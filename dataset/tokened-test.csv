 [ R b6 ]  [ N x e6 ]  [ f x e6 ]  [ B g3 ]  [ Q c6 ] , [ B d3 ]  21
 [ Q f5 ] , [ N x g5 ]  Ghosts again
 [ N x b4 ]  [ N x b4 ] , [ B b3 ]  I'm actually happy with this diagonal I love how it puts pressure on the [ f7 ] pawn.
 [ R e2 ] , [ R c7 ]  27. ... [ R c7 ] it's time to counter-attack !
 [ h5 ] , [ R g7 ]  gxh5; Bxh4+...Any King move; and my position is holding. I was a bit shaky at this moment.
 [ h x g4 ]  [ f x g4 ] , [ K d7 ]  Like me Carl gets his K in action for the same reason as me.
 [ K h8 ]  [ N x e8 ] , [ R f x e8 ]  Here i missed a deadly combination: 22. [ B f6 + ] [ K g8 ] 23.Qh3! and then black is forced to give check on white king to avoid the mate on [ g7 ] or [ h7 ] with 23...[ B x f2 + ] 24.[ K x f2 ] [ N g4 + ] 25.[ Q x g4 ] h5. I've found another solution of my own although.
 [ h5 ]  [ c3 ]  [ f5 ]  [ R d1 ]  [ a5 ] , [ R d2 ]  [ R d3 ] is more active If 31. ...[ e4 ] 32. [ R d4 ] is good for white
 [ a5 ]  [ K e2 ]  [ K e7 ] , [ K d2 ]  With this move white admits his 22. [ K e2 ] was a bit thoughtless. He thinks to bring his king to the queenside but his plans are sooooooo slow. And Fritz agrees not liking this white plan. Here I take a little time to assess and discover that the queenside is perfectly fine. But I wish to get my knight to d4; and to get my h rook into the action while keeping my a rook protected. I'm not ready to try any break anywhere yet until that knight gets to that annoying for white [ d4 ] square. So let's get that done...
 [ N x e5 ]  [ d x e5 ] , [ N d7 ]  16. ..... [ N d7 ] - the attacked becomes the attacker. Paul meets the threat to his [ g5 ] knight and [ e5 ] pawn by retreating it to f3.
 [ B x c4 ]  [ N x c4 ] , [ O-O ]  Knowing my advantage I capitalize on that as noted by Susan Polgar in an e-mail course by castling.
 [ K e2 ]  [ R d c4 ] , [ R h3 ]  Defeating the object of 27. [ K e2 ] which connected the rooks. (Fritz: 28. Rh3?? -5.05; 28. [ B b2 ] -2.45)
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ B b5 ]  The Ruy Lopez opening - an opening that I play against a lot and feel comfortable to do so.
 [ N f6 ] , [ R x e7 ]  ! Best as anything loses a Queen for the Knight or a Rook. By playing this Dan will get two minor pieces in return. However against a player of Joe's strength after 21.[ N f6 ] However Dan will not much longer.
 [ K b8 ] , [ B f8 ]  Blocks the black rook from defending his king and threatens mate in 1 with 24. Re8#.
 [ K h3 ] , [ K e4 ]  ...but now I can switch to the Q-side.
 [ e3 ]  [ c5 ]  [ B x c4 ]  [ c x d4 ] , [ O-O ]  With the idea of 6... dxe3?? 7. Bxf7+. The computer slightly prefers 6. exd4. Then if 6... Bg4? 7. Bxf7+! or if 6... Bf5? 7. Qb3.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ f5 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ N c4 ]  [ f x e4 ]  [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ N b d7 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ N x f6 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ c6 ]  [ f4 ]  [ B b4 ]  [ N b1 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ c3 ]  [ B a5 ] , [ g4 ]  15. [ g4 ] is a bit premature. I'd first developed a knight or put a king on h1.
 [ g4 ]  [ B g6 ] , [ h4 ]  I decide to chase him even further. It is clear tthat he doesn't want to go down a piece early.
 [ Q g7 ]  [ Q x e5 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ Q e4 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ Q x e6 + ]  Second check. He can't seem to stand the Dragon Variation at all.
 [ K f8 ] , [ N x e6 + ]  This begins a combination that will leave Black's King in real trouble.
 [ B c5 ] , [ c3 ]  I am carrying out my plan to take over the centre with d4. A common move in double-king-pawn positions.
 [ N d5 ]  [ B g3 ] , [ h6 ]  black defend the [ g5 ] spot!
 [ B x f4 ]  [ N x f4 ] , [ N e4 ]  This move comes with a discovered attack on the [ f4 ] knight it also places black's knight on a momentarily active square however it's not well supported and it won't stay there long.
 [ h3 ]  [ B h5 ] , [ N b d2 ]  Portisch developed his Knight to [ c3 ] which covers more of the center and leaves space to develop the Bishop.
 [ R f a2 ] , [ b4 ]  I have some doubts about the obvious exchange of pawns and just avoiding it but then this keeps some threats on both wing and I think I have two options to try and achieve a draw with this option a dynamic one in which I defend my b pawn and white could never abandon the defence of the queen's wing pawn nor can he capture the b pawn without risk losing his a pawn on the other hand I have a passive one were I sacrifice a pawn to block white's centre pawns and have him try to work around my position to infiltrate it from behind...
 [ Q x b7 ]  [ h3 ]  [ g3 ] , [ B c8 ]  A try but walks into a pin.
 [ c4 ]  [ a6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ b5 ] , [ c5 ]  I like this move creating dark-square weaknesses and ensuring the queen remains shut out.
 [ K b4 ]  [ N x a1 ] , [ K a3 ]  
 [ d6 ] , [ N f7 ]  I calculated this for a couple of minutes and proudly presented the knight
 [ N f d7 ] , [ B h6 ]  I will try to exchange bishops to exert some pressure over [ d6 ] latter on
 [ d5 ] , [ c4 ]  and now the Queen's Gambit... (I see this a lot when I play in a [ d4 ] [ d5 ] game)
 [ R x h3 ]  [ c5 ]  [ R h h2 ]  [ a5 ]  [ R g d2 + ]  [ K c3 ]  [ N x d5 + ]  [ K c4 ]  [ N e3 + ]  [ K c3 ]  [ d5 ] , [ B b1 ]  This move seems to stave off checkmate for the time being.
 [ h4 ] , [ B f4 ]  What's next g5? That will weaken the [ f5 ] pawn though.
 [ b3 ]  [ b5 ]  [ R f d1 ]  [ f6 ]  [ e x f6 ] , [ R x f6 ]  19. ...................... [ R x f6 ] - now some cramping is relieved as the [ e5 ] pawn disappears from the board.
 [ d5 ]  [ e4 ] , [ d x e4 ]  Maybe I should play [ d4 ] but I like this line
 [ K d1 ]  [ K d6 ] , [ K c2 ]  35. [ K c2 ] - to try and prevent the enemy king from snatching off my a pawn.
 [ Q x c6 + ]  [ K f8 ]  [ Q x a8 + ] , [ K e7 ]  White is out of checks. He resigns as it is mate next move. Or if he sacrifices his Queen mate in 2 moves.
 [ K e2 ] , [ Q f2 # ]  what can I say?
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ a6 ]  [ B a4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B e7 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ b5 ]  [ B b3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ c3 ]  [ O-O ] , [ h3 ]  All well known book the main line.
 [ Q e1 + ] , [ K f8 ]  The exchange of queens is said to give white a good endgame despite his pawn down.
 [ h4 ]  [ f3 ] , [ K h3 ]  This is the point. Now 56. ...[ f2 ] is not dangerous because of 57. [ K g2 ] and after S7. ...[ f1 Q + ] 58. [ K x f1 ] [ B x h4 ] 59. [ B x a5 ] White wins easily.
 [ R a3 ] , [ N d2 ]  If [ R x a4 ] then [ N x c5 ] and the game is closer to a draw.
 [ f x e4 ]  [ d x e4 ] , [ N d4 ]  ! I had realised that blacks best play would be in getting the knihgt to [ d4 ] however I had not realised he could play it straight away. Now White cannot take the knight because after cx[ d4 ] white will lose the knight on account of the pin to the queen.
 [ B f5 ] , [ a4 ]  ! the winning move...
 [ N f6 ] , [ N c3 ]  ...and that's bring out my own knight to defend my pawn moving with the Scandinavian variation. I know what to expect from here...
 [ N c3 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ f4 ]  A standard Sicilian move from White - an early kingside pawn advancement is in order here!
 [ e4 ] , [ N c3 ]  18. [ N c3 ] - finally the decks are cleared but my situation is not ideal. For a starters I do not like the fact that Glenda is on a discovery line (the [ a4 ] to [ e8 ] diagonal). I also mislike the fact that black has the bishop pair (this was a telling factor in Easy 19 - aka The Master Mater's queen sac MTs) to rake across the board and inflict a lot of potential damage. His knight on [ g4 ] looks ominously pesky. There is a rook blasting down the h column and he could double up on it in a few more moves if I do not watch out. Finally his [ d5 ] pawn is a passer in a very strong looking pawn chain. Yup at this point black is better. Do you the Inquest Jury agree?
 [ B x d6 ] , [ B x d6 ]  I expected [ N b6 ] since black cannot keep the pawn in d4.
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ g6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ e4 ]  [ d6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B e2 ]  [ e5 ]  [ O-O ]  [ c6 ]  [ d5 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ N b d7 ]  [ d x c6 ]  [ b x c6 ]  [ Q x d6 ]  [ Q c8 ]  [ R a d1 ]  [ R d8 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ Q c1 ]  [ N b6 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N b d7 ]  [ R d2 ]  [ Q a5 ]  [ R f d1 ]  [ R d e8 ] , [ N d5 ]  First knight sacrifice...
 [ N c6 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ N g4 ] , [ N x c6 ]  This seems inconsistent with his sixth move. [ Q d2 ] may be a more logical continuation.
 [ K h8 ] , [ N x f3 ]  Attacking the Queen
 [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ N f x d5 ] , [ N x d5 ]  forced after b2-3 leaving the knight unguarded
 [ Q x d2 ] , [ Q b5 + ]  and now the run to draw
 [ K g7 ]  [ Q d7 + ]  [ K f8 ]  [ Q f5 + ]  [ K g7 ]  [ Q e5 + ]  [ K g8 ]  [ Q e6 + ]  [ K g7 ]  [ Q e7 + ]  [ K g8 ]  [ Q d8 + ]  [ K g7 ]  [ Q d4 + ]  [ K h7 ]  [ a4 ]  [ R g8 ]  [ a5 ]  [ R g6 ]  [ Q a7 + ]  [ K h6 ]  [ Q e3 + ]  [ K h7 ]  [ Q e7 + ]  [ K g8 ]  [ Q d7 ]  [ K h8 ]  [ Q f7 ]  [ R a6 ]  [ Q c4 ]  [ R a7 ]  [ Q d5 ]  [ R b b7 ]  [ c4 ]  [ R b g7 ]  [ c5 ]  [ R a f7 ]  [ a6 ]  [ R f3 + ]  [ K g2 ]  [ R f f7 ]  [ Q a8 + ]  [ K h7 ]  [ c6 ]  [ R f a7 ]  [ Q e8 ]  [ g3 ]  [ Q h5 + ]  [ K g8 ]  [ Q f5 ]  [ R a e7 ]  [ Q d5 + ]  [ K h7 ]  [ Q h5 + ]  [ K g8 ]  [ Q f3 ]  [ K h7 ]  [ Q d3 + ]  [ K h6 ]  [ Q d2 + ]  [ K h5 ]  [ Q d5 + ]  [ K g4 ]  [ Q f3 + ]  [ K h4 ]  [ Q f4 + ]  [ K h5 ]  [ Q d4 ]  [ R e2 + ]  [ K f3 ]  [ R e e7 ]  [ Q g1 ]  [ R e f7 + ]  [ K e2 ]  [ K g4 ]  [ K d3 ]  [ K f5 ]  [ Q c5 + ]  [ K e6 ]  [ Q e3 + ]  [ K d5 ]  [ Q d4 + ]  [ K x c6 ]  [ K c4 ]  [ g2 ]  [ Q c5 + ]  [ K d7 ]  [ a7 ]  [ g1 = Q ]  [ Q x g1 ]  [ R x g1 ]  [ a8 = Q ]  [ R f4 + ]  [ K d3 ]  [ R d1 + ]  [ K c3 ]  [ K e7 ]  [ Q a7 + ]  [ K f6 ]  [ Q a6 + ]  [ K f5 ]  [ Q b5 + ]  [ K g6 ]  [ Q b8 ]  [ R d f1 ]  [ Q b6 + ]  [ R f4 f6 ]  [ Q d4 ]  [ R f1 f3 + ]  [ K d2 ]  [ R f3 f2 + ]  [ K e1 ]  [ R f2 f4 ]  [ Q d5 ]  [ R f6 f5 ]  [ Q a8 ]  [ R f4 f2 ]  [ Q e8 + ]  [ K g5 ]  [ Q e3 + ]  [ R f2 f4 ]  [ Q e2 ]  [ K f6 ]  [ Q d3 ]  [ K e5 ]  [ Q b5 + ]  [ K d4 ]  [ Q b6 + ]  [ K c4 ]  [ K d2 ] , [ R d4 + ]  At last a draw is agreed on by both sides to make a long story short. The moral of this story and theory is that a Queen against both Rooks is a book draw. Overall I'd like to thank Joe for showing this game. Without the lecture I would not have known about it so this annotation would not have been possible.
 [ R d h1 ] , [ c5 ]  Here he comes.
 [ N c3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ e4 ]  Normally this move seems a little weak as the pawn will (and does in this game) grow weak on e4. However Suba is prepared to give up the pawn.
 [ f x e4 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ B d7 ] , [ a5 ]  ?stopping [ b5 ] but overextending my pawn. It is now very weak
 [ N x c3 ]  [ B x c3 ]  [ Q b6 ]  [ Q c2 ]  [ c5 ]  [ d x c5 ]  [ B x c5 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ B d4 ]  [ Q b8 ] , [ B f3 ]  my opponent is in too much of a hurry and loses the exchange
 [ B e5 ]  [ N x d3 + ]  [ Q x d3 ]  [ f6 ]  [ B g3 ]  [ Q x e3 + ]  [ Q x e3 ]  [ R x e3 + ]  [ K d2 ] , [ R b3 ]  Rather than [ R a e8 ] Rhe1.
 [ e3 ] , [ d5 ]  Black is thinking of trying to dominate the center with [ N f6 ] defending diagonal pawns. The weakness of the plan is that knight would be subject to attack with g5.
 [ R d g8 ] , [ g3 ]  an important moment. black is about to force an exchange here. lets look at the position here. both black rooks are developed and attack the kingside. the white colored bishop on [ c6 ] is well placed and can create threats the queen is fine on [ d7 ] and so are the knight and bishop. on the other hand blacks queen is threatened the knights arent doing all that much and the rook on [ a1 ] isnt developed yet.
 [ R d8 ] , [ R d3 ]  A blunder by white. Interesting was [ h4 ] Rd2...
 [ R x h3 ]  [ R e5 + ]  [ K d6 ]  [ R g5 ]  [ h4 ]  [ R g6 + ]  [ K e7 ]  [ e5 ]  [ R g3 ]  [ R h6 ]  [ h3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ R g4 + ]  [ K e5 ]  [ R g3 ]  [ R h7 + ]  [ K e8 ]  [ K f6 ]  [ R f3 + ]  [ K e5 ] , [ R x c3 ]  49. Rxc3????????? <----- It deserves more question marks than that. This was being too greedy.
 [ N f6 ] , [ e5 ]  Black walked straight into that fork.
 [ B g5 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ B x f6 ] , [ B x f6 ]  White trades his DSB for a knight and GKA says black is up by 2/3 of a point.
 [ h4 ]  [ g6 ] , [ f3 ]  Like Chinese water torture.
 [ R g1 ] , [ B d6 ]  look at those bishops... nice.
 [ b4 ]  [ B b6 ]  [ a4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ a5 ] , [ c x b4 ]  This is a miscalculation on my part
 [ c6 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ d4 ] , [ e5 ]  I just did a lesson on different types of pawn centers. In a dynamic center it has two pawns for each side in the center in a form that will eventually change and become one of the other four types of centers.
 [ B x f4 ]  [ N x c6 ]  [ K x c6 ]  [ B x a5 ] , [ K c5 ]  Loses. After 39... [ B d6 ] 40. [ B d8 ] [ B e5 ] (Or 40... f5) 41. [ B e7 ] [ B c3 ] the position is not as clear.
 [ N c3 ] , [ N d4 ]  Don't want to exchange as I would be forced to then move my knight on the c file.
 [ N d4 ] , [ K d1 ]  Misses the threat to the bishop. [ B d3 ] was necessary.
 [ Q h5 ]  [ e x d6 ]  [ c x d6 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ B x b5 ] , [ N x b5 ]  White has a double threat here. The threat of [ N c7 ] winning the rook and [ Q x a5 ] winning a knight.
 [ O-O ]  [ e3 ]  [ h6 ]  [ B h4 ] , [ b6 ]  This is the Tartakower variation. Spassky claimed that he never lost with this variation.
 [ Q d7 ] , [ N c3 ]  I go to attack his control of d5.
 [ d4 ] , [ d5 ]  A Double Queen Pawn opening
 [ N b4 ] , [ c6 ]  To avoid Nd5. Tension is quickly increasing again!
 [ K f3 ] , [ d5 ]  Development first!
 [ b x c5 ] , [ Q x c5 ]  Now it's 2 against 1 attacking the pawn at c3. Notice how black has converted his tempo advantage into an attack and white despite going first is on the defensive.
 [ B d3 ] , [ B b7 ]  Again [ e4 ] is threatened with [ b4 ] removing away the Nc3.
 [ h6 ] , [ B e7 ]  I continue the offensive
 [ B h3 ]  [ B x h3 ]  [ Q x h3 ]  [ Q g3 ] , [ Q h4 ]  30 QxQ NxQ 31 K-[ B2 ] R-[ K1 ] 32 P-[ K5 ] would now give White the superior endgame.
 [ R h3 + ]  [ K g4 ]  [ R g3 + ]  [ K h5 ]  [ N f5 ] , [ R g6 ]  Leontxo says that now [ R h3 + ] [ K g4 ] [ K g2 ] wins threatening Kd1-[ f2 # ] and [ R x h7 ]  [ K x g6 ]  [ R x g4 + ] , [ K f7 ]  I cannot see why [ K h5 ] is not preferable.
 [ e x d5 ] , [ e4 ]  archduke_piccolo: Move 4... I suggest (and vote for) 4.[ d3 ] here forcing the exchange of Black's advanced pawn. This is the 'standard' move in this line. One could play 4.[ N c3 ] developing a piece and I won't object if the vote goes that way. But the QP advance also goes to development as after the pawn exchange all White's minor pieces will be free to move. It is extremely unlikely that Black will play 4...[ Q x d5 ] as THEN 5.[ N c3 ] will attack the Queen and pick up the e-pawn with the knight. In that case White will have a lead in development and much the greater hold on the centre.
 [ K f5 ]  [ K f7 ]  [ e5 ]  [ f x e5 ] , [ f x e5 ]  36. [ f x e5 ] - white creates a passer.
 [ B e5 ] , [ N e4 + ]  ...and that king d2-[ d3 ] the last one in order to keep [ [ c3 ] ] would have lead to a loss of quality through [ f2 ] . And by losing [ [ c3 ] ] then probably [ c2 ] there was no more hope. After this the game lost interest since it was an obviously inferior position with no compensation.
 [ B x e7 ] , [ O-O-O ]  The pressure on Black's centre - and since he's entangled in it the Black King - has become enormous. Black's answer is a counterattack.
 [ N f6 ]  [ B f3 ]  [ B b7 ] , [ N e2 ]  21. [ N e2 ] - looking to put pressure on the [ c6 ] pawn.
 [ K e1 ] , [ B g3 + ]  Forces king away from defense of d1.
 [ Q c3 ]  [ K h2 ]  [ Q d4 ] , [ Q f3 ]  Carlsen is improving his position ever so slowly. There is not much black can do about it.
 [ K c4 ] , [ K d2 ]  ...and defend my rook...
 [ d4 ]  [ N a4 ]  [ Q f7 ]  [ R f1 ] , [ Q d5 ]  30. .............. Qd5?? - threatening Old Matey on [ g2 ] but I can take the rook on [ f8 ] with check!
 [ N c3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ B g7 ] , [ h3 ]  I don't understand this move perhaps its a waiting move
 [ B a8 ] , [ K e7 ]  With the new prison guard in position the knight is free to deliver checkmate on [ f6 ] which can be reached via [ e4 ] or e8.
 [ N x e6 ]  [ N x e2 + ]  [ K f1 ]  [ R d e8 ]  [ N x g7 ]  [ R x e5 ] , [ R a d1 ]  Se T[ e1 ] Cf4. Se T[ e3 ] anche.
 [ c5 ]  [ f4 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ g6 ]  Black has good intentions fortifying his [ g7 ] diagonal.
 [ c5 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ g6 ]  Although this is a move here it is not as common as the moves 2...[ d6 ] 2...[ N c6 ] 2...e6. [ N c6 ] is the overall favorite and all 3 lines mentioned may transpose to one another.
 [ b5 ]  [ N b6 ]  [ Q x b6 ] , [ B g5 ]  This development doesn't betray White's new goals should he have any. I wonder what he plans to do? He doesn't seem to have many avenues for attack.
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ d4 ] , [ e6 ]  more popular is [ c x d4 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ f6 ]  is the idea is to prevent the Knight from enterin [ e5 ] or g5? if the answer is yes then the move is yseless because the has nothing to do there at the moment. better was cxd4.
 [ Q x g6 ] , [ N d7 ]  Another match was on its way.
 [ e x f4 ] , [ Q c2 ]  Must protect my knight. He can't easily defend the pawn on [ f4 ] I think can pick it up.
 [ R f8 ]  [ Q g3 ]  [ Q h5 + ]  [ K d2 ]  [ Q h6 + ]  [ K c2 ]  [ Q h7 + ] , [ K c1 ]  Had I not been very short of time I would have noticed 31. Be4.
 [ Q d8 + ]  [ K h7 ]  [ g4 ]  [ Q g3 ]  [ h4 ] , [ Q x h4 + ]  ??? a moment of carelessness loses the game. I tried to retract my move momentarily but of course my opponent insisted on touch and move. I had no excuses. I had plenty of time left (about half an hour) whereas White had less than 10 minutes.
 [ d x e5 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ d x e5 ] , [ B x f7 + ]  This was the move that won that pawn but...
 [ b x a5 ]  [ N x a5 + ]  [ K b2 ] , [ R x d3 ]  Rxd3!!? A carefully considered sacrifice. Black gets a piece and pawn for the rook simplifies to an advantageous ending and gains pawn majorities on both sides of the board.
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ c4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ c x d5 ] , [ Q x d5 ]  Huh.... I don't think this is great as I can chase it.
 [ B g5 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ h3 ]  [ B x f3 ]  [ B x f3 ] , [ Q a5 ]  getting my queen out. that's something NOT to do in early game.
 [ N d7 ] , [ N f6 + ]  That dream had been foiled but other attacking options sprang to mind.
 [ R g3 ]  [ c6 ]  [ f4 ]  [ R a d8 ]  [ d5 ] , [ R h e8 ]  43. ............. Rhe8?? - loses another pawn. I overlook the fact that the a pawn will fall after [ d x c6 ] giving white another passer. As soon as I realised this I threw in the sponge before my opponent replied on the grounds of ruinous loss of material. Even taking into account my playing history with the Dentist and the 300 point difference in our ratings I felt that there was nothing left to play for. This was the second time in the space of a week that I lost to U1400 oppo. I dropped 17 points against cbarracuda. Luckily this game was unrated so my rating was not affected. At the time of the resignation my rating was 1679 and my opponent's was 1348. A sorry tale. Do you think I under-estimated my opponent here or do you feel I simply played passively and paid in full? You the jury decide.
 [ N f3 ]  [ N x f3 + ]  [ B x f3 ] , [ N d4 ]  The black square weakness that I mentioned earlier now manifests itself.
 [ B e6 ]  [ Q e2 ] , [ f6 ]  19. [ f6 ] (???????) I don't know why my opponent did this but this was the point where mate was imminent. I seized this opportunity
 [ a6 ] , [ b3 ]  This move is already off the database.
 [ K e2 ] , [ B g4 ]  13. ...... [ B g4 ] - ....... and here it is. Fou Leblanc pins the Wicked Witch of the West to her other half and next move it is Ding Dong the Wicked Witch is dead!
 [ Q d2 ]  [ a6 ]  [ N d6 ]  [ b5 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ f6 ] , [ B x b5 ]  Taking the bishop will cost him his rook.
 [ K d8 ] , [ O-O-O ]  White's position is dangerous.
 [ N g8 + ]  [ K f8 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ b x a4 ]  Now without the rather fortunate positioning I'd be in trouble. If I'd had to take another tempo I think I've had had it from this position.
 [ N e7 ] , [ B c4 ]  Black's knight retreats and white develops his bishop creating veiled threats to [ f7 ] and [ g8 ] and defending the white knight in the process. White now has three pieces aggressively developed to black's one piece defensively developed and white has the hanging black pawn on [ e4 ] free for the taking at any time. I am not familiar enough with the Latvian Counter-Gambit to know where black has gone wrong but I don't think this was how the first 11 moves are supposed to go for black.
 [ N f3 ] , [ N f6 ]  Preparing to castle.
 [ N c3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B g5 ] , [ B e7 ]  Tartakower Variation releasing the pin on Black's knight. Otherwise all main line QGD.
 [ B x c3 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ b4 ]  [ b6 ] , [ N e5 ]  Hitting the bishop and a nice outpost for the knight.
 [ Q f6 + ]  [ K g8 ]  [ Q x g6 + ]  [ K f8 ]  [ Q x h6 + ] , [ K g8 ]  Black is loosing but this make it faster - "best" move would have been 31.- [ K e8 ] but he have to face 32.[ B x g6 + ] and he loose his queen.
 [ B x d6 ] , [ N x d6 + ]  Second fork of Q and K Black resigns.
 [ R g h8 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ a6 ] , [ R d e1 ]  Seize the open file with a threat.
 [ B x c4 ] , [ N b6 ]  Challenging the lsb and giving some breathing space for my cramped king's position..
 [ K g8 ] , [ R g7 + ]  Again bad move.
 [ B c8 ]  [ h5 ] , [ h6 ]  Black advanced the pawn to block the h-pawn. This was a major error for black according to pc analysis. Anyone want to elucidate why? Black had a reasonable chance by moving [ B b7 ] which would have stopped me moving the knight away and advancing a6. At best the e and f pawns would have been lost. Instead now I can advance to [ f5 ] which lets me capture that [ h6 ] pawn or lets me exchange knight for bishop which will lead to me queening - the a-pawn wouldn't outrun the king but would put the king on the [ a8 ] square and I'd eventually queen the h pawn.
 [ N e2 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N g3 ]  [ B g6 ]  [ O-O ] , [ B d6 ]  Had my opponent known that I've played this sort of formation with black from 15 to 18 years old he wouldn't have played it. Sometimes we know kind of authomatically where pieces go. ;-) Black shall play a consistent game 'til the end ready to take advantage of any of white's positional slips. The position seems quite calm but I think it's quite dangerous and poisonous for white had he known he was playing against a specialist in this sort of position. Practical experience proves.
 [ Q e7 ]  [ Q x b2 ]  [ Q x c7 ] , [ c3 ]  This pawn isn't fast enough. White's queen is positioned too well.
 [ d5 ]  [ g4 ] , [ N h4 ]  The only move the knight on [ f5 ] will threaten the queen and the pinned bishop.
 [ O-O ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N x f6 + ] , [ Q x f6 ]  The first tactical skirmish goes nowhere.
 [ g5 ]  [ B x g5 ]  [ f x g5 ] , [ R x e5 ]  I'm only down a pawn. This was more of a positional sacrifice.
 [ Q d1 ] , [ R x d1 # ]  
 [ O-O ] , [ Q x b5 ]  mistake: [ c4 ] was best
 [ N x e4 ] , [ d x e4 ]  Knight exchange. I attack the rook as well.
 [ N c3 ]  [ N x c3 ]  [ b x c3 + ] , [ K x c3 ]  Who is really better? Both sides have the bishop pair and can deliver mate if the other side is not careful. White can force the LS bishop exchange after which he will have an isolated c pawn to match black's isolated a pawn.
 [ d x e5 ] , [ B x e5 ]  Here is the passed d-pawn.
 [ N x e5 ] , [ c3 ]  [ c3 ] scores well on the opening databases
 [ g5 ]  [ B g3 ]  [ N x e4 ] , [ Q f3 ]  Trying to recompensate for lost material I played this. I'm not trying to mate but that's the threat. Believe it or not Jack told me that this was a blunder and asked me what happened if he plays 17...[ N d2 ] forking my LSB+Q. I told him that I would deliver mate with 18.[ Q x f2 # ] In fact that's what was initially played but since this is a training game unlike with an OTB tourney but similar to what we see (before hitting submit) there are take backs. Mr. Stockel told me why he made that mistake and it is due to his glacoma. He confused my LSB for a N. In other words he thought that a N was on [ b3 ] as opposed to my Bishop. Having corrected the mistake he accurately said that 17...[ N [ f6 ] ] is the only option. After moving there he said "My piece is protected" and I nodded. In fact I realize that there's more to this then meets the eye. For once he retreats to [ f6 ] my Q will be attacked which will force to get it out of harms way.
 [ Q b2 + ]  [ K g6 ]  [ Q b3 ] , [ f4 ]  a key move in this ending as will be seen
 [ N x f6 ]  [ Q b5 + ]  [ N d7 ]  [ Q x b7 ]  [ K e7 ] , [ Q x c7 ]  +7!!!!
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ e5 ]  [ e6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ N e7 ]  [ d5 ]  [ O-O ]  [ d6 ] , [ N f5 ]  Black has followed the Hungarian variation in this Sicilian: White has tried to turn this in something else...
 [ a4 ]  [ h5 ]  [ K d4 ]  [ b5 ]  [ a x b5 ]  [ a x b5 ]  [ K c3 ]  [ K c5 ]  [ K b3 ]  [ b4 ]  [ K b2 ]  [ K c4 ]  [ K c2 ]  [ b3 + ]  [ K b2 ]  [ K b4 ]  [ K b1 ]  [ K c3 ]  [ K c1 ]  [ b2 + ]  [ K b1 ] , [ K d3 ]  The loyal Queenside pawns complete their mission by sacrificing for the greater good.
 [ e4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ a6 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B g7 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ N e7 ]  [ c4 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N b c6 ]  [ N x c6 ] , [ N x c6 ]  This is probably a mistake. I think Black might end up with a better position with either [ d x c6 ] or bxc6.
 [ Q b1 ]  [ N x e2 + ]  [ K h1 ] , [ Q f6 ]  and White had had enough.
 [ R e1 ]  [ b4 ] , [ N c e2 ]  [ N e2 ] is reducing White's play.
 [ R c8 ] , [ Q d3 ]  This threatens [ c4 ] and Qf4.
 [ B c4 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ d3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ a3 ] , [ d5 ]  Challenging the center immediately.
 [ N h4 ]  [ N f5 ] , [ Q f3 ]  Ponomnariov defends his kingside by initiating a trade of knights.
 [ K x d6 ]  [ f4 ]  [ B g4 + ]  [ K e1 ]  [ B e7 ] , [ f x e5 + ]  ...which is restored...
 [ d3 ]  [ h4 ]  [ R f1 ]  [ h3 ] , [ g3 ]  There goes attempt no.#1.
 [ b3 ] , [ N f5 ]  Again not helping much to the cause of black since it does have no control whatsoever of any strong square. Now considering its activity on [ h6 ] black may be wanting to activate this N but at the cost of several movements.
 [ h4 ]  [ h6 ]  [ N f7 ] , [ B x e6 ]  Black' s problem is solved.
 [ e x f5 + ]  [ N g e7 ]  [ B d2 ]  [ Q x f5 ] , [ O-O-O ]  White gets his King out of the dangerously open center though his KB and KR are still badly undeveloped.
 [ O-O ] , [ N b6 ]  continuing the development and threatening [ f5 ] which means gaining another tempo
 [ R b7 ]  [ B g7 ] , [ R b8 + ]  I throw in some checks before I determine what plan of attack I want to use.
 [ B g2 ] , [ R e8 ]  well if you want to take my knight you will have to put your self in check i didnt want white to take my knight
 [ B f5 ]  [ N b3 ]  [ Q c7 ] , [ B g5 ]  developing my last minor piece to a good square controlling [ d8 ] the natural square from which to defend d5.
 [ e4 ] , [ N c6 ]  unexpected opening
 [ f4 ] , [ a6 ]  Black develops a pawn and puts pressure on the white queen.
 [ B d6 ] , [ g4 ]  7.g4!?? I'll give the reader a moment to let this move sink in... Hundreds of years ago players used to play things like king's gambit sacrificing the f pawn modern GMs have moved on to sacrificing the g pawn. The idea behind this frightening pawn push is either to gain a half open g file (even the h file after 7... [ N x g4 ] 8.[ R g1 ] Nxh2) or to push the pawn to [ g5 ] where it drives away black's best piece the knight on f6.
 [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ g6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ e4 ]  [ d6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ O-O ] , [ B e2 ]  The opening the King`s Indian Defence usually leads to sharp games. While White plays on the queenside Black tries to attack the king`s flank after playing f5. I used to play this as Black for some time but was not really glad with the outcome. Perhaps I should try it again I am still looking for a good defence against d4...
 [ d4 ] , [ f5 ]  Morphy disliking the positional QP game counters with a Dutch defense.
 [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ e4 ]  [ d6 ] , [ d4 ]  Now we are transposing to a King's Indian Defence
 [ Q h3 ]  [ R d5 d2 ] , [ f5 ]  further attempting to gain some counter play through my pawn majority on the KS
 [ h5 ] , [ N x f6 ]  But this was played instead.
 [ B a2 ] , [ R c7 c2 ]  25. .............. [ R c2 ] - here comes a bone in the throat - my rook is now attacking the [ f2 ] pawn and the [ b2 ] pawn for that matter.
 [ c5 ]  [ d x c5 ]  [ B x c5 ] , [ b4 ]  The best push was 10. e4! and then maybe 10. ... [ Q c7 ] to avoid immediate destruction of the center. This was the right time to punish the Black for his delay in castling.
 [ N x e5 ]  [ d x e5 ] , [ Q b3 ]  You can only put your Queen on [ b3 ] if Black can not put a Knight on [ a5 ] or d4. This is another reason [ N x e5 ] was not a good plan. My coach Mr. Marble says that the most important square to keep track of is [ f7 ] for Black and [ f2 ] for White at the beginning of a game and the Evans Gambit always attacks f7.
 [ B x c6 ]  [ K d8 ] , [ R b8 + ]  White can do better with 22. [ d5 ] threatening to open of the center files.
 [ N x f2 ]  [ Q e2 + ]  [ Q e7 ] , [ N d5 ]  Threatens mate to Qxe7.
 [ B x d6 ] , [ c x d6 ]  ?! Alternative variation: best is 6... [ Q x d6 ] 7. [ e3 ] O-O 8. [ c5 ] [ Q e7 ] 9. [ b4 ] [ b6 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ] , [ e x d5 ]  Major long term score here for white. Those doubled D-pawns will be hard to defend.
 [ B x d5 ]  [ c6 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ K c7 ]  [ R f2 ]  [ R h5 ] , [ N f7 ]  Finally safe!
 [ B b8 ] , [ b4 ]  Adding to my pawn chain and mobilizing the Q side.
 [ Q d5 ] , [ Q c2 ]  Finally letting the LSB out--necessary if White ever wants to castle since his queenside would look pretty weak after trying to shore up [ a2 ] against the Black LSB.
 [ K x f2 ] , [ Q h4 + ]  Now I am back in check so I only have several options. In this position [ g3 ] is best but it is better to move my King backward then forward. However I chose to move it forward which exacerbates the King exposure.
 [ R c e1 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ R e3 ] , [ d5 ]  More central advancing. Note that now black has a passed pawn on the d-file and it supports the e-pawn so collectively black has a 5-3 pawn advantage on the kingside. White of course has two passed pawns and a 2-0 pawn advantage on the queenside but the center/kingside seems more active and more likely to produce results.
 [ K f6 ] , [ N x f5 ]  ...so I win the rook...
 [ c5 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ c3 ]  [ d x c3 ]  [ N x c3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ d6 ]  There are quite a few good ways to play against this gambit. Plans with [ e6 ] are also feasible but this suits my style better.
 [ a4 ]  [ K g3 ]  [ a3 ]  [ K g4 ]  [ R b2 ]  [ R c1 ]  [ a2 ]  [ R a1 ]  [ K b6 ]  [ f5 ]  [ K x c6 ]  [ K g5 ]  [ K b5 ]  [ f6 ]  [ K b4 ]  [ f7 ]  [ R f2 ] , [ K g6 ]  [ R x a2 ] was the move when the game ends in a rook endgame with an extra pawn to black. This simply loses.
 [ Q x g7 + ]  [ K x g7 ]  [ B x c8 ]  [ B x c8 ] , [ B b2 ]  And if I can I will trade pieces until I reach a favorable end-game.
 [ B x e5 ] , [ d x e5 ]  Well he's 4 ahead perhaps he'll get greedy...
 [ N c3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B g5 ] , [ Q e8 ]  would have been better to dev the other N 1st [ N c6 ]  [ B x f6 ] , [ N d7 ]  you have to recapture with [ g x f6 ] otherwise you give away a N
 [ Q x d4 + ] , [ K x a5 ]  Alternative variation: [ Some of the participants including Anand asserted that the move] 26... [ Q c5 ] [ saved the game. However after] 27. [ Q x f6 + ] [ Q d6 ] 28. [ B e6 ] [White closed the rank but left the opportunity to vary threats and to force Black into a desperate position. For example] [ B x d5 ] (28... [ R h e8 ] 29. [ [ b4 ] ] $1 $18) 29. [ [ b4 ] ] $1 [ B a8 ] 30. [ Q x f7 ] [ Q d1 + ] 31. [ K b2 ] [ Q x f3 ] 32. [ B f5 ] [would be the simplest way as all the lines are closed and mate threats become inevitable.]
 [ f x g5 ] , [ R h8 ]  This is where black's magic begins. [ R h8 ] has allowed for the rook to later fire down white's kingside and also potentially to attack the white queen
 [ e6 ] , [ c3 ]  A very popular move among top flight players as well as us lowly folk....
 [ R g8 + ] , [ K h7 ]  [?] Very risky in my view and [ K h6 ] or ...[ K h5 ] ought to have been preferred.
 [ R x e8 + ]  [ R x e8 ]  [ d7 + ] , [ K x d7 ]  Ok so finally white won the black diagonal contest. Now let's see how to neutralize it.
 [ B g7 ]  [ e4 ] , [ O-O ]  All most logical now the idea for black would be to attack on his queen´s (obviously with that extra pawn and the whole column open) while wrestling on his king´s
 [ R c g1 ] , [ Q x d5 ]  I think you had to play 30...[ B b7 ] and hope to survive the attack.
 [ h x g4 ]  [ h x g4 ] , [ K b3 ]  That's because as noted black can Q. This is where I start thinking about resigning but will wait until he plays ...a2.
 [ B b7 ]  [ e5 ]  [ Q e7 ]  [ a3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ O-O-O ]  [ N c3 ]  [ f6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N h6 ]  [ h3 ]  [ N f5 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ d6 ] , [ Q d2 ]  paen trade opens the door to bishop attack
 [ B e2 ] , [ B e6 ]  It was going to happen eventually.
 [ B d6 ]  [ B b2 ]  [ B d7 ] , [ N g f3 ]  White needs to open up the queenside unblock his fianchettoed bishop and gain more space with [ c4 ] soon.
 [ a3 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ N h4 ] , [ B d7 ]  Black's just clearing out the back rank so that the rooks can move freely and back up pawns as needed.
 [ R c3 ]  [ R x b2 ] , [ c5 ]  The only way I could create counterplay.
 [ B f5 ] , [ K d4 ]  Chasing after the bishop by using the safe dark squares. I have hopes that the black king will be enticed towards [ f4 ] via [ h5 ] where I will offer a pawn sacrifice with hopes to gain a win.
 [ g4 ]  [ f x g4 ]  [ B e4 + ]  [ K f7 ]  [ B x h7 ]  [ N b5 ]  [ B e5 ]  [ R x d3 ]  [ B x d3 ]  [ K e6 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ R c e1 + ]  [ K d5 ]  [ R e5 + ]  [ K c6 ]  [ B x g7 ]  [ N b5 ]  [ R f6 + ]  [ K d7 ]  [ B f5 + ]  [ K d8 ]  [ R f7 ]  [ N c7 ] , [ B f6 # ]  It's finished. The king is dead and the faithfull Perceval still at his side could do nothing but cry.
 [ Q x d6 ]  [ N x d6 ] , [ R b6 ]  Pinning the knight against the h6-square. How can White save it? How will it get back in time to sacrifice itself at g3?
 [ c3 ]  [ b x c3 ]  [ b x c3 ]  [ R d6 + ]  [ K g5 ]  [ R d5 + ]  [ K x g4 ]  [ R d4 + ]  [ K f5 ]  [ R c4 ]  [ R b2 + ]  [ K e3 ]  [ c2 ]  [ K d2 ]  [ R a2 ]  [ R x c2 ] , [ R x a4 ]  Better was for black to play RxR. He would have been in good position to win the game with two pawns up
 [ O-O ]  [ N g4 ]  [ h3 ] , [ h5 ]  5...h5! Fishing Hook Variation.
 [ R x h6 ]  [ b4 ]  [ g6 ]  [ Q f3 ]  [ h4 ]  [ R a b1 ]  [ R h5 ] , [ b5 ]  Now I'm getting somewhere.
 [ N f3 ]  [ B g7 ] , [ c3 ]  Now white gives black's bishop a pawn chain to bite on touche! This does take away the natural and usually best square for the white queen's knight c3.
 [ a5 ]  [ e4 ]  [ Q b7 ]  [ Q d3 ]  [ R f d8 ]  [ Q e2 ] , [ e5 ]  here I think I made a mistake but am not sure...
 [ R e2 ]  [ f5 ]  [ R f1 ]  [ R f8 ]  [ R f4 ]  [ Q h3 ]  [ c4 ]  [ R f g8 ]  [ R f3 ]  [ Q h4 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ c4 ] , [ Q e4 ]  I think I can win the endgame.
 [ e4 ] , [ c5 ]  This game features a nice attack with my favorite variation of the Sicilian Najdorf. I never have any problems playing Sicilian as Black and I've upset a lot of high rated players with Sicilian. I quit playing [ [ e4 ] ] a long time ago when I couldn't find any good openings against Sicilian. This is only my theory and you can disagree but Sicilian is just good for Black if Black plays completely accurately. Excuse my bold statement about this position being winning for Black but I am very serious about my Sicilian. Although the opening only matters if both sides play 100% accurately throughout the game which no players will so you can play whatever opening you want if you're not a grandmaster but if you're looking for a sharp opening against [ [ e4 ] ] that you'll never want to quit playing then I advise you to go over this game and learn to play Sicilian the way I do I explain a lot of my sicilian repertoire throughout this annotation.
 [ a5 ] , [ N b5 ]  A pointless move. Better was probably Nb3.
 [ R d1 ] , [ N x f3 + ]  White can noly protect the check with the queen but then gets taken with mate. It just shows how important it is to keep your kingside intact.
 [ B e6 ] , [ B x e6 ]  I have to trade this piece I had no place to put my bishop. If 9.[ B b5 ] [ a7 ] 10.[ B x c6 ] where black would follow with with [ b x c6 ] opening the b file for an attack on my queen side which would be bad for a O-O-O. I think I annotated all of those moves right.
 [ R x d1 ] , [ R x d1 ]  A move I accept given I am up a pawn and he has a doubled pawn. But now I think about my next move. Bd6? evens the board out as white will win his pawn back and put his rook in great position to gain more space.
 [ c4 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ a5 ]  I was surprised that he wanted the queen side as well (?)
 [ B g6 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N e8 ] , [ e6 ]  I thought that exchanging on [ d6 ] was better for Black as he could place his knight on a better square (d6). If Black had captured on [ e6 ] with fx[ e6 ] then his kingside is weakened which may allow for tatics later in the game
 [ K g8 ]  [ N g5 ] , [ B x g5 ]  Bad trade on his part.
 [ Q x b5 ] , [ N x d6 ]  The computer prefers 34. [ R x d6 ] [ N x d6 ] 35. [ Q x d6 ] [ N f8 ] 36. [ Q x e5 ] [ Q d7 ] 37. d6. But I could only think about a direct assault on the black king now. Funny how a fixation like that can change the course of a game so much.
 [ N c3 ]  [ B x c3 ] , [ d x c3 ]  I was about to resign this but good thing I didn't
 [ R g4 x g7 + ]  [ B x g7 ]  [ Q g2 ]  [ N f5 ]  [ h6 ]  [ R f6 ]  [ h x g7 ]  [ N h4 ] , [ Q g5 ]  I'm trying once more to bait him. This time a royal fork is the bait.
 [ N f3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B b4 ] , [ Q c2 ]  While I didn't know it at the time this is all part of the main line.
 [ O-O ]  [ b6 ] , [ N f3 ]  Very mysterious and surprising. I thought the knight would appear at [ b3 ] at some time... Here the threat 15.[ N x e5 ] is easily met.
 [ N f5 ] , [ h5 ]  Queen to [ g6 ] or to [ [ g7 ] ] G6- check k to [ d7 ] q to [ [ g7 ] ] check either knight to [ e7 ] or king to c8. G7- allows for Q to press [ h8 ] then [ h7 ]  [ Q x g7 ]  [ B x f2 + ]  [ K x f2 ]  [ R d7 ]  [ Q x h8 ]  [ K d8 ] , [ Q x g8 # ]  
 [ f x e2 ] , [ N x e2 ]  I myself favour this option by white more.
 [ Q e1 ] , [ B b4 ]  33. ….. [ B b4 ] - there is no saving the pawn on [ [ e7 ] ] so Fou Lenoir gets out of the line of my passer and defends it and attacks the WQ at the same time. Alas it does not prevent the [ [ e7 ] ] pawn from falling but at least he has to capture it with his queen first.
 [ K c1 ] , [ R e c8 + ]  I had been planning to play 22. ... [ R a c8 + ] leaving my other rook active on the open e-file. The natural choice to activate the inactive rook and keep the strong rook on the open file. But last move I found the mate in 5 and it requires my rook on [ a8 ] to stay home.
 [ Q h8 + ]  [ K e7 ] , [ Q g7 + ]  I can sense some sort of win ahead but I'm not sure of it yet. I've got to keep the initiative and make forcing moves so he can't coordinate his queen and rook.
 [ K h5 ]  [ Q h3 + ] , [ Q h4 ]  Forced
 [ h5 + ]  [ K h7 ] , [ R x b1 ]  Now the king is safer however I have achieved my plan from move 12 I have used the weak king and loose pieces to obtain a strong advantage and kingside space. at this point I'm looking for the knockout punch and it comes in the form of a standard tactical idea.
 [ B d6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N e7 ]  [ d4 ] , [ f5 ]  This seems to lose a tempo and also creates a hole on e5. It seems incongruous to play [ N e7 ] and then f5--if [ [ f5 ] ] shouldn't the N belong on f6? Otherwise wouldn't you rather have the N on [ [ f5 ] ] instead of the pawn?
 [ B e4 ] , [ b4 ]  ! Great Stuff.
 [ R f d2 ] , [ N b7 ]  At this point I had to make a few important decisions. First of all I had to decide whether I wanted black to take my B. [ N x d6 ] would leave me without my dark bishop. In this position the dark bishop appears to be quite powerful. Placed on the a1-[ h8 ] diagonal it could cause black problems. However if I moved the bishop after a few moves black could advance the d-pawn (but if [ N x d6 ] then [ R x d6 ] keeps the d-pawn back and weak). And there were also 2 options if I decided to move my B - I could either bring it to the [ b2 ] square through [ a3 ] or I could take it to [ f4 ] and then play [ B h6 ] at some point. So at this junction I was considering 3 moves: B[ a3 ] B[ f4 ] and a move in which I wouldn't move my B probably [ Q b2 ]  [ d5 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ B x d5 ]  [ Q b1 ]  [ R d7 ]  [ B b2 ]  [ R c5 ] , [ Q d3 ]  Attacks [ a6 ] and threatens Qe3. After [ Q e3 ] white could play [ B x d5 ] with the white Q eventually taking on [ e6 ] and leaving the black king in real danger. Maybe it was a bit premature for black to resign - the position however does favour white quite heavily.
 [ O-O ]  [ R f e1 ]  [ R a d8 ]  [ b4 ] , [ N f5 ]  Looking to trade knight for bishop as my bishop pair is the stronger force at the minute
 [ h4 ]  [ Q x f4 ] , [ K e6 ]  And Black resigns. A hard-fought game.
 [ B e7 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ c5 ]  [ d x c5 ]  [ B x c5 ]  [ b4 ] , [ B d6 ]  Black falls into the trap
 [ O-O ] , [ O-O ]  Time to generate something
 [ N x c3 ] , [ Q d2 ]  Instead of winning the exchange on [ b1 ] I decided it's better to get a bishop or more.
 [ B b4 + ]  [ c3 ] , [ B c5 ]  And it's with this move since Tom threatens to fork and win a R. Jack showed a similar example on the same square with the Guaco Piano as after 1.[ e4 ] [ e5 ] 2.[ N f3 ] [ N c6 ] 3.[ B c4 ] [ B e7 ] is best to prevent advancing the d pawn followed by [ N g5 ] which would lead to the same type of fork. Keeping that in mind Tom makes the threat. This leaves my K somewhat exposed because of what's about to happen.
 [ a6 ] , [ N e3 ]  Blakc has missed his chance to prevent the a6-pawn from advancing unkess he plays the rook down the board.
 [ N x e4 ] , [ e5 ]  Not surprisingly Carl hits my N in return. For a while I was wondering what to do and had considered 8.[ N f3 ] or 8.Nb3.
 [ R f e8 ] , [ N b c5 ]  White's knights dominate the board and the e-pawn is ready to become a monster.
 [ B d3 ] , [ g6 ]  
 [ Q f3 ]  [ N f5 ]  [ B g5 ] , [ Q g8 ]  Alternative variation: 17... [ Q h5 ] 18. [ R g4 ] (18. [ Q f4 ] Nb8)
 [ N e7 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ N f5 ]  [ R f3 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ g4 ]  [ N d6 ]  [ Q h6 ]  [ f6 ]  [ N d3 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ N c5 ]  [ Q c6 ]  [ B b1 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ R h3 ]  [ R f7 ] , [ f3 ]  Chasing the knight off the b1-[ h7 ] diagonal.
 [ d6 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ a6 ] , [ N a3 ]  8. [ N a3 ] - this knight is forced back but there is the possiblity of it relocating to [ c4 ] later on.
 [ a6 ]  [ B a4 ] , [ b5 ]  Weird move order chosen by Black
 [ N f6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N x d5 ] , [ e x d5 ]  Please note that the [ g7 ] pawn is hanging.
 [ R e8 ]  [ N e2 ]  [ N h5 ] , [ K b3 ]  12. Kb3?! - Hmm I expected NxB.
 [ f x g6 ] , [ B x g6 ]  Breaking king´s castle
 [ c6 ]  [ d x c6 ] , [ b x c6 ]  27. ...... bxc6. Pawn trade - was 27. [ d x c6 ] a mistake - and was [ d6 ] an improvement? Can you the Inquest Jury decide?
 [ N h f6 ] , [ N x d7 ]  Now more comfortable with exchanges as my g and h pawns are now free to raise some Cain.
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ] , [ N f3 ]  Sticking with mainlines with the last few moves but this is where I decide to develop.
 [ K e5 ] , [ R d6 ]  [ b6 ] is lost.
 [ N f6 ] , [ R e1 ]  I thought this move was sharper than Nc3.
 [ B e7 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N c3 ] , [ d6 ]  I think a Philidor-type defense still has potential for intrigue.
 [ K b3 ] , [ g5 ]  And here my opponent ran out of time although the game was for all intensive purposes over. good game slaughterer41. Thoughts?
 [ Q g4 ] , [ Q e6 ]  Still white has a strong attack after [ B h6 + ] followed by Qf4. In this moment i saw the previous move would finish the game and i regretted it. Here I calculated [ B h6 ] but had a funny lil mistake on calculation and played a bad move.
 [ Q e2 ]  [ h4 ] , [ Q x a6 ]  ?? This is where the attitude is costly but I do what I'm comfortable with. The thing is that Jack Stockel is known to have glacoma as otherwise I wouldn't have considered with. And with problems in his vision he has made a blunders as we saw a week ago and then the time before. That was when I won his Rook for a piece. Therefore I didn't forget but rather ignored that "To take is a mistake." That's because I assumed that his glacoma got the best of him and therefore made a mistake that lost his pawn. It turns out that is where that pompous attitude is costly. Similar to what we saw with bhidragon he gave this pawn away for a reason. It turns out that by taking my Queen is likewise out of play. And I'm now busted. I was just focused on taking advantage of Jack being forced to capture away from the center which made me believe that I was gaining an edge. But we discussed it and he said that there was no need to capture because that was a week. Instead his h pawn was the real danger. With best I'm going to lose two pieces. Therefore he said that best was 16.[ f3 ] as not only is the Queen still in play but it's more active right near the monarch (that's under attack.)
 [ d x e5 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ B x e5 ] , [ d x e5 ]  At least I get rid of the WB... if any compensation is to be gotten here.
 [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ] , [ N f6 ]  3. ..... [ N f6 ] - interesting black does not recapture but develops a piece.
 [ N x e5 ]  [ B x h5 ] , [ N x c4 ]  the simplification is over. Let's take a look at the result that both players had previewed (i guess). White may appear as better coordinated as his bishop his queen and potentially his other pieces are well oriented. But there is no direct threats on black and it just needs one move (the [ c8 ] bishop to be almost completely developped. Computer says white has a slight advantage.
 [ e4 ] , [ c5 ]  Black chose the Sicilian.
 [ N x d8 ] , [ K x d8 ]  The N is dead! Ha!... 10 moves and 5 points later.
 [ R d6 ]  [ f4 ] , [ R d8 ]  Notice black's position. The a pawn is blocked. The b pawn defends the bishop. The d pawn is blockaded and helpless. The g and h pawn are tied up by my f and g pawns. Black's bishop and rook are forced on the defensive and I control the open file. My knight is immune to attack and controls the critical central squares. My king has more space. White has a considerable advantage. Is it enough to win?
 [ d5 ]  [ c3 ]  [ c5 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c4 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ e3 ]  As white I'd play [ N d2 ] to try to break inmediately with [ e4 ] but he likes the London with a lost tempo on a6. The London is my favourite as white so I know a little about it.
 [ B x e4 ] , [ Q x e4 ]  White is ahead in development has a bit more space. But his pawn structure is less than ideal and black has no concrete weaknesses. This game is drawn... or is it!
 [ N c3 ]  [ Q e5 + ]  [ B e2 ]  [ N g6 ] , [ N b5 ]  Knight is now threatening [ N c7 + ] winning the rook.
 [ N f6 ] , [ R e1 ]  his queen is not in a good position
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ f4 ] , [ e x f4 ]  Tim accepts the Gambit.
 [ N x g5 ] , [ Q x g5 ]  So he accepts the exchange.
 [ Q c8 ] , [ B e2 ]  In rapid and blitz things can turn around so fast & no time to find the right defense. This is why Carlsen in spite of big disagreement among the chess community decided to offer a draw in game 12 so he can play rapid where he thinks he'll demolish Caruana.
 [ N x c3 ] , [ b x c3 ]  9. [ b x c3 ] - so here is the busted pawn structure.
 [ c5 ]  [ d5 ] , [ b5 ]  And here we have the Benko Gambit. I don't really know this opening very well so I decided to accept it and then just try to make the best moves since I am already out of the book.
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ h3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ a3 ]  [ b6 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ a6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ e3 ] , [ B d6 ]  I've been experimenting with this setup.
 [ g6 ] , [ R a b1 ]  The mate threat gave me time to guard the other B as well.
 [ R e8 ]  [ B x c8 ]  [ R x c8 ]  [ N a3 ] , [ N f5 ]  To open e file and to develop knight
 [ h6 ] , [ R e2 ]  roneshet: N7[ c5 ] Threatening [ b3 ] and d3. In addition we put it in a very central position. bluenoser: 21. b4? I was looking at [ [ [ [ [ b4 ] ] ] ] ] which would give us more space and everything is protected. ptitroque: I do not like [ [ [ [ [ b4 ] ] ] ] ] 2 possibilities ; 21... [ [ [ [ [ b4 ] ] ] ] ] 22. ax[ [ [ [ [ b4 ] ] ] ] ] ax[ [ [ [ [ b4 ] ] ] ] ] 23. [ R a6 ] and we are in trouble. 21... [ [ [ [ [ b4 ] ] ] ] ] 22. ax[ [ [ [ [ b4 ] ] ] ] ] Bx[ [ [ [ [ b4 ] ] ] ] ] and we have an isolated pawn on the a file which will be hard to defend. bluenoser: 21 [ [ [ [ [ b4 ] ] ] ] ] On 22. ax[ [ [ [ [ b4 ] ] ] ] ] [ B x4 ] was my intent I don't see why it will be hard to defend as we have a pin on rook as the knight is on the same diagonal. You of course have the higher rating so I could be missing things moves down the road.
 [ b x a6 ] , [ c x b4 ]  ! Prevents pawn chains opens a nice line to the king frees the bishop.
 [ N c3 ] , [ a6 ]  5. ....... [ a6 ] - this move is the Sicilian Naijdorf.
 [ Q x g2 ] , [ Q a4 + ]  This one protects [ f2 ] and gives me check. Game over.
 [ B f5 ]  [ R e3 ] , [ N e2 + ]  Now I make the move swapping knight for bishop.
 [ N g3 ]  [ Q c6 ] , [ Q b3 ]  29. [ Q b3 ] - white declines a queen trade and the Wicked Witch of the West lines up on the a2-[ g1 ] diagonal of which Henry is sitting on!
 [ K f2 ] , [ N d6 ]  I move up my knight to attack the bishop and to line up an attack on the king...
 [ Q f6 + ] , [ K c1 ]  ?? Why did I do that? Black is free to go right now. Had I done [ K b1 ] I still could have prevented the worst with the Knight although or by kicking his Knight with the Bishop...
 [ B b5 + ]  [ N c6 ]  [ d x c5 ] , [ e6 ]  [ e6 ] rather than [ e5 ] in case the opposing player gets a bit materialistic...
 [ B c5 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ B x e3 ] , [ Q x e3 ]  ...
 [ Q x d4 ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ N f4 ] , [ R a2 a1 ]  trading off any potentially annoying pieces in a winning endgame is usually a good idea
 [ f8 = Q + ]  [ K d8 ] , [ Q d6 + ]  ...or [ K e7 + ] followed by QxBe8#. Bigger point spread. Though that is truly irrelevant. I mention Q[ x B e8 # ] because many of Shosanna's victories are by the queen trapping the opposing king against the wall and I would like to see a broader repertoire especially if it reduces the number of moves. She is my team mate and sister-in-law just to explain my interest in her progress.
 [ O-O ]  [ O-O ] , [ N c6 ]  I was thinking very hard about what to do to avoid exchanging. There was no way around it here so I decided to complete my development. But better would've been to develop with 10...[ N b d7 ] And when he plays 11.[ B x f6 ] I can recapture with the other N ultimately making it stronger. By playing this however the exchange weakens my position. As now I'm losing some control of my center.
 [ K c3 ]  [ K g3 ]  [ K x c2 ]  [ K g4 ]  [ K b1 ]  [ K g5 ]  [ K x a2 ] , [ K x g6 ]  ...and eliminate my opponent's last pawn to give mine a clear run.
 [ O-O-O ] , [ b5 ]  the natural move for Najdorf
 [ K c4 ]  [ c x b5 + ] , [ K x b5 ]  From my current location I am not worried about his a file pawn advancing due to the location of my B. It would be able to promote but would be immediately be captured. I was not able to focus on moving my f file pawn towards promotion.
 [ R x b2 + ] , [ K f1 ]  Black gains a pawn and puts white in check. Worse that pawn was the only defender of the white knight on [ c3 ] so black also wins that knight. It won't save him now.
 [ N e2 ]  [ N f5 ]  [ B g3 ]  [ B x f3 ]  [ g x f3 ]  [ h5 ]  [ B x b8 ]  [ Q x b8 ]  [ K h1 ] , [ B h6 ]  taking more space...
 [ e4 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ B e2 ] , [ N f d7 ]  Black tries to open the F-file.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ f4 ] , [ d5 ]  Morphy was never one to accept gambits...
 [ N b5 ] , [ B b2 ]  29. [ B b2 ] - this move is forced because I must get Fou Lenoir out of the knight's attack and prevent a fork on a3. It leaves my [ f2 ] pawn weak though and this is gonna drop off.
 [ g6 ]  [ B e3 ] , [ N h5 ]  preparing ... [ N f4 ] and ... [ f5 ]  [ K h2 ] , [ N g7 ]  unexpected but logical as it further supports ... [ f5 ] and the N was no longer usefully employed on [ h5 ]  [ N d7 ] , [ B g5 ]  A sign that I'm running out of ideas at this point. This B doesn't attack anythingbut does take temporary control fo [ d8 ] where I suspected that Black would want to place his R or Q in due course.
 [ R x a4 + ]  [ R x a4 ] , [ Q b3 # ]  There you have it. Until next time...
 [ N x e7 ] , [ Q x e7 ]  Q and K have no place to get safe squares...
 [ h5 ]  [ Q x f8 + ]  [ K h7 ] , [ Q g7 # ]  That's it. :) I really enjoyed the knight play and think it was in a way a beautiful game since not that much tactic was made and the black moves seamed pretty reasonable. :) Thanks for reading I hope you enjoyed it and comments are welcome. :)
 [ a6 ] , [ a4 ]  blocked position for blacks at queenside.
 [ e x d4 ] , [ e5 ]  This is a safer line in my opinion than the Scotch Gambit.
 [ N x d4 ]  [ B x d4 ] , [ R e1 ]  ?? In this position I was worried about losing my F Rook if I was not careful. The reason being is that he wanted to trick me with 9...[ N g4 ] in which case my R would be trapped because [ [ f3 ] ] is not an option. Instead it's an illegal move. So I decided to protect it with this move. Of course this is the losing blunder. Therefore I went from flawlessness to losing in one move because of this mistake. I mean with [ [ f3 ] ] being prohibited he could have won my Q with 9...[ B g4 ] and that would be the very least of my problems. Instead he is going to play something else which actually threatens mate. However for the first time I do not know what the best move was.
 [ K e4 ] , [ Q x a4 + ]  I probably could have mated him in a move or 2 but I head a minute and a half on the clock so I just took the rook.
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ N e2 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ b6 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ a3 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ b4 ]  [ Q g5 ]  [ f3 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N f4 ]  [ g3 ]  [ N x d3 ]  [ c x d3 ]  [ a5 ]  [ f4 ]  [ Q g6 ] , [ Q b3 ]  I examined this position for ten minuets before I moved. My white bishop has a strong position and I was salivating for the chance to put my queen down on the [ h1 ] or [ g2 ] squares. But at this point my queen seem trapped behind the menacing white pawn line. Every white square beyond the pawn line is protected and I cant get around the pawn line on the 6th row because of the knight on d4. But then I noticed that knight shared a diagonal with the king and I saw my chance to pin it there and get my queen out.
 [ B x f4 ]  [ d x c3 ] , [ Q b3 ]  Naturally exchanges on [ d8 ] come into consideration: 11.Qx[ d8 ] Nx[ d8 ] 12.[ b x c3 ] when White has a big lead in development.
 [ B x e5 ] , [ d x e5 ]  Completing the exchange.
 [ B d6 ]  [ b4 ] , [ B g4 ]  if 17. ...[ B x c5 ] then 18. [ R x c5 ] would give white a slight but enduring edge
 [ R g1 ]  [ Q h3 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ R g3 ]  [ Q h5 ]  [ N b5 ] , [ N x e5 ]  Nxe5! It could seem a blunder but for me it isn't.
 [ N c3 ] , [ b5 ]  The Goldman variation of the Caro-Kann plays [ d5 ] instead. I can't find this variation in the GameKnot database.
 [ B e2 ] , [ Q c3 ]  Here we are Q take strong place with force against [ b4 ]  [ N c4 ]  [ N x c4 ]  [ d x c4 ]  [ B f3 ]  [ B x b5 ]  [ B x b7 ] , [ R a b8 ]  now black have clear plan to attack
 [ N f6 ] , [ g3 ]  4.g3. On 2nd thought I am wary of bringing the knight back to [ f3 ] too soon as this will take development time. That knight will have moved 3 times while I have no other furniture moved at all. I know how it is with these Master Mater guys: You give an inch of development and they take the whole board! So if 4.N[ f3 ] [ B g7 ] or 4.N[ f3 ] [ B e7 ] and black is ahead in development with his king-side almost completely mobilized. Wait a minute I thought black is supposed to be a half tempo behind...
 [ e x f6 ]  [ Q x f6 ] , [ N e5 ]  Whites knight on [ e5 ] is very problematic and I have lost my dark square bishop and have no center pawns to attack with. I now miss my [ d7 ] pawn!
 [ N c3 ]  [ B g4 ] , [ a3 ]  12. [ a3 ] - preventing Nb4.
 [ R a1 ]  [ Q h3 + ]  [ K g1 ] , [ Q g3 + ]  It was a mistake since [ g3 ] was lethal to white. But is mate in some more mores anyway so my opponent resigned. The key to the win was to give tempoes more importance than material and surprise my opponent tempting him with a juicy candy. Thank you for reading and forgive the low game level from both sides.
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ g6 ]  The fiachetto is probably the best structure against the London attack. This doesn't mean I won't play my favorite plan against it. The first thing to do is to block the action of a future black bishop... on f5! The black squared bishop will aim to a solid pawn wall (c3) and it is not dangerous itself.
 [ B b5 ]  [ N x h1 ]  [ Q x h1 ]  [ O-O ]  [ d3 ] , [ N d4 ]  Here black moves into position for the famous king/rook fork with NxPc2+. White should respond with [ Q g2 ] though [ B a4 ] works too.
 [ Q c5 ]  [ d3 ]  [ Q b6 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ Q x b2 ] , [ B c1 ]  It unfortunately took Nick about a second to realise his mistake. 12. [ N g5 ] keeps Black's advantage to a minimum.
 [ N x c3 ]  [ b x c3 ]  [ Q x a5 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B a3 ]  [ R c2 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ Q d3 ]  [ Q b5 ]  [ c4 ]  [ Q f5 ] , [ e4 ]  Black's queen bouncing back and forth allows white's pawns to advance free of charge.
 [ B x b2 ]  [ K x b2 ] , [ R d c1 ]  White's king is now safely trapped on the b file.
 [ N f4 ] , [ Q g3 ]  Trading might have been better but the rook recapture puts pressure on the g pawn.
 [ B x f4 ]  [ N x f4 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ B x c6 ]  To get a powerful knight on [ e5 ]  [ B x c6 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ Q f3 ]  [ R b8 ]  [ N e g6 + ]  [ f x g6 ] , [ N e6 + ]  My opponent was so mad he knocked over all his pieces and left the room swearing.
 [ K h3 ] , [ Q x c1 ]  i enjoyed playing this opponent he is good player he did better in our other game he resigned here there is no shame in that.i hope to play him again sometime he just relized once the hiredgun is on your trail there IS no way out please leave your input.Shout out to my friend SMART DONKEY!!!PEACE GOOD CHESS!!!
 [ N x f6 ] , [ R a d1 ]  preventing the castling
 [ R a e1 ]  [ Q d5 ] , [ N b3 ]  Stopping counter play on the [ a2 ] square
 [ d4 ] , [ Q a5 + ]  Getting my queen in the attack
 [ B d3 ] , [ N c6 ]  since the d pawn gave up it's wedge in the centre my knihgt can now develop here which gives me good control over the central dark squares.
 [ K e2 ]  [ Q e3 + ]  [ K f1 ]  [ d3 ]  [ Q e1 ]  [ Q x e1 + ]  [ K x e1 ]  [ K f7 ]  [ K d2 ]  [ K e6 ]  [ K x d3 ] , [ K d5 ]  Opposition is when two kings face each other and one must move away allowing the opposing king access to a critical square. In this case access would be to the pawns on one side or the other. Black starting thinking before I did and positioned his king directly opposite mine. Since he has the greater number of possible pawn moves he should be able to lock the board in a favorable position and force my king to step aside.
 [ Q x c4 ]  [ N x d5 ] , [ Q x a2 ]  The rook was off limits Black needed to control the c file and not allow white to take control of the dark squares
 [ R d3 + ]  [ K e8 ] , [ R d4 ]  Offering the exchange.
 [ R d8 ] , [ b x c6 ]  Again he was too lax and didn't take it so I took his pawn opening more holes in his defense.
 [ B x c4 ]  [ N d6 ] , [ B d3 ]  Bishop rejoins the [ b1 ] - [ h7 ] diagonal with the Queen and now white threatens e5.
 [ Q b2 ] , [ K f7 ]  nambam: I would continue to probe 28. Qd4. redfoxrising: move 28 any more suggestions [ Q d2 ] is on the long diagonal from move 27. [ Q b2 ] nambam suggested [ Q d4 ] again for 28 I think a pawn move or a rook move is better or B back to our base line. trying to break the wall need some more suggestions move 28. not easy to choose [ [ h3 ] ] [ e3 ] [ B f1 ] [ K f2 ] [ R e d1 ] Rcd1. [ Q d4 ] nambam archduke_piccolo: Difficult... I played through a conjectural line beginning [ Q e5 ] that went down to a rook and 5 vs bishop and 6. The ending position left nowhere where the the White king could invade or break through. I'm beginning to suspect a win is now unlikely. I'm tempted to play [ [ h3 ] ] but I don't think that leads anywhere unless we can get leverage elsewhere. That 'elsewhere has to be the centre and we don't have anything there at the moment. I think I'd try [ R c d1 ] but I'm not optimistic. nambam: [ R c d1 ] is one of my suggested waiting moves so i vote [ R c d1 ]  [ R c d1 ] , [ R g8 ]  archduke_piccolo: I'm looking... ... at 29.[ Q e5 ] here. Looking at the possibility a move or so back it didn't look so attractive but with both rooks on the centre files it doesn't look so bad at all. Further investigation needed of course - let's not be too hasty. Other ideas are: 29.[ Q d4 ] 29.[ h3 ] 29.[ h4 ] (= in my view) 29.[ [ e4 ] ] another move I've been eyeing for a while but not clear that it gives us anything. 29.[ e3 ] possibly with the view to exchanging off bishops - can't say this floats my boat neither. The relevance to our position... ... appears to be the potential breaks at [ b5 ] and h3. Black has a potential break at b4. By sacrificing a knight there she might create a passed pawn. She might also have in mind the kind of switching attention from wing to wing though in the problem that is forced upon White whose path to the ideal squares is a long and narrow one. What I have been looking at are potential breaks for White in the centre focusing on what e2-[ [ e4 ] ] might achieve. in the circumstances that doesn't look easy to arrange given Black's coverage of that square. And that is why [ Q e5 ] has drawn my attention over the last couple of moves or so. At first it looked unpromising but I'm coming round to thinking that maybe that is where our best chance lies. So my vote is for 29.Qe5. But I'm not going to complain if the vote comes down to a different choice and am willing to be persuaded that a better option exists. nambam: after playing through what i think are all possible moves to break the deadlock i conclude that i agree with the duke in that our best chance lies with 29. Qe5. it then depends on whether janet wants to swap queens or not. i have played out both scenarios to some lengths and believe that both give us chances but will wait to see which way the cat jumps before going into more detail.
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ B b5 + ]  [ B d7 ]  [ B x d7 + ]  [ Q x d7 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N c6 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ d3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ N b d2 ]  [ O-O ]  [ e5 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ R x e5 ]  [ b6 ]  [ N c4 ]  [ R a d8 ]  [ R e3 ] , [ h6 ]  this gains a bishop for the knight.
 [ Q g7 + ]  [ K e8 ]  [ Q x g8 + ]  [ K d7 ]  [ Q x f7 + ]  [ K c8 ] , [ R x e6 ]  The last few moves were all conditional and in my hurry to input them before my opponent moved I missed 36. [ Q e8 + ] [ Q d8 ] 37. Qxd8#. The move played is however almost as forcing. Black can delay mate by sacrificing the queen and rooks but he chooses the gentlemanly way out.
 [ R c7 ] , [ B f4 ]  black resigns. a fun game with the opposing sides being interestingly out of balance. Thank you to rjfsmith for another good game.
 [ Q x f5 ] , [ N d7 ]  Protecting f6.
 [ O-O ]  [ N g5 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ N h5 ] , [ h6 ]  Possibly weakning. I wanted to kick the knight but perhaps moving some pieces over to defend would have been fine.
 [ B x b4 ]  [ K d7 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ R a6 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ R a2 ]  [ B f8 ] , [ h5 ]  Rook is getting trapped as you soon will see. At any case [ N d7 ] develops the Knight and lets rook out.
 [ N b6 ]  [ B b3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ R e1 ] , [ N c6 ]  OK now is when stuff starts happening.
 [ Q x b3 ]  [ N f5 ] , [ g4 ]  Aiming the knight at [ h4 ] as then I still have the threat of a back rank mate if the white rook strays away
 [ O-O ] , [ B e6 ]  forcing the trade this would double the e pawns and open the f file if I castle kingside
 [ B e3 ]  [ R c8 ]  [ N a3 ] , [ Q g6 ]  ? This move turned out well but with good play for White it is a disadvantage for Black.
 [ f4 ]  [ B b6 ] , [ e4 ]  Do you remember the [ e4 ] strike? Well now is the moment. If [ d4 ] [ B f2 ] and I win the pawn.
 [ d x c6 ]  [ O-O ] , [ Q f6 ]  This answer is rather rare. Continuations like 5... [ f6 ] or 5... [ B g4 ] are believed to be more robust.
 [ B b3 ] , [ a5 ]  Black continues aggresive play. Now here I decide to play a4.
 [ e3 ]  [ B x e3 ]  [ N x e3 ]  [ R x e3 ]  [ R x e3 ]  [ f x e3 ]  [ Q x c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ Q x e3 + ]  [ K h1 ] , [ R e8 ]  material is still even and maybe I can draw if I keep pieces on since black does have some queenside weakness's but here I should be completely lost after my next move.
 [ R d8 ] , [ N x d5 ]  and taking one more pawn.
 [ R x e2 + ]  [ K x e2 ]  [ Q e6 + ]  [ B e3 ]  [ Q x a2 + ]  [ N b d2 ]  [ B c3 ] , [ R d1 ]  this is why it is called the fortress game you have a wall of peices
 [ R x d2 ] , [ K c7 ]  black prefer to finish development rather than going into complication with 20...[ Q x a2 ]  [ R h d1 ]  [ R h d8 ] , [ Q f7 ]  Sealed the N fate.
 [ e4 ] , [ g6 ]  This is the so-called Modern Defense where black allows white to dominate the centre in the beginning. It is an opening that requires extensive positional skills from the black player and which I would not recommend to beginners
 [ B f5 ] , [ g6 ]  !
 [ B f6 ]  [ Q x g6 ] , [ d x c4 ]  The bishop does not matter in this position as white is on the offense.
 [ R b1 ]  [ B x c3 + ]  [ K d1 ]  [ R x a2 ]  [ K c1 ] , [ B a6 ]  In my opinion this was my worst move of the game. The computer analysis labels it as a mistake in favor of "Ne4". White could have advanced to [ [ b7 ] ] to win my bishop but neither mrshtaba nor the computer analysis picked up on this. Anyway in the end this move was essentially just a wasted move. I think that I should have castled or moved the bishop to [ [ b7 ] ] instead. I wanted to focus on the right side and I don't think that [ N e4 ] would have progressed to mate as quickly.
 [ B d3 ] , [ d5 ]  Here I moved my bishop to support my pawn so I can move [ c3 ] to move my knight back. My opponent does a central pawn thrust to d5.
 [ B d6 + ]  [ K e8 ]  [ R g8 + ] , [ K d7 ]  ...but time to move.
 [ B g2 ]  [ O-O ] , [ O-O ]  i felt comfortable at this stage... i've been here many times before and know i can find winning attacks...
 [ K f8 ] , [ K d6 ]  My king gets deeper into the position. Computer gives Black only 0.62 up now
 [ B x d6 ]  [ Q x d6 ]  [ N b d2 ]  [ R f e8 ]  [ Q c2 ]  [ R a c8 ]  [ R x e8 + ]  [ R x e8 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ R x e1 + ]  [ N x e1 ] , [ B f5 ]  Now my focus switches from the kingside to the center where the weak [ d3 ] pawn lies.
 [ R e8 ]  [ Q e2 ]  [ e4 ] , [ B d4 ]  This is where white's early development and attack of black's queenside becomes obvious. Though he has doubled pawns this may work to white's advantage.
 [ Q f5 + ]  [ K h6 ]  [ d3 + ]  [ g5 ] , [ h4 ]  A decisive attack and black must make the right move to survive. 9...[ d5 ] is the only way to prevent mate because it blocks the bishop from controlling [ f7 ] and it also threatens the queen. If black makes any other move the following mate occurs.
 [ N c3 ] , [ a6 ]  I choose the Najdorf which I have been playing for a few years now.
 [ Q f4 ] , [ b4 ]  Black's attack comes. Will White be in trouble?
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ] , [ B b5 + ]  The Sicilian Moscow
 [ N x e2 ] , [ O-O ]  I also wanted time to castle. But this could have been just as soon by retreating.
 [ K x h4 ] , [ g2 ]  Threatening to Queen.
 [ Q g3 ]  [ R e6 ]  [ h3 ] , [ R a e8 ]  Things are taking shape... White has to ponder...
 [ b5 ] , [ R d1 ]  ...so now my rook is free to contest the open file. I'm again hoping Black will agree to exchange which would allow my king more room to roam...
 [ a4 ] , [ a5 ]  symmetrical
 [ b5 ]  [ a3 ]  [ h6 ] , [ B x f6 ]  I thought 12. [ B e3 ] was really putting me into a cramped position. 12. [ B h4 ] [ g5 ] loses the Bishop
 [ B b6 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ R b2 ]  [ a3 ]  [ R b3 ]  [ a2 ]  [ R x d3 ]  [ a1 = Q + ]  [ R d1 ] , [ Q x d1 # ]  congrats and thanks to Russ for taking the time to play me. All in all I'm not entirely disappointed with my performance in the game I was throroughly outmanouevred in the middle-game only realising Russ's plan when it was too late. But I'll need to go back to the opening position it left me in a real quandry how best to proceed with the attack
 [ O-O ]  [ a6 ]  [ d3 ]  [ N e7 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N b c6 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ N b4 ]  [ R a c1 ]  [ N b c6 ]  [ a3 ]  [ Q d7 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ B x d5 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ b4 ]  [ b5 ]  [ c4 ] , [ N a7 ]  ? This was a terrible idea. [ R a8 ] is sacrificed--a completely free rook.
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B c4 ] , [ N d4 ]  My favourite opening but this time my opponent tries a less used approach to it.
 [ K g6 ]  [ K e4 ] , [ N x h4 ]  At this point the game was abandoned as a draw for reasons I am quite unable to discover. Having said that suppose White were to play 53.[ R b7 ] to which Black replies 53...Rd6?? (53...[ R c6 ] is way better). Then 54.Rxg7ch!! might have drawn the game as 54...[ K x g7 ] is a draw by Stalemate. Unfortunately Black can escape by 54...[ K h6 ] 55.Rh7ch Kg5! and if 56.Rh5ch [ K g6 ] 57.Rg5ch Bxg5; or 56.Rg7ch Ng6.
 [ Q x e5 ] , [ B f6 ]  13... [ N f6 ] reduces black's forces to passivity unfortunately 13...[ B f6 ] trades off black's most active piece.
 [ a6 ]  [ B a4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ O-O ] , [ B e7 ]  The Closed Variation leading to a slower more positional game. 5...NxP the Open Variation can get tactical very quickly.
 [ R a c8 ]  [ b4 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ N b3 ]  [ B d8 ]  [ b5 ]  [ a x b5 ] , [ B x b5 ]  Things are looking up for white the pawn on [ b7 ] is now a target
 [ K x e2 ]  [ h6 ]  [ N f4 ]  [ R f e8 ]  [ N h3 ]  [ g5 ]  [ R a f1 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ B x e5 ]  [ R x e5 ]  [ a4 ]  [ R e e8 ]  [ a5 ]  [ B c7 ]  [ R f a1 ]  [ g4 ]  [ N g1 ]  [ K g7 ]  [ g3 ]  [ K g6 ]  [ h3 ]  [ h5 ]  [ c3 ]  [ d4 ]  [ h x g4 ]  [ h x g4 ]  [ R c1 ]  [ B e5 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ R x d4 ]  [ b5 ]  [ R e d8 ]  [ R c2 ]  [ R d4 d5 ]  [ a6 ]  [ b x a6 ] , [ R c6 + ]  Thats perhaps an error.
 [ R d c1 ] , [ f5 ]  Winning space and ridding out of the threat on d6.
 [ c x d3 ] , [ R x f6 ]  A silly blunder the pawn would be impossible to defend and I needed to make a rook move like [ R d e8 ] before taking the pawn.
 [ K h2 ]  [ c1 = Q ]  [ N x c1 ] , [ R x c1 ]  42. ..... [ R x c1 ] - only to lose it to the knight but I am now a Rook and 3 pawns up so I have come off very well out of that deal. My b pawn now spends the next four moves marching off to Glendadom and this time arrives safely.
 [ d4 ]  [ g6 ] , [ B c4 ]  4. [ B c4 ] - my opponent's last move took me out of the db but I fall back on the old OTB principle of good normal sensible development here with Bc4.
 [ d6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ d3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ Q e7 ]  [ h3 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ Q e2 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ g4 ]  [ N x e3 ] , [ f x e3 ]  retaking the center possibilities
 [ O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ N a4 ]  [ d6 ]  [ N x c5 ] , [ d x c5 ]  "Dad! You had the chance to get rid of the pawn which is in my way." "I know but I felt it more important to double his pawns."
 [ N x h7 ] , [ B h4 ]  Bizarre and hilarious.
 [ e4 ] , [ c5 ]  He played [ e4 ] and i responded with the Sicilian.
 [ b6 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ R f x h7 + ]  [ K g8 ]  [ b7 ] , [ N x d3 ]  He takes the bishop hoping to take my rook with the king next turn. His efforts prove to be futile. Another potentially better move would've been [ K c6 ] followed by [ K b8 ] preventing my pawn from reaching the 8th rank.
 [ B c7 ] , [ f4 ]  Really the only good way to stop the threat on h2. Now my ideas regarding the fourth rank are garbage.
 [ B d2 ]  [ h5 ]  [ Q b3 ]  [ N g4 ]  [ f4 ] , [ g5 ]  Trying to open things.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ b4 ]  [ B x b4 ]  [ c3 ]  [ B a5 ]  [ d4 ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ O-O ]  [ d6 ]  [ c x d4 ] , [ B b6 ]  The starting position for all the games.
 [ c5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ g5 ]  [ Q b3 ]  [ b6 ] , [ Q a4 + ]  Queen calls check
 [ K b3 ]  [ N d2 + ]  [ R x d2 ] , [ R x d2 ]  winning the exchange!
 [ f x e5 ]  [ N x e5 ] , [ N x e5 ]  Now 9. ...d5!? was the only move when Black whilst significantly worse is surprisingly resilient because of the possibility of a ... [ Q d4 + ] hitting the Bc4. I'll some analysis of the various captures later. Instead Black's reply brings the game to a speedy conclusion.
 [ N c3 ] , [ N f6 ]  Chance to push the pawn forward one space next move would be [ B b5 ] and maybe trade out the night and bishop
 [ N c6 ] , [ N f3 ]  I advance my knight controlling [ e5 ] and enabling a possible [ d4 ] pawn advance to weaken his pawn structure.
 [ e4 ]  [ d5 ] , [ d3 ]  One of the worst moves.
 [ a5 ]  [ N g3 ] , [ h6 ]  I was hoping for that
 [ N g e2 ]  [ O-O ] , [ d4 ]  White plays as I would do. Not "losing time" with castling. I did it and white strikes. But look: Is he threatening to pin the piece and place a rook behind it? He won't get on time methink...
 [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ g6 ]  What is the best move?
 [ N c4 ]  [ Q d7 ]  [ B c3 ]  [ O-O-O ]  [ B d2 ] , [ h5 ]  black gives a pawn. I think it is not that good but it is playable in order to attack.
 [ a4 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ b4 ] , [ N e2 ]  all because of his attacking b pawn I decided to bring queen's side Knight over to attack on his King
 [ g6 ]  [ h x g6 ]  [ f x g6 ]  [ K f6 ]  [ R e2 ] , [ f x g6 ]  Wins a pawn
 [ R x b6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ R c6 ]  [ R f4 ]  [ N e3 ]  [ R f2 + ]  [ K g1 ]  [ R f3 ]  [ N x c4 ] , [ R x h3 ]  Now he has a piece (and a soon-to-be-free pawn) but I have two joined and passed pawns... let's see.
 [ R c7 ]  [ c4 ]  [ b x c4 ] , [ N x c4 ]  White avoids exchanges in order to make my life hard.
 [ Q h4 ] , [ e5 ]  Although 16...[ R h8 ] was intended in my calculation(And it is quite good after 16...[ R h8 ] 17.[ Q f2 ] e5=.) 16...e5! is even stronger threatening Rg4. You see that even though we may have plannedin our calculations we should always start our thought process in a position where we need to calculate.
 [ f4 ]  [ B x g4 ]  [ h x g4 ]  [ R h4 ]  [ g3 ] , [ R g4 ]  And here's the big blunder that throws away the game (although to be fair to easy19 I was already significantly behind at this point). What was I thinking?
 [ K d6 ]  [ R x h5 ] , [ R f1 + ]  Here the shelter for my K is useful. I played very quickly here so to recover some time for the moves to come.
 [ Q g5 ] , [ K b1 ]  25. [ K b1 ] - Henry moves off the discovery line c1-h6. Failure to do this will result in the loss of Glenda to the moves [ f3 ] 26 [ K b1 ] PXQ.
 [ R e d1 ]  [ K b8 ] , [ Q c4 ]  Not quite sure what I was exactly looking for besides getting my pieces over to the Queenside
 [ K c2 ]  [ Q x h2 + ] , [ K b3 ]  I don't mind - I wanted my king on the third rank to stop a skewer of the king with the rook
 [ B g4 ] , [ Q c2 ]  13. [ Q c2 ] - why not f3?
 [ K b1 ]  [ b2 ]  [ R b3 ] , [ f4 ]  A key move: Black advances the pawn before the king so that if White exchanges on [ b2 ] the pawn is within range to promote unaided.
 [ d4 ] , [ e5 ]  not the most textbook opening...
 [ c6 ] , [ b x c6 ]  And with it I take.
 [ h3 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ R d2 ]  [ O-O ]  [ g3 ]  [ N b6 ]  [ B g2 ] , [ R d8 ]  My eyes popped when I saw that!
 [ B a7 ] , [ B e4 ]  Now at this point White could have shut down the entire width of the board with 39.h5! leaving Black with absolutely nothing to do. The only way the King can get White's side of the board is via the light squares on the Q-side. That would leave White with the option of tempo moves with the bishop or even getting in amongst Black's pawns stranded on dark squares.
 [ c6 ]  [ B e5 ]  [ B x e5 ] , [ N x e5 ]  16. [ N x e5 ] - bishop trade.
 [ N d6 ]  [ R x e7 ] , [ N e4 + ]  Euwe finishes it off in style; with probably the busiest Knight on the planet for modern understandings... Alekhine never knew what hit him and resigned: and won the next game to no avail; after three conclusive draws Euwe became the first and only ever Dutch Word Champion of Chess... final note: the KN move count in this game amounts to 19 moves out of 47; let's say 2 out of every 5 moves... that is why this game is ranking among the then greats; we Dutch call this The Pearl of Zandvoort...
 [ R d8 ]  [ B d2 ]  [ b4 ]  [ a x b4 ] , [ a x b4 ]  28. ....... [ a x b4 ] - my beloved companion Gareth has just been slain. I am all on my own. Glenda's gentle voice soothed and comforted me. You are not alone I am right behind you and so is Fou Lenoir. We will not let you be taken by Queen Henrietta or Bishop Oates. I feel a bit better but I long for my companion. I see that Haldup is still on [ d5 ] but the c column separates us and it is very hard for me to strike up a conversation yet alone for us to defend each other.
 [ c3 ] , [ N a5 ]  This is the chigorin's variation. [ N b8 ] is Keres i think.
 [ N x b5 ] , [ N c6 ]  he leaves his pawn wide open i take the chance to control the pawn causing lots of problems.
 [ R x g3 ]  [ K x g3 ]  [ N x d3 ]  [ K g4 ] , [ e4 ]  To be honest I am not good at endgame. Both white and black want to advance pawns on [ h3 ] and [ e4 ] respectively.
 [ N f7 ]  [ d x c4 ]  [ N x d8 ]  [ R x d8 ] , [ d x c4 ]  The dust has settled with White up a piece and the exchange. Black has few credible attacks here and essentially no hope of winning. However his pawns might offer some hope of clogging up the middle and getting a draw from this mess. Moving a pawn to the 5th rank would blunt White's attack.
 [ R x d7 ] , [ R c1 ]  Now 24. [ R c6 ] is a threat hence Black's next.
 [ Q x f1 + ]  [ K x f1 ]  [ K d5 ]  [ K f2 ]  [ K e5 ]  [ K g3 ]  [ K f5 ]  [ K h4 ] , [ K g6 ]  there was no more option for black... He resigned.
 [ K g7 ]  [ e6 ] , [ K f6 ]  ...and three connected pawns can be stopped by the king just as two! White is in zugszwang!
 [ c x d4 ] , [ Q x d4 ]  ? As I had mentioned earlier this is a mistake. 5.[ N x d4 ] would have been his best move for this continuation. He has violated General Opening Principles by bringing his queen out this early. Therefore I will not hesitate to chase his queen with 5.Nc6. Although 5.Nc6! the obsession will cost me and I will explain this momentarily.
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ Q f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ a6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ B x e5 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ Q x e5 ]  [ Q d5 ]  [ d6 ]  [ f4 ]  [ Q x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ h3 ]  [ B h5 ]  [ g4 ]  [ B g6 ]  [ B x g6 ]  [ h x g6 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ N d7 ] , [ O-O-O ]  If I had castled on the king's side I might have given him a better fight.
 [ Q e3 ]  [ Q x b2 ]  [ R x f8 + ]  [ R x f8 ] , [ R e1 ]  White is a pawn down with diminished attacking chances.
 [ B c6 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ R b3 ]  [ K g2 ]  [ R x b4 ]  [ B f3 ]  [ K d6 ]  [ K x g3 ]  [ R d4 ]  [ K f2 ]  [ b4 ]  [ K e3 ]  [ K c5 ]  [ R c1 + ]  [ R c4 ]  [ R b1 ]  [ R c3 + ]  [ K e2 ]  [ B b5 + ]  [ K f2 ]  [ b3 ]  [ B d1 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ K e1 ] , [ K d4 ]  The last few moves having played themselves Black is clearly winning and White resigned.
 [ a6 ]  [ a4 ]  [ B d7 ] , [ c4 ]  35. [ c4 ] - this seems a bit of wait and see but not quite there is a hidden threat to under-mine protection of the [ [ e5 ] ] pawn and allow Glenda to come to [ [ e5 ] ] and give a nasty check on the black king. Julia susses it out and backs her knight off to g6.
 [ N e4 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ Q g3 ] , [ Q b6 ]  I do not know why he played this.
 [ K e3 ] , [ Q h4 ]  At this point I figured I might as well use my king as a supporting piece since it was basically in the middle of the board almost...haha
 [ Q f8 ] , [ d x e5 ]  White changes his mind - bad idea and black jumps on it quick.
 [ b x c6 ]  [ B e5 ]  [ B e8 ] , [ Q e2 ]  Now black loses a pawn.
 [ K a2 ]  [ R a5 ]  [ R x a5 ] , [ N x a5 ]  Capablanca's last piece falls and it's all over but the shouting.
 [ Q h5 ] , [ B x f2 ]  That pawn finally falls.
 [ c6 ] , [ R c7 ]  first of three moves to win this pawn
 [ f5 ] , [ e6 ]  Another daring move by white! More and more interesting. I admit here that I missed RxB+ NxR fxR [ N x e4 ] with winning material advantage.
 [ R c f2 ] , [ N g5 ]  Was hoping for n x n q x n q x q and h x q. Rook endings are my favourite.
 [ Q g5 ]  [ Q x g5 ]  [ R x g5 ]  [ N d5 ] , [ N a6 ]  18. ...... [ N a6 ] - a developing move and a necessary one as white threatens to regain his rook.
 [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ e4 ]  [ B g7 ] , [ d4 ]  could be me black or white...
 [ B x e4 ] , [ B x c4 ]  of course he take back a pawn and threat my [ [ f1 ] ] rook but what about [ [ f1 ] ] [ d1 ] ? I will still threat the [ a8 ] rook and in addition threat [ d4 ] pawns. Isnt this position in advantage for me ?
 [ B x f3 + ]  [ N x f3 ] , [ R x f3 ]  saved checkmate and won another pawn materially back level but knight & pawns against connected rooks.
 [ B x f8 ] , [ B x f8 ]  White should have castled here even losing a pawn and freeing black's pieces.
 [ N c3 ]  [ Q e6 ]  [ N g5 ]  [ Q d7 ] , [ N g x e4 ]  Was this the right knight?
 [ N x e5 + ]  [ K e6 ]  [ N x g4 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ R f3 ]  [ b5 ] , [ N x h6 ]  White is cleaning up all of black's pawn's now.
 [ R x a4 ]  [ Q b6 ]  [ R a5 ]  [ e6 ]  [ g4 ]  [ N b8 ] , [ g5 ]  Resticting the bishop a little
 [ g4 ]  [ N x d4 ] , [ N x d4 ]  Same pin but now at least I have a little room to move......
 [ O-O ]  [ N h5 ] , [ N g e7 ]  To protect the c knight in order to enable the queen to move.
 [ N d2 ]  [ B e6 ] , [ O-O-O ]  taunting black's queen for a free pawn... i would love it to open up on the f file.
 [ g x h2 + ] , [ K h1 ]  This was the reason for choosing 16.[ Q f3 ] over 16.h3. The WK now gets to hide out on a light square behind a Black pawn. The pawn is nasty-looking but with no Black LSB on the board and his own Bishop on the h1-[ a8 ] diagonal White's King is actually pretty safe here.
 [ N x e5 ] , [ B c5 ]  taking pawn [ e4 ] was the least Black could do...
 [ e4 ]  [ B b4 ]  [ B d3 ] , [ O-O ]  After my 5º move I would have waited a little longer to castle!
 [ g6 ] , [ a3 ]  Computer analysis calls this an inaccuracy but I can't really see how to take advantage of this.
 [ R a b1 ]  [ R d2 ]  [ R b3 ]  [ R c2 ]  [ R b b1 ]  [ b6 ]  [ c x b6 ]  [ B x b6 ] , [ R b e1 ]  My opponent just shuffles the pieces which gives me an opportunity to improve my position. 33.[ R b e1 ] Big Blunder! Here I have R[ f x f2 ] and my opponent is forced to capture with rook unless they want to get checkmated. Then I have [ B x f2 + ] which makes me up a rook for a pawn!!!
 [ R b1 + ]  [ K e2 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ f3 ] , [ O-O ]  Black is taking advantage of White's poor development - just look at White's pieces stuck on the kingside!
 [ Q f6 ]  [ N g4 ] , [ Q g6 ]  How long will black ignore that bishop with its robes hiked up?
 [ R x a8 ]  [ N x c6 ]  [ R x f8 + ] , [ K x f8 ]  no i'm for a chance to win.
 [ R c8 ]  [ R b6 + ]  [ K d7 ]  [ R d5 + ] , [ K e8 ]  Harbouring faint hopes that white might play something like Bf3. But alas no Freddy did not wish to lose this encounter. maybe next time :P
 [ N e7 ]  [ b5 ]  [ O-O ]  [ b6 ]  [ R b8 ] , [ g4 ]  I should move the knight to C6 to threaten the pawn. Why don't I do this?
 [ K g3 ] , [ a5 ]  A run-away-train.
 [ K h7 ]  [ R c2 ]  [ N a4 ] , [ K f3 ]  Taking away my king from the second row I have a time more in order to make something on the g column. My position is very delicate due to the weak pawns on the a and c columns. Still rook [ g2 ] can give me something in addition to my king. But I must accept the penetration of his rook on my field...
 [ B a6 ] , [ c3 ]  ...and white did not spot the sneaky little move....[ B h6 ] ! Winning a piece and pawn for nothing...
 [ g x h3 ] , [ N c7 ]  Too late! The Knight may be there at the 5th move.
 [ e4 ] , [ N f6 ]  Alekhine defense. I never faced it so I tried to follow the main lines...
 [ Q c3 ] , [ a6 ]  the start of a winning march...
 [ Q e7 ] , [ N e4 ]  The bishop pair now support the pawns and the rooks are about to provide heavy backup. I could almost play this position without the queen it seems.
 [ Q g3 ] , [ f6 ]  this is the mistake in my opinion. Whould you did it ?
 [ R x e8 ] , [ g x f5 ]  Spells the end if it wasn't already.. [ B f4 ] is the best from a bad bunch (21. [ B f4 ] [ B d7 ] 22. [ N f3 ] Re2etc..)
 [ R e6 ]  [ N x h6 + ]  [ K h8 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ N g6 ]  [ N f5 ]  [ N f4 ] , [ a4 ]  36. [ a4 ] - passers must be pushed.
 [ K e1 ]  [ N x c2 + ] , [ K d2 ]  In this position it is unlikely that I will be able to win so I try to trick him into a draw by repetition. Note: my King was on [ d2 ] before I had played 18.Ke1. However he is going to see through it and my attempt is not going to work.
 [ b x c6 ] , [ B x c6 + ]  Forks Black's King and Rook. Should be marked 7.Bxc6+!!
 [ N x f6 ] , [ g x f6 ]  If [ Q x f6 ] ... [ B x b7 ] and white wins the exchange.
 [ d x c5 ]  [ b x c5 ] , [ B b5 + ]  A rather confusing move for black to respond to in blitz anyways. Goes against intuition to not lose material if a few seconds are spent observing the situation.
 [ N b6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ O-O ] , [ Q d2 ]  [Quite naturally White prepares to castle long and follow up with a typical kingside attack: [ B h6 ] h4–[ h5 ] etc.]
 [ N b4 ] , [ N x e6 ]  Not tempted by winning the exchange on [ h8 ] White tidies up the pawn and shuts off one of Black's King's escape squares.
 [ K f8 ] , [ Q d3 ]  Kosteniuk thought for some time whether to accept the bishop on [ f7 ] immediately and played the in between move next.
 [ e5 ] , [ Q x e5 ]  I play [ e5 ] to deflect the queen from [ f7 ] and he takes.
 [ B x g5 ]  [ b3 ]  [ R e f8 ]  [ g3 ]  [ f4 ]  [ g4 ] , [ Q d8 ]  Black probably got a little weak with the unorganized pawn structure but that is no reason to give up the game.
 [ B g2 ] , [ Q h5 ]  This creates a number of uncomfortable problems for white.
 [ N d2 ] , [ R c d1 ]  Again I have no idea what he was thinking here so I just kept challenging his pieces and moving in for the kill (checkmate.)
 [ c x b5 ]  [ B x a1 ] , [ b6 ]  In this position I know that I cannot take back due to her Queen. Therefore my goal is a promotion of some sort. Either a Queen or an underpromotion. What would the underpromotion be? A rook to replace the rook that I had lost. Of course I am not surprised with the fact that my opponent will not allow this. In chess just like regular life you always have to prepare for the unexpected and you cannot rely on him or her to make a mistake.
 [ K d7 ] , [ N f3 ]  [ N f3 ] to castle!
 [ Q x f1 + ]  [ B x f1 ]  [ R x f1 + ] , [ K g2 ]  The black rook is enprise and white still threatens mate so black resigned. Please comment and rate.
 [ R g5 + ] , [ K b4 ]  Avoiding the white bishop threatening the a pawn and positioning for further supporting those central pawns. The best king move in this position. Often finding the best position is not always a matter of calculation (although that is most often a big part of it) as it is in getting the most out of one's piece each move.
 [ e4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ d4 ] , [ d5 ]  I opened with the French Defense as Black.
 [ d x e7 + ]  [ K e8 ] , [ Q d8 # ]  Not exactly a classic for the ages but White follows thru on the basics.
 [ B x d3 ] , [ c x d3 ]  this capture is probably better after [ e x d3 ] the [ c4 ] pawn could be weak. But then I'd be able to attack the [ e3 ] pawn from the front so its possible this weakness wouldn't matter. Maybe I just wanted a chain of 6 pawns - it looks impressive!
 [ b6 ]  [ e3 ] , [ B b7 ]  This is an opening I've used when I first started playing chess but I've stopped using it because there are much better openings
 [ Q f6 ] , [ N g6 + ]  thats a naty discovert check and an attack against the queen.
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ a6 ]  This is the O'Kelly variation according to Wikipedia Chess Openings. "The idea is that 3.[ d4 ] runs into 3...cx[ d4 ] 4.Nx[ d4 ] [ N f6 ] 5.[ N [ c3 ] ] [ e5 ] when [ N b5 ] is prevented and Black will equalize by playing ...[ B b4 ] and ...[ d5 ] at some point. However after 3.[ c3 ] or 3.[ c4 ] it is unclear how 2...[ a6 ] has improved Black's position."
 [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ] , [ e x d5 ]  10. [ e x d5 ] - a pawn trade re-arranges the third rank configuration.
 [ N x d5 ] , [ c x d5 ]  Mission accomplished.
 [ e x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ] , [ O-O ]  Now that I look at it O-O WAS better than BxD5
 [ B x c6 + ]  [ b x c6 ]  [ R x e5 ]  [ Q x e5 ]  [ B x e5 ]  [ O-O ]  [ Q g4 ]  [ g6 ]  [ Q g5 ] , [ R a e8 ]  This move traps [ R f8 ] if white moves Bd6.
 [ N g4 ] , [ N h5 ]  I did not want to trade on [ g4 ] wanted [ h1 ] undefended... any comment here?
 [ N x e6 ]  [ f x e6 ]  [ B x e6 ] , [ Q e7 ]  Not liking the position Carl attacks my B. Of course the idea is catching up on developing.
 [ B e2 ]  [ e4 ]  [ N g1 ]  [ e3 ] , [ Q x e3 + ]  lucky that was check or i would have lost my rook
 [ Q h5 ]  [ Q x h5 ]  [ N x h5 ]  [ R e c1 ]  [ R x c3 ] , [ R x c3 ]  i now control the c-file.
 [ N g6 ]  [ e5 ] , [ N g8 ]  6. ...... [ N g8 ] - a necessary retreat.
 [ R f e8 ] , [ c4 ]  Tactical to drive the N off of b5.
 [ B h7 ] , [ c4 ]  Time for a fork. I was happy to see this and i thought i would have a better chance. I have been pushed around a bit so far.
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ f5 ]  ?! The Latvian Gambit. Generally considered somewhat dubious Black gives up a pawn and generally much more in exchange for open lines of attack and a lead in development.
 [ Q x d6 ] , [ R x d6 ]  My post-game analysis shows NxQ may have been better. One potential alternative could have gone as follows: 17. NxQ Reb8; 18. [ e5 ] Ndxe5; 19. [ B x b7 ]  [ a6 ] , [ N c3 ]  A knee-jerk reaction!! I think 19. [ B x b7 ] was better.
 [ e4 ] , [ N b6 ]  I played 11. [ N b6 ] here instead of Nf6. My idea is to stop annoying white [ B g5 ] as well I see the weakness of [ c4 ] square. And as well the benefit of [ N b6 ] my bishop indirectly pin white rook in [ a1 ]  [ b3 ] , [ f5 ]  I have a second thought for this move since it will create a weakness on my e6. But I don't want to let white to dominate the center which is very vital in a strategy and planning.
 [ Q e3 ] , [ N f6 ]  ...and develop its twin too.
 [ B d5 ] , [ N f6 ]  ?! The reason being is with this move but it's inaccurate. The reason is because it'll allow me to liquidate and this time double up his b pawns. Best was 8...[ N e5 ] or 8...Nb4.
 [ B d2 ]  [ Q e7 ] , [ e5 ]  I didn't see that...
 [ B d7 ] , [ N d b5 ]  an exicting idea but a bit too aggressive. The forced move for black [ Q b8 ] is actually not to bad because the queen is well position on the b8-[ h2 ] diagonal and can support pawn thrusts from safety. The disadvantage of [ Q b8 ] is that the A rook is going to be hard to develop.
 [ e x f4 ] , [ N x f4 ]  the best move; after [ B c6 ] we need Nd5...
 [ R a6 ] , [ R a5 ]  Make that two.
 [ K h1 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ B b3 ] , [ B a6 ]  Black tries to organize his forces for a counterblow. However Morphy's more aggresive pieces get there first.
 [ d3 ] , [ N c6 ]  I moved out my other knight to get ahead on development and to assert some control of the centre (although [ d5 ] and [ e4 ] are out of bounds). I must try not to overdevelop my knights though instead get out my bishops or even go in for some trades.
 [ Q b4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ Q d4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ B x b5 + ]  [ K d8 ]  [ Q x a4 ]  [ R x a4 ]  [ B x a4 ]  [ Q a6 ]  [ B b3 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ g x h5 ] , [ c4 ]  Well it's not over
 [ Q f4 ] , [ R f8 ]  Binding the queen.
 [ Q e7 ]  [ e3 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ Q x e5 ] , [ N c3 ]  Maybe 6.[ c4 ] is better?
 [ c6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ b5 ] , [ e5 ]  Being the game is OTB this move was more for irritational purposes and hopes of gaining full control of the centre.
 [ O-O ]  [ f4 ] , [ e5 ]  White can try to win the e pawn but after 7. [ f x e5 ] [ d x e5 ] 8. [ d x e5 ] [ N g4 ] and black will get the pawn back with an easy game.
 [ K d3 ]  [ N b2 + ]  [ K e2 ]  [ d4 ] , [ h4 ]  40. [ h4 ] - I do try and advance the pawn though but it is too little too late.
 [ g5 ]  [ N g3 ]  [ K f2 ]  [ N e4 + ]  [ K f3 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ Q f6 ]  [ N d5 ] , [ Q e5 ]  Sweet. Save the pawn push to when it will hurt. Does black respond?
 [ e4 ]  [ e6 ] , [ f4 ]  If not many people play it it may be because it is not good
 [ B x f3 ]  [ B x f3 ]  [ R g1 ] , [ B e7 ]  This leaves P[ g7 ] undefended.
 [ f4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ e3 ] , [ B g7 ]  Slow opening... but the agame heats up l;ater!
 [ Q g5 ] , [ R x f5 ]  (dieselengine9) Rxf5: trades his f pawn for my useless e pawn
 [ Q f3 ]  [ N x h1 ] , [ g3 ]  ! Of course I overlooked this so the R isn't free. But white still loses a R for N. Therefore it's a similar position to the first game against ION. Unlike there however I remembered it here and was not going to overlook something like that. The idea as kenneth_fiore said is that when teaching you must be cruel and not show lienence. That's how you learn. However since he is going to win my N in exchange regardless of what black does I will take on g3. By doing this I win an extra pawn in the process for the reason outlined.
 [ R f8 ]  [ Q g7 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ R x e8 + ] , [ Q x e8 ]  37. ..... [ Q x e8 ] - rook trade. It looks as though my [ h7 ] pawn is a gonner. But the WK is now a little bit exposed. Glenda and Fou Lenoir are both aware of this fact and it is handy that these two pieces can check the WK diagonally on the white and dark squares. Maybe picking up a WP in the process.
 [ B c4 ] , [ e6 ]  I was preparing for a d7-[ d5 ] launch on the white bishop.
 [ a x b5 ]  [ Q x b5 ]  [ Q x b5 ]  [ B x b5 ] , [ N a5 ]  A piece up I thought he'd want to exchange more pieces. I wasn't unhappy though because I thought the a and b pawns were going to prove very difficult to stop and therefore the more QS play the better.
 [ R x c7 ] , [ b3 ]  I am forced to move my queen so I know that I must keep my opponent in check with my queen until I can move my rook out all the while avoiding the easy checkmate of my king trapped behind the castle wall. I thought that this was a really good move by my opponent. I wasn't expecting it.
 [ Q g4 + ] , [ K d3 ]  The mate threat is now [ Q f8 ] if the R leaves.
 [ K g7 ] , [ R e6 ]  At first my attitude was that if he takes I'll take back. Can't happen because of how far up his Rook is.
 [ B h6 ]  [ N d3 ] , [ R e4 ]  Trying to prevent Nb4.
 [ a5 ]  [ B d2 ] , [ B f8 ]  24. ...... [ B f8 ] - necessary to avoid a knight fork on d6.
 [ Q x a1 + ]  [ K e2 ] , [ N a6 ]  I'm not sure why black played but I assume that Kieseritzky is planning to set up a mating with that piece combined with his [ B g1 ] and [ Q a1 ] but it's too little too late especially with Anderson's next move. And now it is safe to conclude that the game is lost for black because of the mating attack. Of more significance is that black won all of those pieces and being way ahead you'd think the opposite. But Anderson however had it all planned out which means that there is no way out of it.
 [ B b5 ] , [ a6 ]  rong move!!
 [ N x d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ Q x d2 + ]  [ K x d2 ]  [ N f4 ] , [ R a c1 ]  From now on White's play is direct and brutal. I would have played [ B f1 ] and followed it with Ke3. Kramnik has no truck with such sophisticated nuances and goes directly for the jugular.
 [ K f3 ]  [ c5 ]  [ R d2 ]  [ B b7 + ]  [ K e3 ]  [ B c6 ]  [ c4 ] , [ K e7 ]  The fortunes of both sides depend on them taking the initiative on the side on which they have a pawn majority. Black has not realized this or he would have played 30.… [ g x f4 + ] 31.[ K x f4 ] Rb8; White has but then fails to take advantage of Black’s passivity with 31.[ h4 ] (and if …gx[ h4 ] 32.Rh2).
 [ B x e6 ] , [ d4 ]  Establishing a center...
 [ c x d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ Q a5 + ] , [ N d2 ]  Other defenses are playable. Also 6.[ N c3 ] [ N x c3 ] that seems to lose the knight because white has the tactical move 7.Qd2! taking back material. I didn't like 6.[ Q d2 ] because I didn't want to exchange queens.
 [ c5 ] , [ N e2 ]  This is a line I like because it avoids any complications after 8. [ N f3 ] O-O followed by Bg4.
 [ Q x e3 ] , [ O-O ]  Ok what make now? * Key in chess - the soul - are pawns! So finding rupture points - crashes - with pawns open diagonals and columns improving activity of pieces. [ N c3 ] and [ B c4 ] are active and centralised. But rooks are not so happy... :( So f2-[ f4 ] advance will open f column and after this [ R f2 ] [ R a f1 ] and so on will touch all the kingside. Black will be in danger and probably will close [ B c4 ] with a future d6-[ d5 ] ([ B e6 ] etc.) will be the best option. But then [ R x f6 ] [ Q x h6 ] Rf3-[ g3 ] appears... uff! :-)
 [ Q x c2 ] , [ Q e8 ]  Now here we see a sort of unusual thing. The queen moving one square instead of two squares or across the entire board which she can do if allowed...
 [ B d8 ]  [ a4 ]  [ K e8 ]  [ a5 ]  [ B c7 ]  [ a6 ]  [ N x a6 ]  [ B x a6 ]  [ K d8 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ R b8 ]  [ R x b8 + ]  [ B x b8 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ f5 ]  [ B b6 + ] , [ K e7 ]  exhanging bishops may have been better here as black's bishop is now completely trapped and cannot be reached by his king.
 [ b5 ] , [ a5 ]  The queenside becomes locked up by black pawn to [ b5 ] and white moves pawn to a5. It looks like the action will be happening on the kingside.
 [ R e2 ] , [ B x f2 + ]  I get out of the pin.
 [ f4 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ B d3 ] , [ B x d3 ]  Exchange of bishops
 [ B d3 ]  [ B a5 + ]  [ N d2 ] , [ N b4 ]  Forking the bishop on [ d3 ] and the pawn on a2.
 [ K g2 ]  [ f5 ] , [ R f h1 ]  ! White drives me out yet again - the queen and bishop control the right diagonals here
 [ c6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ Q x e4 + ]  [ Q e2 ]  [ Q x d4 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ e4 ] , [ Q e3 ]  Black can afford trades especially if he ends up with a free bishop. Q[ x Q e3 + ] is highly recommended.
 [ Q x c7 ]  [ h6 ]  [ Q c8 + ]  [ K h7 ] , [ Q x a6 ]  After taking my pawn the chance for a draw was gone.
 [ N d2 ]  [ Q h4 ]  [ f3 ] , [ N f6 ]  The Knight is finally forced to retreat although 11... NxN was also feasable. However conceding the Bishop-pair is probably not a wise move at this stage.
 [ Q x e4 ] , [ N g5 ]  Right notion but an oversight in the execution forgetting that the knight was pinned against the rook. Now here's a thing that happens a lot in this game. Both sides are trying to play chess. This isn't random stuff. But in planning ahead (White is after that importunate Queen) both sides are apt to forget about what is happening immediately. This knight move uncovers the vulnerable Rook at h1. Note that White didn't try the desirable 10.[ B d3 ] as it was an illegal move (the bishop is pinned against the King)! The right move was 10.0-0! which kept alive both threats ([ B d3 ] and Ng5) by unpinning both pieces at once. So: 10.0-0 [ Q g6 ] 11.[ N e5 ] [ Q f6 ] (cutting his losses) 12.[ R x f6 ] winning Queen for Rook.
 [ Q x c2 ] , [ d x c4 ]  He wins the Knight back but at what price?
 [ R h f8 ] , [ B e3 ]  Offering my bishop in order to get my pawn structure fixed. Also a bit of a defensive move to defend the d pawn which could have been subject to a discovered attack by moving the knight on d5.
 [ B x e3 + ]  [ Q x e3 ]  [ R a d8 ]  [ R d2 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ R c d1 ]  [ K g7 ] , [ N d3 ]  Threatens [ N x e5 ] [ d x e5 ] seizing control of the file for now.
 [ B e2 ] , [ Q x d5 ]  Queen captures white pawn. I considered capturing with [ K f6 ] but opted for the Queen
 [ N b d2 ]  [ f5 ] , [ N x e4 ]  10. [ c4 ] ... this just hands the centre to black.
 [ B e7 ] , [ e5 ]  This pawn advance is perhaps premature
 [ e5 ] , [ N d5 ]  roneshet: [ [ c4 ] ] lets advance our pawn on more step while they wonder around with their knight. a_random_guy: 4.[ N f3 ] Pushing [ [ c4 ] ] now would give us a very weak [ [ [ d4 ] ] ] square later on so I wouldn't recommend it right away even if i does kick their Knight away again. The two main moves here are 4.[ [ [ d4 ] ] ] and 4.Nf3. I'll vote for the later but I really don't mind 4.[ [ [ d4 ] ] ] either. bluenoser: 4.[ N f3 ] I agree [ N f3 ] protecting our [ e5 ] pawn we have already pushed and making onother opening move.We will also gain our tempo back by them already moving their knight twice. roneshet: B[ [ c4 ] ] Maybe we can consider moving the bishop. though threatening the knight preparing for casteling and taking a good stand with the bishop. ptitroque: 4. [ N f3 ] Most natural move
 [ O-O ]  [ B e2 ]  [ b4 ] , [ N b1 ]  this kind of play will not get White anywhere...
 [ K x h7 ] , [ N x f6 + ]  Black can't capture the knight as his king is checked by the bishop as well. He could play 12. ... [ K h8 ] but then White plays 13. Ng6#. Black has only one other option.
 [ R g8 ]  [ R h3 ]  [ B g4 ] , [ R g3 ]  One move that might be fun for white is Nb5. Should black be foolish enough to respond with Q[ x N b5 ] white answers with [ B a4 ] pinning the black queen against the king. If black makes some other move (besides the king) white can play [ N c7 + ] forking the [ a8 ] rook.
 [ Q e5 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O-O ]  [ N e2 ] , [ N d4 ]  This is mistake. Black considered the move 12.[ c4 ] as invitation to occupy the point [ d4 ] by the knight and got into the trap created by the move 14. Ne2. No black don't loose any material but they loose strong position in the center their pieces have to retreat. If black played 14... [ Q c5 + ] 15. [ K h2 ] [ h5 ] white had difficulties in the center and also had to defend his position in the king's wing. But now white's advantage becomes obvious.
 [ R h6 + ]  [ K e5 ]  [ B x b5 ]  [ Q b1 ]  [ a4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ B c6 ]  [ K e4 ]  [ R h4 + ]  [ K e5 ]  [ B e8 ]  [ Q b8 ]  [ R h8 ]  [ Q b6 ]  [ R h6 ]  [ Q b8 ] , [ B g6 ]  great defensive move by him
 [ d4 ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N g e7 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ B b6 ] , [ B g5 ]  This move isn't in the GK database.
 [ K d8 ] , [ R b x a7 ]  Back on track.
 [ K x b8 ]  [ K e4 ]  [ K c7 ]  [ h4 ] , [ K c6 ]  It was here I realised I had miscalculated and a draw was agreed. Thanks for reading please comment
 [ B x f5 ]  [ h5 ] , [ B d3 ]  Threatening 37...[ B c4 ] attacking d- and a-pawns. But the real motive is to commit the rook to preventing that happening whereat the Black King might yet effect an escape.
 [ Q x g7 ]  [ R d5 ]  [ Q a1 + ]  [ K h2 ]  [ K g8 ]  [ R x d8 ]  [ R x d8 ]  [ Q x d8 + ]  [ K g7 ]  [ Q d4 + ]  [ Q x d4 ] , [ R x d4 ]  black resign finally
 [ N c6 ] , [ O-O ]  [ d5 ] is a highly devious alternative at this point with the potential for several juicy exchanges.
 [ K x c4 ]  [ R d8 ] , [ R h6 + ]  Of course not [ N x d4 ] -> Ra4.
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B b5 ] , [ N d4 ]  Now he responds in a very interesting way that I have not seen before. I am used to something like 3...[ a6 ] after the Ruy Lopez but not this move.
 [ R g7 ] , [ N f8 ]  Black resigns here. Black can avoid mate with 30...[ R x f8 ] 31.[ Q x f8 + ] [ R g8 ] 32.[ R x g8 + ] [ Q x g8 ] 33.[ Q x g8 + ] [ K x g8 ] but loses too much material in the process.
 [ N g7 ] , [ Q d2 ]  (!?) Bolstering the bishop and with the idea that the Q might eventually gain access to h6. The Q-move also enables the long castling or at least bringing the a1-rook into play...
 [ B c4 ]  [ Q a5 ] , [ N f5 ]  This is a critical move for white as it is the only move that can protects white center pawn which is the only thing keeping black from dominating the center board.
 [ Q e2 ]  [ R c7 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ R e7 ] , [ R e3 ]  40mins. remaining.
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ] , [ N x d4 ]  Standard Sicilian play.
 [ B e7 ]  [ Q d2 ] , [ b5 ]  As the development of White comes to an end [Black has yet to castle and connect rooks but his position seems solid enough at this point] Black has ambitions of queenside pawn expansion...
 [ B g3 ] , [ g4 ]  and even more so with this?
 [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ c3 ]  [ d3 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ B x d3 ] , [ N f6 ]  Not a good position for black I guess. white has four pieces out against 2 for black
 [ R x d2 ]  [ B x d2 ]  [ g2 ] , [ b4 ]  look at this...
 [ h x g3 ]  [ Q h5 + ] , [ N h2 ]  ? [ N h4 ] allows white to survive for a longer time but I believe I still have a forced mate.
 [ K b5 ]  [ f4 ]  [ K a6 ] , [ Q b8 ]  Maybe it I can move my king he'll forget about that pawn...
 [ B x f3 ] , [ B x f3 ]  now an attack on [ h5 ] could be refuted
 [ c5 ] , [ c4 ]  Turning up the heat on Black's central pawns.
 [ R d f1 ]  [ Q x h3 ]  [ g3 ]  [ R x g3 + ]  [ f x g3 ] , [ Q x g3 + ]  I donot know why I took this piece...
 [ K x c7 ]  [ R x a6 ]  [ R b8 ]  [ R a7 + ] , [ K d8 ]  ...[ K c6 ] might have been slightly better with the possibility of supporting the c-pawn; the king will now be cut off on the back rank.
 [ N e6 ]  [ d x e5 ] , [ Q x e5 ]  14. ..... [ Q x e5 ] - another set of pawns have been exchanged but there is still my kingside pawn majority!
 [ e4 ]  [ c6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e5 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ O-O ]  [ h6 ]  [ N b d2 ]  [ N e7 ]  [ a4 ] , [ c5 ]  Alternative variation: 8... [ Q c7 ] 9. [ N b3 ] O-O-O $13
 [ Q e2 ] , [ R d8 ]  Defending my weakest link the d-pawn.
 [ B x b3 ] , [ a x b3 ]  Now I am a pawn up with more space.
 [ R e1 ] , [ e x d4 ]  expected
 [ e5 ]  [ N d b5 ] , [ N x e4 ]  This was an early morning blunder. For some reason I thought I could answer 7 N[ x N e4 ] with [ Q a5 + ] and then QxNb5--completely overlooking the fact [ N b5 ] was defended by Bf1. I even programmed it.
 [ e3 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ c3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N b d2 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ N e4 ] , [ Q h5 ]  The first outburst.
 [ B b5 ]  [ R e7 ]  [ c4 ] , [ B g4 ]  black is technically playing without two pieces.
 [ d3 ] , [ R x f5 + ]  ...but instantly loses it.
 [ a5 ] , [ a3 ]  Preventing the Bishop from getting trapped (by 12...[ b5 ] 13.[ B b3 ] a4).
 [ h x g5 ]  [ R x g5 ] , [ Q d6 ]  Simultaneously protecting the bishop and activating the queen for possible counterplay.
 [ N c6 ] , [ d5 ]  Developing pieces can wait. As usual I am anxious to push central pawns unchallenged into my opponent's territory.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ f5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ e x f5 ]  [ B c5 ] , [ N g5 ]  Here white is prepared to launch an attack on the Kingside with his Queen two minor pieces and his f pawn. I'll try to fight him off...this is going to be messy...
 [ N f6 ] , [ B g5 ]  And now we arrive at the Richter-Rauzer Attack.
 [ R g8 + ]  [ K c7 ]  [ K e7 ]  [ K b6 ]  [ d8 = Q + ]  [ K c6 ]  [ Q d7 + ]  [ K b6 ]  [ R c8 ]  [ K a5 ]  [ Q b7 ]  [ K a4 ] , [ R a8 # ]  Really an interesting game to see how a small mistake can take a probable draw into a loss.
 [ c x d5 ] , [ e x d5 ]  Black has done well in the openning and has come out of it with an approximate equality.
 [ f5 ] , [ g5 ]  22. ..... [ g5 ] - the first action of Operation Joblock. A pawn advances to close up my position.
 [ Q e3 ]  [ N d f6 ] , [ B x e4 ]  now white gives up his good bishop to take off the [ e4 ] knight just to find that the [ f6 ] knight takes it's place.
 [ B g2 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ N c3 ]  Reversed move order but position now is the same as Reversed Rossolimo (1.[ c4 ] [ e5 ] 2.[ g3 ] [ N c6 ] 3.[ N c3 ] [ N f6 ] 4.Bg2) expecting [ B b4 ] from Black to continue this.
 [ B g2 ] , [ N c6 ]  I bring out my LB to [ g2 ] and where it has the diagonal [ h1 ] to [ a8 ] to keep an eye on. Black develops his b knight to c6.
 [ e5 ]  [ N b7 ]  [ h4 ]  [ K g2 ]  [ f4 ] , [ e4 + ]  Fixes the black pawn at [ e5 ] where it will be a target. White wants some passed pawns too.
 [ R x c7 ]  [ R f6 ] , [ B d3 ]  ...or Pc3. I prefer [ R x a7 ] here as Pc3's advance is blocked. White can then promote P[ b3 ] which enjoys a pretty clear path.
 [ K d8 ]  [ N x a8 ]  [ N g f6 ]  [ f3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ R e8 + ]  [ K d1 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ h3 ]  [ K d7 ] , [ R e4 ]  White is very cramped. He decides to move the rook into play.
 [ K h7 ]  [ R c6 c5 ] , [ f5 ]  30. .......... f5? I think black should have given that a pawn a little more back up. Note that the dark squared bishop is PINNED!
 [ B f6 ]  [ b4 ]  [ h3 ]  [ K c2 ]  [ h x g4 ]  [ h x g4 ]  [ R e4 ]  [ b3 ]  [ R x g4 ] , [ K b1 ]  Here it seems after making the move Black had enough for the day.
 [ g x f3 ]  [ N f4 ]  [ B g4 ] , [ R d g1 ]  Now that white's rooks are connected they can freely move to properly position for an attack.
 [ R x e5 + ] , [ K f8 ]  Look at the position. material is even White attacks king where king feels littel bit unsafe Black's king rook is trapped in cage but he does little work too defending the king Black's queenside pawn structure give black winning endgame advantage.
 [ B c4 ] , [ e6 ]  The Philidor Variation with 2. [ B c4 ] considered inferior to Main Close Morra Gambit and Wing Gambit but I have seen it several times in maybe at most a couple dozen games where I have played the Sicilian as black. Maybe it has lots of hits in the GK DataBase?
 [ B x d5 ] , [ B e3 ]  I was holding my breath hoping that he would take with 17 Qxd5. He didn't make that move but this one is not so good either. It does connect his rooks which is always a plus in development but it doesn't add much attack value with where he placed it. More damning however it will also cost him his knight for free. If he re-takes very bad things happen. The better move here for white would have been to put the knight on [ g5 ] followed up by [ R d1 ] breaking my chance to exchange with the knight and earning a bishop for the pawn I took on d5. (thanks kingcruel)
 [ d x c5 ]  [ B x f3 ] , [ e x f3 ]  Now black is under mate situation or losing queen if they take move [ Q x c5 ] what black did
 [ B x f4 ]  [ c6 ] , [ B e5 ]  White could have gone for the check here with 17. [ N g5 + ] [ K h8 ] 18. [ B e5 ] (pinning the N) leaving Black with few options to prevent 19. BxN+ RxB 20. [ R h7 + + ] But here White plays the pin ahead fo time.
 [ e6 ]  [ c x d5 ] , [ N f6 ]  living the e pawn to take irresistible temptation ! Then black will stay with a BIG HOLE in the center.
 [ K c7 ]  [ B x c5 ]  [ h3 ] , [ K e6 ]  Keep the white king away from the black pawns. If 47. [ K d8 ] [ f5 ] 48. [ K e8 ] [ B e7 ] traps the white king. Black is free to play a 3-on-2 pawn endgame as long as he doesn't kill both white pawns and end in an immediate stalemate.
 [ e4 ] , [ N f6 ]  I don't often meet Alekhine's Defence. The idea of the opening is for Black to encourage White to overreach himself and then to strike back exploiting the holes in White's defences. So in planning to meet it White either has to guard against over-exuberance or make sure that his attack wins quickly - not an option against a decent player of the Black pieces.
 [ g3 ] , [ h4 ]  starting an attack on the kingside
 [ R g6 ]  [ R x h4 ]  [ R x f6 ]  [ R e h1 ]  [ K g8 ]  [ R h1 h3 ]  [ K f8 ] , [ R h4 x h7 ]  Prokofiev's doubled Rooks threaten to penetrate the Black position.
 [ N c6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ B d7 ] , [ B x c6 ]  I'm not so sure about this trade to be honest though I guess white envisioned this becoming a more closed game where knights would be better than bishops. Also black's light-square bishop is technically a bad bishop but so is white's dark-squared one.
 [ N c6 ] , [ B b5 ]  Pinning the N seems a satisfactory alternative to Qg4.
 [ N x e4 ]  [ N x e4 ] , [ B x e4 ]  And easy mate in 1
 [ R g5 ]  [ R f d8 ] , [ R x h5 + ]  26. [ R x [ h5 ] + ] - the weak [ h5 ] pawn drops off.
 [ B d2 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ R b1 ] , [ B g7 ]  finally fianchetto...
 [ N c6 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ B g4 ]  There goes my plan.
 [ B h6 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ B x e3 ]  [ f x e3 ]  [ R x e3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B x d3 ]  [ B x d3 ]  [ R x d3 ]  [ R f2 ]  [ N d7 ] , [ b4 ]  Taking his queen out of action. Most likely Qa3. Then I will play [ R b3 ]  [ Q x a3 ] , [ R b3 ]  Forces him to sac his queen or his rook. Protected in all sides
 [ Q f3 ]  [ Q a5 ] , [ R x d5 ]  ??? You crazy ?? I see no threat !!!
 [ Q c1 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ N b d2 ]  [ e6 ] , [ N h4 ]  I decide that I want the [ d3 ] square for my bishop
 [ e4 ] , [ c5 ]  Team Match I play black and opt for the Sicilian vs. the Open Game.
 [ B h8 ] , [ g4 ]  Advancing on the king side since black can't counter in the center or get active play on the queen side.
 [ B e3 ] , [ R f2 + ]  I will have it soon enought though Forcd mate in 2 -35. [ K c1 ] Only move [ B x e3 + ] 36 [ K b1 ] (only move) [ R x d1 ]  [ K c1 ]  [ B x e3 + ]  [ K b1 ] , [ R x d1 # ]  Though I did pretty well with the calculations did I miss any other moves?
 [ N c3 ] , [ B g4 ]  That allows me to counterattack early. A common response might be [ f3 ] but ...
 [ Q b6 ]  [ a4 ]  [ b4 ]  [ a5 ]  [ Q a7 ] , [ N a4 ]  12. [ N a4 ] - I am just starting to come out of the database here. Black's pieces are rather tied up on the queenside but somehow I just do not take full advantage of this.
 [ f5 ] , [ e x d5 ]  Black advances the wall and White has had enough and moves to break it.
 [ Q e4 + ]  [ K g3 ]  [ Q e6 ]  [ K h4 ] , [ Q f6 ]  66. Qf6? - this move throws away the win and brings the match to a dramatic finish.
 [ B x b4 ]  [ Q x c2 ]  [ B x a5 + ]  [ K c8 ] , [ b4 ]  and now after spending the game simply catching up with lost material Black has pulled ahead
 [ B g5 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ g4 ]  [ h6 ] , [ B x f6 ]  already a piece down black continues to trade. better is 14.[ B h4 ] or 14.[ B c1 ] .... 15.Bb2. This mistaken trade makes it impossible to recover from the lost N.
 [ Q x f4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ] , [ Q x d4 ]  Black has the freer game plus an extra pawn.
 [ N f3 ] , [ Q g4 ]  The great escape continues but I have spacial and material advantage at this point
 [ K e2 ]  [ R d5 ]  [ N d2 ]  [ R e5 + ]  [ K f2 ] , [ K g6 ]  Maybe 40...[ R e5 ] wasn't such a good move. 40...[ R f5 ] was probably better.
 [ h x g5 ] , [ N x g5 ]  There we go. He may think he has an attack with queen to H7 but the game is wrapping up.
 [ N c3 ]  [ Q f2 + ]  [ K d1 ]  [ Q x e3 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ R x d4 + ]  [ B d3 ]  [ R x d3 + ]  [ K c2 ] , [ R x c3 + ]  Dbl. check white has to move the king.
 [ B h4 ] , [ Q c6 ]  Applying pressure on [ g2 ] easily defended by several options.
 [ K c6 ] , [ Q a5 ]  Capturing on [ e4 ] seemed more complicated. It might have been a little more efficient but it would allow black's king to try and nurse his last pawn to promotion on the a-file. Instead for simpicity's sake white simply brought the queen over to the a-file where she can kill the a-pawn leaving the e-pawn for the white king to capture.
 [ B x c6 ] , [ Q e2 ]  Finishing Developing
 [ e x d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ B b6 ] , [ N x b6 ]  No real reason for the exchange of a strong knight for a weak bishop but I see the possibility of exposing a pin against black's knight at c6.
 [ c4 ]  [ R b d8 ]  [ R f1 ] , [ R d4 ]  28. ....... [ R d4 ] - I am planning some dirty work at the crossroads for Alex preparing to double on the d column and put Alex's back rank under the hammer.
 [ N x e4 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ Q d5 ]  [ N g3 ]  [ R e1 ] , [ O-O ]  castling under pressure...
 [ B f3 ]  [ R d h5 ]  [ B x h1 ]  [ R x h1 ]  [ R a8 ]  [ B b2 ]  [ f6 ]  [ f5 ]  [ K f7 ]  [ B d4 ]  [ h5 ]  [ K e2 ]  [ h4 ]  [ R h3 ]  [ R a g8 ]  [ B f2 ]  [ R g2 ]  [ K f3 ]  [ R g5 ]  [ K f4 ]  [ R g2 ]  [ K f3 ]  [ R g5 ]  [ K f4 ]  [ R h h5 ]  [ B x h4 ]  [ R g x f5 + ]  [ K g4 ]  [ K g6 ]  [ B e1 ]  [ R f g5 + ]  [ K f4 ] , [ R x h3 ]  White Resigns
 [ N x d4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N d b5 ] , [ N f6 ]  First serious misstake. I'm in trouble already and this makes it worse.
 [ h4 ] , [ c5 ]  this is always my first move if i am black
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ N c3 ]  We begin with the Three Knights Opening. You couldn't call this an Attack rather it's a non-committal debut that keeps White's options open. Possibly the downside is that it keeps Black's options open as well.
 [ K g2 ] , [ B h6 ]  I wasn't really sure what to do here so I just developed my last piece and threatened his queen keeping all of my attacking possibilities in the air for now.
 [ b4 ]  [ N a4 ]  [ N b5 ]  [ c4 ]  [ b x c3 ]  [ e ]  [ p ]  [ N x c3 ]  [ N x d4 ] , [ Q x d4 ]  Black just needs to exchange all White's pieces off to consolidate his lead.
 [ e x f4 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ d5 ]  I knew how to play this opening well but I lack the experience in playing it.
 [ f5 ]  [ K c6 ] , [ Q g4 ]  ?! perhaps I should have played [ f x e6 ] [ f x e6 ] [ B g6 ] but I liked this move because it stalls the bishops development by at least a move or two and he now must react to my threat of fxe6.
 [ f x e5 ] , [ Q c6 ]  black is trying to create a passed d pawn by forcing exchanges on [ e4 ] and as black isn't pressuring the e pawn i decide to try to hold on to it which i can do now as black has neglected to put pressure on it
 [ N x e2 ] , [ O-O ]  I would like to play [ N b4 ] and if needed [ R c8 ] to beat up on that backward pawn on c2. But white can shrug that off easily enough so I put it on a back burner for now and think defensively. My bishop on [ g7 ] needs support if I am ever going to open the long diagonal by moving my knight.
 [ Q x e1 ]  [ h4 ]  [ B x f4 ] , [ g x f4 ]  I decide to open up the g-file a long-dreamed of plan which looks good.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ] , [ f4 ]  King's gambit... tricky opening as the game will show it.
 [ f3 ] , [ Q f4 ]  !? Black uses the threat of a Q exchange to advance.
 [ O-O ] , [ Q c2 ]  now I expect [ g6 ] [ Q c7 ] is also possible...
 [ B x e2 ]  [ Q x e2 ] , [ B g7 ]  White has a variety of good moves here including 19. [ Q c2 ] 19. [ N e6 ] and 19. Rfe1. Also good is ...
 [ B d5 ] , [ K x g6 ]  I win the knight (but probably should have used the bishop)
 [ R x e5 ]  [ B b2 ]  [ R e7 + ]  [ R f6 f7 ]  [ R x f7 + ]  [ R x f7 ]  [ K d2 ]  [ d4 ] , [ c4 ]  ?! this loses two pawns instead of one with 38.[ c x d4 ] [ B x d4 ] when the [ f2 ] pawn must fall since 39.[ K e2 ] loses the queenside pawns after 39...[ B c3 ]  [ B c3 + ]  [ K e2 ]  [ B x b4 ]  [ R g4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ f4 ]  [ B x a5 ]  [ K f3 ]  [ b5 ]  [ c x b5 ] , [ a x b5 ]  Black now has two extra pawns but he should win.
 [ K d3 ]  [ R x a3 + ]  [ K c4 ]  [ K e6 ]  [ N d8 + ]  [ K d7 ]  [ N f7 ] , [ R a4 + ]  to me i think that this a draw.
 [ B x f6 ] , [ Q c2 ]  Black did not earn his good rating by falling for simple threats like this; Whites hope was purely to force Black to weaken his own pawn structure in his Kings Castle; it is difficult for me to see how he could avoid doing so.
 [ R x f7 ] , [ N g5 ]  Threatening both rooks.
 [ K a2 ]  [ K c3 ]  [ K a3 ]  [ b4 + ]  [ K a2 ] , [ b3 + ]  ?? - Blunder. I believe I had this setup in a conditional sequence having calculated thing incorrectly. Here's an example of correct play. Black maintains opposition and controls white's moves to ensure control of [ b1 ] and a successful queening: 57. [ K a2 ] [ K c2 ] 58. [ K a1 ] [ K [ b3 ] ] 59. K[ b1 ] [ K a3 ] 60. [ K a1 ] [ b3 ] 61. K[ b1 ] [ b2 ] 62. [ K c2 ] [ K a2 ]  [ K b1 ] , [ K b4 ]  ?? - Blunder. johnforteen6 pointed out that I should have played 58...[ b2 ] forcing white to a2. I don't have any excuse for missing this. It was part of a conditional sequence I'd setup the night before and I assume that I overlooked it during analysis by skipping the sequence.
 [ c5 ] , [ N d6 ]  So I have to mobilize to corner his king and mate him now that I have given him an out
 [ B x e3 ] , [ f x e3 ]  Alternative variation: 27. [ N c7 ] [ B d7 ] 28. [ R e4 ] [ R c8 ] 29. [ R x e3 ] [ N c5 ] $19
 [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ B g7 ] , [ B e2 ]  His pawns point to my kingside so I can expect a kingside attack.
 [ R e a1 ]  [ Q e7 ]  [ B b1 ]  [ B e8 ]  [ N e2 ]  [ N d8 ] , [ N h2 ]  Now we see that controlling the open a-file was not White's only aim. He now opens a second front: by playing [ f4 ] he will transfer the weight of the action to the kingside.
 [ B c4 ]  [ N d5 ] , [ B x d5 ]  I didnt anticipate the following defense combo
 [ N g5 ] , [ N h6 ]  This seemed the best way to defend against the attack.
 [ Q x f7 + ] , [ K g5 ]  Forced.
 [ N f6 ] , [ N f3 ]  my opponent apparently avoiding the nimzo that means [ e6 ] wont be too good idea- [ d5 ] will be better
 [ N x h6 + ] , [ K h8 ]  17...[ K h7 ] makes no difference.
 [ h6 ]  [ B x f6 ] , [ g x f6 ]  Personally I consider this a mistake. While the king's defenses are opened after 9...[ Q x f6 ] 10.[ Q x f6 ] [ g x f6 ] anyway in that position it is far less dangerous since the queens are off. This gives an open route to the black king and blocks the queen off from defense.
 [ N e5 ] , [ B d5 ]  Of course I have to keep my bishop.
 [ B e7 ] , [ b4 ]  Now my advantage is less than half a point but I wanted to open up the Queenside and use my better placed pieces to attack
 [ b5 ]  [ B d5 ]  [ R b8 ] , [ B c6 ]  Here I was thinking along the lines of 8. ... [ B b6 ] 9. [ d5 ] followed by 10 [ B e3 ] attacking the rook which only has one place to go [ b8 ] whereupon [ B a7 ] wins the exchange. No this isn't forced. I was only hoping for it while at the same time I'm pinning the knight on [ d7 ] and binding black's pieces.
 [ h4 ] , [ Q g4 ]  I'm going to lose a pawn but material doesn't matter that much in an opposite colored bishop endgame.
 [ B c2 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N b d2 ]  [ R e8 ] , [ N f1 ]  12. [ N f1 ] - this position is gradually becoming like a middle game Lopez position. Chris gave me the Lopez a few years ago and thumped me a few moves out of the DB. I just hope I can improve on this.
 [ N x f4 ] , [ B x f3 ]  This sequence of exchanges...
 [ a4 ] , [ B x a4 ]  Ill advised. [ B c2 ] would have been much better.
 [ N g e2 ] , [ B g4 ]  I now develop my g knight to [ e2 ] and black develops his LB to g4. We are now both ready to castle.
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ] , [ B f4 ]  Queen's pawn Mason variation.
 [ B f2 ] , [ b2 ]  Now he is threatening ...Bc2. So I give hi something to worry about with [ d6 ] after which he must play ...[ K f8 ]  [ d6 ] , [ K f8 ]  Next I am going to activate the bishop through tempoing the queen.
 [ N b6 ]  [ c x b7 ]  [ N a4 ]  [ b8 = Q + ]  [ Q x b8 ]  [ Q x a4 ]  [ Q b1 + ]  [ Q d1 ]  [ Q b4 ]  [ g3 ]  [ f6 ]  [ Q c2 ]  [ Q b6 ]  [ Q c6 ]  [ Q x c6 ]  [ d x c6 ]  [ K f7 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ K e7 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ K d6 ]  [ f4 ]  [ g5 ]  [ K f2 ]  [ K c5 ]  [ K e3 ]  [ h6 ]  [ e5 ]  [ f x e5 ]  [ f x e5 ]  [ K d5 ]  [ e6 ]  [ K d6 ] , [ K e4 ]  Black resigns.
 [ B c3 ]  [ N e6 ]  [ K e2 ] , [ h5 ]  30. ........ [ h5 ] - to prevent g4.
 [ R e1 ] , [ N d7 ]  Protecting the bishop as my attack's plan was based on its later protection for queen.
 [ K e4 ]  [ N a4 ]  [ K d4 ]  [ N b2 ]  [ R f3 ]  [ N a4 ]  [ R e3 ]  [ N b2 ]  [ K e4 ]  [ N a4 ]  [ K f3 ] , [ K a3 ]  This foils my plan. After ...K-[ K7 ] White would play K-[ N2 ] and I could never approach.
 [ a4 ]  [ a5 ]  [ g4 ]  [ h6 ]  [ B g3 ] , [ c5 ]  24. ...... [ c5 ] - pawn break.
 [ Q x e8 + ] , [ K f2 ]  The hunt is on. But there are things I must be careful of. I have to keep pressure on the king so White does not move the queen knight and join his rooks together.
 [ c3 ]  [ O-O ] , [ d4 ]  I decided to go ahead and test the center.
 [ c5 ]  [ K f7 ]  [ K f1 ]  [ K e7 ]  [ K e2 ] , [ b6 ]  27. .......... [ b6 ] - challenging white's imposing pawn roll on the queenside and preventing the standard pawn breakthrough which could occur should white play a5. The queenside pawn structure will soon be locked - this is a good thing to me as the white king will not be able to get through - Henry can therefore handle what is to come on the kingside.
 [ d x c4 ] , [ B x c4 ]  White is ahead in development and space.
 [ B x f4 ]  [ Q e6 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ B c7 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ R x d5 ] , [ B f6 ]  White threatens checkmate forcing Black to make another defensive move.
 [ R a7 ] , [ B x e3 ]  Is there a better move here? I can't find one although I certainly don't like the text because it allows White's pieces to spring to life again.
 [ B a3 ]  [ c3 ]  [ d x c3 ] , [ R c5 ]  24. Rc5?? trashes the rook and loses offence and defence.
 [ e3 ] , [ B g4 ]  Black keeps chugging right along and makes another good move. I remind myself that over-confidence has taken down players far better than I and that I should now double my efforts and start playing chess. No one is gonna just give me a point.
 [ R d4 ]  [ c5 ] , [ R e4 ]  Black can gain temporary counterplay but is not able to gain solid play.
 [ R d1 ] , [ Q g4 ]  27. ..... [ Q g4 ] - again keeping the back row under the hammer but now Freddy launches his attack and that is successful ...... for him sigh!
 [ h3 ] , [ N x e3 ]  begining of the end
 [ B d7 ] , [ B d5 ]  hitting the weak [ f7 ] pawn and preventing [ B e6 ] and also protecting b3.
 [ Q g4 + ] , [ K h2 ]  As good a spot as any.
 [ b7 ]  [ R x b7 ]  [ h3 ]  [ g x h3 ]  [ g4 + ] , [ K x g4 ]  
 [ Q b3 ] , [ R c8 ]  Oops. Black may not be able to hold onto all that he's won. Maybe those pieces are just a tad overextended.
 [ N x g5 ] , [ R f3 f4 ]  There is no good move.
 [ B d7 ] , [ O-O ]  11. 0-0 - although I do create a balance of king safety and attack on enemy king.
 [ R d8 ]  [ g6 ]  [ R x d5 ] , [ f5 ]  from here its an easy endgame
 [ b3 ] , [ c x d4 ]  Opening up the c file and the position in general. This is always good when you have the bishop pair as bishops thrive in open positions whereas knights love closed positions.
 [ N e5 ]  [ B b3 ]  [ N b d7 ] , [ a3 ]  I can't remember why I made this move.
 [ N f3 ] , [ g5 ]  [ g5 ] is an important reponse to the gambit black isnt going to be half hearted and the gambit is going to be tested.
 [ K e2 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ Q x g4 + ]  [ K e1 ]  [ Q g1 + ]  [ K e2 ]  [ Q g2 + ]  [ K e1 ] , [ N f3 # ]  Nf3#. Could I do something to avoid this? Thanks for reading and comment!
 [ B d3 ]  [ N e6 ] , [ N b3 ]  15.[ B d3 ] [ N e6 ] 16.Nb3! ... CM is now on the defensive and this move correctly anticipates my intended maneuver of bringing the knight to c5.
 [ K f2 ] , [ B x c6 ]  White gets out of check and black finally realizes he has a free capture on the board. This is the point where white resigned facing overwhelming material deficit (bishop and two pawns) with no way to prevent promotion (black's bishop controls both promotion squares of his two passed pawns). I don't know if this was Hercules' finest hour (in GameKnot anyway) but it's a good solid win and for the most part well played.
 [ R x d2 ] , [ B x d2 ]  I was rather surprised at this move I assumed he'd take the queen but instead he tried to launch an attack at my weak base.
 [ R c8 + ]  [ K h7 ] , [ Q c2 + ]  This forces a Queen trade and gets into an endgame
 [ N f3 ] , [ f6 ]  Hitting at the front of the pawn chain since the base is unassailable. Here it's even more effective since the early [ N f3 ] blocks the f-pawn. Ideally White would like to support [ e5 ] with f2-[ f4 ] but often White makes this concession for the sake of rapid kingside development. Black's 5...[ f6 ] is well-timed here.
 [ N x d3 + ] , [ Q x d3 ]  I certainly didn't mind that trade it brought my queen out.
 [ R d g8 ] , [ K f1 ]  Now instead of long castling I am forced to defend with my king! Uh oh!
 [ N b4 c6 ]  [ Q c2 ] , [ f6 ]  That's when I figured out that he was trying to put an overwhelming pressure against my K side. A N B and the Q all working together on the K side tells me an important. Which is that he's got threats that could be overwhelming if I'm not careful. So to prevent that kind of nonsense I play this. I'm also keeping in mind that he intends to exchange pawns which I'm not afraid since that's not part of the overall picture.
 [ Q d6 ]  [ d3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ c6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ B g4 ] , [ O-O-O ]  king to safety and focusing on his king side
 [ Q x c6 ]  [ N d6 ] , [ R x c7 ]  [ g f b3 ] does a great job of punishing black for their mistakes in recent moves. Black's board position is terrible here.
 [ Q h3 ] , [ N e3 ]  Perhaps I have survived his sandstorm.
 [ d5 ]  [ K e5 ]  [ d6 ] , [ R d7 ]  Now if [ c6 ] [ R x d6 ] wins both pawns. 51...Rc6?? of course would have been met by 52.d7!
 [ R f8 ] , [ R e d1 ]  White having more attacks though a pawn down
 [ c x d4 ] , [ e x d4 ]  My queenside keeps closed. It is supposed to be the shield for my king after o-o-o.
 [ B f3 ]  [ Q f4 ] , [ N e7 + ]  Keeping the King in his corner.
 [ Q h6 ]  [ R c8 ] , [ R f3 ]  Black should contest the c-file with [ R c1 ] instead of trying to mate on [ h7 ] which is impossible because of [ N g5 ] or simply moving the king to [ f8 ] after Qh7+.
 [ b x c3 ] , [ N b3 ]  This was the idea to survive.
 [ N a5 ]  [ K d3 ]  [ N c4 ] , [ R a b1 ]  whites rook on [ b1 ] is in very unpleasente position however even after 24.b3-[ N a5 ] whites position wasnt get better at all.
 [ N x f7 + ] , [ K e8 ]  16...Ke8?? this is clearly weaker than 16...Ke7. Now i can fork the queen and king
 [ N c6 ] , [ B b5 ]  moving the piece twice. probably a bad decision. i thought i was saving the pawn and/or preventing my g-pawn from doubling on the f-file but i think there are other ways forward.
 [ N c6 ] , [ c3 ]  4. [ [ [ c3 ] ] ] is a rather passive way to prepare for [ [ [ d4 ] ] ] and prevents N[ [ [ c3 ] ] ] defending e4. [ [ [ c3 ] ] ] is a good way to prepare for [ [ [ d4 ] ] ] in the Giuoco Piano and the Ruy Lopez. The difference is that the light square Bishop is already developed which allows castling and [ R e1 ] defending [ [ e4 ] ] and allowing [ [ [ c3 ] ] ] to be played shortly after. With this in mind 4.[ B b5 ] pins the Knight and prepares for [ [ [ d4 ] ] ] while keeping N[ [ [ c3 ] ] ] ready to defend [ [ e4 ] ] when Black plays Nf6.
 [ R e2 + ]  [ K g1 ] , [ R x e3 ]  My opponent having been ahead a queen for a knight is now completely and utterly lost. The game continued:
 [ B x f3 ]  [ N x f3 ] , [ N x e4 ]  too greedy...
 [ R a7 ] , [ B b8 ]  28. [ R a7 ] surprised me. Why not just 28. [ R x d8 ] and win the exchange? Material would be imbalanced but pretty much even. Black ahead by two pawns for the exchange would be relying on trying to promote those two passed kingside pawns. But white tried something else and black found a way to save his rook.
 [ N f6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B c5 ] , [ c4 ]  Taking some more control of the center
 [ c x b5 ]  [ B x h8 ] , [ f6 ]  I am the exchange down I have her bishop and she has my rook but her bishop is now out of play and vulnerable.
 [ R c c8 ]  [ h4 ]  [ R c x f8 + ]  [ K g7 ]  [ R f g8 + ]  [ K f7 ]  [ R x g4 ]  [ R h6 ] , [ f5 ]  time for the charge of the light brigade.
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ d3 ]  Nothing particular with the opening yet!
 [ h4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ] , [ c x d5 ]  Each central opposing pawn down works in my favour.
 [ R g1 ] , [ Q b2 ]  my bishop rook queen is coordinated now towards the king.
 [ K d2 ]  [ R a3 ]  [ K c2 ]  [ K b4 ]  [ R a6 ]  [ R x a4 ]  [ R x b6 ]  [ K c5 ]  [ R b8 ] , [ R b4 ]  White is now struggling to draw.
 [ N c2 ]  [ Q x d3 ]  [ N x e1 ] , [ Q b5 + ]  Yes the only flaw in the plan. But too bad and too late. Anyway I have won the exchange I only have to keep the knight and don't lose it.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ] , [ d4 ]  He goes to one of my favorite openings. Center Game.
 [ K f3 ]  [ R f8 ] , [ g4 ]  My expected sequence would be of somewhat greater value for my opponent pawn for rook (not that it matters). Instead by this move he's simply offering the rook for free.
 [ Q e2 ]  [ R b8 ]  [ B d1 ]  [ R e8 ] , [ Q d2 ]  15. [ Q d2 ] - a regrouping exercise is going on behind the hedgehog.
 [ Q x h8 ]  [ N d2 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ B x f2 ]  16. [ B x f2 ] - I decided to get rid of the nuisance pawn but would a queen move to [ h1 ] been the order of the day here?
 [ K g3 ] , [ Q c7 + ]  !
 [ e5 ] , [ Q h5 ]  Queen out early..
 [ N c6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ a6 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N e5 ] , [ h3 ]  Passive. there's no reason to play this move here - the black knight won't come to [ g4 ] because the queen covers it. You should make your plans for future moves not put your opponents possibilities as priority in your mind. I assume you worried of the potential [ d6 ] with Bg4? Not sure. Either way developing with [ N c3 ] or taking control of the center with [ f4 ] would be better here.
 [ B x f5 ]  [ Q a4 ]  [ R c8 ] , [ N c3 ]  i see the check but want to secure things first
 [ e5 ]  [ B b2 ]  [ d5 ] , [ b5 ]  To prevent [ N c6 ] (the main interest of b4). A bit slow may be.
 [ b4 ]  [ N e2 + ]  [ K f2 ] , [ R d5 ]  here comes trouble...
 [ K d8 ]  [ e7 + ] , [ K c7 ]  
 [ h6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N d7 ] , [ Q d2 ]  Except for castling both players have now lined up there pieces ready for middle game
 [ e4 ] , [ e5 ]  We open up our queens and kingside bishops...
 [ Q x d7 ] , [ R h2 ]  Don't think I didn't realize the danger on the white diagonal... :-) [ d4 ] - [ d3 ] is wonderful for black. I am sure black could have had some advantage playing it before but it is hard to review.
 [ e6 ]  [ Q c1 ]  [ R g6 ]  [ g3 ] , [ h4 ]  Here comes the cavalry charge again! :)
 [ B x e4 ]  [ d x e4 ] , [ B f4 ]  No need to panic about my knights safety just yet. How about a little tempo first?
 [ e3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ c4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ c x d5 ] , [ N x d5 ]  Moving twice the knight in the very opening... but after [ Q x d4 ] white has an easy developement kicking the queen.
 [ e4 ] , [ c5 ]  I have started using [ c5 ] recently and found it to be a very good reply from black.
 [ Q g3 ]  [ Q f4 ] , [ N e d6 ]  Enough dancing -- it's time for a massive trigger. We both know it's coming and we're just trying to get our pieces in a spot so they'll be better placed after the trade.
 [ d5 ]  [ N d2 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f d7 ]  [ f4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ c3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ N d f3 ]  It seems a dull move but I thought the [ g1 ] knight could develop anyway.
 [ e5 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ d4 ]  [ d6 ]  [ e x d6 ]  [ c x d6 ] , [ B c4 ]  I think whites best move was [ c4 ] not Bc4.
 [ K c3 ] , [ R x d6 ]  White resigns. Yet another victory for me.
 [ Q e2 ]  [ N g e7 ] , [ N g5 + ]  19.Ng5+! if he captures my N with 19...[ f x g5 ] it's mate 20.Qh5#. Then my N can move on to various forks and windmills. Another common theme that the chess tactics training has helped me to see these hidden advantages.
 [ g6 ]  [ c3 + ] , [ K c2 ]  Trying to buy time...I don't suppose Black will move 44...[ a3 ]  [ f6 ]  [ e5 ] , [ a3 ]  45...a3? Oh my I'm doing some calculating and I may be back in this.
 [ B d7 ]  [ e x d7 + ] , [ K f8 ]  No other viable options.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N x c3 ]  [ b x c3 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ R e1 ]  [ B x e5 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ N c5 ]  [ R b1 ]  [ N x d3 ]  [ c x d3 ]  [ b6 ] , [ R b4 ]  !
 [ O-O ] , [ O-O ]  ...and castling.
 [ Q d2 ] , [ R e8 + ]  ? On principle this decision looks quite odd. It isn't so much the material issue of two pieces and rook for the queen (and chaos on the board still) but the fact that black will trade off two developed pieces for the queen with no immediate way to aggressively sustain the initiative. -CB.
 [ a6 ]  [ B a4 ] , [ B e7 ]  This is turning into a Morphy defence after 4.a6. OF course black can try [ N x e4 ] but that is extremely dangerous.
 [ g3 ]  [ O-O-O ] , [ N b5 ]  Now that Black has castled White wastes no time in preparing an attack first forking the Q on [ d6 ] and the pawn on [ a7 ] while granting his Q access to [ c3 ] to deliver check.
 [ b1 = Q + ]  [ N x b1 ] , [ B x b1 + ]  I have a significant piece advantage but I am still unsure I can finish this. Once I clear his pawns I will be 6 on him and still might not end up being able to finish. This is when I started to research the BB and BK end game.
 [ c x d4 ]  [ R a d1 ]  [ g5 ]  [ Q a5 ]  [ Q b6 ]  [ Q x b6 ] , [ f4 ]  ? P[ x Q b6 ] would attack Pa2. Even N[ x Q b6 ] makes back the queen. Any other move should only be considered if force mate ensues or is prevented. [ Q e6 + ] gives white [ N d5 ] (taken by Bg2).
 [ e6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ] , [ Q x d5 ]  Too soon to come out with the Queen. e x [ d5 ] was better
 [ Q x f8 ] , [ Q g6 ]  His king is immobilized but it looks like he has it under control.
 [ Q h6 ]  [ R a b1 ] , [ B e5 ]  In the game I actually felt that [ B f6 ] was a better place for the bishop.
 [ Q f2 ]  [ b4 ] , [ Q g3 ]  
 [ e4 ]  [ c6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ c x d5 ] , [ B d3 ]  This (the exchange variation) is not what I was expecting. Recently I've been looking into the Panov-Botvinnik attack and was surprised to see this tamer continuation. Still theory holds white retains a slight edge coming out of the opening so it's hard to blame white for this line.
 [ c x d4 ]  [ R d3 ]  [ g5 ]  [ B f2 ] , [ R d8 ]  if White does not capture the pawn then it is saved but if he captures with Rook ... RxP RxR BxR then Black King comes to e pawn and Rook goes to [ a4 ] [ b5 ] pawns ...
 [ N d2 ] , [ d6 ]  Well-intentioned — Black is trying to open new lines of attack in the center while making square for the DSB. I think that either …[ N h6 ] followed by …g5-[ g4 ] or else …0-0-0 with the same sacrifices as in the game would be more accurate however.
 [ f3 ]  [ B f5 ] , [ B b5 + ]  White could defend the pawn with [ [ c4 ] ] as shown in my first annotated game on the portuguese gambit this move places the bishop outside the pawns instead of being cramped by white's own [ [ c4 ] ] pawn.
 [ d x e5 ]  [ Q c2 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ Q b3 ]  [ Q c6 ]  [ c x b4 ]  [ R f e8 ]  [ b5 ]  [ Q g6 ] , [ a4 ]  With the idea to get counterplay pushing the pawns and to find a better place for the bishop (c4) and the knight (c3).
 [ R f1 ]  [ R x f1 + ] , [ K x f1 ]  24. [ K x f1 ] - and it brings King Dan one step closer to centralisation. I must now follow suit with Henry.
 [ B b7 ]  [ R f b1 ]  [ Q d7 ]  [ R a5 ]  [ B d8 ] , [ R a3 ]  It is clear that black has nothing to do since his position is clearly worse.
 [ d5 ]  [ h3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ e3 ]  White opens with a defensive position instead of with offensive moves.
 [ B x c8 ]  [ Q x c8 ] , [ Q d2 ]  double up on the bishop and preparing O-O-O; Get them rooks pounding on his O-O side.
 [ K d2 ]  [ N x c1 + ]  [ K x c1 ]  [ B x g1 ] , [ B x a6 ]  With [ N x g1 ] I would win a free bishop on f2..
 [ B c4 ]  [ N g7 ]  [ R b c1 ]  [ Q x d5 ]  [ R x d5 ]  [ K h8 ]  [ R c d1 ] , [ N x e4 ]  Probably should've taken the pawn on [ a4 ]  [ R x e5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ R d6 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ R x b6 ]  [ R x d7 ]  [ R x a5 ]  [ f4 ]  [ g4 ]  [ f3 ] , [ B d5 ]  Much stronger would've been [ N x f3 ] - Black cannot take back with his Rook without losing material. for example. 36... [ R x f3 ] 37. [ R a8 ] [ N e8 ] (forced) 38. [ R x e8 ] [ K g7 ] 39. [ R x e4 ]  [ B x f3 ]  [ R x f3 ]  [ R a8 + ]  [ N e8 ]  [ R x e8 + ]  [ K g7 ]  [ K g2 ]  [ R f6 ] , [ a5 ]  I had considered trading rooks but didn't like it as much. Fritz gave it a slight advantage to a5. I think I wanted to maintain tension and thought if you were to trade after taking back with my pawn and then moving my rook to the 6th rank I would have a good chance to promote
 [ N c3 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ B e2 ] , [ R c8 ]  Building up on the [ c3 ] knight
 [ B x g4 ] , [ O-O ]  7. ..... 0-0 - black decided to keep his king upright and to castle kingside. Has he castled into it though? His position is a little weak and I can find a way to exploit this right now.
 [ K h7 ]  [ N x h4 ]  [ g x h4 ] , [ K x h4 ]  OK now I'm back to a suitable lead especially since there is no way for black to save his [ c7 ] pawn from my bishop and rook.
 [ N e7 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ N d7 ] , [ N g e2 ]  10 [ B x h7 ] is no good because of ...[ g6 ] 11 Bx[ g6 ] Nxg6.
 [ N h3 ]  [ R f8 ]  [ f3 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ B e5 ]  The d-pawn is slated for advance and White wants the bishop out in front of the pawn chain and on the kingside first from where it will be able to operate more freely.
 [ R a8 ] , [ B c6 ]  finnaly I have seen the move [ B c6 ]  [ N g3 + ] , [ K h2 ]  I think better move would be 35.[ K g1 ]  [ K g1 ] , [ R f8 ]  ??
 [ c4 ]  [ c6 ]  [ N d6 ]  [ Q a4 ]  [ N d2 ]  [ b5 ]  [ b3 ]  [ Q a6 ]  [ K e3 ]  [ b x c4 ]  [ b x c4 ]  [ d x c4 ]  [ N d6 x c4 ]  [ Q c8 ] , [ N b6 ]  Nice Threat although it can be dealt
 [ Q x h2 + ]  [ K g4 ]  [ Q g2 + ]  [ K h4 ] , [ B e7 ]  Now the rook is pinned and Black regains the advantage due to the mistake on move 39. But can he keep it?
 [ N b d7 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ Q a5 ]  [ a3 ]  [ B x c3 + ] , [ R x c3 ]  The first exchange takes place.
 [ R h4 ] , [ g6 ]  This was the fatal error. I didn't realise that my KNP was the only piece defending my knight: I was trying to give my king an escape route should a queen/rook land on his starting rank although it is guarded by both rooks...
 [ B x h6 + ]  [ R x h6 ] , [ Q e2 ]  Waste of time. Unless the second rook comes into play white is in a really bad shape.
 [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ g6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ e4 ] , [ O-O ]  I was quite confident right now as I had won 6 games and drawed 3 times from my last 10 games with kings indian.
 [ d5 ]  [ c4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ c5 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ Q a4 + ]  [ B d7 ]  [ Q x d4 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ Q x d5 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ Q d1 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ e3 ]  [ Q e7 ]  [ B e2 ] , [ O-O-O ]  The traditional treatment is to go queenside but in recent games the patient approach with kingside castling has been revived.
 [ e x f5 ]  [ R x f5 ] , [ N g5 ]  There are two reasons this does not deserve an '!'. The knight can be chased away and white wasted time making this move twice.
 [ N x e7 ]  [ B x e7 ]  [ R f e8 ]  [ R d1 ]  [ Q x d1 + ]  [ Q x d1 ] , [ R x e7 ]  this is the result.. not too depressing after all.
 [ K h4 ] , [ g3 + ]  And I am still trying to activate my King.
 [ B a3 + ]  [ R e7 ] , [ B x b7 ]  The very least White can do now is win a double-Exchange. At this moment I was thinking to myself "I'll bet this guy hasn't been abused in 23 moves like this since the last time he played an Expert."
 [ N c3 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B e7 ] , [ h3 ]  this move is in preparation for [ B e3 ] (preparing [ d4 ] as in my previous note). However it is a weakness that Black can target I should have erred on the side of caution.
 [ Q c7 ]  [ B x g7 + ]  [ K x g7 ] , [ N b5 ]  ?? According to the analysis which I agree this is a mistake but not for the same reason. The computer outlines 16.[ B e2 ] as the best move but that's wrong. And as ION put it this is the losing blunder. And this is the move that he alluded to. The reason I didn't play this is that there is also a saying that "To take is a mistake." One time I had a somewhat similar position in my game against easy19. He had a R en-prise and I took it. By doing so I lost because the K was exposed. I thought that would happen later on if I played that because I was worried that there was a potential though not an immediate threat that the Q would come down and the d pawn would advance and create problems around the K. That however is not the case. Instead this is where I missed the opportunity win a R for a N with 16.Nxc8! which was best. Playing that would have left black clinging as he put it. But the reason that I did not make that move is because I still thought that to taking would be a costly mistake. The reason I played this was not to win a Q or the a pawn which it appears; as I wouldn't make that move just for that against a player like ION because it would be unsound and would be refuted. The real idea was to prevent black from making threats with his Q. If I took the R after taking back I thought because I analyzed and based on my assessment I believe that black would've played 17...[ g5 ] and would keep advancing the g and h pawns and keep them connected and then the Q would come down and pose as a threat to white. I didn't want to allow that so the idea is that in order to protect both the a pawn and Q and after asking what he could do the only option is what he plays next. And by keeping that Q on [ b8 ] the structure around my K is safe for now.
 [ N c4 ] , [ R a d1 ]  To centralize the rook.
 [ B b5 ]  [ R e7 ]  [ h3 ]  [ B h5 ] , [ N h4 ]  I like this move. White is seeking to be aggressive to gain the initiative from his lost pawn. I do not like that his minor pieces are still on the back rank. One problem though is that it allows black to do Be2! gaining the exchange or a bishop.
 [ N e4 ] , [ R x d5 ]  This is a defencive sac which is definitely needed here however all is lost. Some comments so far: "charleshiggie (1828) on 15-Feb-08: I think 24...[ [ d4 ] ] wins as well" "moppa (1778) on 20-Feb-08: 24...[ [ d4 ] ] 25.Rx[ [ d4 ] ] [ R x c3 ] 26.[ R x c3 ] [ R x c3 ] 27.[ Q x c3 ] [ Q x c3 ] 28.[ R d8 ] [ N e8 ] 29.[ R x e8 # ] (Whoops) is something black has to take care of if he is to play 24...d4"
 [ O-O ] , [ f x e4 ]  only move
 [ Q e4 + ]  [ R f3 ]  [ Q e2 + ]  [ K g3 ]  [ Q e1 + ]  [ R f2 ]  [ Q g1 + ]  [ K f3 ]  [ Q h1 + ]  [ K e3 ]  [ Q e1 + ]  [ R e2 ]  [ Q g1 + ]  [ K d3 ]  [ Q d1 + ]  [ R d2 ]  [ Q f3 + ] , [ K d4 ]  escaped his checks
 [ R x b6 ]  [ a8 = Q ] , [ R d6 ]  Better may have been [ N c6 ] but Black is busted at this point.
 [ R d7 ]  [ R a c1 ]  [ c5 ]  [ R b1 ]  [ R d6 ]  [ K g2 ]  [ c4 ] , [ K g3 ]  Black is running out of reasonable moves.
 [ Q d2 ] , [ f5 ]  Black attempts to slow White's coming charge.
 [ K a5 ]  [ N e6 ]  [ Q c8 ]  [ B b4 + ]  [ K b6 ] , [ N d4 ]  ?! White might do better to repeat with 19. Bc5+. Black would probably have to accept the draw.
 [ R b1 ]  [ Q c6 + ] , [ N c4 ]  Here eat my rook EAT IT!!
 [ K d8 ]  [ R b7 ]  [ R h2 ]  [ K g3 ]  [ R e2 ]  [ b6 ] , [ R b2 ]  White will use one last trick to get his decisive advantage converted.
 [ f x e4 ]  [ R x d2 ]  [ B x d2 ] , [ N f4 ]  Keeping the third pawn. And now we enter the endgame where Black has a decisive advantage.
 [ h x g6 ]  [ f x g6 ]  [ N h3 ] , [ R f8 ]  Are blacks paving the way for [ Q e8 ] ? If yes then the whites attack must have worked some psychological effect.
 [ R a g8 ] , [ d3 ]  Opening a diagonal for bishop and also extra protection for knight at e4.
 [ Q h4 + ]  [ N f6 ] , [ B g5 ]  I wanted to get into complications risking to lose a piece somewhere.
 [ O-O ]  [ b5 ]  [ a3 ] , [ c5 ]  gets lots of space to play in the queen side but black did not castle yet and has got two pieces in the queen side that are not in the game yet...
 [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ a6 ]  I looked at Fischer and saw pure hatred staring back at me. I thought this must be what Jack the Rippers victims must have seen. After that I concentrated on the board and didn't look at Fischer.
 [ Q a4 + ]  [ K f7 ]  [ N a3 ]  [ R a6 ]  [ Q c4 + ] , [ e6 ]  Why did I not consider 24...Re6.
 [ B x c6 ] , [ Q x c6 ]  and now black has successfully prepared the exchange forcing white to decide to double pawns or to lose a pawn...
 [ Q x f2 ] , [ R f1 ]  Black is compelled to move but he is ahead.
 [ h4 ] , [ R e8 ]  making room to flee. Our brave King leads by example (or follows his queen ?)
 [ b x c3 ]  [ a6 ]  [ B a4 ]  [ b5 ]  [ B b3 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ B d5 ] , [ B x d5 ]  the centre is mine
 [ c x d5 ] , [ c x d5 ]  15. ......... [ c x d5 ] - this pawn trade now allows that "Surprise Move" 16. Nb5!
 [ B e6 ] , [ c7 ]  And push!
 [ R h5 ] , [ K f7 ]  why run so early? Actually the King comes in handy in helping to hold things together. Black should continue development and prepare to attack on the queenside.
 [ K x g2 ]  [ Q b7 + ]  [ f3 ]  [ Q x b5 ] , [ N x g5 ]  I am very happy with my knight here
 [ Q a4 ]  [ Q e1 + ]  [ K h2 ] , [ Q x f2 ]  It does not just materializes - it also opens the e-pawn. Unfortunately I was more interested into changing the queens.
 [ O-O ]  [ e3 ] , [ N c6 ]  All these moves are very classical.
 [ N c5 ]  [ B x c5 ]  [ d x c5 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ N x d7 ]  [ c x d7 ]  [ Q x d7 ]  [ d6 ]  [ R f d8 ] , [ Q d5 ]  Trying to reinforce with O-O-O.
 [ N x a4 ]  [ d x c6 ] , [ a5 ]  A few moves later and I push at his rear-front-attack back gaining control of the left rank.
 [ R x c3 ] , [ b x c3 ]  ...with this Rook exchange.
 [ R b8 ] , [ b3 ]  ? A bad move which weakens the a1-[ h8 ] diagonal. I should have known that and play the more cautious 15.Rab1.
 [ N b3 ]  [ K e6 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ a6 ]  [ K f1 ]  [ K d5 ]  [ B d4 ]  [ K c4 ]  [ N d2 + ]  [ K d3 ]  [ K e1 ] , [ K c2 ]  Wow this is going really well (for black). By chasing white's pieces around black was able to get his king to the other side of the board before white did. White may still be able to trade a piece for both pawns if he tries hard. Incidentally black could have defended the pawn on [ g7 ] but it seemed more valuable to get the king to [ c2 ] (and keep white's king out) than to save the pawn on g7.
 [ Q x d3 + ]  [ K b2 ] , [ R x e4 ]  Taking the rook. White resigns. Conclusion: I think this was simply a case of maybe me having more experience than white. I was able to predict further into the game and use my pieces more creatively.
 [ Q e6 + ]  [ R f7 ] , [ N x e5 ]  i would black to take my rook
 [ N x f6 ]  [ K x f6 ]  [ R f4 + ]  [ K g7 ] , [ K g4 ]  This mistake allows me to trap his king and weave a mating net.
 [ c5 ] , [ B e2 ]  Accepting the game after [ c4 ] by black. I should not but I didn't remembered when playing.
 [ f3 ] , [ B f6 ]  With my K and B in place White cannot get rid of the P by advancing his P's to [ B4 ] and N5: I would play ...BxP and replay to PxB with..PxP the P being guarded by my K.
 [ N d5 ] , [ Q x b2 ]  ?? I don't know if really is a two Queiry move but in the English System ...[ Q x b2 ] is in most variations considered to be a losing blunder. That's because Susan Polgar mentioned that taking this is a huge mistake that allows black to win. Although the variations are different with what follows I'm applying the same concept regardless despite a different position because going into thought process I believe that Kieseritzky has just become overly confident. And as he gets more and more comfortable black's headed for disaster big time which does unfold later in the game.
 [ N e5 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N x d5 ] , [ N x d5 ]  12. ...... [ N x d5 ] - knight trade.
 [ e5 ] , [ N e4 ]  I suppose I couldn't help but place my knight on the square when I see a hole thats protected by a pawn.
 [ B e7 ] , [ N b5 ]  Whit this move I attack pawn on [ d6 ] and clear the way for black bishop to attack pawn on g7.
 [ g6 ]  [ e4 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ O-O ] , [ O-O ]  So far both sides have castled kingside but White has a lot more control of the center. I personally don't like putting many pawns in the center and instead I play flexible setups that will contest the center later. Even though I don't have much space I am more flexible and I can play to break in the center with [ e5 ] or c5.
 [ B g7 ]  [ B b2 ]  [ O-O ] , [ e3 ]  This move may not be the best. I think that it is best to develop the bishop on the h1-[ a8 ] diagonal. on the f1-[ h6 ] diagonal the bishop does not do much.
 [ g x h3 ]  [ g x h3 ]  [ R x h3 ] , [ N a5 ]  Knowing that he's going to get the h pawn I might as well play anything. So I go back to square one by putting pressure on the b pawn.
 [ Q d5 ]  [ B c2 ]  [ B x c2 ]  [ Q x c2 ] , [ R a d8 ]  the queen is in front of the rook but then the bishop is closed so it's not possible for white to play [ R d1 ] if [ N e4 ] I'm able to exchange queens with [ Q d1 + ] [ Q x d1 ] forced [ R x d1 + ] and now is [ R e1 ] [ R x e1 ] [ N x e1 ] or I'll force it with [ N d5 ] attacking the rook with the idea of [ R e2 ] [ N f4 ] [ R e3 ] [ N d3 ] wining a piece so white must play [ R e1 ] and allow the exchange of rooks also
 [ a x b6 ] , [ N c3 ]  This would of continued Alekhine's Defense if played on move 6.
 [ R f g8 + ] , [ K f1 ]  The only half-way reasonable move.
 [ K e7 ] , [ N c4 ]  This threatens both bishop and queen. I did not see this coming. I was hoping [ Q b5 ] or [ Q a6 ] but that would have lost the game unavoidable. First 11. [ Q d6 ] [11. .. [ K e8 ] 12. Qf8#] [ K f6 ] 13. [ N d4 ] [ K g5 ] 14. [ h4 ] and eexpectingBe2ither king goes to [ h5 ] or [ g4 ] and 15. [ B e2 # ] Even better than [ B x f2 ] might have been just to capture the knight now. 10. .. [ d x e6 ] 11. [ B x c5 ] [ Q x c5 ] 12. [ N c7 ] [ K e7 ] 13. [ N x a8 ] [ Q b4 ] and white at least loses one pawn...
 [ c3 ] , [ Q a5 ]  Trying to decide between this move and Ne5. Probably should have gone with the latter.
 [ N x e3 ]  [ R x e3 ] , [ N x d4 ]  As I was saying earlier the N at [ d4 ] falls. Excellent read by black. Great tactical combination!
 [ e3 ]  [ O-O ] , [ B b5 ]  Clears the way for a kingside castle.
 [ K f7 ]  [ B e3 ] , [ Q b4 ]  The less-greedy 12. ...[ Q e5 ] would have served me much better as will soon become apparent.
 [ R x g7 ] , [ B f6 ]  immediately attacking the intruder
 [ B c5 ]  [ c3 ] , [ R c8 ]  I definetly like [ B x d4 ] better for black doubling my pawns and isolating them on the d-file.
 [ B b1 ] , [ Q x d2 ]  White finds a little pressure of his own. The threat is 28. [ B x g6 ] [ f x g6 ] 29. [ Q x g6 ] beginning a king hunt offering white a chance to find a perpetual check or 3-move repetition if possible. I didn't work out whether it is possible because I found the winning move for black. After 27. ... [ Q x d2 ] black gains more material and now threatens the white queen preventing 28. Bxg6?? by threatening 28. ... Qxh6.
 [ g5 ]  [ R d4 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ N c5 ]  [ K e7 ]  [ f3 ]  [ R b6 ]  [ b4 ]  [ K d6 ]  [ K f2 ]  [ R e7 ]  [ a3 ]  [ f6 ] , [ R d2 ]  
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ e x d4 ] , [ B c4 ]  Ta-da! Main line Scotch runs 4. Nxd4. This move gives Black several opportunities to hang himself with his own rope. 4...[ B b4 ] ?! is one such move when 5. c3! dc 6. bc! and Black is already in trouble.
 [ Q f5 + ]  [ K b8 ]  [ e4 ]  [ Q c5 + ]  [ Q x c5 ]  [ B x c5 + ]  [ K h1 ] , [ h5 ]  Here comes the pawns can I make something of it
 [ d x e5 ]  [ N e8 ] , [ B b5 ]  Black loses at least a piece here and appears to be positionally crushed.
 [ B d7 ]  [ R a b1 ]  [ R a c8 ] , [ h3 ]  I want to get my other knight more actively placed on g4. And besides giving your king a little breathing room is always a good idea to avoid those pesky back-rank mates. I had considered (albeit briefly) playing 19.[ g4 ] threatening to win his bishop by 20.[ g5 ] but after 19...[ g6 ] and 20...[ B g7 ] my e-pawn will have to go because I don't have the time or resources to defend it.
 [ B x e4 ]  [ d x e4 ] , [ Q x e4 ]  White has two pawns for the piece has a monster pawn on [ g5 ] and an open h file. Also note that the bishop on [ c3 ] may now enter the game with a timely d5. The immediate problems for black is h7.
 [ K f7 ] , [ c3 ]  White offered draw... After 29. ... [ R b8 ] 30. [ b3 ] we are dead equal... So I accepted...
 [ R d1 + ] , [ R x d1 ]  forced
 [ e5 ]  [ B x e5 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ R f c8 ]  [ B b2 ]  [ g6 ] , [ Q f3 ]  Once I move my knight his knight will be under attack from both my queen and bishop.
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ] , [ N c3 ]  [ N c3 ] is the Paulsen Variation. Other main lines are [ e x d5 ] (the Exchange Variation) [ e5 ] (the Advance) and [ N d2 ] (the Tarrasch).
 [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ e x d6 ]  [ B x d6 ]  [ e3 ] , [ g5 ]  Lasker variation of the Frome messing with the white knight.
 [ g4 ]  [ B h7 ]  [ N d2 ] , [ O-O-O ]  as i saw the battle coming to [ e5 ] is where i had to think of what my plan was. this is where i saw the checkmate from. from my part thats if my oponent played how i calculated too lol but the game development looked natural enough to calculate.
 [ Q g6 ]  [ e3 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ Q x e4 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ Q g4 ] , [ O-O ]  White is doing a nice job omitting the blunder on the fourth move.
 [ B g4 ]  [ B x g4 ] , [ R x g4 ]  The position simplifies a little more.
 [ R x f7 ] , [ Q x c5 ]  and so i thought this would help relieve stress
 [ d5 ]  [ B b3 ] , [ d4 ]  ! will win back the piece
 [ R x e2 ]  [ Q x e2 ]  [ B x c3 ] , [ R a d1 ]  24. [ R a d1 ] - my queen rook centralises but that bishop pair do look ominous.
 [ N d7 ]  [ R g3 + ]  [ K h7 ] , [ R f4 ]  Nothing to be done.
 [ N c3 ] , [ B b4 ]  White moves out his queenside knight and I pin it with my dark bishop.
 [ K f1 ] , [ K x e3 ]  40. ....... [ K x e3 ] - munch munch!
 [ B c2 ] , [ N g6 ]  the [ h4 ] bishop has to find a better place. also [ e5 ] is now threatened twice.
 [ N x d1 ]  [ R x d1 ]  [ d x c4 ]  [ B f1 ]  [ R c d8 ]  [ B x c4 ]  [ R x d1 + ]  [ K x d1 ]  [ R c8 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ R c3 ]  [ K e1 ]  [ B x c2 ]  [ B x c2 ]  [ R x e3 + ]  [ K f2 ]  [ R x a3 ]  [ K g3 ]  [ b5 ]  [ K f4 ]  [ b4 ]  [ K g5 ]  [ b3 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ b2 ]  [ B c2 ]  [ R c3 ]  [ B b1 ]  [ R c1 ]  [ B a2 ]  [ b1 = Q ]  [ B x b1 ] , [ R x b1 ]  
 [ B x g4 ] , [ e5 ]  Again since my king is not at [ c6 ] I can play 9. ... [ e5 ] to attack the white's knight defender. The idea is to remove the defender and the attack to the knight or at least force white to re-place his knight. I played the same way against id=antagonistknight and he responded with 10. O-O which seems better than 10. [ d3 ]  [ e x d3 ] , [ c x d3 ]  As you can see white's pawn at [ d3 ] is isolated now!
 [ N x c5 ]  [ d x c5 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ b3 ]  [ B d4 ]  [ B x d5 + ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ B x e3 ] , [ f x e3 ]  Time to evaluate this endgame. It's quite complex actually. Both sides have isolated pawns. The kings are preparing to advance to the center. Black has a pawn majority on the kingside while white has one on the queenside. The queenside majority gives white dangerous chances though. The majority has a lust to quickly expand with [ b4 ] and [ a4 ] with moves like [ b5 ] and then [ c6 ] coming in probably creating a strong passed pawn. This may not happen but it is a threat. It at least keeps the black king somewhat tied down to this area to prevent a passed pawn from becoming a deadly threat.
 [ b5 ]  [ Q c3 ]  [ b x a4 ]  [ R x a1 ] , [ R a b8 ]  Black has a good position but with a lost counterplay. Doubled pawns and disjointed pawn structure and lost centre.Offcourse he has a open Rook diagonal with two pairs of rook .lets see whether he is activate them or not
 [ b4 ]  [ B a7 ]  [ B b2 ] , [ d5 ]  Don't open the center when behind in development unless you can then speedily complete it or must make such a move to live. Here ..[ d6 ] or [ N b c6 ] are probably both preferrential. Note my center will still be mobile.
 [ B x g5 ]  [ B x g5 ] , [ Q e5 ]  Leaving her Bishop indirectly pinned to the Queen. But after this move the time has run out for both of us making it an unfinished game. Mary however was busted from whichever you way you look at with that blunder. After this game though Jack said that I didn't play well. I'm not sure what line but he said that there was a line that I could've pinned and won the Queen. Considering however that time really was of the essence I disagree with Jack. As this is the best that I've ever played for someone who was on a tight schedule and thus under a major time crunch.
 [ c x d4 ] , [ B e7 ]  A weak move. A much better move for Black is d6. [ B e7 ] just seems pointless and unsharp.
 [ N c6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ N b4 ]  i'm threatening to capture his rook
 [ N c3 ] , [ c5 ]  With this move the computer introduces a Tarrasch Opening which I had no idea what it was when I was playing this but upon looking it up in the MCO later I was very pleased in my intuitive play but also impressed that the computer would choose this opening over other main line QGD choices.
 [ R e d1 ] , [ B x c3 ]  ...which I do with this exchange.
 [ K h3 ]  [ R b3 + ]  [ K h4 ] , [ R x a3 ]  ?? The big mistake!
 [ N c6 ] , [ Q b3 ]  I do not know why he moved here.
 [ R c d8 ]  [ B e6 + ]  [ K h8 ]  [ Q g4 ] , [ B f8 ]  There is no salvation.
 [ N x f4 ] , [ B g4 + ]  escaping the danger
 [ R h7 ] , [ R x a5 ]  White take that a pawn but this is useless
 [ c x b5 ]  [ a x b5 ]  [ a3 ]  [ R a8 ] , [ K f3 ]  moving the king closer to [ e5 ] pawn.
 [ O-O ] , [ Q d4 ]  What he does now.
 [ Q x e4 ]  [ N x g7 + ]  [ K f8 ]  [ N d2 ]  [ Q e5 ] , [ N f3 ]  Gains a temp for now but I am stuck with a peice under attack and no way to protect it or move it because I let the opponent get center control while i went pawn picking away from the action
 [ B e7 ] , [ R d c1 ]  ...basically I am preparing the central push...with [ R d c1 ] where does the knight goto..?
 [ f x g3 ] , [ B g2 ]  lets the king go
 [ N d2 ] , [ B x a2 ]  Winning another Pawn.
 [ Q a3 ] , [ Q e5 ]  Now to remove the bishop
 [ R f1 + ] , [ K g8 ]  Caruana just cannot offer a draw here. He has to try. But the position is practically a draw unless someone make a monumental boo-boo!
 [ N f3 ]  [ O-O-O ]  [ B e3 ]  [ B x e3 ] , [ R x e3 ]  19. [ R x e3 ] - in order to keep my kingside pawn majority intact I recaptured with the rook. That is another set of minor pieces off the board.
 [ N f3 ]  [ R e7 ]  [ R e f1 ] , [ R a e8 ]  Black wants to put pressure on the backward pawn on e3. [ N e1 ] for white looks like it could allow white to play [ B f3 ] but It would lose the [ e3 ] pawn.
 [ O-O ] , [ O-O ]  They both do so.
 [ R b8 ] , [ f3 ]  19. [ f3 ] - an attempt to smash that screen.
 [ K e7 ] , [ Q e6 # ]  
 [ Q x h6 ] , [ Q d4 + ]  A trap becomes clear if only I make the right moves and he doesn't see what I'm doing.
 [ K f4 ] , [ B d4 ]  It's faster to get the bishop out of the way and just get there with the king.
 [ d x c6 ]  [ B x c6 ]  [ N x c6 ] , [ R e8 + ]  white did not foresee this move. 13.[ K f1 ] [ Q x d3 + ] and white is prevented from casling and black gains a tempo too.
 [ R h2 ]  [ g x h4 ]  [ g x h4 ] , [ K h5 ]  And it's right here. That's due to his h pawn. Although it's not a passed pawn it can become one. Plus it is dangerous as Carl could use that pawn and his R if I'm not careful. I thought that his threat would start off with 32.[ h5 + ] and after 32...[ K g5 ] while everything seems ok black might plan something like Rb7-b8-[ g8 ] with an overwhelming check. As those two R's on adjacent files coupled with that pawn are known to be dangerous as well. Even without a passed pawn I could wind up in a lot of trouble. If that happens there would be a possiblity of Carl pulling a swindle and winning a lost game. I was determined not to allow that and therefore stop any plans that he might have with his Rb7. I do this by blocking his [ h4 ] pawn even at the cost of a pawn.
 [ h4 ]  [ f x e4 ] , [ h x g3 + ]  Black Has Regained The Material. Also White Hardly has Any Development.
 [ N f d7 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ c5 ]  7. ..... [ [ c5 ] ] - GM Daniel King in a chess video on the French has always recommended this black pawn break on [ [ c5 ] ] before black's queen knight goes to c6.
 [ b x c3 ]  [ R x c3 ] , [ Q x e7 ]  St George prepares a counter strike
 [ g x f6 ] , [ N c3 ]  here i decide i need to make something happen after such poor play from white he needs to be punished...
 [ R x g2 + ]  [ K f1 ]  [ R c2 ] , [ R x b5 ]  [ B c4 + ] winning the rook
 [ b x c3 ] , [ Q x c3 ]  To get the Rook and a little extra.
 [ e3 + ] , [ K g1 ]  53. [ K e1 ] loses as follows: 53. ... [ f2 ] 54. [ K e2 ] f1=Q#.
 [ a5 ]  [ K f7 ]  [ b4 ] , [ R f h8 ]  Black need not worry about the Queenside as the fight is nearly over.
 [ b3 ]  [ a4 ] , [ d3 ]  12. [ d3 ] - at the moment my pawn structure seems fairly solid but later on just like Captain Smith of the Titanic thought it turned out not to be the case a few moves down the line (I recently watched Cameron's 1997 movie of the Titanic recently and thought it would have some parallels here!).
 [ b3 ] , [ g5 ]  Placing a considerable constraint upon White's K-side especially the h3-Knight. A good deal of Black's play in this game involves the motif of "constraint".
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ B b5 ]  The well-known Spanish (Ruy Lopez) opening...
 [ R x c6 ]  [ Q x c6 ] , [ g x h3 ]  ?! White probably felt obliged to accept this piece sac however it goes according to the script I'd mapped out. In defensive positions indeed in chess in general one should endeavor to play actively and in a non-stereotyped fashion and try to find counterpressure whenever possible. 26. [ Q b3 ] is a more active move pressuring the a2-[ g8 ] diagonal and keeping on eye on black's empty back-rank and personally I would have found a sterner defensive move though white is decisively worse in any case.
 [ B e2 ]  [ d6 ]  [ e x d6 ]  [ c x d6 ] , [ Q a4 + ]  Terrezas begins a risky premature attack... maybe he felt Castro wasn't a strong enough defender to accurately riposte.
 [ B x f5 ]  [ R x f5 ]  [ b x c3 ]  [ b x c3 ]  [ B x e5 ] , [ R x e5 ]  17. [ R x e5 ] - I chose this recapture rather than [ d x e5 ] because I wanted to control the e column.
 [ g3 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ f4 ]  [ B e7 ] , [ a3 ]  White doesn't have any moves to impact on the game. Waiting to be put down by Black.
 [ g5 ] , [ B e7 ]  [ b4 ] pressure is a bit lighter now but really just moved to the [ a3 ] square. White on the other hand are about to get a strong kingside attack and black is still blocking a queenside castling by not moving the queen out of the last row
 [ N x e5 ]  [ N x e5 ] , [ B x e5 ]  Black now has a small advantage but being so small I was not worried.
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ] , [ N f3 ]  I hate playing against the Sicilian defense as White but once I open with P-[ K4 ] my opponent can force it on me.
 [ N c3 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ B e2 ] , [ B x f3 ]  Better to wait until White forces the exchange.
 [ Q x h5 ] , [ B a4 ]  Black continues his policy off seeking exchanges.21.....[ e5 ] was an alternative but black felt the White B was more dangerous than the N.
 [ R c f1 ]  [ R f7 x f6 ]  [ R x f6 ]  [ R x f6 ] , [ B x f6 ]  So got exchanges of the Rooks leaving the battle for the Queens and Bishops.
 [ f x e6 ]  [ Q x e6 + ] , [ N g e7 ]  Why not Nce7? Um. Good question. it would free the Queen to defend too.
 [ B x b3 ]  [ N c5 ]  [ B d1 ]  [ K d2 ]  [ B f3 ]  [ N b3 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ K e3 ]  [ B d1 ] , [ N c5 ]  This is the same postion than before but now I had a sudden whisper from Caissa:
 [ B x c6 ] , [ b x c6 ]  Trying to trade against strong opponents.
 [ Q x d7 ] , [ R x d7 ]  I recapture my queen. I had yes foreseen lines with 21.[ R e8 + ] [ B f8 ] 22.[ R b8 ] [ R d2 ] which I think are narrowly advantageous for me.
 [ e3 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ B a8 ]  [ a4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ c4 ] , [ e6 ]  14. ....................... e6? In restrospect maybe taking on [ c4 ] might have been better but then it would have allowed a knight to squat in on c4.
 [ N e7 ]  [ e5 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ d x e5 ] , [ Q x d1 ]  Inaccuracy: +1.34 » … [ Q x d1 ] 20. R[ c x d1 ] [ N h7 ] 21. [ R d7 ] [ R f d8 ] 22. [ [ e6 ] ] [ K f8 ] 23. [ B e5 ] [ R x d7 ] 24. [ e x d7 ] [ N c6 ] 25. [ N a4 ] [ N x e5 ] 26. [ N x e5 ] [ R d8 ] 27. [ N x b6 ] [ c x b6 ] 28. [ R e3 ] Best: +0.46 » … [ N f d5 ] 20. [ N a4 ] [ a5 ] 21. [ N x b6 ] [ c x b6 ] 22. bx[ a5 ] bx[ a5 ] 23. [ Q d2 ] [ R f d8 ] 24. [ N d4 ] [ Q a4 ] 25. [ Q d3 ] [ N c3 ] 26. [ [ e6 ] ] [ Q x d4 ] 27. [ e x f7 + ] [ K x f7 ] 28. [ Q x c3 ] [ Q x c3 ] 29. [ R x c3 ] Sure but I expected the move he played.
 [ N x a4 ]  [ N x a4 ]  [ Q x a4 ]  [ c3 ]  [ b5 ] , [ Q e3 ]  26. [ Q a1 ] [ Q x a1 ] 27. [ R x a1 ] [ b4 ] is surely better... Now follows a forced continuation and black reaches a favourable position...
 [ R x h7 + ]  [ K g4 ] , [ f3 # ]  I had a choice of 4 mates here - a pawn mate is very nice! - JS
 [ a x b5 ]  [ K e3 ] , [ Q c1 + ]  he took 30 minutes to make the next move for some reason. He said there was a perpetual as he didn't want me to take the [ a2 ] pawn. Frankly I wouldn't have taken it as it looses the e e and b pawns.
 [ R e2 ] , [ B x e4 ]  ? simply gives him more center and allows him to exchange more.
 [ g4 ] , [ N d4 ]  forced but winning; after [ N x d4 ] [ B x d4 ] [ R h6 ] a3! [ a5 ] [ [ f5 ] ] most of Blacks' illusions are over... after [ b4 ] [ N x c6 ] [ B x c6 ] cx[ b4 ] [ B b5 ] [ R d1 ] [ [ f5 ] ] [ e x f6 ] [ Q x f6 ] f5...
 [ Q d6 ]  [ c4 ] , [ Q b6 ]  Up three pawns a Queen trade is good for White
 [ B a3 ]  [ K b1 ]  [ h7 ]  [ K a2 ]  [ h8 = Q ] , [ K x a3 ]  Well there was nothing better.
 [ N e4 ]  [ Q a3 + ] , [ K b1 ]  Black's menace on the kingside is no more efficient.
 [ g x f6 ]  [ N x e4 ] , [ N d7 ]  18. [ B x h2 ] also wins but there was no need to allow Black to activate their knights i.e.: 19. [ N x f6 ] [ K e7 ] 20.[ N f5 ] [ Q h4 ] 21.[ N d6 + ]  [ N x d6 + ]  [ c x d6 ]  [ Q e2 ] , [ K e7 ]  [ N e5 ] wins the knight but forces [ K f8 ] after [ Q b5 ] to avoid a further capture of [ b7 ] with check. In the actual game [ K e7 ] was played almost instantly bringing the rook in [ a7 ] into the attack.
 [ d x c3 + ]  [ B e3 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ Q h4 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ B x e5 ]  [ R a2 ] , [ B g6 ]  The programmed response to Qh4. Thematically this pressures the weak [ e4 ] point and sets up for a tactic o [ h2 ] which was playable here as well.
 [ B x b7 ]  [ R g6 + ]  [ K h4 ]  [ R g4 + ]  [ K h5 ] , [ g6 # ]  With all this pieces scattering around the pawn is the one that gives the mate. Hope you enjoyed it and be soon able to refute my lines!
 [ B f7 ] , [ f4 ]  I decide to push another pawn. Right now my goal is to force another exchange but that will not work.
 [ B e2 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N b3 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ f4 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N b d7 ] , [ f5 ]  There were many alternatives.. like ensuring His Highness' safety (10.Kh1) or playing the so Sicilian-like 10.Be3. What is the target of 10.[ f5 ] then? Maintaining the tension and making Black loose his nerves.
 [ e6 ] , [ N c3 ]  He prevents [ d5 ] for the moment.
 [ g5 ] , [ g4 ]  I decided to threaten her with [ g x h5 ] by playing g4. As a result she was forced to pull her knight back.
 [ B x g2 + ]  [ N x g2 ] , [ R x f3 ]  Nice I missed this combination -- now it is only one pawn and black has a lot more pressure.
 [ B e4 ]  [ K f2 ]  [ K f5 ]  [ R a2 ]  [ h4 ]  [ g x h4 ] , [ K x f4 ]  Morphy charges forward trying to constrict Harrwitz's pieces.
 [ f x e7 ] , [ Q x e7 ]  Exchange of pawns.
 [ O-O ] , [ Q d7 ]  If instead 13...[ B [ f5 ] ] I had in mind to play 14.[ N h4 ] followed by 15.[ f5 ] with attack on the K-side. One of the features of this game is that I found myself continually switching my attention from Q-side to K-side and back again. I will return to this theme later...
 [ g x f5 ]  [ e x f5 ] , [ K d5 ]  Now White is getting ready to play c6.
 [ R c8 ] , [ e7 + ]  but now the rook is too well defended. And a discovered check that forced the end.
 [ R a c1 ] , [ c6 ]  Solid looking and it does sort of just feel right. But a subtle chink in the armor is detected by Steinitz.
 [ d5 ] , [ e3 ]  I thought this was a fairly weak opening for the fact that there are a lot other recognized moves that will give White more initiative. moving the King's Pawn up 2 spaces instead of 1 would be the obvious choice if you're going to move that particular pawn.
 [ Q g6 ]  [ Q g2 ] , [ Q h5 ]  22. .... [ Q h5 ] - declines an exchange of queens.
 [ K b3 ]  [ R x a1 ]  [ R x a1 ]  [ B x a1 ]  [ b x c5 ]  [ b x c5 ]  [ K c2 ]  [ B d4 ]  [ f3 ]  [ R b8 ]  [ K d2 ] , [ R b2 + ]  And that is how far ahead I looked when he threatened my rook with his bishop; no further than this. Although I thought he'd go after my knight necessitating [ N c3 ] and saving his f pawn that way before my rook would get down there.
 [ B x e5 ] , [ N x e5 ]  Evidently white wants to kill the black rook something fierce.
 [ B c6 ] , [ B x f5 ]  getting rid of the irksome N and giving Black doubled pawns
 [ N e8 ]  [ N f1 ]  [ f5 ] , [ Q b3 ]  So far so good. Now any opening of the position should benefit white.
 [ B d2 ]  [ R x a4 ]  [ b6 ]  [ R b8 ] , [ b7 ]  White bishop's power...
 [ R d4 ]  [ N c4 ]  [ K b3 ] , [ Q d6 ]  Black ups the ante...
 [ K g8 ]  [ R e7 ] , [ R x e5 ]  However I am lucky. The black's king is now a target and with the extra piece rounding up both pawns and promoting the h pawn will be OK. Therefore I am winning but I complicated the task.
 [ O-O ] , [ R h d1 ]  He decides to connect his rooks and that is always a good idea to do this in chess.
 [ c6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ K d6 ]  ok my king can enter the fray too - needs to to help pawns reach thier destination.
 [ N d6 ]  [ R c b8 ]  [ N x e8 ]  [ R b5 ]  [ Q x d4 ]  [ f6 ] , [ B x f6 ]  An interesting tactic can ensure with knight takes bishop or pawn takes bishop with an eventual fork of the queen and king by my knight.
 [ a x b6 ]  [ R a b1 ]  [ K b7 ] , [ Q e2 ]  23.[ f4 ] is better attacking the center and keeping the passer blockaded.
 [ O-O ] , [ B e5 ]  trade off bishops and now i start controlling momentum and hes forced to move defensively each time im happy with my game so far even though i havent made up for the pawn gambit yet. but its givin me so much development itll be hard for him to catch up
 [ B e6 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ N d5 ] , [ Q h5 ]  At last counterplay. Threatening 21. [ Q x h7 ] and forcing the king back onto the central files.
 [ N c6 ] , [ c3 ]  Better to stay calm. I can still lose this. I'm a piece under after all.
 [ c5 ]  [ e x d5 ] , [ c x d4 ]  The book line is 4. ed4. Perhaps that's the case because of what occurs next.
 [ R f e8 ]  [ B x c6 ]  [ B x c6 ]  [ R x c7 ]  [ B d5 ] , [ R x a7 ]  Simple picking off the pawns.
 [ K c8 ] , [ Q h7 ]  Now it's game over.
 [ e5 ] , [ B e3 ]  Again misplaced. I realised about 5 seconds after this move that 10.[ B g5 ] would have been much better flowing towards an Averbakh Variation of the KID.
 [ B e3 ] , [ N a6 ]  ...and adding protection to the QBP couldn't hurt.
 [ Q x b2 ] , [ B x c3 ]  Maintaining the balance.
 [ R a3 ]  [ f4 ] , [ g x f4 + ]  Black resigned in view of 33..[ B b3 ] 34.[ R x b3 # ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ Q x d5 ]  [ d4 ] , [ e6 ]  After a couple of standard book moves this is an inaccuracy I think. [ N f6 ] or [ N c6 ] are the main moves. Fritz doesn't like 4. ... [ e6 ] - but of course the question is what to do about it.
 [ B g5 ] , [ B b4 ]  Black acts quickly to keep the tension on the board and not falling to passivity
 [ N f5 ]  [ g7 ] , [ N c4 ]  too late...
 [ K g7 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ K f6 ] , [ B f8 ]  Now that I have the White king where I want him I just need to make a waste move with my bishop to force the king off its square so that I can control that square once the king is off making the barrier tighter.
 [ Q x d4 ] , [ a6 ]  wanting to stop any [ B a6 ] moves when I advance my d pawn
 [ O-O ]  [ N x c3 ]  [ b x c3 ] , [ B e7 ]  Well at the very least I got him to waste some tempo retreating the bishop.
 [ B e7 ]  [ g5 ]  [ N f d7 ]  [ h4 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ Q e2 ]  [ a6 ]  [ O-O-O ]  [ b5 ]  [ f4 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ B g2 ]  [ O-O-O ]  [ e5 ] , [ d5 ]  14...[ d5 ] appears to be a mistake. Perhaps 14...de would've been preferable.
 [ Q x h8 + ]  [ B f8 ]  [ f4 ]  [ Q e7 ]  [ Q e5 ] , [ B g7 ]  Trying to get the Queen out of my territory
 [ N f6 ] , [ B x a8 ]  26. Nf6?? loses a lot more than just the exchange. Black needed to make some running room for his queen. But with the queen supported by her rook on the f-file white couldn't trap black's queen immediately. Now that file is blocked by the black knight and black's queen is trapped. White can simply play 27. Rf1? and win the black queen for a rook (how often do I get to put a ? on winning a queen for a mere rook?). But white can also play 27. Bxa8! and win that rook for free - if black recaptures on [ [ a8 ] ] 28. [ R f1 ] still wins the queen. Black must save his queen which will allow the white bishop to escape from [ [ a8 ] ] - or white can leave it there because black's queen is only safe on [ f2 ] white the black rook remains on f8.
 [ N c3 ] , [ N x e4 ]  pressuring the attack
 [ B x f8 ] , [ R x f8 ]  If 21...[ K x [ f8 ] ] 22.[ R x h7 ] with a huge advantage for White. But now the BK can't escape through [ f8 ] at all.
 [ e4 ] , [ d5 ]  The Scandinavian Defence sometimes called Centre Counter Defence (ECO B01). It is one of the oldest known openings first recorded in a poem in year 1475 as being played between Francesco di Castellvi and Narciso Vinyoles in Valencia Spain. I have stayed clear of it for quite some years but recently the opening has again become a favourite of mine while facing 1.[ e4 ] with the Black pieces. After all I am Scandinavian myself. :)
 [ N x e5 ] , [ d6 ]  3. ...... [ d6 ] - this move drives my knight back and the [ e4 ] pawn will be regained next turn.
 [ N h3 ] , [ N x g5 ]  I'm up on points so I'll trade to eliminate the bishop pair
 [ e x d4 ] , [ N c6 ]  And then attacking it.
 [ K x h7 ] , [ N d f3 ]  This is a good move advancing the knight to a better square.
 [ d x e5 ]  [ N x e5 ] , [ c x d5 ]  Okay he wants to totally lose control of the center it appears.
 [ a x b3 ]  [ c x b3 ]  [ Q f4 + ]  [ K g6 ]  [ c3 ] , [ B f7 ]  The text sets the stage for the capture of Whit's threat on g7; but there's a devious positional trap lurking within the obvious intent.
 [ c4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e3 ]  [ B e7 ] , [ N b d2 ]  In preference to the older move N-[ B3 ] so that he can recapture with the Knight on [ Q B4 ] and so make a strong point of his K5.
 [ d6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N b d7 ]  [ e5 ] , [ d x e5 ]  I looked at [ N d4 ] which seems preferable to me from a positional point of view. But it seems to allow [ Q e4 ] which might lead to more weaknesses.
 [ R x a4 ]  [ R x a4 ] , [ N x a4 ]  I do not agree with giving up the exchange with the a-pawn however. You need to GAIN material (pawns) or get a definite positional plus for an exchange down trade.
 [ N d2 ]  [ g5 ]  [ f3 ] , [ B e3 ]  i didnt play [ K x a3 ] because after [ B x d2 ] i wont be able to reach the other passed pawn
 [ B f3 ]  [ R f x h4 ]  [ g x f6 ]  [ K x h6 ]  [ f7 + ]  [ K g7 ]  [ R f6 ] , [ K f8 ]  The carnage leaves the game as a dead draw. The [ f7 ] pawn will never promote unless Black plays recklessly for the win.
 [ h3 ]  [ B f8 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ h6 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ B g7 ] , [ Q d2 ]  17. [ Q d2 ] - the Wicked Witch of the West and the enemy dsb have my [ h6 ] pawn in their sights. Henry now adds protection to this pawn.
 [ Q d2 ] , [ e6 ]  Setting up arguably the most flexible and strongest defensive walls in chess history. It is known as the hedgehog formation.
 [ g x h4 ]  [ N x h4 ]  [ f5 ]  [ O-O ]  [ f x e4 ]  [ B x e4 ]  [ N x c6 ] , [ B x h7 ]  That pawn may cost the white bishop since the queen is behind it.
 [ Q f5 ] , [ B c8 ]  Black wins a tempo to improve his black bishop now d7-[ h3 ] diagonal is more valuable.
 [ d6 ] , [ R a d1 ]  I'm not too worried about losing the pawn on e4; at the moment it'd just help to open lines for me.
 [ Q x b5 ] , [ B x f6 ]  !
 [ R f f2 ]  [ B c6 ]  [ R f c2 ]  [ R x c2 ] , [ R x c2 ]  50. [ R x c2 ] - one pair of rooks have been exchanged. I now tie his remaining rook down to defending that b pawn.
 [ N g4 ]  [ g3 ]  [ Q e6 ]  [ h3 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ R e1 ] , [ N f3 + ]  23.....[ N f3 + ] Q-R fork!!!
 [ Q e2 ] , [ O-O ]  Tucking away the king and indirectly protecting the pawn from Bc3->[ Q e5 ] but [ B d4 ] still holds in a nice way. Alternative variation: 12. ... [ B d4 ]  [ O-O ] , [ R e8 ]  ...[ B d4 ] still waiting to be played
 [ b3 ] , [ B e4 ]  Saving the bishop and limiting the rook's movement.
 [ K c2 ] , [ R e5 ]  I told you.
 [ R e8 ] , [ h3 ]  This is a quiet move which opens a bolt hole for the king in case of emergency and is the simplest way to underline the fact that Black's position is hopeless. I thought for about an hour here without finding a decent plan and there finally came the eloquent move ...
 [ b4 ]  [ N b d7 ]  [ B b2 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ Q c2 ]  [ e5 ] , [ O-O-O ]  The King will be safer here than on the opposite wing.
 [ R c3 ] , [ f4 + ]  I start pushing his king around.
 [ h5 ]  [ R d5 ]  [ Q e4 ] , [ g5 ]  Alternative variation: 32... [ R x h5 ] 33. [ R x g6 + ] [Demolishes the pawn shield] [ f x g6 ] 34. [ Q x g6 + ] [ K f8 ] 35. [ Q x h5 ] $14
 [ K f2 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ R g5 + ]  [ K h6 ]  [ K e3 ]  [ B f6 ]  [ R f5 ]  [ K g6 ] , [ g4 ]  I pretty much had the game won here as I'll go up a pawn after this exchange is complete
 [ N x e5 ]  [ B x e5 ]  [ f4 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ f5 ]  [ g x f5 ]  [ e x f5 ] , [ f6 ]  13... [ B f6 ] is slightly better because bishop is not as passive as in this case.
 [ O-O ] , [ c6 ]  Giving my king a space for a manual castle.
 [ g6 ] , [ Q e3 ]  After stopping one threat I start sneaking up with my Q yet again. As I'm now threatening 26.[ Q h6 ] which would force a mate on the next move.
 [ R x b1 ]  [ d6 ]  [ N f7 ]  [ K c6 ]  [ N x h6 ]  [ K c5 ]  [ Q x c8 + ] , [ N c6 ]  
 [ K e8 ]  [ Q x e6 + ]  [ B e7 ] , [ R h2 ]  I was doing well until this move to attack Black's queen. Computer analysis views this as a mistake and that [ B e5 ] was better. I'm not quite certain how that helps or how this move was even any form of a mistake. I do know though that black was in a bad position and that white's advantage has grown to a big advantage.
 [ R b2 ] , [ Q d1 + ]  ? Black shouldn't be attacking - that pawn needs to be pushed and if Black keeps pushing it White will have to sac a rook to stop promotion (e.g 28...[ h4 ] 29.[ R d7 ] [ h3 ] 30.[ R x d6 ] [ h2 ] 31.Rx[ h2 ] Qxh2)
 [ O-O ]  [ g x f3 ] , [ Q x f3 ]  take with the queen which can move to [ h5 ] and further attack [ f7 ]  [ B b3 ] , [ b4 ]  What would you do?? The knight can withdraw to [ e2 ]  [ Q d8 ] , [ B x f7 + ]  lost your queen mate. He resigns. Kings gambit - always unpredictable. 11- Q [ c7 ] was the key move. Pl comment and rate freely. This is chess for fun hope you enjoyed
 [ B h4 ]  [ c6 ]  [ B d3 ] , [ Q b6 ]  preparing for [ Q x b2 ] and attacking rock and knight in the same time. good move
 [ R f d8 ]  [ Q f3 ]  [ d5 ] , [ e x d5 ]  I guess there's going to be a lot of exchanges
 [ B e6 ] , [ N h3 ]  I looked at where white was and this was the safest development choice but I don't think it was the smartest. White is going to have a hell of a time getting his bishop into the game while the [ c4 ] pawn is in its location. Perhaps [ R b1 ] in preparation for a pawn push to get your bishop into the game?
 [ e x f3 + ]  [ K x f3 ]  [ K g7 ] , [ K f4 ]  I try and get my king into the action
 [ h4 ] , [ N b c6 ]  Desperately trying to bring in some help. [ N d7 ] leaves the N no where to go.
 [ N g5 ]  [ h6 ]  [ N h3 ] , [ N d4 ]  And this is the fluke. I saw a chance to create a cheap threat and White overlooked it. I'm not trying to disparage my opponent by describing it as cheap; everyone misses these once in a while. I'm just emphasising the hopelessness of Black's position if White had noticed the threat in time to counteract it.
 [ N d6 ]  [ c3 ]  [ N c4 ] , [ Q e1 ]  22. [ Q e1 ] - the only square for Glenda.
 [ N d4 ]  [ B c6 ]  [ N x c6 ] , [ R x c6 ]  Happily accept a bishop-knight exchange.
 [ N c6 ]  [ c3 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ B g2 ]  [ N g e7 ]  [ h5 ]  [ O-O ]  [ h6 ]  [ g6 ] , [ Q b3 ]  Does the Queen come out too early?
 [ N f6 ] , [ d5 ]  29. [ d5 ] - pawn stab those carrion are espying a nice tasty dinner. Freddy hangs fire on that discovery though.
 [ N c5 ]  [ N x c5 ]  [ R x c5 ]  [ R x c5 ] , [ Q x c5 ]  23. ....... [ Q x c5 ] - typical of jstevens1 - tries to exchange her way out of trouble but there is still quite a lot of ivory on the board!
 [ N f6 ]  [ h3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ B e7 ]  Makes way for a castle to the kingside.
 [ K g3 ] , [ Q g8 + ]  Now as long as I continually harass the K the Black Pawns cannot move.
 [ R e8 ] , [ N e5 ]  This time I chose [ N e5 ] normally here I play 1 of 4 moves [ c4 ] [ e4 ] [ a3 ] or Ne5.
 [ Q x e8 + ]  [ K x e8 ]  [ R e1 + ]  [ K f7 ] , [ K f2 ]  Connecting my rooks to exploit my control of the e-file
 [ Q b2 ] , [ N b4 ]  I know that this will let his knight come up to [ e5 ] but I need to get out of the way so I can play [ c5 ] and counter the open line he has for his rook.
 [ N x c6 ]  [ c5 + ] , [ d5 ]  Blocks the diagonal and gives black a nice center with a passed pawn.
 [ R x d6 ]  [ O-O-O ]  [ B a6 + ]  [ K c7 ] , [ R h d1 ]  Doubled on d.
 [ N f3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ e3 ] , [ B g4 ]  Not a common move 4...[ e6 ] is the main move.
 [ B e8 ]  [ R e5 ]  [ R d7 ]  [ Q e3 ] , [ R c d8 ]  32. ......... [ R c d8 ] - doubling up on the backward [ d4 ] pawn.
 [ B f4 ]  [ R h3 + ]  [ B h6 ] , [ Q h4 ]  The final detail notice that 22.Qh5?? allows black to defend with [ Q f4 ] but by placing the queen on [ h4 ] instead white ensures that there is no longer any defense to mate.
 [ d x e4 ]  [ N b4 ]  [ a3 ]  [ N b c6 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N c8 ]  [ N x c8 ]  [ R x c8 ] , [ R x d7 ]  All of a sudden I saw two Rooks on the seventh rank and I felt totally lost. Bobby still had about 15 games going and had already lost one.
 [ c x d4 ] , [ Q a5 + ]  Snatching a pawn to counterbalance White's development and pawn centre.
 [ B x c5 ]  [ N x c5 ]  [ d x c5 ] , [ N f7 ]  Now the middle has changed up a bit
 [ h x g3 ]  [ d6 ] , [ f4 ]  To prevent a Pawn-storming attack on the weakened K-side.
 [ N c7 ] , [ B d3 ]  [ B c4 ] may have been ok but the a2-[ g8 ] diagonal doesn't look like it will be opening up any time soon
 [ b x c6 ] , [ O-O ]  White seems willing to accept doubled doubled pawns on the King file in exchange for an open file near Black's King. I do not like the open file but the doubled pawns and Bishop pair seemed like a fair exchange. Besides my Knight can be easily forced from this post. I don't like to waste time withdrawing. So.......
 [ e4 ]  [ B e2 ] , [ R x a3 ]  I think this move deserves a !
 [ R d4 ]  [ Q x f4 ]  [ R x f4 ]  [ g3 ]  [ R f6 ] , [ K e3 ]  My opponent burned his clock down to less than 10 minutes with this decision which is correct.
 [ K d7 ] , [ B e6 + ]  A kind of a trappy move offering the bishop in this way. But I was really looking to the King hunt that ought to have followed. Also strong was 17.[ e5 ] which move I also spent a lot of time looking at. The reason for choosing the text was a certain special feature.
 [ O-O ] , [ Q e7 ]  I wasn't entirely sure where Black's queen belongs yet although this does put some more useful pressure on b4. But I also wanted to vacate [ d8 ] for Black's rook which will pin White's bishop to the White queen. Again Black's position is slightly more harmonious than White's with pieces placed slightly more usefully: however this won't turn into a win just yet. So I simply improve my pieces' position little by little and create small difficulties for White.
 [ R x b4 ] , [ R e1 ]  Preparing to counter-attack on the 7th rank and hoping then to promote the advanced f-pawn.
 [ N b c6 ] , [ Q a4 ]  The knight will remain pinned to the king for the majority of the game.
 [ B x f3 ]  [ Q x f3 ]  [ c5 ]  [ O-O ]  [ b5 ]  [ B b2 ] , [ a5 ]  Unfortunately I wake up late to his pawn advance into my territory
 [ R e3 ] , [ R b6 ]  To menace both the b pawn and the knight.
 [ B e7 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N c3 ] , [ N c6 ]  Pressuring [ d4 ] and hoping to tie White's pieces down to this pawn's defense.
 [ B h6 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ e5 ]  Black closes the center hoping he can pull out a draw but with this many pieces still on the board that will be very difficult to do.
 [ R x c3 ]  [ N x a7 ] , [ c5 ]  good move the idea is to play 33...[ B e4 ] and some chances to create a passing pawn for black.
 [ B e3 + ]  [ K d1 ] , [ B f3 + ]  White surrendered as checkmate follows on the next move.
 [ K b1 ]  [ N x c3 + ]  [ B x c3 ] , [ Q x c3 ]  The combination has won Black the Queen and a pawn to further weaken White's position. Black Queen's is in a perfect position to continue the attack.
 [ d5 ]  [ R e4 ]  [ d x c6 + ]  [ K c8 ]  [ Q d6 ]  [ R d8 ]  [ Q f6 ]  [ R e6 ] , [ Q a1 ]  Blunder. With the material advantage black doesn't hesitate and exchanges. [ Q x f7 ] is best and dangerous for black
 [ d x c5 ]  [ N h5 ] , [ B g3 ]  After 8. [ B g5 ] I considered 8. ...f6!? 9. [ B h4 ] [ e5 ] as a way to keep the position double-edged possibly followed by ...O-O ...[ Q e8 ] and ...f5.
 [ h5 ]  [ f7 ]  [ h x g4 ] , [ h4 ]  A sweet move if I do say so myself. If white takes the pawn black recaptures with check and then he can maneuver his rook back to his back rank and defend [ f8 ] with both rook and bishop. Not at all what I want. Now black's rook is threatened so B[ f8 ] is out. [ R g8 ] fails miserably. Black has nothing. White must gain a queen unless black leaves his rook to die.
 [ K h8 ] , [ N g5 ]  Threatening 23.Nxh7! [ K x h7 ] 24.[ R h5 + ]  [ N b6 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ Q a5 ]  [ B x f8 ]  [ N x d5 ] , [ B x g7 + ]  ?! Eliminating the black K's last remaining defender but after the game I found 25.Qe4! which leads to a much quicker win (the GK game analysis computer agrees).
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ g3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ d4 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ Q x d1 + ]  [ K x d1 ]  [ B g4 + ]  [ B e2 ]  [ O-O-O + ]  [ B d2 ]  [ B x e2 + ]  [ K x e2 ]  [ N e7 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ R d4 ]  [ R a d1 ]  [ R x d1 ]  [ R x d1 ]  [ h6 ]  [ B f4 ] , [ B b4 ]  This is blacks first mistake. And as a result I earn a pawn
 [ N x h8 ]  [ B x h8 ] , [ N x c8 + ]  Royal fork !! [ R x c1 ] takes care of that.
 [ N f5 ]  [ g3 ]  [ N x e3 ]  [ R x e3 ] , [ B f6 ]  31. ........ Bf6? - this retreat now transforms Glenda the Defender into Glenda the Offender. One pawn drops .........
 [ c5 ]  [ R f e1 ] , [ O-O ]  23. ...... 0-0 - finally Henry is tucked away - on move 23.
 [ B x d3 ] , [ B x d3 ]  ...and make him hard to castle?
 [ b4 ] , [ b5 ]  symmetrical
 [ f3 + ]  [ K g3 ] , [ B f6 ]  I attempt to drive away the knight
 [ Q x h5 ]  [ b2 ]  [ Q h7 + ]  [ K d6 ]  [ Q h6 + ]  [ K c7 ]  [ Q g7 + ]  [ K b6 ]  [ Q f6 + ]  [ Q c6 ]  [ Q d8 + ]  [ K c5 ]  [ Q f8 + ]  [ Q d6 ]  [ Q c8 + ] , [ K d4 ]  I can capture some white pawns and make sure he can't queen or trade queens and then use his pawn advantage to make me lose my queen
 [ N f6 ] , [ O-O ]  Putting the king away and preparing to put my rook into that e-file.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ d3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B b4 ] , [ B d2 ]  A trade off between aggression and defence. The pin is broken but there is not any immediate pressure being placed against black's king side.
 [ R x h2 ]  [ B x h2 ] , [ R x e6 + ]  [%clk 0:00:21] I got some seconds and a very nice outpost and a pawn more than he!
 [ R f2 ]  [ N c5 ]  [ B f1 ]  [ N e6 ] , [ R d7 ]  Hog on the 7th rank.
 [ Q c2 ]  [ Q f5 ]  [ Q x f5 ]  [ R x f5 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ R g5 ]  [ f3 ] , [ e4 ]  My turn to poke a little hole in his defenses.
 [ b3 ]  [ B c5 ] , [ N a4 ]  I'm still trying to think of a way to develop my QB.
 [ Q x c6 + ] , [ K x c6 ]  
 [ h4 ] , [ b4 ]  If my opponent hadn't resigned here what is best: [ K c1 ] or h5?
 [ N f3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ e6 ] , [ e3 ]  Why not [ c4 ] here? It would stake claim to some of the center immediately.
 [ d x c6 ]  [ R x b5 ]  [ Q x b5 ] , [ Q x e1 ]  Here White should simply accept his losses and go home with 28.[ Q f1 ] hoping to develop his Bishop push the center and maybe somehow get a draw with his advanced c-pawn as a counter to Black's Knight.
 [ R h6 ]  [ B x g4 ] , [ R g8 ]  This is the test.
 [ d5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ e4 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ N g5 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ B x f7 + ]  [ K d7 ]  [ Q x g4 + ]  [ N x g4 ]  [ B e6 + ]  [ K c6 ]  [ B x g4 ]  [ B g7 ] , [ N c3 ]  I wanted to try a different approach.
 [ N e4 ]  [ N d7 ] , [ B d4 ]  There we go. things looking good for White now.
 [ e x f3 ] , [ R x f3 ]  And there is the point of this. If Black moves 25. [ N x f4 ] 26. [ B x f4 ] and then if say 26...[ B e6 ] 27. [ B x h5 ] If Black doesn't move his LSB then the [ R a8 ] is lost.
 [ N f6 ] , [ Q e2 ]  My intention here was to line my queen up with the black king
 [ g5 ]  [ R a2 ]  [ a5 ] , [ Q d2 ]  More lost time with his queen.
 [ N f3 ]  [ Q c7 ] , [ h3 ]  As mentioned before ...[ B g4 ] has given me grief in past games against the Scandinavian so I decided to prevent it.
 [ R c7 ] , [ R b c1 ]  I was desperately trying to make time control here with less than 5 minutes on my clock. I knew there was no danger except for [ R d1 ] so I just made a move.
 [ K b1 ] , [ B d7 ]  Keeping the b-file open.
 [ B b5 + ]  [ K d8 ] , [ R e8 # ]  
 [ B e7 ]  [ N b d2 ]  [ N f5 ] , [ B f2 ]  also preventing Ng3...
 [ R e1 ]  [ N e7 ]  [ c3 ] , [ N c6 ]  Just on basic principles White should play 9. d4.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ] , [ B c4 ]  Bishop
 [ R d7 ]  [ Q e8 ] , [ N e5 ]  I bring more pieces forward
 [ B x c7 ]  [ Q x c7 ]  [ B h3 ]  [ h5 ] , [ B f1 ]  ? White just wasted two moves.
 [ R c8 ]  [ B x d5 ]  [ R x c1 ] , [ B x b7 ]  Engines also consider my opponents choice to exchange his rook for a bishop and two pawns obviously aiming to push forward the passed pawns while most human players might have prefered 18. T[ x c1 ] ...
 [ f5 ] , [ a4 ]  37. [ a4 ] - this move was played to hold back b5. If black does play it I will play [ b3 ] and then if he plays [ [ h5 ] ] I will respond with [ [ h5 ] ] and black must then lose further material.
 [ N e5 + ]  [ B x e5 ] , [ R x e5 ]  ? A blunder says gameknot but still enough for black to call it a day here. 35. PxB which I had been considering is better; I'd missed that after 35. ... [ Q b1 + ] 36. [ K h2 ] [ R h8 ] 37. [ Q f6 ] that ... RxP is check. White is still winning but there's plenty for black to fight over. 35. PxB covers white's back rank and means black has to deal with the threats of [ h8 = Q ] and [ Q d6 + ] Still at my level it's too much to ask for an attack on gameknot to be perfect; this one was fun and the analysis instructive so that's enough for me!
 [ d x e5 ]  [ N x e5 ] , [ Q x d3 ]  He should have played [ Q e6 ] pinning and putting pressure on the knight.
 [ N x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ] , [ N e5 ]  TA has an attack lined up since he is threatening to fork with 17.[ N c6 ]  [ b x c5 ]  [ Q x c5 ] , [ B e6 ]  Doing what he can for counterplay black finishes his development.
 [ e6 ]  [ B x f6 ] , [ g x f6 ]  This is I suppose anti-positional but I'm thinking I can castle queenside and he will have to since the open file would be dangerous. It had to be better than the previous crush.
 [ R h f1 ] , [ B x c2 + ]  ?! -- Okay it's *not* an easy continuation to see and this *was* a speed game and both of us *were* getting short of time by now ... but these are not sufficient excuses. Black now misses the chance to put the game away with 21. ...fe6!! 22. [ N e6 ] [ Q c2 ] 23. [ K a1 ] Nc4! 24. [ R b1 ] [ Q e2 ] 25. [ R f2 ] Qe3! 26. [ N d8 ] [ B d8 ] and Black has 3 minor pieces for the Rook and on the next move will either win back his Exchange (remaining 2 pieces up) or will trade Queens. If White plays Qe3?? then ...[ N e3 ] threatens a smothered mate *and* gives Black time to win back the Exchange.
 [ N e7 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ R d f8 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ R g h8 ] , [ g4 ]  seeming the only way to make progress and setting a trap into which black falls
 [ g3 ] , [ K f7 ]  With the help of the king.
 [ N c3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ g3 ]  [ B g4 ] , [ Q d2 ]  The queen has to be moved to the only safe square what else to do?
 [ K e1 ]  [ R f8 ]  [ R x f8 ]  [ R d7 ] , [ Q h6 # ]  Black's play was generally robust but some moves were wasted away from the action and the move 18...a6? sealed the weakspot on [ b6 ] coupled with 19...Be8? secured the fate of Black's already half-entombed and isolated queen.
 [ N b6 ] , [ Q a5 ]  I had seen [ N b6 ] coming and decided that the queen was also well-placed on a5. White threatens [ N x d5 ] winning a pawn and forcing two piece exchanges or [ Q c5 ] threatening the queen exchange and driving Black's queen into passivity unless he accepts.
 [ B g7 ] , [ B d3 ]  ?! Consistent with the Colle and London Systems but I always think a [ B d3 ] is misplaced against a Black Kingside fianchetto unless White plans a pawn assault on the f-file.
 [ B g7 ]  [ B b2 ]  [ O-O ] , [ g3 ]  5. [ e3 ] is acceptable also and is a favorite of Vassily Smyslov.
 [ N f3 ]  [ d5 ] , [ B g2 ]  Of course Black likely won't play 4...[ d x c4 ] as doing so would give up a large portion of his center control.
 [ N g e7 ]  [ a4 ]  [ b4 ] , [ a5 ]  Blocking the situation on the queen side
 [ Q c2 ] , [ R f c8 ]  Freddy brings his other Rook over to the Q-side to try and break down my position.
 [ N e7 ] , [ e4 ]  Preventing [ N d5 ] or Nf5. Also stops ideas like [ e4 ] for Black.
 [ N x c4 ]  [ d x c4 ] , [ b6 ]  Despite the protection I'm now ready to exchange pawns. The reason being is to undouble my pawns on [ d4 ] especially since this is an endgame. As now I'll be able to use my King as a weapon.
 [ B e3 ] , [ B a3 ]  37. ..... [ B a3 ] - The Dentist has enough knowledge of endgames to know not to exchange down into a K & P ending here with a pawn minus. Henry now moves towards the kingside pawns - he senses a fine supper there p(r)awns with garlic and a lovely side salad - truly fit for a king!
 [ N f3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B g2 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B e7 ]  [ c x d5 ] , [ N x d5 ]  I would have expected 7... exd5; 8.dxc5; Black has an isolated center pawn but he also takes the initiave.
 [ d3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ B b3 ] , [ d x e4 ]  This exchange is good as if 7. [ N x e4 ] [ N x e4 ] 8. [ d x e4 ] [ Q x d1 ] 9. [ K x d1 ] leaves white unable to castle with the king stuck on an exposed central file.
 [ N d5 ]  [ B g3 ] , [ B g4 ]  A natural developing developing move and all is good (at least he thinks that way). So now black is ready to take the knight in [ f3 ] but he forgets about another a more dangerous white knight.
 [ N x c3 ] , [ b x c3 ]  white is in no hurry to loose his bishops in this position and the pawn's prevent any nasty surprizes from the two active dark squared pieces
 [ Q x h6 ] , [ R e2 ]  White cleverly gained a pawn while protecting his en prise knight. Black responds by getting a rook on the 7th (2nd really but it's black's 7th rank) doubling the threat on the white knight but also adding pressure on white's king.
 [ K b1 ] , [ c5 ]  According to the computer this is where I first go astray it prefers [ a5 ]  [ N g3 ]  [ f6 ]  [ B e3 ] , [ a5 ]  intending an eventual [ a4 ] then [ b4 ]  [ R h f1 ]  [ a4 ]  [ c3 ]  [ b4 ]  [ c x b4 ]  [ c x b4 ]  [ B x b6 ]  [ Q x b6 ]  [ Q x b4 ]  [ Q x b4 ]  [ a x b4 ]  [ R f b8 ] , [ K a2 ]  According to the computer this is the first mistake of the game it prefers [ d4 ]  [ R x b4 ]  [ R f2 ] , [ N c6 ]  I want the rook on [ b3 ] so I can advance the a pawn to do this I am going to need the knight on [ d4 ] to protect the rook
 [ Q f3 ] , [ f6 ]  so points are equal to both
 [ B e6 ]  [ f3 ] , [ B e7 ]  Black has the idea of playing for [ [ [ [ d5 ] ] ] ] in the passive lines but should not be done now since [ Q d2 ] O-O-O owns the d-file in which the [ [ [ [ d5 ] ] ] ] boost would benefit White. Black needs to just castle immediately and wait to see what White does. If White goes for a cheap attack [ [ g4 ] ] then Black can go ahead with the [ [ [ [ d5 ] ] ] ] boost now that he is better developed and ready to castle. Play could continue [ [ g4 ] ] [ [ [ [ d5 ] ] ] ] [ g5 ] [ d4 ] [ g x f6 ] [ B x f6 ] and [ B h4 ] is coming if White doesn't play [ B f2 ] in which [ d x c3 ] leaves White with doubled isolated pawns in the endgame
 [ d5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ c6 ] , [ e3 ]  Forbids B to come back but opens line for [ B f1 ] development.
 [ g4 + ]  [ K g3 ]  [ K g5 ]  [ K g2 ]  [ K f4 ]  [ K f2 ]  [ K f5 ]  [ K g3 ]  [ K g5 ]  [ K g2 ]  [ K f4 ]  [ K f2 ]  [ g3 + ]  [ K g2 ]  [ K g4 ] , [ K g1 ]  If for example I'd played to [ f1 ] Black could play 73...[ K f3 ] 74.[ K g1 ] [ g2 ] and my King must move out of the way to allow the pawn through.
 [ c x d4 ]  [ Q x d4 + ]  [ K h1 ]  [ Q x d3 ]  [ Q x d3 ] , [ R x d3 ]  Suddenly the tables are turned!
 [ f x g5 ]  [ N x g5 ]  [ K c8 ]  [ R h8 ]  [ K b7 ]  [ N d e4 ]  [ K b6 ]  [ N c5 ]  [ B c6 ]  [ N g x e6 ]  [ B d5 ]  [ N g5 ]  [ K a5 ]  [ e4 ]  [ B c6 ]  [ K e3 ]  [ B e8 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ b4 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ a4 ]  [ B x a4 ]  [ N x c4 + ]  [ K b5 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ K a5 ]  [ R b8 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ g3 ]  [ g5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ g x f4 + ]  [ g x f4 ]  [ Q h7 ]  [ f5 ]  [ Q h1 ]  [ N b3 + ]  [ K a4 ]  [ N b d2 ]  [ Q h6 + ]  [ K f2 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ R g8 ]  [ Q f4 ]  [ R h8 ]  [ b3 ]  [ R h4 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ f6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ R h5 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ R e5 ]  [ Q f7 ]  [ R x e6 ]  [ Q x e6 ]  [ e5 ]  [ K b4 ]  [ K e3 ]  [ a5 ]  [ K f4 ]  [ a4 ]  [ N g5 ]  [ Q d7 ]  [ f7 ]  [ Q e7 ]  [ d5 ]  [ a3 ]  [ b x a3 + ]  [ K c3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ Q f8 ]  [ N g e4 + ]  [ K d3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ Q h6 + ]  [ K f5 ]  [ b2 ] , [ d7 ]  Why not [ e7 ] looking for f8=Q?
 [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ] , [ c5 ]  to open bishop diagonal g7/[ a1 ] for after
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ] , [ N x d4 ]  A strategic mistake. Black loses a tempo and allows the White Queen to come to the center very early making the K-side development a little tricky.
 [ B f4 ]  [ O-O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ B c5 ]  [ N f5 ] , [ g6 ]  Of course since I'm Black I *don't* want to exchange pieces at least until the Pawn structure is more favorably disposed towards me in an end game. However I do wish to drive the Knight from the fine square KB5.
 [ Q f3 ] , [ B e5 ]  I thought that this stopped the knight from moving but.....
 [ B x b5 ]  [ R x b5 ]  [ R c1 ] , [ R a5 ]  ?! This makes the rook more or less out of play.
 [ b x c3 ]  [ B d7 ] , [ f5 ]  Nice little idea to break open the center immediately and start an attack. By move nine I have offered up a pawn to the opponent twice already. If you see a sacrifice for a gain in activity you should always just play it after calculating the basic variations. Since gaining activity is the main goal of chess you will be doing the right thing. Usually the opponent cannot use a pawn actively until the endgame. Most players are afraid to sacrifice activity unless it leads to a direct attack against the opponent's king. They are under the delusion that the opponent can simply neutralize their activity and trade to an endgame where their material is decisive. Certainly that CAN happen and the activity is a temporary advantage. Yet it is a much greater advantage than a pawn and can easily lead to a quick win as well as gaining other permanent advantages. There are countless obstacles a player needs to pass before consolidating a pawn advantage. Also it is much harder to find good moves when you have less activity because that implies a defence. The attacker just makes threats while the defender needs to check the opponent's tactics and think much harder.
 [ B x c6 ]  [ f3 ] , [ R b8 ]  still holding off castleing and creating more pressure.
 [ N d5 ]  [ B e6 ] , [ B g5 ]  Attacking the Queen. But Bird has a riposte.
 [ K f8 ] , [ B a5 ]  I can trap the Knight if it decides to stick around. Otherwise I can drive it off and queen the a-pawn with ease.
 [ e4 ] , [ c5 ]  fiercequeen doing her job at the Sicilian
 [ b6 ] , [ b3 ]  33. [ b3 ] and DRAW OFFER of which I accept immediately. Gameknot analysis describes the position as roughly even with the miniscule edge in Ion's favour so this turned out to be a good acceptance. Avoiding a rout against Ion is a victory in itself!
 [ e4 ] , [ a6 ]  The least common opening I've seen so far but it's book and so far there is no concern of a mistake.
 [ R d a1 ]  [ R x a1 ]  [ K x a1 ]  [ Q f6 ] , [ R c1 ]  I found a way to stay even materially -- though my isolated e-pawn will mean my pawns are weaker than his.
 [ B c4 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ d5 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ B e4 ] , [ O-O ]  My Rook will soon take over the e-file while Black's development is badly lagging.
 [ B e2 ]  [ N g6 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ B e5 ]  [ B x e5 ] , [ Q x e5 ]  23. ...... [ Q x e5 ] - bishop trade. Glenda now threatens to hoover up another pawn.
 [ N g3 ]  [ B g6 ]  [ h4 ]  [ h6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N d7 ] , [ h5 ]  I chose to play the Spassky Variation...
 [ N x e3 ]  [ N x e3 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ K h1 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ R e2 ]  [ a4 ] , [ b4 ]  Keeping the queenside files blocked.
 [ a3 ]  [ N f4 ]  [ R f e1 ] , [ B g4 ]  Exchanging on [ f3 ] would make a mess of white's kingside.
 [ c x b4 ]  [ a x b4 ] , [ B x b4 ]  white's pawn is pinned so white lost another pawn.
 [ d5 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ g6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ B g7 ]  Now [ d6 ] is interesting... I know there is a lot of theory about all this but I don't have any access to it unless I spend more time than reasonable to find out... e4-[ e5 ] if allowed can be deadly for black unless he defends properly...
 [ d5 ] , [ c x d5 ]  I made a tactical error having Q vulnerable to a potential fork so best to take wih [ c4 ] I was thinking of [ e5 ] threatening N but with the Q where she is could lead to problems.
 [ e4 ] , [ g6 ]  Okay on with the show. Tal is white here and he is playing against Tringov and this game was played in Amsterdam 1964. Tal kicks off with [ e4 ] and Tringov responds with g6.
 [ K b8 ]  [ R e8 + ]  [ R c8 ]  [ R x c8 + ] , [ K x c8 ]  And as we know this is a theoretical win.
 [ B e3 ]  [ B f3 ]  [ B f4 ] , [ B e1 ]  Alternative variation: 38. [ B x f4 ] [ e x f4 ] 39. [ K d2 ] [ K e5 ] [ looks like a draw but black has the better chances. ]
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ d4 ]  If White wanted to avoid the Sveshnikov this was his chance with either 3. [ N c3 ] or the more respectable 3. Bb5.
 [ R f3 ] , [ R a1 ]  time for some real chess...
 [ e5 ] , [ f x e5 ]  So may as well take it!
 [ O-O ] , [ a6 ]  ? This pawn formation doesn't for some reason feel right.
 [ N x h3 + ] , [ K g2 ]  ? Allows mate in two.
 [ Q x c6 + ] , [ N b7 ]  Forced. Can you see how to proceed with the attack? Which is white's most direct way to make a threat?
 [ N f3 ] , [ c x d4 ]  This also helps me giving me the [ c3 ] square for my knight. More common is to leave the tension and try force white's knight to [ a3 ] or [ d2 ] instead.
 [ K f7 ]  [ b4 ]  [ N e7 ] , [ N d4 ]  Bad bad bad move. This is the second time in a team game where I've had my moves planned out and then I made a move out-of-order. The last time I did it I had to immediately ask for a draw (and I think he pitied me and gave it to me). This time maybe I'm far enough ahead that I can still win ... but it'll take lots more work.
 [ h4 ] , [ Q d7 ]  Counterattack on the Rook.
 [ K h8 ]  [ B x e2 ] , [ R x c3 ]  !! Of course now the queen cannot retake or RxB+ losing the queen!
 [ K g7 ]  [ R f5 ]  [ K h6 ] , [ N c7 ]  He blunders here. He touched and moved his knight and after moving stared at me and hoped that I didn't notice his blunder.
 [ K x h6 ]  [ N b6 ]  [ R c6 ] , [ N d5 ]  21. [ N d5 ] - a reasonable outpost for my knight but unfortunately he will not stay there.
 [ R a f8 ] , [ R f3 ]  Yes this is a "superpin" indeed... two hanging rooks pressuring a pinned f7... and a BLACK bishop... but wait the white's king is still exposed... isn't it?
 [ N d7 ] , [ e4 ]  18. e4? - allows [ B x f4 ] winning a pawn.
 [ Q f3 ]  [ e5 ]  [ d x e6 ]  [ e ]  [ p ]  [ R x e6 ] , [ N f6 + ]  the winning move: White wins a quality...
 [ Q d4 ]  [ R x e1 + ]  [ N x e1 ]  [ N e8 ]  [ b4 ]  [ N a6 ]  [ f4 ]  [ N a c7 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N e6 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ R d8 ]  [ g4 ]  [ N f8 ]  [ f5 ] , [ B h7 ]  Black is using his knights to defend - they are completely useless as attacking pieces for the time being.
 [ e3 ] , [ N c6 ]  Keeping up the pressure and/or offering up a bit of a gambit sort of a black version of the Queen's Gambit.
 [ a5 ]  [ f3 ]  [ a6 ] , [ K h3 ]  Obviously Black's only hope is to give up his rook for the a-pawn and win the white f-pawn with his king. In order to do this Black needs to sacrifice on [ a7 ] at a moment when White must recapture with the rook.
 [ K x f7 ]  [ R x f4 + ]  [ N f6 ] , [ N d5 ]  Unfortunately too little too late.
 [ B x f3 ] , [ e4 ]  now a 3rd time
 [ a4 ]  [ b6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B a6 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N d5 ] , [ N d4 ]  He threatens 2 different checks (both of which could be met) while I "pin" the g-pawn or the g-knight because of Nf3.
 [ Q x g4 ]  [ N x d2 + ]  [ K e2 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ Q g3 ]  [ N d x c4 ]  [ N f5 ]  [ Q f6 ] , [ N d5 ]  Offering him a free knight!
 [ g4 ] , [ Q c3 ]  I know. But there is no point in defending I will lose sooner or later so go on with the "banzai attack". I analyzed that I had a chance to survive to the subsequent checks losing a lot of pawns but maybe I have still "something" up there.
 [ B d2 + ]  [ K b3 ] , [ B c3 ]  Threatening 25. [ B d1 ] mate. If 24. ... [ N b4 ] 25. [ R a3 + ] [ K c2 ] 26. [ B d1 + ] [ K b1 ] 27. [ K [ d2 ] ] with mate next move. 24. ... [ [ d2 ] + ] is a possibility but after 25. [ K f2 ] Black will still have to give up his queen plus the pawn on [ d2 ] is now a sitting duck. Freddy decides to give up the queen immediately perhaps hoping that he might be able to hold onto the [ d3 ] pawn.
 [ R c8 ] , [ Q x b6 + ]  Here black resigned as mate follows in the next move. Hope you enjoyed! I also can't get computer analysis on this game so any opinions on the bishop sac back in move 20 would be greatly appreciated. Cheers.
 [ K c7 ] , [ K c5 ]  
 [ K g2 ]  [ K g6 ]  [ R b1 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ K f1 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ K e2 ] , [ K f6 ]  Is white really headed for [ a6 ] with his king? Black's king must guard the pawn on [ h7 ] so he's not going very far.
 [ B x e6 ] , [ g3 ]  The long diagonal looks good for white's LSB.
 [ B b7 ]  [ Q x d6 ] , [ N x d6 ]  The Queens have been exchanged but White still has some problems to solve. [ e4 ] and [ c4 ] are weak spots his Bishop is bad and his piece coordination isn't quite so good.
 [ e6 ] , [ h3 ]  Since the B is never coming to [ g4 ] and there are no realistic threats based on ...N[ g4 ] this is an unnecessary weakening of the normal k-safety place.
 [ h6 ]  [ h3 ]  [ N e3 ] , [ B f2 ]  A 3rd attempt at attacking the knight in that undesirable position!
 [ N c5 ] , [ b3 ]  I begin the planned advance.
 [ N d2 ]  [ e6 ] , [ B d3 ]  The whole goal of the last 2 moves is to defend [ e4 ] the weakest point in the Stonewall.
 [ N c3 ] , [ d6 ]  Trying to break up my pawn structure.
 [ B c4 ] , [ N f6 ]  Instead 6...[ Q h4 ] has been tried a number of times... with indifferent success...
 [ e3 ]  [ B f5 ] , [ B d3 ]  Move my bishop out to discourage black's bishop from marauding the king side.
 [ O-O ] , [ g4 ]  If I prepare this move with [ f3 ] in order to prevent the knight's jump to [ e4 ] after [ g5 ] I self-block my queen's action on [ h5 ] that turns to be a nice outpost for the black's knight. I don't want him to exchange my bishop so I have to retire it to [ h2 ] and this gives black a valuable tempo for further defence. So I go for it at once maybe underestimating the power of his knight in e4.
 [ K g4 ]  [ K g2 ]  [ K h4 ]  [ Q f3 ]  [ g4 ] , [ B f6 # ]  Many thanks to blitzkov for this very fun and educational (for me at least) game! Comments are much appreciated and thanks for reading!
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ] , [ f4 ]  King's gambit. One of the most hazardous openings. One bad move and you are finished!
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ c4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N b d7 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ e3 ]  [ c6 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ a6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ d x c4 ]  [ B x c4 ]  [ N b6 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ N f d5 ]  [ B x e7 ]  [ Q x e7 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ N x c3 ]  [ b x c3 ]  [ c5 ]  [ R a b1 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ a4 ]  [ O-O ]  [ Q c2 ]  [ h6 ]  [ R f e1 ]  [ b6 ]  [ R b2 ]  [ R b8 ]  [ R e b1 ]  [ Q d6 ]  [ Q e2 ]  [ a5 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ R d8 ]  [ h3 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ e4 ]  [ N f8 ]  [ Q e3 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ B e8 ]  [ B x e8 ]  [ R d x e8 ]  [ f4 ]  [ f6 ] , [ N f3 ]  White prepares [ e5 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ e5 ]  [ f5 ]  [ g4 ] , [ g6 ]  Alternative variation: 30... [ f x g4 ] 31. [ h x g4 ] [ c x d4 ] 32. [ c x d4 ] [ Q c6 ] $11
 [ R c8 ] , [ b4 ]  now it is getting messy for me
 [ b6 ] , [ B g5 ]  So his development is now complete.
 [ d6 ] , [ N f3 ]  Looking to develop quickly
 [ K e4 ]  [ R f7 ] , [ K e5 ]  
 [ N e2 ] , [ g6 ]  Where to put the bishop? [ B d6 ] achieves very little whilst [ B e7 ] is just a bit passive for me.
 [ a4 ] , [ N g7 ]  Good thing the knight's popped away and even better he's blocked the rook so at least I can do waht I planned.
 [ f x g5 ] , [ g6 ]  black is afraid of white's g6. but it wouldnt be that dangerous for the black. besides 14...[ N e4 ] then [ B c5 ] and [ N f2 ] would give black a chance to draw.
 [ B g4 ]  [ K e1 ]  [ B x f3 ]  [ g x f3 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ O-O-O ] , [ f4 ]  I think you definitely wanted to stop Nd3. Having 2 bishops is usually considered better than a knight and bishop especially in a position like this that's pretty wide open not blocked up with pawns. The bishops coordinate vary well together and give you some compensation for being down a pawn. With that in mind maybe [ R d1 ] was the best move.
 [ K d6 ]  [ R h8 ]  [ B c1 ]  [ R a8 ]  [ B b2 + ]  [ K e4 ]  [ K c6 ]  [ R a6 + ]  [ K c5 ] , [ K f4 ]  I thought my only chanche was to take the [ f6 ] pawn and get to queen before him but he played very well.
 [ Q x f3 ]  [ B x b2 ]  [ R a b1 ] , [ h5 ]  If white takes on [ b2 ] then I get his rook on e1.
 [ R x a4 ]  [ R x a4 ]  [ Q x a4 ]  [ N f5 ]  [ B x b4 ] , [ h6 ]  again I think the e pawn was the one to push. [ h6 ] didn't serve you much purpose.
 [ Q g4 + ]  [ B f3 ]  [ N x f3 ]  [ Q d5 + ]  [ K c8 ] , [ Q x f3 ]  so far so good white has a pawn and the balance is somewhat restored... [ Q b4 ] [ a3 ] [ Q d4 ] is probably best for black or straightaway Qd4...
 [ h4 ] , [ B e8 ]  The bishop has enough time to stop both pawns because of how far back they start in white's position. Had either pawn been a step ahead of their current positions black would be forced to concede a draw.
 [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ a3 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ b4 ]  [ B d6 ] , [ d4 ]  I wanna started exchange some pieces and ultimately develop some pieces to attack...
 [ b4 ] , [ d4 ]  Going for the middle if my opponent wants to go down the sides I shall let him.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ] , [ N c3 ]  I started reading in books about openings that people usually don't play. This is the Vienna Game. Others include the King's Gambit.
 [ Q x a4 ] , [ B x a4 ]  The middle game melee is over and now we enter an endgame in which Black has an extra pawn for the exchange (i.e. P and B for R). The 'bishop pair' helps Black as do her slightly more solid pawns in the centre. All White's pawns are isolated and weak. At this point I would not have given much for White's winning chances but he's not prepared to flag it away yet!
 [ O-O ] , [ N b d2 ]  Well here i wasn't sure how to play so i decided Nd2. I have seen games where white tries to put the b-knight all the way to [ g3 ] in this position so that's pretty much what i did.
 [ B f4 ] , [ f x e4 ]  White advances [ b f4 ] black captures fxe4. Now white has a couple of options I can capture with my pawn or with the knight on c3. I chose to take with my pawn as I was not interested in swapping knights just yet
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B c4 ] , [ N f6 ]  Questionable but not totally beatable... yet...
 [ B h2 + ]  [ K h1 ]  [ B g3 + ]  [ K g1 ] , [ Q h2 + ]  from here its mate next move. where did i go wrong and where i could have done better? hope you enjoyed this rather poor annotation.
 [ e6 ] , [ d4 ]  time to break formation...
 [ h x g4 ]  [ h x g4 ] , [ K h4 ]  where it should have stayed...
 [ Q d2 ] , [ B d7 ]  Preparing queenside castling. I want my rook on the d-file.
 [ h5 ]  [ Q b5 ]  [ R d2 x d1 + ]  [ K e2 ]  [ R x g1 ] , [ Q x g5 + ]  Since the pawn has moved up the queen is free to eat material.
 [ a x b4 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ b5 ]  [ N e7 ] , [ B x b7 ]  Another well calculated venture that increases White's positional advantage further.
 [ R c8 ] , [ a5 ]  Just trying to advance a little
 [ K x f7 ] , [ N g5 + ]  I have to keep the king in check or else he can escape.
 [ Q b3 ] , [ b5 ]  My opponent overlooks the natural attack
 [ B e5 ]  [ f4 ] , [ B f6 ]  go ahead tke it...
 [ K b8 ] , [ N d6 ]  so white moves to safety instead of capturing bishop
 [ a4 ] , [ R x b3 ]  [ N f3 ] would have mated immediately.
 [ N c3 ] , [ f x e3 ]  Threatening mate on [ f2 ] after nine moves - can't be bad! I am sure she will see it.....
 [ a3 ]  [ B e7 ] , [ R d1 ]  Now white starts to press on the d column.
 [ B d3 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ Q b3 ]  [ B x c3 + ]  [ b x c3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B a3 ] , [ R e8 ]  the whites DSB is blocked on c1-[ h6 ] diagonal because of pawn [ e3 ] which blocked by the black knight on [ e4 ] i decided to develop the bishop to much more use full place like [ a3 ] this is long and very effective for the white DSB to move . white now all most developed all he's Pisces while black still behind with he's development .
 [ R h g1 ] , [ K h8 ]  He GOT scared! for nothing! And I won a tempo pulling away my rook from the white "radioactive" white diagonal.
 [ N x e4 ] , [ N f5 ]  He lets my knight live?
 [ a6 ]  [ B x c6 + ]  [ b x c6 ]  [ h3 ]  [ B x f3 ] , [ g x f3 ]  ?
 [ N c6 ] , [ N e5 ]  The key exchange
 [ N h3 + ]  [ K g2 ] , [ R x f2 + ]  I'm about done for Wish my rook was on e2!
 [ B g4 ]  [ R d1 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ Q x d8 + ]  [ R x d8 ]  [ R x d8 + ] , [ B x d8 ]  14. ............. [ B x d8 ] - two major pieces have been exchanged but I must develop my queenside.
 [ R x a2 ]  [ R x a2 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ B x d4 ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ b3 ] , [ N c3 ]  I think the knight should have kept his post as a blockader. but perhaps he was lost none the less.
 [ Q c7 ]  [ b6 ]  [ Q c8 ] , [ B e7 ]  So now black has nothing to lose.
 [ d x c3 ] , [ Q x c3 ]  ...and nothing happens. Now a diagonal threat to open if g6. But...
 [ b3 ]  [ e5 ]  [ B b2 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ e3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ B x e5 ]  I aim to "keep the draw in hand" from this point on. Even though it's an unrated game a draw against someone 200 points higher than me would be most acceptable. A win would be even better but a draw would be fine.
 [ N f6 ] , [ d3 ]  Opening up a line for his Bc1.
 [ d4 ] , [ R e8 ]  Now White's pawns seem to be under control and White cannot even back them up with [ R a e1 ] as my bishop controls that square. At this point I still thought it would be an easy win. What's notable about this game is that even though I get the piece advantage early on I never seem to be able to make much use of it and yet I'm not making any huge mistakes; indeed GameKnot's analysis labels only FOUR moves as mistakes in the entire game of which one is 3. [ B x f7 + ] and two come after the contest was really over!
 [ R b8 ] , [ a3 ]  Mate in 3.
 [ Q e5 ] , [ N g3 ]  Black has better piece activity but white has an extra pawn. Very close to equal.
 [ B x d5 ]  [ B f5 + ]  [ K c3 ]  [ N d4 ] , [ Q e3 ]  Trying to trade Queens to clear the middle area of any major pieces.
 [ Q x h1 ] , [ B b4 ]  I was hoping that a queen and a bishop pointing at E7 woulda been mate in one but the chances that I would succeed where 0.
 [ N f6 ] , [ O-O ]  The Closed Defense
 [ a3 ]  [ R b8 ] , [ f5 ]  this is a little bit less obvious but still valuable
 [ Q d2 ] , [ Q f6 ]  Time to attack. Black's queen is very strong on the a1-[ h8 ] diagonal with only that little pawn on [ e5 ] in the way. Further the queen on [ f6 ] threatens the undefended white knight on f3. 18. ... Qf6! surrenders the pawn on [ d5 ] but that is now inconsequential.
 [ Q d6 + ]  [ K g7 ]  [ Q e7 + ] , [ K g6 ]  Queen managed to take kings seeing each other this is it bad move loses
 [ N f3 ] , [ B e6 ]  Another disadvantage of [ N g4 ] is that [ B g4 ] cannot be played. However [ B e6 ] is not as bad as it looks; perhaps Black anticipates White's coming [ e4 ] and the exchange on [ d5 ] increasing the bishop's scope.
 [ d6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ R f d1 ] , [ f5 ]  This strikes at the center but the real threat is ...f4! and white's bishops become very passive.
 [ B b5 + ] , [ c6 ]  blocking the kniht i will kick it !
 [ B f4 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ Q e2 ] , [ B d7 ]  playing 16. [ B x e5 ] loses for white [ d x e5 ] 17. [ Q x e5 ] [ B d6 ] 18. [ N d5 ] Nxd5. therefore i continued along the lines of pressurising the centre and a view to a possible combination.
 [ K d5 ] , [ N d8 ]  Almost there...
 [ B d2 ] , [ N b d7 ]  It might be better to play [ B e6 ] before blocking it in with the N.
 [ N f5 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N d6 ]  [ B x d6 ] , [ c x d6 ]  29. ..... [ c x d6 ] - after this trade the computer gave my score as -1.35 so it is certainly gradually getting worse all the while.
 [ Q x a1 ] , [ N x d6 ]  Why not fork the rooks? Is P[ e4 ] so valuable?
 [ Q d3 ]  [ N d1 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ N x e4 ] , [ R x e4 ]  29. ... Re4?? :O a blunder that cost the game! Psychologically my opponent was too confident when rejecting the draw offer. Starting from that moment I properly analyst the position. To see this is very pleasing!
 [ f3 ]  [ h6 ]  [ N a3 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ c5 ]  [ b x c5 ]  [ B x c5 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ B x f5 ]  [ g x f5 ] , [ N c6 ]  Feeling good so far with ten moves gone my development which is usually lousy seems far better.
 [ d5 ] , [ N f6 ]  Now it looklike really to a King's Indian game.
 [ B x g3 ]  [ f x g3 ] , [ Q x g3 ]  Now I threaten mate in two in different ways.
 [ d3 ] , [ d5 ]  I like this move as it stakes a claim on the centre and should white play [ [ e4 ] ] he will lose a pawn and the right to castle with something like [ [ e4 ] ] dx[ [ e4 ] ] [ Q x d1 + ] [ K x d1 ] [ N x e4 ]  [ B g5 ] , [ N c6 ]  Possibly better in this position would be [ e6 ] however I wasn't too worried about the possbility of doubled pawns just yet and I certainly would be happy to exchange a bishop for my knight at this time.
 [ b3 ] , [ N f5 ]  Black has more active pieces. White is still cramped and struggling to develop.
 [ K x f7 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ N h5 ]  This is the "knight to the rim" move that prompted me to annotate this game. The black knight wasn't under threat. White's c knight could attack it but black still has a pawn bishop and king backup. The purpose of this move was to launch a surprise attack on the queen. If white ignores this threat she falls. But before you push a piece you should know where it will go. In this case the white queen must guard the c knight or black plays B[ x N c3 + ] and white ends up losing at least the knight. if white interposes the bishop black gets the poison pawn (b2) for free too. If white plays b[ x B c3 ] black plays Q[ x N c3 + ] and snags Ra1. So white must be careful about where to place the queen.
 [ K d1 ] , [ f6 ]  White king moves out of check and I develop [ f7 ] pawn threatening LB at g5.
 [ B h6 + ]  [ K c2 ]  [ B e4 + ] , [ K b2 ]  My king needed a place to hide here.
 [ Q a5 ]  [ K b1 ] , [ d5 ]  Black has the initiative and is now pressing white. White does have a potentially good attack on blacks king side however at this moment black is better.
 [ Q x b5 ]  [ R x b5 ]  [ R f c8 ] , [ N x f6 + ]  Completely unnecessary it doesn't even open the castle...
 [ d4 ]  [ O-O ] , [ B d3 ]  The best square for the bishop in this case because now the bishop directly aims at the black kings fortress. Very important in this game as we will see.
 [ N f6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ] , [ e5 ]  White thought he could support a pawn push to [ [ e5 ] ] with a move like 11. [ d4 ] with the idea of chasing away my knight and winning the game. Moreover White thought that "striking while the iron was hot" (with 12. e5) was better than first recapturing (12. cxd5). But in the process he forgot that [ [ e5 ] ] was defended twice by my knight and pawn.
 [ B e5 ] , [ B g8 ]  Hoping to exploit white square weaknesses but Black is prepared.
 [ Q f3 ] , [ N d2 ]  he gave me a rook.
 [ B f3 ] , [ R e8 ]  Checkmate threat (Re1#).
 [ R x h4 + ]  [ K g1 ] , [ N e4 ]  I know I will lose the knight but I wanted him to move his pawns in front of the king while taking time to hide my king and get activated the rest of my forces. [ N g4 ] does nothing.
 [ N x d4 ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ N d5 ] , [ B x d5 ]  Nor will Black accept my Knight in such a good position although the capture with the Bishop surprised me but is probably better. 18. ... [ N x d5 ] 19. [ c x d5 ] [ B d7 ] leaves the Bishop in a poor position as compared to the Knight on [ f6 ]  [ R a b8 ] , [ g4 ]  My hope was to drive off the Black Knight and then push the f pawn followed up by the Rook and the Queen
 [ K e7 ]  [ N f5 + ] , [ K f8 ]  putting black king in less defensive position while restricting H rook
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ a6 ]  [ B a4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B e7 ]  [ R e1 ] , [ d6 ]  Deciding to slow down I go with [ [ d6 ] ] rather than b5... I must say that I really don't like [ [ b5 ] ] at all it never seems to deliver cramps the queenside and increases its vulnerability to attack! In the Game Database 11 000 people went with [ [ b5 ] ] and only 379 with [ [ d6 ] ] go figure?
 [ B d5 ] , [ N a5 ]  Exposing the rook though attacking white's queen.
 [ B b7 ] , [ R d8 ]  Once again the mobility of the black king is a problem. [ R b8 ] fails.
 [ Q x d6 ]  [ B x d6 ]  [ a5 ]  [ N e2 ]  [ c x d4 ] , [ N x d4 ]  When I can I like to recapture central pawns with pieces because it makes them very powerful and in this case helps protect my pawn on f2.
 [ e4 ] , [ g6 ]  1....... [ g6 ] - starting the Robatsch Defense - prepares to develop dsb on g7.
 [ R d4 ]  [ f5 ] , [ N c7 ]  this move threatens a nasty fork on [ e6 ] and so gains a tempo
 [ R d c1 ] , [ B b4 ]  Black does not want to trade especially the dark square Bishop. He wants to maintain the pressure. It is much easier to play with the Black side now. Carlsen has to go into holding this game mode as White has no concrete plan to play for any kind of advantage. As I said a few moves earlier it is in Carlsen's interest to trade some minor pieces off. Otherwise Caruana may have to much play. But as you can see Caruana is wise not to trade. He thinks he has chances to play for a win here or at least at no risk.
 [ c x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ] , [ Q b3 ]  Developing the queen attacking the knight and adding pressure to the weak [ f7 ] pawn. I don't usually develop my queen so early but can't find fault with it.
 [ R c5 ] , [ Q x g4 ]  40... [ Q d7 ] 41. [ f5 ] [ K g5 ] (41... [ K g7 ] 42. [ R c7 ] loses Q for R) 42. [ Q f3 ] with certain mate.
 [ B g5 + ]  [ K b1 ] , [ R d2 ]  (?) Played to reduce the pressure by exchanges but this proves to be the decisive error. Black can improve with 15...[ K e7 ] breaking the pin on the d5-knight. If White plays 16.e6?! Nxc3ch. However White can instead play 16.[ B x d5 ] [ c x d5 ] 17.Nxd5ch [ K f8 ] (17...[ K e8 ] 18.Qg6ch) 18.Qe1! (18.[ R h f1 ] [ R x f1 ] 19.Rxf1ch [ K g8 ] 20.[ [ e6 ] ] Qd6! is OK for Black) 18...[ R f7 ] 19.[ [ e6 ] ] [ R f5 ] 20.[ Q e4 ] winning material; or 18...[ R f5 ] 19.[ g4 ] [ R f3 ] 20.[ h4 ] [ B e7 ] 21.[ Q e4 ] [ R f2 ] 22.[ Q e3 ] ...
 [ N g e2 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N x c3 ]  [ b x c3 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ B x f7 + ]  [ K x f7 ]  [ B x f4 ] , [ B x f4 ]  It's not often you get to see the double question mark next to a move that looks so normal. Indeed with black up an entire minor piece and white's pawn structure in shambles it's natural for black to want to simplify. Nevertheless the annotation is entirely warranted: black is completely lost in this position being defenseless against the attack that is to come. (Interestingly it takes my Crafty engine 1.4 billion nodes and about twenty minutes to discover that white is far better here. I'm sure someone running Fritz or Rybka on a fast machine will get a quicker result but this is still surprising given how intuitive the approaching tactics are.)
 [ K h1 ] , [ B f6 ]  Harry puts his king out of the way of checks but [ h2 ] may have been a better square. I bring my bishop back into action. It has very limited scope now on g7.
 [ O-O ] , [ Q d3 ]  Not sure why I did this move. It just felt right.
 [ Q x c4 ]  [ R x c4 ]  [ R b c1 ]  [ R x c1 ]  [ R x c1 ] , [ R c8 ]  I want the rooks off for the same reason as the queen.
 [ R x f3 ] , [ Q h4 + ]  back with another check sensing a promising continuation
 [ R a c8 ] , [ B f1 ]  This move came as a relief for me. Had White continued his idea initiated by his last move and played 22.g4! he would have possessed all the trumps for a raging attack on my King.
 [ R f7 ] , [ b4 ]  Attempting a minority attack.
 [ h6 ]  [ B h4 ]  [ g5 ] , [ Q g3 ]  This was also a mistake for me. I was somehow thinking that pinning my opponent's knight to his king would be better than simply saving the bishop. I was overconfident as I said before. At this point I was determined to win the [ f6 ] knight. Instead I had simply exposed my queen to danger and taken by bishop's only means of escape away.
 [ e3 ] , [ e5 ]  White pushed a pawn to ee supporting his [ f4 ] pawn and allowing his queen to access h4.
 [ K d8 ]  [ Q d5 ]  [ R x b2 ]  [ R x g3 ] , [ R f8 ]  Marshall offers Swiderski a chance to win two pieces for a Rook...
 [ R e7 ] , [ K f8 ]  I moved my king to unpin my pawn and attack his rook at the same time.
 [ N d3 ] , [ R c a2 ]  The best move here for White is P-[ R3 ] eliminating the back rank mate threat. Instead he blunders away any hope of dragging out the game.
 [ Q x e1 ] , [ O-O ]  I finally castle.
 [ Q c5 ]  [ c4 ] , [ g6 ]  ? This move leaves Black's h-pawn hanging. Black needs all of his pawns to fight for the draw.
 [ e x d5 ] , [ B x d5 ]  The bishop isn't hanging ([ Q x e5 ] Qxg2#)
 [ g x f6 ]  [ e ]  [ p ] , [ N b4 ]  It looks good but black should have thought about defending instead. But the danger isn't so clear yet.
 [ K f8 ] , [ e6 ]  So many choices for black including promoting his pawn but nothing will stop 43. [ R f7 # ] except the knight sacrifice which only delays the checkmate by one move - as predicted back on move 20.
 [ f4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ f x e5 ]  [ d6 ]  [ e x d6 ]  [ B x d6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ g5 ]  [ g3 ]  [ g4 ]  [ N h4 ]  [ N e7 ]  [ d4 ]  [ N g6 ]  [ N x g6 ] , [ h x g6 ]  The starting position.
 [ Q x f7 + ]  [ B e7 ] , [ K g2 ]  avoiding the check after q[ x g7 ]  [ Q x g7 ] , [ R f8 ]  with white's knight useless black has all the initiative here. white's queen will not be able to prosecute a mating attack on its own.
 [ B c3 ] , [ N h5 ]  Going to the other weak [ f4 ] square
 [ d6 ]  [ K h7 ] , [ R x f6 ]  Taking advantage of the pinned bishop
 [ N b c6 ]  [ a3 ]  [ N g6 ] , [ Q e2 ]  protect me pawn
 [ Q b7 ]  [ R f5 f7 ]  [ Q a6 ]  [ R f7 f6 ]  [ Q b5 ]  [ b x a5 ] , [ Q x c5 ]  too much pawn white has take. black is doomed.
 [ b x c6 ] , [ e5 ]  The tremendous bishop finally comes into play.
 [ B x f7 + ]  [ K f8 ] , [ c x d4 ]  White wants to play [ N a3 ] but first I solidify my pawn structure and open the c-file.
 [ Q d4 + ]  [ Q e3 ] , [ N x h1 ]  The queens are destined to disappear and Black is forced to recoup some of the material.
 [ d4 ] , [ N f6 ]  A Team Match my 100th win on GameKnot and my second game against this opponent. The first game was titled "A Little Less Careless" and is annotated on 4/09/2009. This time I'm black and play the Indian system against 1. d4. This game consumes 33 moves in a 45-day span and felt gruelingly slow. And when all the dust settled this was the final game of the team match and the teams tied 3-3.
 [ N f7 ] , [ R f8 ]  White has a possibility to put the knight into play. But with this play I can do [ N f6 ] and put the white king in a dangerous position. And alternative was [ e4 ] which would lead to [ Q h3 + ] [ R d7 ] a rook lock and a very mobile white queen.
 [ B e3 ] , [ N e5 ]  Appears to threaten the white knight and the lsb which I was hoping to take as the knight is pinned to the queen my knight appears to be immune however appearances can be deceptive as we will see.
 [ N f6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B e7 ] , [ N c3 ]  [White's centre is slightly weak and he can't stop Black's queenside expansion so White is slightly worse already] - The development of both sides is nearing their ends and Keres already has a plan queenside. Hort's counterplay will have to either come in the centre or kingside if he can't stop operations queenside.
 [ B a4 ]  [ b5 ]  [ B b3 ] , [ N a5 ]  The only thing I don't like is that pieces will be exchanged. And I'm not ready to do it but part of the mainline is this early exchange. Thinking about what Ken told me with exchanges combined with there being little no time I decide to grab his center pawn.
 [ h x g7 ]  [ Q x b2 + ]  [ K d2 ]  [ K x g7 ] , [ R x h7 + ]  A splendid Rook sacrifice if I do say so myself.
 [ d4 ] , [ g5 ]  Analysis advise Black to play 3...[ e6 ] instead but I am concerned about [ N x g5 ] on move 4 like analysis wanted me to. Analysis abhorred my next move.
 [ g7 ]  [ R a8 ] , [ R h8 ]  Now [ R a1 ] and later Ne4.
 [ N g5 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ h3 ]  [ h6 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ g5 ]  Now my kingside is overwhelming. White can't do much in this position but instead of suffering a slow and painful loss he makes a blunder and gives me a pretty win.
 [ N c6 ] , [ d3 ]  I decide to open my other bishop
 [ Q f8 ]  [ N x c5 + ]  [ K d8 ] , [ d7 ]  As now he's threatening to win my B.
 [ d x c4 ]  [ N x c4 ] , [ Q c7 ]  A dubious move I can take the pawn on [ g2 ] and have an easy win but I was scared about [ R g1 ] but that doesn't give me any danger. This was really paranoid of me!
 [ d x e4 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ B e6 ] , [ c3 ]  I was outside the system for this move. I usually like [ N c4 ] but that's before the d-pawns get traded. I often play [ [ c3 ] ] in this opening because it keeps his knight off of [ b4 ] -- and the pawn on [ c2 ] gets vulnerable if my queen wants to attack kingside. [ [ c3 ] ] also gives my queen an opening if she wants to attack on b3.
 [ K g7 ]  [ R d7 + ]  [ K f8 ]  [ b7 ] , [ K e8 ]  All those king moves are fruitless but I do not see what to do.
 [ N c3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ N f6 ]  This seems pretty standard so far both sides are getting pieces in place for the coming battles. QGD games allow for development for both sides and don't seem to have huge attack potential for black right away.
 [ R g1 ]  [ Q f4 ] , [ Q e8 + ]  But seeing an opportunity I decide to avoid the whole mess.....
 [ B x f3 ]  [ g x f3 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ B x d4 ]  [ N x e5 ] , [ Q e4 ]  15.[ B x e5 ] [ Q x e5 + ] 16.[ K f1 ] [ R a c8 ] 17.[ R x b7 ] [ R f d8 ] would have left Black perfectly placed to exploit the uncastled White King.
 [ K g7 ]  [ R x h8 ]  [ K x h8 ]  [ N c4 ]  [ b5 ] , [ N e3 ]  Rallying what's left of the troops shouldn't have traded off all my pieces...I probably would have been better off now...
 [ K c6 ]  [ N d8 + ]  [ K c7 ] , [ Q c2 + ]  There you go.
 [ g3 ] , [ Q b6 ]  Nice move he's pinned [ f2 ] and fored me to advance the king wasting a move. Could move queen up but if he trades Kxg3. He is still unable to devolop anything else quickly. [ K g2 ] makes the pawn at [ [ e4 ] ] very important but [ K h2 ] take away a protector from f2.... I can guard [ [ e4 ] ] pretty well.
 [ Q d2 ] , [ g5 ]  Played because of the same illusion as my 17th move. ...[ h6 ] is still best.
 [ R f1 ] , [ R h2 ]  Intending ...RxP in response to RxP.
 [ a6 ]  [ R a e1 ]  [ b5 ] , [ a3 ]  Black's attack is getting there faster and White must take time out to inhibit the pawns from advancing further especially with the queen still on the file Black is trying to open.
 [ K x h7 ] , [ R x e1 ]  Great position for me. But still there's a long endgame to be played.
 [ R c8 + ]  [ K h7 ]  [ R c7 ]  [ B d8 ] , [ R x f7 ]  First pawn to fall. As you can see this is a slow game just the kind of game I have to play to improve my chess (if it would still be possible!).
 [ e6 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ B e7 ] , [ Q e2 ]  A relatively new idea the Velimirovic attack leads to very sharp play.
 [ R a e1 ]  [ R d8 ]  [ R e2 ] , [ B a6 ]  ? Not as strong as it seems because White can simply play...
 [ f4 ]  [ K f7 ]  [ K d3 ]  [ K e6 ] , [ c4 ]  White throws all of chips in the pot and attacks. I'm guessing he was counting on getting his king to [ b5 ] after exchanging the remaining minor pieces and hopefully winning the race to promote his a pawn before I could get my king behind his remaining pawns.
 [ a3 ] , [ N b c6 ]  pawn [ d4 ] on the menu...
 [ N f6 ] , [ N c3 ]  Knight is now safe and able to hold its square on [ c3 ]  [ Q c2 ] , [ N h5 ]  Again forcing my pieces into better positions. This is just plain suicide
 [ Q x c7 ] , [ Q x g2 ]  Now his Rook is threatened and his King will never be able to find safety. The K-side is shattered and the Q-side is undeveloped.
 [ N c5 ]  [ R x c5 ]  [ d x c5 ] , [ Q x c5 ]  33. ....... [ Q x c5 ] - I decide to get rid of that white horsie at a cost of my rook though I do get a pawn thrown in to the bargain too!
 [ K d7 ] , [ d5 ]  kicking the knight from its defensive square and was planning to play [ N e5 ] exchanging knight for his LSB leaving him with an isolani on e file and opening f file for my rook
 [ N e6 ]  [ b4 ]  [ c6 ]  [ N e3 ]  [ B x e3 ]  [ f x e3 ]  [ b5 ]  [ B b3 ]  [ N g5 ]  [ N h4 ]  [ K h8 ]  [ Q h5 ]  [ K h7 ]  [ R f2 ]  [ R g8 ] , [ B x f7 ]  The first important moment of the game where White misses the obvious pin on his pawn to which Black takes advantage of. 20. [ K h1 ] was safer eliminating Black's next move and keeping the pressure on. Now a fork comes.
 [ N x c3 ]  [ b x c3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ O-O ] , [ B d6 ]  White is a great position with the development of rook via castle. Control of the center is slowly moving her way.
 [ N b1 ]  [ b4 ] , [ g4 ]  i shouldve took [ a3 ] with my knight
 [ K d8 ]  [ b7 ]  [ K e7 ]  [ R e a1 ] , [ d x e4 ]  This wasn't so much an attacking move more trying to find a way for my queen to get back.
 [ B e3 ]  [ O-O ] , [ h3 ]  [ h3 ] ? Planning [ [ g4 ] ] already or just fearing a Black piece on [ [ g4 ] ] ?
 [ N d7 ]  [ N f1 ]  [ a5 ]  [ h4 ]  [ b4 ] , [ N f1 h2 ]  Kingside attack versus queenside attack. But when that happens I usually will give odds to the person who's attacking the side the king is on.
 [ Q x e3 ] , [ B c5 ]  !!Now I pined his queen against his King winning the game. The rest is a matter of technique
 [ R e5 ]  [ R x e5 ]  [ B x e5 ]  [ h4 ]  [ g x h4 ]  [ R x h4 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ R h7 + ]  [ K f8 ]  [ K f3 ]  [ R e6 ] , [ g5 ]  The Black rook is locked out. and the White king has an invasion route on the light-squares. Unfortunately this is where Black timed out just when the endgame was looking interesting.
 [ N x b5 ] , [ K g3 ]  Better would be [ K g2 ] to avoid the tactic described in the next move.
 [ B d2 ] , [ N f6 ]  Developing classically
 [ B x f3 ] , [ N x f3 ]  [ N x f3 ] !? maybe there's other way that [ B x f3 ] and prevent [ N f6 ] moving around ... but there is a threat with [ Q e7 + ]  [ N e5 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ B b2 ]  [ b4 ]  [ b x c4 ]  [ b x c3 ]  [ Q a4 + ]  [ Q d7 ]  [ Q x d7 + ]  [ K x d7 ]  [ B c1 ]  [ c2 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ B b4 + ]  [ K f1 ]  [ N d2 + ]  [ B x d2 ]  [ B x d2 ]  [ B g4 + ]  [ K e8 ]  [ K e2 ]  [ B h6 ]  [ d6 ]  [ c1 = Q ]  [ R a x c1 ]  [ B x c1 ]  [ R x c1 ]  [ h5 ]  [ B h3 ]  [ f6 ] , [ e6 ]  My Biggest Mistake Of The Game ! Blocking the bishop path !!!
 [ B b4 ] , [ c x d5 ]  As he grabs a pawn.
 [ d5 ] , [ N c3 ]  I wasn't a fan of the exchange variation or the Panov-Botvinnik attack or the advance Caro-Kann
 [ a5 ]  [ B c2 ]  [ b4 ] , [ N e3 ]  by allowing this moveblack lost the [ h6 ] pawn the weak protected only by the queen due to the pin in [ g7 ]  [ b x c3 ] , [ b x c3 ]  doesn't change a thing
 [ K g8 ] , [ N x c6 ]  Treating queen
 [ N x h4 ] , [ B x h4 ]  to finish any possible counterplay
 [ c6 ] , [ a2 ]  Now is different. I will lose my pawn but the other will take its place. If white goes to the promotion I will get the first queen check.
 [ Q x h7 + ]  [ K f8 ] , [ R a e1 ]  IS [ c3 ] stronger? This move allows Queen to return home & defend.
 [ f x e3 ]  [ K g2 ]  [ Q x g4 + ] , [ B g3 ]  50. [ B g3 ] - the only move but black is not finished with him not by a long chalk.
 [ B x d5 + ] , [ K h8 ]  Note that 21. ...[ R f7 ] had resulted in immediate mate [ Q e8 + + ]  [ N f7 + ]  [ K g8 ] , [ Q f3 ]  Further analysis shows that 23. [ Q e7 ] had been more effective
 [ N x e7 + ]  [ Q x e7 ]  [ Q x d8 + ] , [ B f8 ]  Not [ Q x d8 ] because [ R x d8 + ] then [ B f8 ] [ R x c8 ] wins material
 [ R f2 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ Q f1 ] , [ B x f2 + ]  Here Fritz recommends ...[ e4 ] and Black equalizes. After the game move material is even I have a rook and a pawn vs. two minor pieces. This normally favors the minor pieces. During the game I felt that I might be able to obtain the initiative and get my rook quickly in to play.
 [ b x a6 ]  [ b x a6 ]  [ N h6 + ]  [ K g7 ]  [ N f5 + ]  [ K f6 ]  [ N d4 ] , [ B x f4 ]  Maybe 36...[ B d1 ] and a6-a5-a4-a3-a2-[ a1 Q ] wins faster?
 [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N g e7 ]  [ a3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B d3 ]  [ N g6 ]  [ Q e2 ]  [ a6 ]  [ b4 ] , [ N d4 ]  Attacking the queen knighttrade seems the only option for white.
 [ c x b6 ] , [ N b5 ]  Interesting move. I was expecting 15. [ N d5 ] [ K b8 ] [Forced] 16. [ N x b6 ] [ Q d4 ] [And Black is fine.]
 [ R b6 ]  [ Q d8 + ]  [ R b8 ]  [ Q a5 ]  [ Q d7 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ R b6 ]  [ R e3 ]  [ Q c6 ]  [ R f3 ]  [ R x a6 ]  [ R f8 + ]  [ K b7 ]  [ R f7 + ]  [ K c8 ]  [ R c7 + ]  [ Q x c7 ]  [ Q x a6 + ]  [ K d8 ] , [ Q x e6 ]  ...and the endgame is won for white. Very interesiting game despite the mistakes.
 [ R x d1 + ] , [ B x d1 ]  22. [ B x [ d1 ] ] - but look at that [ [ e4 ] ] pawn that Fou Leblanc has set his eyes on. Now that white's lsb has moved to [ d1 ] it is no longer defending that [ [ e4 ] ] pawn. Now that p(r)awn is about to grace Henry's table!
 [ R a d8 ] , [ N c5 ]  17. A strong outpost for this knight...opening up this game will just make W's pieces more active...so black has got a real problem here
 [ c x d5 ]  [ c x d5 ] , [ Q a5 ]  This one. If NxN fxN white cannot go [ Q x e4 ] because of Qxc3+.
 [ R x e8 ] , [ N f3 ]  The threat is still "on".
 [ N f6 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ N b d7 ]  Both players continue their development logically.
 [ O-O ] , [ b5 ]  Black may as well take the tempo given by White's decision not to retreat the bishop to [ b3 ] on mv 7. All theory of course.
 [ R e1 ]  [ R a e8 ]  [ B x c6 ]  [ Q x c6 ]  [ N h4 ]  [ Q x c3 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ B x c2 ]  [ Q e2 ] , [ R e6 ]  A queen fork is scary. However this woman has a suitable strategy. She waits until she can get into a position where she could cause a trade. Notice though that I haven't taken the pawn. studentofkerry had claimed the file already with her rook. I have challenged her claim and now I'm waiting for the perfect moment to claim the e file for myself. It has become a waiting game where one of us could make a mistake.
 [ B x g4 ] , [ e5 ]  This line tries to take advantage of whites seemingly weak knight and allows alternate routes for the dsb.
 [ K b1 ] , [ N f4 ]  So it's a waiting thing but after white's next move I make a quick decision on how to respond.
 [ O-O ] , [ N b4 ]  This is nicely placed here but is not worth exchanging my bishop for so I allowed it happen.
 [ Q g3 + ]  [ K d2 ] , [ Q x g2 + ]  pushing my luck double attack on [ d5 ]  [ K b4 ]  [ Q x b2 + ]  [ K a5 ] , [ Q c3 + ]  opponent resigned good game : )
 [ N b d2 ] , [ c x d4 ]  Trying to open up the position a bit.
 [ O-O ] , [ Q d7 ]  Planning to attack his Q.
 [ K x h3 ]  [ R f4 x f3 + ]  [ R x f3 ]  [ R x f3 + ] , [ K x h4 ]  after this i thought i should have moved to [ g2 ]  [ B f2 + ]  [ K g4 ]  [ R f4 + ]  [ K h3 ]  [ K f6 ]  [ c5 ]  [ K g5 ]  [ c x d6 ]  [ c x d6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ R g4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ d x c5 ]  [ c4 ]  [ K f4 ]  [ a4 ]  [ K f3 ]  [ a5 ] , [ R h4 # ]  ok well this game wasn't really my best if i would have done an equal rook trade i probably would have won...
 [ Q e6 ]  [ b3 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ Q b4 ]  [ b6 ] , [ B x b6 ]  OK so I knew this was probably a bad idea when I played it. My thought process was that I was getting my pawn back and after he recaptures I can play [ R f e1 ] pinning the knight and getting the piece back. Now this works but I don't actually win the pawn back. I wont go into detail of this variation but after [[ c x b6 ] 19.[ R f e1 ] f5. 20.[ f3 ] c5. 21.[ Q a4 ] b5. 22.[ Q a5 ] Qf6. 23.[ f x e4 ] fxe4] I have indeed lost my pawn once again. Thankfully he did not play this line.
 [ B d6 ]  [ N g f3 ] , [ B d7 ]  Both sides develop their pieces.
 [ B b5 ]  [ Q d6 ] , [ Q e2 ]  Renewing the threat of Nxe6.
 [ N e3 ]  [ R c8 ]  [ R f d2 ]  [ Q b6 ] , [ N x c4 ]  31. [ N x c4 ] - the black c pawn drops.
 [ K e8 ] , [ h5 ]  I judged that this was the correct pawn break better than 16.[ g5 ] and certainly superior to 16.f5. If 16...[ g x h5 ] 17.[ R x h5 ] and my rook charges into the attack. If he ignores the pawn exchange threat 17.[ h x g6 ] and if 17...[ N x g6 ] 18.[ R x h7 ] and if 17...[ h x g6 ] 18.[ R h7 ] - in short there's only one move that stops my rook from charging into the action...
 [ a3 ] , [ R e8 ]  11. ............ [ R [ e8 ] ] - rooks belong on open files. Here there could be a possibility of a doubling on [ e7 ] and [ e8 ] putting more pressure on white's lsb.
 [ h3 ]  [ N a5 ]  [ N b d2 ]  [ Q e7 ]  [ B d5 ] , [ c6 ]  Bumping back the Bishop.
 [ g6 ]  [ R h7 ]  [ h5 ]  [ N e3 + ]  [ K c5 ]  [ R c7 + ]  [ K b5 ]  [ N d5 ] , [ B c6 ]  Necessary to prevent [ R b7 ] and Rxb6.
 [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B b4 ]  [ a3 ]  [ B x c3 + ]  [ b x c3 ] , [ c5 ]  My favorite variation. It immediately attacks the center and I have a fetish for c-pawn moves in the opening.
 [ e x d5 ] , [ c x d5 ]  Jack: You took it? Joe: Yes if I didn't take wouldn't I lose material? Jack: I guess so.
 [ B x g5 ] , [ Q x h7 + ]  [ Q x h7 ] Blacks game is falling right down on him
 [ e5 ] , [ N d5 ]  Black's losing tempo.
 [ R x e1 + ]  [ K x e1 ] , [ R d4 ]  I thought it was more important to take down a center pawn. Plus with [ R x a4 ] [ R b3 ] white can get chances to attack the [ d6 ] pawn with a series of checks against my king and I wanted to protect my d-pawn after taking on d5. After [ R b3 ] it is not so wise to play [ R b4 ] and making the exchange. White's king can get to my pawns quickly--though it would still probably be in my favor.
 [ Q x f6 ]  [ N x f6 ]  [ N x e4 ] , [ B b4 + ]  The exchange ends with me leading by a pawn.
 [ R b6 ] , [ K b3 ]  I move my king to cover my pawn on [ b4 ] as he is the slower moving of the two bottom rank piece remaining and he could also defend the one on [ d4 ] as there is an enemy pawn on the c-file...
 [ B x e2 ]  [ N x e2 ]  [ Q b4 + ]  [ c3 ]  [ Q c4 ]  [ b3 ]  [ Q c6 ]  [ B a3 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ N d2 ]  [ Q a6 ] , [ c4 ]  [ B a3 ] is undefended and a tasty morsel for the black queen.
 [ g x f3 ] , [ N d5 ]  the idea is to control [ f4 ] but also threatens Nb4-[ c2 ]  [ B x f4 ]  [ N x f4 ]  [ R e4 ] , [ N d3 ]  and is a pawn for a pawn or if [ R b1 ] then [ R c8 ] protects [ c4 ]  [ R x c4 ]  [ N x b2 ] , [ R g4 ]  inconsequent move as the pawn is easily sacrificed to simplify further the position
 [ O-O ]  [ B e3 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ N d2 ]  [ N b d7 ] , [ Q c2 ]  There isn't much going on in the position so I am just placing my pieces where I think they stand the best
 [ N g e2 ] , [ N c6 ]  Safe gets a piece out controls central squares. This and [ B e7 ] were the only plausible piece-developing moves.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ g6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ e x d4 ] , [ N x d4 ]  It was only later that the strong continuation 5 B-KN5! was discovered.
 [ f x g6 ]  [ B x g6 ] , [ Q h6 ]  I've got him right where I want him.
 [ f x e5 ]  [ f x e5 ] , [ B f5 ]  Finally gets to play [ B f5 ] and exchange my best light piece. Now after the forced Bishop swap my advantage is almost non-existent. Black has solved all the opening problems and equalized fully.
 [ R d2 ]  [ R x f7 ]  [ R d1 + ]  [ K h2 ]  [ K g6 ]  [ R e7 ]  [ K f6 ] , [ B d6 ]  ??
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ g6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ e4 ]  [ d6 ] , [ h4 ]  Pretty straightforward move. In always every situation where enemy king fianchettos one easy way to attack there is through exchanging black bishops([ B e3 ] [ Q e2 ] and to h6.) After doing that [ h4 ] moves effect will be much more powerful you only not open your way to rook but also give a place for queen to [ h6 ] early. Simple tactic but effective.
 [ R d7 + ]  [ K h8 ] , [ R h6 # ]  Mate would not have been possible if the Bishop wasn't able to own this diagonal - it wins the game for White without making a check of its own!! A fine example of the Bishop's latent power more typically seen in the Fianccheto Bishop.
 [ Q x f6 ] , [ K x a3 ]  Topalov still erred in thinking that White had nothing better than 32.[ Q x a6 ] [ K x [ b4 ] ] and 33.Bd7. Really White has no other possibilities as the King is under mate himself. Alternative variation: [Black misses the best defense that let him continue the resistance in the ending playing] 31... [ R d1 + ] [And then] 32. [ K b2 ] [ R a8 ] 33. [ Q b6 ] $1 [threatening a mate from a5.] [ Q d4 + ] ([ At] 33... [ [ [ a5 ] ] ] 34. [ B d7 ] [is decisive]) 34. [ Q x d4 ] [ R x d4 ] 35. [ R x f7 ] [ Technically it is the most complicated decision.] ([I planned to play 35.Bd7. Analysis showed that this was also enough for the victory. White tries to dominate to press the black pieces and he prepares to move the King-side pawns taking advantage of the fact that the Rook should be on a8. Black tries to defend himself from [ B b5 + ] and not to let the Bishop go to b3. Nevertheless he does not succeed. After] 35. [ B d7 ] $5 [ R d2 ] 36. [ B c6 ] [ f5 ] 37. [ R b6 ] [ R a7 ] 38. [ B e8 ] [ R d4 ] 39. [ f4 ] [Black is nearly stalemated.] [ R c4 ] 40. [ B f7 ] [ R x [ b4 ] + ] 41. [ a x [ b4 ] ] [ R x f7 ] 42. [ [ [ c3 ] ] ] [After] [ R a7 ] [the only way is to play] 43. [ R e6 ] [ [ [ a5 ] ] ] 44. [ R e1 ] [and we come across a new mating construction. This time it is a front checkmate from a1; the Rook mates the black King on the a-rank.]) [Black must play] 35... [ [ [ a5 ] ] ] 36. [ B e6 ] [ a x [ b4 ] ] 37. [ B b3 + ] K[ [ [ a5 ] ] ] 38. [ a x [ b4 ] + ] [and it turns out that the Rook can not capture on [ b4 ] because after [ [ [ c3 ] ] ] this Rook is trapped and the ending is technically won. Then after] [ K b6 ] (38... Rx[ b4 ] 39. c3) 39. [ R x h7 ] [ R c8 ] 40. [ h4 ] [White has to win this position without much trouble. The Bishop and three pawns are much stronger than the Rook. White's disposition is marvelous and his victory is a point of time. However the continuation 35.[ B d7 ] was more effective and I counted on it during the game because frankly speaking I did not see that after 38. [ a x [ b4 ] + ] Rx[ b4 ] the move 39.[ [ [ c3 ] ] ] trapped the Rook.] Nevertheless Topalov took on [ a3 ] with the King and the line I dreamt of came true! Once again tried to check the lines and afraid to believe my own eyes I made sure that what I had thought of for so long
 [ B e2 ]  [ f5 ] , [ f4 ]  I think the best try.
 [ N f7 + ] , [ K g8 ]  Ano now NxQ seems to guarantee me the victory. But no I "have" to be "smarter"... :-(
 [ Q h4 ]  [ Q x c3 ]  [ R f c1 ] , [ Q g7 ]  And in this dynamic position White overstepped.
 [ f6 ] , [ g6 ]  Declining the pawn was wise. Neither I nor white saw the resulting force mate. White was still inconceivably (to me) eying the black queen.
 [ K f8 ] , [ Q f6 + ]  This was my first opportunity to get a draw.
 [ B x e5 ] , [ Q x c2 ]  Here I was considering 0-0 and h6. 0-0 seemed safer but [ h6 ] seemed to be a promising continuation further sharpening the position. I also quickly considered [ R [ d1 ] ] but then thought that committing the rook to [ d1 ] was not the good idea maybe later I would need to put the rook on e1.
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ e3 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ h3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ B x c6 ]  [ B x c6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N x c6 ]  [ b x c6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ R e8 ]  [ B e5 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N a4 ] , [ h5 ]  Pawn thrust h6. The center is closed so what do you do? Counter a closed center by attacking the wings.
 [ K c6 ] , [ d7 ]  another sacrifice
 [ c6 ]  [ e4 ] , [ d5 ]  We've transposed to a Caro-Kann which I'm generally more comfortable with than the QGD.
 [ B d7 ]  [ Q x c5 ]  [ N e7 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ R f8 ]  Don't know why
 [ B c4 + ] , [ K h7 ]  blacks other move was Bd5.
 [ Q e7 ] , [ B x h5 ]  ... finally I capture the pawn and in the process complete the trap on black's queen
 [ f4 ] , [ N f d7 ]  This move took me some head scratching. I wanted to play 8. ... [ N b d7 ] leaving my good knight on f6. But then I reasoned that after 9. [ N x d7 ] [ Q x d7 ] I would just have a knight that cannot go to [ e4 ] or [ g4 ] and won't get much traction on [ d5 ] either. So why not use that limited knight to drive off the white knight and then later I can play [ N c6 ] developing my queen's knight to a square that actually reaches into white's camp with some meaning.
 [ c3 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ N g5 ]  with black blocking the queens cover of [ [ g5 ] ] i jump in with the knight on [ [ g5 ] ] i choose this as it is clear black is looking to castle king side
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ f3 ] , [ O-O ]  A standard Dragon position of the [ d6 ] Open Sicilian. This opening is well known for being one of the most aggressive and crazy openings in chess theory.
 [ N d6 ]  [ h3 ]  [ b6 ] , [ B e2 ]  Stockfish 1.8 JA 64bit: Analysis reports blunder with score change from/to: +0.12 / -0.64 ( 14.[ b4 ] [ h5 ] 15.gx[ h5 ] [ e4 ] 16.[ N d4 ] [ N x d4 ] 17.[ e x d4 ] [ a5 ] 18.[ c5 ] [ N f5 ] 19.[ h6 ] gx[ h6 ] 20.[ B g2 ] ax[ b4 ] 21.ax[ b4 ] [ N x d4 ] 22.[ c x b6 ] [ c x b6 ] 23.Bx[ e4 ] [ R a3 ] 24.[ N d5 ] = ) This loses a pawn.
 [ N b4 ] , [ a5 ]  Taking advantage of Cobo's mistake.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ] , [ N c3 ]  The fact alone that I live in Vienna myself makes that opening very attractive for me ;-)
 [ c6 ]  [ f3 ]  [ B h5 ]  [ O-O-O ] , [ b5 ]  This move is a diaster.
 [ K e3 ] , [ B x h2 ]  It would be more exchanges or drawn mister...
 [ O-O ] , [ B f4 ]  Good occupation of the diagonal.
 [ R d1 + ] , [ R e1 ]  Nice ! White side has only option of moving a piece without quiting the game.
 [ R x d1 + ] , [ K x d1 ]  ...and again we exchange.
 [ N d5 ] , [ N e4 ]  this is the punishment... Where?
 [ N c6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ g6 ]  [ e4 ]  [ b6 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ B b7 ] , [ c4 ]  5. [ c4 ] - over the past few moves I have been establishing a strong pawn centre. If I had a pawn on [ f4 ] this would transpose into the Pirc Defense/Austrian Attack.
 [ B b2 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ d x e4 ] , [ N x e4 ]  I thought I might be winning a pawn here. My doubled and isolated pawns on the e-file are so weak it's pathetic.
 [ N x e2 ]  [ B e1 ] , [ g3 ]  ...but I miscalculated and returned the courtesy. This loses the knight. Better was [ N f1 ] and back to [ b3 ] - untouchable.
 [ R d2 ]  [ Q a5 ]  [ K b1 ] , [ R c6 ]  Preparing to double the rooks or rook and queen on same file
 [ N a4 ]  [ b6 ]  [ N x c5 ]  [ b x c5 ]  [ c4 ]  [ N g4 ]  [ B a3 ] , [ Q a5 ]  The first major piece ventures out combining attack and defense.
 [ K d7 ] , [ Q f7 + ]  Back again to f7.....
 [ N c3 ]  [ c4 ]  [ B b1 ] , [ N a c6 ]  24. ....... [ N a c6 ] - improving the position of my knight.
 [ B x f8 ] , [ d5 ]  Perhaps 26. [ R c8 ] was slightly more accurate but this needs to be played eventually. White wants to use the extra space to get his pieces on ideal spots and generate more than enough initiative to recover the pawn.
 [ K x h4 ] , [ f x e5 ]  With White having to waste a move with his king I can capture and open the file.
 [ K f8 ] , [ R x f7 + ]  WIN WIN situation i am thinking
 [ B d7 ] , [ N c3 ]  already winning is Nh4! with the potent threat of Ng6; not very much Black can do about it...
 [ N d1 ]  [ R h5 ]  [ N b2 ]  [ B f7 ] , [ N d3 ]  54...[ N d3 ] at this point acenlv took first place with a win over bcjuk but we could all tie at 4 points if I win this.
 [ B h6 ]  [ b4 ]  [ B x d2 + ] , [ K x d2 ]  It took 23 moves to get developed and I'm still not happy about the exposed position of my K. In compensation I have a two pawn material advantage.
 [ d x c5 ]  [ K c4 ] , [ N f5 ]  [ K d6 ] was much better here.
 [ K h3 ] , [ K b7 ]  Trying to use king on far side to open a pawn lane.
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d5 ] , [ N c3 ]  geniusacamel plays the classical QGD varation which is a favoriate of mine. For the time being white focuses on develop king safety before embarking on attacking in the centre.
 [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ e6 ] , [ N c3 ]  I am excepting ...[ d5 ]  [ b6 ]  [ B g5 ] , [ h6 ]  It is a good idea to break the pin because a lot of Black's counters derive from playing for the [ e4 ] square.
 [ R f2 + ]  [ K d3 ]  [ R x g2 ] , [ b4 ]  No matter what I would've played my h pawn is gone. But that is ok because I have two pawns that are better since they're passers. With that being said I come up with other ideas and that's maintaining a pawn chain because as I learned not too long ago in endgames one thing that is essential is a pawn chain with passed pawns as it helps you promote. I couldn't find the best examples and had made some mistakes as a couple of commentators in those annotations pointed. But this game is the perfect example of what I was alluding as a similar example was shown I forgot exactly by who but it was either an IM or GM and his video was very good and instructive that I was able to apply it here.
 [ e5 ]  [ f4 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ f x e5 ]  [ N x e5 ] , [ d4 ]  Hmmm don't move pieces twice in dev. Thats what they drum into you. So I didn't.
 [ c5 ]  [ b x c5 ]  [ b x c5 ]  [ R b1 ]  [ Q c7 ] , [ d x c5 ]  The real question for black is where should I stick my dark squared bishop (no comments please!). After playing ....[ g6 ] it seems sensible to follow it up with ....Bg7. The problem is that the bishop doesn't really do anything here as [ e5 ] is securely defended. Instead I would rather play it out to [ c5 ] where it is far more active hence I don't play ...Nx[ c5 ] but ....Nf5. Notice that ...[ N [ c6 ] ] is a mistake as he can play [ N b5 ] followed by cementing the knight on d6. Capturing the knight is worse; [ a x b5 ] follwed by [ c6 ] kills me off in short order.
 [ h x g3 ]  [ K h4 ] , [ N f1 ]  In preparation for another move which I miss completely in my desperation to stop the g-pawn...
 [ K x b1 ]  [ R g7 ] , [ Q h8 + ]  An alternative was (29.[ Q x g7 ] [ N d5 ] 30.Qg8#)
 [ d x e6 ] , [ B x e6 ]  Two pieces out for a central pawn... hardly a bargain but let's see.
 [ R f1 + ]  [ K g7 ] , [ Q c3 ]  this will do it.
 [ f x e5 ]  [ d x e5 ] , [ K g2 ]  So I start by activating my King.
 [ g x f6 ]  [ e ]  [ p ] , [ + ]  And there you have it. If I'm not wrong Black's king can actually escape mate via [ K f7 ] and then run off to [ e8 ] but the queen would be lost in the process of doing so. In face of such dire circumstances Black resigns here thus resolving this greatly satisfying battle of such a contested center. This was easily one of the most fun and puzzling matches I've had in some time; thank you for reading this annotation! :)
 [ B g2 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ O-O ] , [ N b d7 ]  If [ R e1 ] o-o-o it is still possible for white to sac the exchange (RxBe6) and go on with a nice game.
 [ N d6 ]  [ R e7 ] , [ R a d1 ]  Doubling on the d-file and preparing 21...[ R e2 ] 22.R1[ d2 ]  [ K g8 ]  [ N f5 ]  [ R e2 ] , [ R d4 d8 + ]  23.R1[ d2 ] is better.This gives Black even better drawing chances.
 [ g6 ] , [ N c3 ]  I'm grasping for development...were there better ideas?
 [ R e1 ]  [ d6 ] , [ c3 ]  First world champion Wilhem Stienitiz developed this way of playing the white pieces. He would first construct an unbreakable center with pawns on [ d3 ] and [ c3 ] in order to keep his opponent at arms length. Then he would gradually build up a direct attack on the king side often by advancing g2-[ g4 ] and bring his knight all the way over from [ b1 ] to g3.
 [ N b c8 ]  [ a6 ] , [ Q d6 ]  Black increases the pressure on the [ a6 ] pawn but is not yet anywhere near creating a threat of capturing it.
 [ B b6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ R h e8 ] , [ d3 ]  I was panicking here -- I think [ a4 ] would have been better as [ R a2 ] is then a possibility.
 [ K c4 ] , [ N d6 + ]  ...and again...
 [ N d6 ] , [ Q c7 ]  and black resigns in a hopeless middlegame.
 [ g4 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ R f f1 ] , [ R g2 + ]  And the "windmill" begins!
 [ f x g6 ] , [ Q x e3 + ]  If I had gone simply rook to [ e1 ] on the move before I would be in safe territory ah now the adventure begins.
 [ h5 ]  [ b5 ]  [ K e6 ] , [ b6 ]  My opponent resigned at this stage as there is no stopping my b-pawn once I get the Rook on the a-file. Best for Black might be trading his Rook for my Knight and a pawn but it is hopeless. This was a methodical win on my part and I was particularly pleased with 15. [ B b1 ] because it is the sort of move I never would have made in the past although I'm not sure it was integral to this victory.
 [ R x g7 ]  [ N h5 ] , [ R g1 ]  [ N f4 ] would be good here.
 [ Q b5 ] , [ e x f6 ]  you can have it now. (blunder also)
 [ R x g7 + ]  [ B x g7 ]  [ R g1 ]  [ R f c8 ]  [ R x g7 + ] , [ K x g7 ]  If 21... K-[ B1 ] 22 RxP ch forces mate.
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ b6 ]  [ g3 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ B g2 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ] , [ N c3 ]  This tournament game was a loss for me but I think its an interesting game. The game has a surprise in store.
 [ N x e5 ]  [ d x e5 ] , [ Q x e5 ]  There is no saving the bishop of course and the capture ...[ c x b2 ] would be only a minor irritation. Black's best is to bite the bullet with 13...[ K f7 ] or maybe 13...[ c x b2 ] 14.[ Q x b2 ] Kf7.
 [ R b1 + ] , [ K c8 ]  This move loses immediately after 29. Re7+!! which forces the king to [ d8 ] then its mate after 30. [ R b8 ] [ B c8 ] 31. [ R x c8 ]  [ R e7 + ]  [ K d8 ]  [ R b8 + ]  [ B c8 ] , [ R x c8 # ]  This game was probably one of my most spectacular games I've ever played. Black was crushed after black captured the poisoned knight.
 [ Q x d3 + ]  [ K c1 ] , [ Q f1 + ]  drives the king in front of the queen winning the bishop
 [ R b2 ] , [ Q c5 ]  My bishop seems to be a good support
 [ K h8 ]  [ N x c8 ] , [ R b x c8 ]  Things went downhill for black pretty quick actually. Well again I will play until the very end.
 [ O-O-O ] , [ O-O-O ]  ? And another mistake. Now the queen shows her power for the first time.
 [ Q d8 ]  [ Q b3 ] , [ Q c7 ]  black cant defend the [ f7 ] pawn because if 22...Rf8.23.Ng7+-Ke7.24.Qa3+and white win .
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ c4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ c5 ]  [ c x d5 ] , [ c x d4 ]  [Filipp Frenkel: This game is a demonstration of the difference in efficiency between active and passive pieces. If the objective is mate then one needs to retain only the bare minimum to fulfill the goal of checkmate. But only limited favorable situations can lead to the tightened noose around hostile king's neck. We frequently encounter a dilemma where inferior material side furiously prevails over superior forces due to more effective performance of their pieces creating tricks available to them. Here I was ready to give away one of my pawns for superior position increasing the scope of fire power of my pieces which give opportunity of obtaining not decisive but a noticeable advantage in the placement of my pieces.]
 [ B x h3 ]  [ R f8 + ]  [ K x g7 ]  [ R x a8 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ e8 = Q ]  [ B x e8 ] , [ R x e8 ]  Black could easily have resigned here but continues for the sake of his team.
 [ N c3 ] , [ g4 ]  Yea I have no idea why I didn't defend against the rook attack... it appears the wheels are coming off. Its all but over from here. I end up resigning. Thanks for the game Steven!
 [ N f3 ] , [ g6 ]  !? Hyper accelerated Dragon. Requires precise play.
 [ g3 ] , [ B g4 ]  I now moved my pawn to [ g3 ] to allow for my LB to fianchetto and black developed his LB to [ g4 ] Black has placed his LB on a spot where it can get involved very quickly.
 [ B x e4 ]  [ d x e4 ] , [ Q x e4 ]  Well if black goes for [ h3 ] I will be partly ok unless black can build some quick attack. Plan is castle Qside and get the bN to c4.
 [ f3 ] , [ R a5 ]  black sets up to offer an exchange on [ c5 ] for the troublesome rook.
 [ Q d6 ] , [ N e f3 ]  [ f4 ] seemed more sensible to me this seems a good time to press the kingside attack - now I am happy to castle and build pressure for a counter-attack
 [ e4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ d4 ]  White refuses the sacrifice avoiding open tactical play but in return black gets to grab a lot of space in the centre.
 [ c6 ]  [ d x c6 ] , [ Q x c4 ]  43. .... [ Q x [ c4 ] ] - black finally decided to exchange queens but before I could take on [ c4 ] he hit the resign button! After allowing my pawn to capture on [ c6 ] I can now get two queens on the board to nail the BK. Black sees this and it is game over wheew and double wheeew!
 [ B d7 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ R c8 ]  I'm still waiting for the eventual e pawn thrust which is I also think common in this version of the alkhine.
 [ B x d3 ]  [ R x d3 ]  [ R d8 ]  [ R f d1 ]  [ R d5 ]  [ R d3 x d5 ]  [ c x d5 ] , [ R e1 ]  Doubling on the e-file.
 [ R d2 ]  [ d5 ]  [ B f2 ]  [ N g5 ]  [ h4 ]  [ N e6 ]  [ K f1 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ B x d4 ]  [ B x d4 ]  [ R x d4 ] , [ N x b2 ]  I was quite annoyed here as I had missed that I can't grab the d pawn due to 33...[ R x e1 ] 34.[ K x e1 ] [ R c1 + ] when the knight controls [ d1 ] where I had planned to move the rook!
 [ h6 ] , [ N g e4 ]  ?! This is a good move.... but the problem is 18.Nce4! is just much better. Often in this line of the perreux variation if white can tactically take control of the [ e4 ] square he has a good position.
 [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ] , [ e5 ]  A surprise for me is just like I would play
 [ B x c5 ] , [ N h4 ]  OH NOW! Well... [ N e2 ] would have been fine but after the exchange my knight is poor a threat for white. So I go with the main plan.
 [ g3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B g2 ] , [ d5 ]  this is provocative rather like the sicilian p exchange. he can't let me occupy that sq.
 [ K f3 ] , [ R d5 ]  A last-ditch attempt to gain power in some ways a mistake. 32...[ R h5 ] would have provided an escape route for the rook. Instead he is now stranded in the centre.
 [ Q e6 ]  [ N d2 ]  [ O-O-O ]  [ R a e1 ] , [ R d e8 ]  Each camp has calmly regroup its pieces.
 [ c x b5 ]  [ N x b5 + ]  [ K c6 ]  [ a4 ]  [ B g7 ] , [ Q g6 ]  waht is the idea here? better was [ N e2 ] with 0-0.
 [ K g7 ]  [ g3 ] , [ e5 ]  I think this move just seals whites fate. If [ f x e5 ] then [ Q x e5 ] threatens mate and if [ f5 ] then [ B x c3 ] and [ e4 ] also threaten mate
 [ K f5 ]  [ K f2 ]  [ B d5 ]  [ g4 + ]  [ h x g4 ] , [ f x g4 + ]  At the cost of allowing Black a passed pawn White creates co-joined passers of his own.
 [ O-O ] , [ g6 ]  This move seemed to score highly on the databases
 [ g4 ]  [ K d3 ]  [ h3 ]  [ g x h3 ] , [ g x h3 ]  51. ..... [ g x h3 ] - under a set of conditional moves a decisive pawn trade takes place. Only one dear little pawn is left on the board so why should white resign two moves down the line?
 [ B x c4 ] , [ B c5 ]  Black threatens to win the [ f2 ] pawn but will need to exchange a minor piece to do so and I'm happy to allow this since I'm already 8 points up and it will leave black with just 2 pieces and a handful of mostly disconnected pawns.
 [ B a3 ]  [ B c7 ]  [ B c1 ]  [ K d6 ]  [ B b2 ] , [ K e7 ]  Black continues to use the weakness of [ f4 ] to tie White down and hamper his attempts to make progress.
 [ B x f6 ] , [ g x f6 ]  This move holds [ d6 ] and with it the center but compels Black to play the rest of his game with shattered pawns on both wings. White gets good activity for the piece he's about to invest but not quite the attack he was undoubtedly playing for.
 [ K x f7 ]  [ Q d5 + ]  [ K e8 ]  [ Q x e4 ]  [ B x f3 ] , [ Q x f3 ]  Happy so far with my position.
 [ B a8 ] , [ c4 ]  ..It would seem better to leave Pawn on c3..............
 [ K e6 ]  [ B x b6 ]  [ B x b6 ]  [ K x b6 ] , [ K e5 ]  And the pawns are marching in
 [ N g5 ]  [ O-O ]  [ b4 ] , [ N f d7 ]  Black has played the middle game like a seasoned veteran ... blacks king is safe material is not the central issue in this struggle developement king safety & unprotect stuff that what it is all about! 13. ...[ B x g2 ] would keep things simple. It wins an important pawn attacks the [ R h1 ] with tempo make white king position a little uncomfortable & [ N g5 ] would be looking for some help!
 [ R f4 + ]  [ K g5 ]  [ K f2 ] , [ R f5 ]  As planned though I can hardly say this sequence was forced.
 [ N c6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ d3 ]  [ B g7 ] , [ B g5 ]  Until this move everything was usual. I don't know what the idea of ths move was but it didn't existed in the DB. I decided to castle early because as I said I haven't played the Gloria variation so often.
 [ a3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ d x c5 ]  [ B x c5 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ b4 ]  [ B e7 ] , [ B c4 ]  For some moves Black could have chosen the isolated pawn on [ d5 ] instead. It can be strong - or just a looser. Mostly it depends on wether it gets blockaded efficiently or not. In this case I think the two White Knights will do what it takes so I decide to retreat my own Knight and keep the game in balance.
 [ K g4 ] , [ K b6 ]  I may sacrifice the knight and run my rook over to a to clear pawns.
 [ B x d8 ] , [ N b3 + ]  Here is the reason.
 [ b x c6 ] , [ e5 ]  pushing the pawn to make it interesting.
 [ B e2 ] , [ N d4 ]  White gave me the obvious fork so I take it. The move attacks the white queen and thanks to 14. Be2? she cannot get back to defend c2. So the real fork here is the queen on [ f3 ] and the fork on [ c2 ] - black is forking the fork. As a result 14. ... Nd4! will win black the exchange.
 [ B b5 ]  [ K e8 ]  [ a3 ] , [ R a8 ]  blunder there was enough firepower to defend N on [ d7 ]  [ B x d7 + ]  [ R x d7 ]  [ R d5 x d7 ]  [ b x a3 ]  [ R x h7 ] , [ R a6 ]  can't play [ a x b2 ] since lose rook after 33. [ R h8 ] K? 34. [ R x a8 ]  [ b x a3 ] , [ R b6 ]  33... [ R x a3 ] loses 34. [ R b1 ] [ R a8 ] 35. [ R h8 ] wins the rook 33... [ R f6 ] 34. [ R b1 ] [ R f7 ] 35. [ R b7 ] forces trade of rooks 33... [ R b6 ] lets hope he goes crazy with 35. [ R d3 ]  [ a4 ]  [ R b2 ]  [ R a1 ]  [ K d8 ]  [ c4 ]  [ K c8 ]  [ a5 ]  [ R b7 ]  [ R x b7 ]  [ K x b7 ] , [ a6 + ]  
 [ N f2 ] , [ B e7 ]  It has taken Black a while to get this bishop off [ d8 ] but that time has been put to good use. The game seems about even.
 [ K a6 ] , [ h4 ]  when that pawn gets to [ h5 ] it will be vulnerable hence rook [ g5 ]  [ K b7 ]  [ h5 ] , [ B x h5 ]  this seems like it shouts: "I'm going for stale mate!"
 [ B d3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N e2 ]  [ b6 ]  [ e4 ] , [ N e8 ]  A strong move preventing 10 B-[ N5 ] and allowing the reply ...P-[ B4 ] if White tries P-B4.
 [ N f3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N e5 ] , [ N x e5 ]  Alternatives were [ B d7 ] to recapture with the Bishop or letting it be and developing Nf6. While the text lets off pressure on White's QP it gives a tempo as the Bishop can be chased.
 [ K h8 ] , [ B d2 ]  1-0. With nowhere else for his Queen to run Black resigns in the face of overwhelming material loss (23...[ Q d8 ] 24.[ R x d8 ] [ R x d8 ] 25.[ Q x c5 ] is easily enough to prove decisive). Many thanks to hinschi for a fantastic game! I hope some of you enjoyed reading it; especially the last six moves or so. Comments are appreciated; thanks for reading!
 [ K g7 ]  [ Q x g5 + ]  [ K f8 ]  [ Q d8 + ]  [ K g7 ]  [ R g1 + ]  [ K h6 ] , [ Q h4 # ]  great move by black at 8...[ B e7 ] but if he didn't lose the Q maybe he would won. What do u think about?
 [ B e2 ] , [ N b c6 ]  More pieces on the queenside. White really needs to worry about the queenside if Black attacks there.
 [ K e5 ] , [ B x b5 ]  I remove his b-pawn...
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ c6 ]  [ h3 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ B x d3 ] , [ Q x d3 ]  I think [ c x d3 ] with [ e4 ] is interested and rare.
 [ e4 ]  [ e6 ] , [ N h3 ]  Awkward but not that bad yet.
 [ R a5 ] , [ K b8 ]  Now I couldn't see a mate for white even if the position calls for that.
 [ Q b3 ]  [ R f6 ]  [ N c4 ] , [ R g6 ]  threatens mate
 [ h4 ]  [ B h2 ]  [ B g6 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ B x e4 ]  [ B f7 ]  [ B g6 ]  [ Q x a2 ]  [ B x f7 + ]  [ K x f7 ]  [ K d2 ]  [ Q d5 ]  [ K e2 ]  [ K g7 ] , [ R h g1 ]  looking the position now is clear my stronger strategy and tactical situation:for example black bishop is completely trapped by his own pieces while mine is in a powerful active position controlling the h2-[ b8 ] diagonal my knight according to the pawn structure is ready to be an active piece on the Queen side (as the pawn structure indicate white should attack on queen side and black on king side )
 [ f6 ]  [ f4 ] , [ Q c5 ]  Aiming for an exchange of queens.
 [ B c4 ]  [ h6 ]  [ O-O ] , [ d6 ]  I was expected [ g5 ] where I wished play a Muzio-like style
 [ R x g6 ] , [ f x g6 ]  I think it is the only defence
 [ B f4 ]  [ e6 ] , [ e3 ]  [ d4 ] blocks my own action on g6. I have to go for a plan and my plan is not "just move forward". I don't say it was good.
 [ Q x c3 + ]  [ b x c3 ]  [ B x e6 ] , [ N x h8 ]  As the dust settles white is up about a queen. However white needs to not get too lazy and throw the game away.
 [ K g1 ] , [ K g3 ]  67. ...... [ K g3 ] - I think this move is the clincher here!
 [ b3 ]  [ Q f2 + ]  [ R e2 ]  [ Q f4 + ] , [ K c2 ]  not quite what I had expected but now my queen has gotten to a position where I could potentially promote my h pawn after a sacrifice of the queen were he to pursue the mate trap. I am just amazed at how complex this position is still ...
 [ Q e8 + ]  [ K h7 ] , [ Q x e7 ]  Resignation.
 [ Q a4 ]  [ N c2 + ] , [ K f2 ]  Trying to get the most of it.
 [ Q g1 ] , [ R x a2 ]  White moves the queen across to [ g1 ] to protect the king and I take advantage and capture the pawn at a2. This allows me to control the row while at a distance from the queen's capture.
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ a4 ]  [ g6 ]  [ b3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ R a2 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N e2 ]  [ N e7 ]  [ N g3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ h4 ] , [ d5 ]  in my case just normal development in the Hungarian variation of the Sicilian; I had really no idea what White was up to: frankly I didn't even look at it; to me this player was a deranged madman/woman...
 [ Q x d4 ] , [ g4 ]  So Mike plays this. But I will grab another pawn. Better was 25...[ f5 ] but as noted nothing will help any more.
 [ h x g4 ]  [ f x g4 ]  [ R x h4 ]  [ f3 ]  [ R h2 ]  [ a4 ]  [ R d h8 ]  [ f4 ]  [ R x c2 ] , [ b4 ]  One final mistake in a lost game to end the agony.
 [ K e7 ] , [ f3 ]  [ g2 ] is now protected.
 [ B d5 + ] , [ K g6 ]  From now on black tries to avoid the mate and hold 13. moves.
 [ Q e2 ] , [ N g4 ]  Threatening the proverbially-weak [ f2 ] square. In blitz you get a lot of players who prefer these arrogant attacks. In the game I estimate that I will be able to defend.
 [ N b d2 ]  [ B x a6 ]  [ N f1 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ N e5 ] , [ Q d6 ]  This one stumps me a little. The computer wanted [ N x e5 ] as the optimal move but from what I can see it's just... still bad but not quite as bad? I guess that makes sense but the nuance of that kind of position is clearly not my strongest point. The analysis goes on for 16 moves in this line for a slightly less bad position for black leading me to believe that the chess engine is far far more advanced than any human likely has need for now or in the near future.
 [ g4 ] , [ R f6 ]  H'mmm. Have to make a retreat with the Rook.
 [ K c8 ] , [ R e8 # ]  Mate. I felt this was a fun game even if I didn't play great. Please comment and rate.
 [ N e4 ]  [ Q g2 + ]  [ K b3 ]  [ Q x f3 + ] , [ N c3 ]  alright i cornered my king lost a pawn but i feel safer to move out some pieces now
 [ b x a3 ]  [ R x a3 ]  [ Q e6 ]  [ N d2 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ Q f3 ] , [ N e8 ]  First inaccuracy according to the computer though I would argue that ...o-o was also an inaccuracy at this stage in the game I was not as good a player as I am now. though it may not appear so I feel that over the course of this game I made significant improvments in my play by finally getting some chess books to read. prior to then I had not read any chess books before. hopefully my improvments will begin to show soon.
 [ b5 ]  [ R a3 ]  [ N h5 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ N d f6 ]  [ B g5 ] , [ Q d7 ]  threatening [ b x h3 ]  [ K h2 ]  [ h6 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ N d2 ]  [ N h f6 ] , [ f3 ]  f3?? Blunder! leaves the knight trappable
 [ R e g1 ]  [ Q f3 + ]  [ K e1 ]  [ Q e4 ] , [ R x g7 ]  Probably white doesn't see the perpetual trap... or he welcomed it!
 [ K g4 ]  [ K d2 ]  [ K f5 ]  [ K c3 ]  [ K e5 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ K f6 ]  [ K d4 ]  [ K e6 ] , [ B b4 ]  As i said the king has to give way in these situations. White wins the last pawn in the same manner and queens his pawn. VERY STRONG PLAY BY WHITE ESPECIALLY IN THE ENDING. WELL PLAYED.
 [ R b7 + ] , [ K c8 ]  Rb8+...[ K c7 ] [ a8 = Q ] would've traded rook for pawn and I missed that. I'd found a way to win and didn't want to deviate even though this would've won faster. It's a bad habit I'm working on.
 [ N c6 ]  [ N e2 ] , [ d5 ]  ...but black doesn't waste any time because he doesn't want white to build a strong center....
 [ B x d6 ] , [ Q e3 ]  Which Sandre had to prevent since Joe was threatening a skewer with 21...Be5. If he played it now however white has 22.d4.
 [ N f3 ] , [ R b f8 ]  Threatening ...Nxe4.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ d6 ]  he chooses to open white bishop's diagonal.
 [ Q b6 + ]  [ N d4 ]  [ N d6 ]  [ N c5 ]  [ a x b4 ]  [ c x b4 ] , [ R e8 ]  Lining the rook up against the white queen
 [ K x g5 ]  [ B x e6 ]  [ B x e6 ] , [ R e2 x e6 ]  ...well its nasty for Black now...h4/5/6/7 is coming..
 [ g3 ]  [ Q g1 ]  [ g x h2 ]  [ R x h2 ]  [ g5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d4 ] , [ R g2 ]  White down in material continues the pointless attack.
 [ R g8 ]  [ R c1 ] , [ Q f5 ]  The idea is [ Q h3 ] provoking [ g3 ] and go on [ h5 ] h4. I know it is too slow but I can't see anything better. Now I would suggest [ B c7 ] and Q[ h5 ] but this doesn't crush white. I'm down and in serious danger to lose the game.
 [ B b6 ]  [ e4 ] , [ Q e3 ]  Simply. This turned out to be more complicated for me than foreseen due to my unwise moves.
 [ B c5 ]  [ O-O ] , [ N x d4 ]  ? Very bad idea. Black waste again some tempo and lose the center.
 [ c4 ] , [ N g3 ]  Pushing my bishop back.
 [ Q d8 ]  [ N x e7 + ] , [ Q x e7 ]  Black is up a pawn has a 3-1 majority on the Queenside but White has the bishop pair.
 [ c x d4 ]  [ Q x d4 ] , [ N e5 ]  Still sticking with sicilian dragon defense.
 [ h3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N x e5 ] , [ d x e4 ]  ...but we create more space by swapping pawns...
 [ N g6 ]  [ R f1 ] , [ d5 ]  Now his black-squared bishop became useless there.
 [ h6 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ Q x f6 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N e7 ] , [ a4 ]  Now that my king is safe my plan is to set-up a strong pawn chain
 [ N x e5 ]  [ Q x e5 ] , [ B e2 ]  I feel i needed to castle at some point
 [ N c6 ] , [ K h1 ]  Time to get out of line as planned. Later in the game the consequence is that I have to worry about back row mates.
 [ N c3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ d3 ] , [ B b4 ]  Threatening to win a pawn and blast open the queenside where White obviously is trying to castle.
 [ f x e6 ] , [ B e3 ]  Opening the Q file to my Rook's fire.
 [ K g2 ]  [ R g8 + ]  [ K h2 ]  [ R b8 ]  [ R x c4 + ]  [ K g5 ] , [ a6 ]  Thank you very much for the game but first of all for a good chat during the game.
 [ g x f4 ]  [ N x c8 ]  [ Q x c7 ]  [ N e7 + ]  [ K g7 ]  [ R g8 + ]  [ K f6 ]  [ Q x e4 ] , [ N x f2 ]  Not better is 28. ... [ Q d6 ] 29. [ N c8 ] [ Q d4 ] 30. Qh7...
 [ K h6 ]  [ Q f6 + ]  [ K h5 ] , [ R h7 # ]  and delivering the final blow with my rook - checkmate!
 [ B d7 ]  [ B g5 ] , [ f6 ]  Uncharted waters with that move not on the database. I note Black's dcb is currently tipsy (I term the "bad" bishop as tipsy and the "good" bishop as sober to avoid the prejudicial terms bad and good) nor do I wish to park my dcb on the eventual [ g3 ] square. I have possible plans for kingside development particularly should I decide to castle long. Therefore I avoid the R-Llike (but on the kingside) 8. [ B h4 ] [ g5 ] 9.Bg3.
 [ B e7 ] , [ d6 ]  "Once more unto the breach dear friends once more" and the bishop is forced onto f8.
 [ R f1 + ]  [ K c2 ]  [ B g5 ] , [ R h h2 ]  Ok [ N f3 ] to scare [ R h2 ] followed by [ N d4 + ] to fork the other rook. Knights excel at forking rooks.
 [ N b4 ] , [ B b1 ]  Now [ a1 ] rook is temoparay out of play.
 [ B f1 ] , [ B h3 ]  White could have resigned here.
 [ Q x e6 ] , [ f4 ]  Protecting the [ e5 ] Knight.
 [ N f5 ]  [ b3 ]  [ Q b6 + ]  [ K h1 ] , [ B x c3 ]  This allows a fork on white's rook and queen.
 [ K g1 ] , [ e5 ]  Trying to prohibit White's bishop and free Black's.
 [ K c5 ]  [ K c3 ]  [ K b5 ] , [ K d4 ]  Continuing the next stage of the plan. Now the white king will mount a raid on the black kingside pawns and seek to establish a decisive material advantage on that side of the board. As usual Black cannot take the a-pawn because the resulting king and pawn ending would be hopeless so his only defensive idea is to "change the guard" on the queenside; the king will occupy [ a6 ] blocking the passed pawn and the black rook will endeavour to hold off the white king.
 [ N b3 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ B e3 ] , [ O-O ]  Just developing now since I'm out of reference on the Sicilian.
 [ N f2 + ]  [ K g1 ]  [ N x d1 + ]  [ K h1 ]  [ N f2 + ]  [ K g1 ]  [ N h3 + ]  [ K f1 ] , [ Q f2 # ]  beautiful windmill.....this game goes to show the power of queen/knight combinations. One of the benefits of having 2 bishops is the ability to exchange one of them at a propicous juncture in order to get rid of a nasty knight if need-be. Could white have kept the 2-bishop advantage instead of exchanging white bishops at move 19? It seemed reasonable at the time as white valued the black bishop due to black being weak on black squares.....but maybe 19.[ B e2 ] was the better move. White played a good game no real obvious errors until the end when (as it usually does) tactics took over. Probably 25.[ R e5 ] was the loosing mistake.
 [ Q x g6 ] , [ B x h2 + ]  Dun Dun Dun! it cost me an extra bishop cause of my earlier attack/mistake with my black bishop but i still got my favorite trap! btw those are the bishop sacrifices i mentioned in title (i think :D)
 [ b4 ]  [ R a2 ]  [ R x a2 ]  [ B x a2 ]  [ R b8 ]  [ R b1 ]  [ Q f4 ]  [ R x b4 ]  [ R x b4 ]  [ Q x b4 ]  [ K g7 ]  [ B d5 ]  [ h5 ]  [ Q e7 ]  [ h x g4 ]  [ Q h4 ]  [ Q c1 + ]  [ K g2 ]  [ g x h3 + ]  [ Q x h3 ]  [ Q g5 + ]  [ Q g3 ]  [ Q x g3 + ]  [ K x g3 ]  [ K f6 ]  [ K g4 ]  [ a5 ] , [ f3 ]  I hesitated between several possibilities (43.[ f4 ] ; 43. Bc6). I finally elected this one because there is still a risk of draw and I wanted to try to take a free pawn without exchanging.
 [ B b5 ]  [ R e1 ] , [ B x e2 ]  Since I'm about to play ...[ c4 ] my LSB will become a bad bishop and needs to be exchanged off.
 [ R b1 + ] , [ K a3 ]  My other option would have been checkmate. I had already played through that scenario and was ready for it.
 [ e4 ] , [ c5 ]  Sicilian Defence
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B b5 ] , [ N f6 ]  Not surprised to see Terence play the Berlin Defense as that's what I do in the Ruy Lopez these days as he has seen.
 [ a7 ]  [ K e8 ]  [ R b8 + ]  [ K e7 ]  [ a8 = Q ]  [ R x a8 ]  [ R x a8 ]  [ K x e6 ] , [ R h8 ]  Over now. Black insists on extending it.
 [ Q a3 ]  [ Q x c2 ] , [ Q x f8 + ]  Notice that I had connected rooks and his [ c8 ] bishop was still undeveloped blocking in his rook on a8. Had he develop this attack would have been nullified
 [ g4 ] , [ h6 ]  Black can't do much in this position. A common result of playing the opening too passively.
 [ N x e4 ]  [ N x g4 ]  [ f3 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ Q c2 ]  If he exchanges centralizes my queen or I can build an impressive center. [ B g5 ] was another good option probably better.
 [ B c3 + ] , [ K c5 ]  Shoving the king back to make way for pawns.
 [ g x f6 ]  [ Q h5 + ]  [ Q f7 ]  [ Q x f7 + ]  [ K x f7 ]  [ B x d5 + ]  [ K e7 ]  [ N f4 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ O-O-O ]  [ f x e5 ]  [ B x c6 ] , [ e x f4 ]  I certainly would have considered 19. ...[ b c6 ] opening lines.
 [ B c4 ] , [ R a d8 ]  making sure not to leave the d-file uncontested.
 [ N d5 ] , [ Q a4 ]  ?! This is my only real oversight of the game. I was planning to exchange on [ d5 ] and play ...[ Q a4 ] and thought the move order didn't matter because ...[ Q a4 ] would threaten mate. However I missed something important...
 [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ g6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ d5 ]  The Grünfeld defence also sometimes called the Grünfeld-Indian Defence. The Indian player Moheschunder Bannerjee played the opening as early as 1855 against John Cochrane. However it is named for Ernst Grünfeld who introduced it into international tournament play at Vienna 1922 where Grünfeld in his first game with the defense beat future World Champion Alexander Alekhine.
 [ B c5 + ]  [ K h1 ]  [ Q x d1 ]  [ R x d1 ] , [ O-O ]  Better was the very strong Ng4!
 [ d5 ]  [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ e3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ B x d3 ] , [ Q x d3 ]  at this point of the game I was just making normal development moves and looking out if there's any weakness on my opponent side.
 [ B c6 ] , [ Q d4 ]  Now I realize too late that I will have to manage a way to avoid the pawn's chain to be formed in front of his K. I'll have to sac a piece. Now the bad B move allows me to occupy this central square one-step to the Kside with no loss of tempo dued to [ N c6 ] or c5. Fortunately my opponent is not a proficient attacker!
 [ B b3 ] , [ h4 ]  More threatening would have been [ R e8 ] first but [ R e1 ] and the exchange didn't seem a good option for me.
 [ O-O-O ]  [ Q e7 ] , [ N h3 ]  Gathering forces for a kingside assault.
 [ O-O ] , [ B e6 ]  [ N g e7 ] would have been in the Sicilian Defense / Botvinnik 5.[ d3 ] [ d6 ] 6.[ N g e2 ] [ e5 ] opening line. White is now free to play [ N d5 ] because taking the knight forces Black to to cede the bishop pair. After 8.[ N d5 ] if black plays 8... [ B x d5 ] then the probable continuation 9.[ e x d5 ] [ N e7 ] (9... [ N b4 ] 10.a3) 10. [ f4 ] [ N f6 ] 11. [ B g5 ] N[ f x d5 ] 12. [ B x d5 ] [ Q d2 ] (12... [ N x d5 ] 13.Bxd1) looks fine for White because White has both bishops and the light-square bishop seems to control diagonal given up by the [ e6 ] bishop.
 [ Q g6 ] , [ B d7 ]  Necessary
 [ Q c7 ] , [ N a4 ]  The pressure on the Q-side evaporated and White has ideas of c4-[ c5 ] creating a very dangerous passed pawn. I had to think of something fast. If I play slowly White will certainly convert his extra material. I knew my chances lay on the K-side and that I had to generate initiative there. Notice the opposite colour Bishops. This is a very dangerous middlegame to play and unlike its counterpart in the endgame very much not drawish. The side that can seize the initiative usually wins since the defending Bishop cannot cover the opposite colour squares.
 [ g5 ] , [ N x g5 ]  13. [ N g5 ] also controls [ e6 ] keeping [ B d7 ] from [ e7 ] to prevent Nf7.
 [ B x h7 + ]  [ K x h7 ] , [ Q h5 + ]  White gives up the bishop for a very powerful initiative and advantage on the king side.
 [ N x e4 ] , [ Q e3 ]  16. [ Q e3 ] - Glenda to the rescue! At least she does have a threat of hopping on her broomstick to [ a7 ] and attacking that lsb on b7. The Wicked Witch of the West scotches that plan not only defending that turbulent prelate but piling up on my poor [ c2 ] pawn forcing my rook to defend it.
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N g5 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ N x f7 ]  [ B x f2 + ]  [ K f1 ]  [ Q e7 ]  [ N x h8 ] , [ B b6 ]  7. ...... [ B b6 ] - this retreat of Fou Lenoir has netted me most of the 6.5 points achieved from this MT. That a7-[ g1 ] diagonal has actually resulted in a couple of my opponents copping Old Matey from Glenda once the d column has been opened because Fou Lenoir has prevented the WK from taking refuge on g1.
 [ K g1 ]  [ B x f1 ]  [ K x f1 ]  [ N e7 ] , [ K e2 ]  Kicking the bishop out
 [ Q x a2 ] , [ O-O ]  I was recently reading a book by Bronstein on the K-K match in Seville where Karpov played this variation but opted for the Queen exchange which Kasparov easily drew. One comment said that sacrificing a pawn like this leads to nowhere after 12...[ b6 ] 13. Qc1. Little did they know about the times to come. The most pertinent game in that line is Ivanchuck - Svidler Linares 1998 where White slowly used his central control to build up his position to achieve a winning advantage.
 [ N x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ] , [ c4 ]  White does not like the vaguely threatening Black pawn position and would like to throw a wrench into it.
 [ K a4 ] , [ Q b4 # ]  WHAM! The king is dead.
 [ Q x a2 ] , [ Q x d4 ]  takes the bait!
 [ B x f8 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ N x e3 ]  [ B x e3 ]  [ R d1 + ] , [ K c7 ]  You need to bring the queeen rook into the game. Overall a very good game!!!!!
 [ K c6 ]  [ B a4 + ]  [ K d5 ]  [ R d7 + ]  [ K e4 ] , [ c6 ]  The path of the c-pawn has been cleared of obstacles and the end is now not far away.
 [ Q x e5 ] , [ B g4 + ]  White queen captures unprotected pawn at [ e5 ] and I move LB to check king at [ g4 ] which could lead to exchange of queens.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ] , [ N c3 ]  The Vienna game -- a lot less common than the typical 2. Nf3.
 [ N d7 ] , [ a3 ]  This move doesn't appear to be dangerous since [ a x b4 ] would result in [ Q x a1 ] but looks can be deceiving. Black should simply move his bishop here but he ignored White's "pointless" move and didn't think ahead.
 [ K b6 ]  [ h x g3 ] , [ B x g3 ]  Black goes for it but at this point I realized that I had overlooked the variation [ Q g6 ] Qd6! [ Q x g3 ] [ Q x g3 ] fg [ b4 ] [ K f1 ] (the g-pawn is not fast enough) [ c3 ] bc b3! and white's king cannot reach the b-pawn.
 [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ a6 ] , [ B d3 ]  A relatively rare response to the Najdorf. This bishop usually adopts a more attacking posture on [ c4 ] or prepares to occupy the long diagonal with B-e2-f3. On [ d3 ] it's blocked in by the pawn on [ e4 ] and not actually attacking anything. The main line of the Najdorf continues with 6. [ B g5 ] and extremely complex theoretical battles. I started a Najdorf tournament at the same time as this one and in one game we're still in the book at move 17 ...
 [ N d7 + ] , [ K e8 ]  But falling into the temptation of theat the knight with my king.
 [ N f6 ]  [ B b2 ]  [ e6 ]  [ B e2 ] , [ B g4 ]  The B had a good square already at [ f5 ] so moving it twice in the opening loses a tempo.
 [ N d7 ]  [ N x d7 ]  [ K x d7 ] , [ N d2 ]  This stops the Pawn's advance.
 [ K e8 ] , [ Q c3 ]  In this position she is clearly trying to win my rook but I am not going to allow this.
 [ Q x b5 + ]  [ N x b5 ]  [ B x b5 + ]  [ B d7 ]  [ B x d7 + ]  [ Q x d7 ]  [ h x g4 ] , [ Q x g4 ]  Pull ahead and pressure open pawn
 [ Q x b5 ]  [ c x b5 ]  [ K d3 ]  [ R a4 ]  [ K c3 ]  [ K f7 ]  [ K b3 ]  [ a2 ]  [ R x a2 ]  [ R x a2 ]  [ K x a2 ]  [ K e6 ]  [ K b3 ]  [ K d5 ]  [ K b4 ]  [ K c6 ] , [ d5 + ]  and now with this simple [ d5 + ] I'm sure to bring my [ c5 ] pawn to promotion with an easy with his bishop still trapped into his pawns....since move 12!!!! he substantially plaied almost all the match with 1 piece less because of his weak strategy based only on " pushing pawns " without any real plan
 [ N x b5 ] , [ g6 ]  With seven points up I decide to not retreat the Knight yet but continue with the advantage I created.
 [ d x e5 ] , [ d5 ]  This just gives up the pawn. If there was a gambit-like aspiration behind it it doesn't appear to work because even though after 5. [ e x d5 ] White's pawns are far enough forward that they have the potential to become targets Black has no concrete way of attacking them. They completely dominate the center and force Black's Knights on to less than ideal squares. And even if White ends up having to give back one of these pawns he remains ahead in material!
 [ N e1 ] , [ R b f8 ]  not best but i guess black is aiming for [ f4 ]  [ N c2 ]  [ Q d6 ] , [ N b4 ]  attacking the black bishop
 [ K f7 ] , [ B f6 ]  Bishop raid final part!
 [ Q h5 + ]  [ g6 ] , [ Q x g6 + ]  Checkmate in 5! Man defeats monkey again! As students learn to checkmate in this way they will enjoy taking on the monkey in this way. This second victory has left me with just one last question about the monkey...is it even POSSIBLE to lose to it? (This will be answered in game 3.)
 [ N e4 ] , [ N x e4 ]  Free knight
 [ B g7 ] , [ B f4 ]  and now I'm waiting the fork (g5?)
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ c4 ] , [ d x c4 ]  Queens Gambit accepted. Ok so I'm thinking win at this point.
 [ f x e6 ] , [ Q e2 ]  White targets the pawn and knight - both can not be saved.
 [ R h4 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ h6 ] , [ N x f7 ]  Snatching a loose Pawn.
 [ e4 ] , [ c5 ]  This is a training game between id=stalhandske and MGW (Mighty G Warriors) where the members of the G team conferred about the next move before making it. The opening is Sicilian but....
 [ N x d4 ] , [ Q x d4 ]  No real choice but...
 [ B h6 ]  [ Q a2 + ]  [ K h8 ]  [ Q e6 ] , [ N d5 ]  Fischer returns the favor. 26...N-[ B4 ] was correct.
 [ K x f3 ]  [ a5 ]  [ K f4 ] , [ N g4 ]  Willing to sacrifice its ego for the success of the team! Ala Bill Russell the greatest team championship winner of all-time!
 [ N b5 ]  [ N b8 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ N a6 ]  [ B c3 ]  [ N b4 ]  [ B x b4 ] , [ c x b4 ]  The first real action takes place with an exchange of minor pieces.
 [ R c3 ]  [ c6 ]  [ b4 ] , [ R f6 ]  Endgame maxim: Rooks belong behind passed Pawns.
 [ K f8 ]  [ Q x h8 ] , [ Q x f2 ]  ?? Blunder that loses the game.
 [ R x c7 ]  [ B x c7 ]  [ B d5 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ B x c6 ]  [ b x c6 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ B x e5 ]  [ Q x e5 + ]  [ K g8 ]  [ Q e6 + ]  [ R f7 ]  [ Q x c6 ]  [ K g7 ]  [ f3 ]  [ R e7 ]  [ K f2 ]  [ K g8 ]  [ f4 ]  [ K g7 ]  [ g4 ]  [ R f7 ]  [ K f3 ]  [ K g8 ]  [ Q e8 + ]  [ R f8 ]  [ Q e6 + ]  [ R f7 ]  [ K e4 ]  [ K g7 ]  [ f5 ]  [ g x f5 + ]  [ g x f5 ]  [ R f6 ]  [ Q e7 + ]  [ R f7 ]  [ Q g5 + ]  [ K f8 ]  [ Q d8 + ]  [ K g7 ]  [ K e5 ]  [ R b7 ]  [ f6 + ]  [ K h6 ]  [ Q d2 + ]  [ K h5 ]  [ Q e2 + ]  [ K h4 ] , [ Q e4 + ]  With my rook on [ b7 ] falling it is time to give up. Many thanks for reading. Please rate this annotation on the star system and leave a comment or two to let me know how I am doing. Until next time dear reader!
 [ N f6 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ d6 ] , [ B c4 ]  7. [ B c4 ] - the last few moves have been a combo of development and establishing a pawn centre. There will now follow a plethora of exchanges.
 [ K h8 ]  [ R e7 ]  [ e5 ]  [ K g3 ]  [ B f2 + ]  [ K g2 ] , [ R f5 ]  I found this game covered many great ideas and themes very well.and quite enjoyed playing it to. My young opponent surprised me by how well she played to. Some comments would be nice to :) I'd be interested in the endgame in particular to see if my annotations and moves were correct or if they were way off.
 [ K b5 ]  [ K x b2 ] , [ K x a5 ]  Alternative variation: 63. [ K c4 ] [white tries to protect the b-pawn but [ K c2 ] restablishes opposition and he has to move away.] [ K c2 ] 64. [ K b5 ] [ K x b3 ]  [ K x b3 ]  [ K b5 ]  [ K c3 ]  [ K a4 ]  [ b3 ]  [ K b5 ]  [ b2 ]  [ K c5 ] , [ b1 = Q ]  
 [ N f6 ]  [ d3 ] , [ c6 ]  I do this to open the queen and if he moves his knight it's a nice little pitfall for me with q-[ a5 ]  [ d5 ] , [ N x e5 ]  this move was a blunder on his part falling prey to a trap in 3 moves losing his knight
 [ K g5 ]  [ Q x h6 + ] , [ g x h6 ]  white now broadens attack
 [ B x c4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ O-O ] , [ b5 ]  Hmm as predicted. Was this the only reason for 4. ... a6?
 [ B b7 ]  [ R h4 ] , [ B x d5 ]  ?!
 [ B e7 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N b d7 ]  [ c5 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ B b2 ]  [ e5 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ N x e5 ] , [ Q x e5 ]  Still equal but black become some breath.
 [ h3 ]  [ R c3 + ]  [ K b5 ]  [ R d5 + ]  [ K b4 ] , [ R c4 # ]  
 [ h6 ] , [ B x f5 ]  Now for black the computer prefers playing [ c4 ] allowing [ N e6 + ] [ K g8 ] ([ Q x e6 ] allows Qxb4+) [ B x b6 ] [ c x b3 ] etc.
 [ b x c6 ] , [ B d6 ]  Probably worse than my last move. It's all bluff. If he takes the bishop I recapture with my queen menacing his king. But it's an empty threat because he can put his queen on [ e7 ] forcing a trade of queens and he is fine. Perhaps he does not like the idea of taking the queens off the board this early in the game.
 [ K g2 ]  [ N d3 ]  [ Q c2 ]  [ R c8 ] , [ R a d1 ]  Black will avoid the exchange sacrifice.
 [ N g6 ]  [ N x f7 ] , [ R f8 ]  Threatens my knight but I can still check the king and win a pawn.
 [ R e1 + ] , [ K d6 ]  Moving my king toward the center as well but leaving the e-file open. That hardly matters because the promotion is going to happen on the f-file (unless the rook stays there in which case he leaves as the pawn promotes).
 [ K c7 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ a5 ]  [ R g5 ]  [ K c6 ] , [ R f5 ]  With the Pawn slated to fall Black resigns.
 [ R f7 ] , [ R h5 ]  Trading would have saved white from QxBa7.
 [ Q x e7 ]  [ Q x e7 + ]  [ K h8 ]  [ Q f6 + ] , [ K h7 ]  
 [ g6 ]  [ g5 ]  [ f x g5 ]  [ h x g5 ] , [ N f8 ]  If white plays 20. f5[ x g6 ] then black plays N[ x g6 ] and there is no attack - black can defend. If white plays 20. [ f6 ] the position becomes blocked and white won't make progress. So white must find a way to increase the pressure.
 [ Q e7 ]  [ N g5 ] , [ h6 ]  pushing the knight away but i guess he missed the bshop hitting [ f7 ] aswell.
 [ R x c5 ]  [ K h4 ]  [ K h7 ]  [ R g5 ]  [ R x g5 ]  [ K x g5 ] , [ g6 ]  The killer move. Now Black wins easily and I resigned. I thought this was a very sharp game with good attacking lines on both sides down the Queenside. The doubled black pawn ended up destroying my position and forcing me onto the defensive although I still had some counterplay. I had to be very sharp on the defensive because of numerous threats and almost managed to salvage the game. OldGus says that I had some strong attacks and felt this was winning or draw for White but I could not find the moves.
 [ Q c4 + ] , [ B d5 ]  I was expecting ...[ N d5 ] to which I would have replied 17. [ R a d1 ] and I didn't see any significant clear choice for black's subsequent move so I didn't analyze any further.
 [ f4 ]  [ e x f4 ]  [ g x f4 ] , [ B a5 ]  This is the correct play by Caruana. This is why he is #2 in the world and the rightful challenger to Carlsen.
 [ g5 ]  [ O-O ]  [ h5 ]  [ h3 ]  [ h4 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ K c7 ]  [ R f d1 ]  [ N e7 ]  [ B c5 ] , [ N g6 ]  Bishop trade?
 [ N c2 + ] , [ K d2 ]  Giving time for white to attack on [ d6 ]  [ N b4 ]  [ B e7 ] , [ f6 ]  Interesting sacrifice! Activates BK. In case now of 34.[ g x f6 ] white weakens his chain of pawns. I rather keep on attacking [ d6 ] which will make W[ d5 ] a strong pawn (and also we have to consider that [ d8 ] is a black square and can therefore be dominated by WB)
 [ Q d2 ] , [ B e7 ]  This is the last book move however both white and black have a few more moves to make to get to full development.
 [ R b d8 ]  [ R x d5 ] , [ e x d5 ]  I had thought that the point of doubling up the rooks was to always keep a rook controlling the open d file which was why I had anticipated [ R x d5 ] instead. I questioned why he put his rook on [ d8 ] in the first place. I suppose he thought that it would have been better to un-isolate his c pawn which are now both passed pawns.
 [ O-O ] , [ O-O ]  Black is definitely better out of the opening.
 [ d3 ]  [ g5 ]  [ a3 ] , [ h5 ]  15. ...... [ h5 ] - driving back white's lsb and attempting a pawn storm on the kingside. This is how far those pawns get however.
 [ b5 ]  [ Q e6 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ B e4 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ Q d7 ]  [ f3 ]  [ B x b1 ]  [ R x b1 ]  [ e6 ] , [ O-O ]  Finally castling as a rook move inorder to double up the rooks on the queenside.
 [ f x g5 ]  [ B x e5 ]  [ N e4 ] , [ K f5 ]  Rushed move. [ B f5 ] would have been more powerful. Though not necessarily the winning move.
 [ N x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ R x d4 ] , [ Q x g4 ]  getting his pesky queen out of there
 [ K f8 ] , [ d8 = Q + ]  yay queen now we are about even wouldn't you say???
 [ R f3 ]  [ K g8 ]  [ g4 ]  [ K f8 ]  [ e6 ] , [ f6 ]  White creates a passer.
 [ N h3 ] , [ d5 ]  pawn donation?
 [ f3 ] , [ R d c8 ]  Played with the idea that his pawn on [ [ d4 ] ] is going to be pinned in some variation and that I may be able to take on [ [ d4 ] ] - as indeed I do in the game. Computer likes [ f3 ] doesn't like my move prefers [ B c4 ] and claims that the position is equal.
 [ N x e6 ] , [ f x e6 ]  opening up a line to f2: the pride of our position...
 [ e6 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ N c6 ]  I don't like black blocking his own "c" pawn but a lot of people does it... under 1800 normally...
 [ a4 ] , [ B b7 ]  a fiancietto-ed bishop doesn't usually hold up against the strong centre of QGA in my experience... unless you haven't build the centre yet:
 [ N x c6 ] , [ e x d6 ]  No need to recapture the knight immediately
 [ R g2 ] , [ c3 ]  Pushing the passer.
 [ B g7 ] , [ B h3 ]  White attains a superior board position with the fuller development of the white Bishop but I do not concern myself with this fact though because I have a development strategy to complete.
 [ R g1 ]  [ B f6 ]  [ g4 ]  [ B g6 ]  [ h4 ] , [ Q d7 ]  This leaves the possibility of [ N e5 ] with the d pawn pinned in some variations
 [ a x b3 ] , [ R c8 ]  At this point he decides to move his a Rook here. Why? It puts pressure on the c file.
 [ a5 ]  [ h3 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ e5 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ N a6 ]  [ R a d1 ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ f3 ]  [ N b4 ] , [ B c4 ]  To make it more difficult for Black to play ...d6-[ d5 ]  [ B b3 ] , [ d5 ]  Black succeeds in carrying out his plan but its outcome is unclear
 [ B f5 ] , [ f3 ]  On the other hand I also don't want Black to seize a good diagonal with his B so I guard the N rather than move it.
 [ B d2 ] , [ B c5 ]  The bishop returns just in time to close off the e3-square once again. In the meantime the white h-pawn has advanced one rank closer to promotion.
 [ e4 ] , [ c5 ]  I never played Sicilian before but I wanna know (in this way) if black can stop black Knights attacks.
 [ N b6 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ R a c1 ]  [ Q d6 ]  [ B x c4 ]  [ Q b4 ]  [ B x b5 ]  [ Q x b5 ] , [ R c4 ]  the rest of the game is just mopping up
 [ B x e4 ]  [ B x e4 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ d3 ] , [ N g5 ]  but lucky for me he blunders
 [ B x h7 ]  [ Q g5 ]  [ B x g8 ]  [ Q x f6 ]  [ R h f1 ]  [ Q x g7 ] , [ B x f7 + ]  relentless...
 [ Q d3 ]  [ e5 ] , [ Q x a6 ]  I didn't see this
 [ Q d2 ] , [ O-O ]  Once again if White plays [ g4 ] phish attack attempt then [ d5 ] is good for Black.
 [ N e6 ] , [ Q g8 ]  Still following the main line.
 [ Q d1 ]  [ Q x h4 ]  [ f3 ]  [ R a e8 ]  [ N b1 ]  [ Q f4 ]  [ N d2 ] , [ Q e3 + ]  I guess he didn't see that.
 [ B f5 + ] , [ K b3 ]  a tough decision for White: [ K c1 ] is bad...
 [ B c4 ] , [ N c6 ]  i always do this second in hopes of [ Q f3 ]  [ Q f3 ] , [ N e5 ]  the best answer to the fool's mate
 [ b3 ] , [ N f6 ]  ...and its twin to attack my opponent's...
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ d6 ]  At this time I would have been hoping for Guico Piano - but Philador would have done!
 [ Q d6 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ c4 ] , [ Q x c4 ]  ?? Ignoring the showstopper 20. [ B d6 ] [ c b3 ] 21. Be7. This is why I'm not a GM and Anand is. ;-)
 [ K f3 ]  [ N g6 ] , [ a4 ]  Attempting to win a bishop.
 [ B b5 ] , [ f5 ]  I move my f6-pawn to give my f7-pawn room to manoeuvre and to help my e-pawn.
 [ R b8 ] , [ Q d5 ]  (!?) Sensible-looking and centralising yet the GK engine doesn't approve. According to its wisdom 13.[ Q a6 ] ought to have been played. I'm inclined to agree as that move combines attack on [ a7 ] as well as d6. But I think White wanted to keep the Queen nearer the action bearing in mind her Q-side has yet to make a move.
 [ Q b3 ] , [ a6 ]  Driving the knight away.
 [ R c2 x c8 + ]  [ R x c8 ]  [ R x c8 + ] , [ B x c8 ]  25. ...... [ B x c8 ] - the heavies are duly exchanged.
 [ e x f6 ] , [ R d8 ]  He seemed to have no problem trading when he is nine points behind so I figured I'd make it a bit easier for him.
 [ Q x a7 + ]  [ K g6 ]  [ Q a8 ]  [ K f6 ] , [ a4 ]  And Tal starts the run towards promotion.
 [ h6 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ e3 ]  [ R a7 ]  [ N b d2 ]  [ c5 ] , [ N b3 ]  17. [ N b3 ] - I cannot play [ d x [ c5 ] ] here as black will take the pawn on b2. My knight tries to come to [ c5 ] he gets there but unfortunately he just cannot stay there.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ] , [ f4 ]  I reeeally like the King's Gambit. I'm in looove with it.
 [ c6 ] , [ Q c2 ]  now Nge2? would be a mistake [ Q c2 ] is needed to hold [ e4 ] and threat [ h7 ]  [ O-O ] , [ N g e2 ]  trying to use the central pawn majority is a thematic approach to this Carlsbad pawns structure games [ N g e2 ] instead of [ N f3 ] allows some freedom to white's f pawn while still developing his last minor piece
 [ B x f5 ]  [ e x f5 ]  [ Q x f5 ] , [ g4 ]  If 16...[ h4 ] then 17. Nxg5.
 [ N f3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ d4 ] , [ B g7 ]  the Hungarian variation of the Sicilian: White has played an early [ d4 ] to challenge c5; Black does not seem to be bothered...
 [ K f5 ] , [ f x e5 ]  As expected captured B W:s R At [ e5 ]  [ Q g6 + ] , [ K f8 ]  Here could I check with [ B h6 + ] and captured B: R after [ R x h6 ]  [ K e8 ] , [ Q x e5 + ]  here have I to make a possibility for W:s Rook at 1-line to check later
 [ K e6 ] , [ R g1 ]  With the rook coming to the g-file it is all over bar the shouting.
 [ h6 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ N x e4 ] , [ d x e4 ]  Probably better was [ f x e4 ] because that can lead to an attack on my king.
 [ e5 ]  [ N d b5 ]  [ a6 ]  [ N a3 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ B g5 ]  Still happy here
 [ R c7 ] , [ Q f8 + ]  Forcing the king back to b7.
 [ B h7 + ]  [ N x h7 ]  [ Q x h7 + ]  [ K f8 ] , [ Q x f7 # ]  Checkmate! Hope you enjoyed the game.
 [ K g7 ]  [ K f1 ]  [ K g6 ]  [ K e2 ]  [ f5 ] , [ h4 ]  Foolishly hoping I can play 47.[ Q g5 + ] next which would win the Rook after 47...[ K h7 ] 48.[ Q x f5 + ]  [ f4 ]  [ Q x c2 + ]  [ R x c2 + ] , [ K x c2 ]  Now to deal with those advancing pawns. Except in advancing the h-pawn in the hope of an error I've given Black a chance -
 [ N e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ B f8 ]  [ B x f8 ]  [ R x f8 ] , [ e3 ]  This move is important so as to slow down any f5-[ f4 ] ideas from Black.
 [ B x c3 + ] , [ b x c3 ]  I'm still not completely but am feeling more comfortable about my position due to his a pawn being cut off from the rest of his pawns. In other words we're talking about an isolated pawn.
 [ d4 ]  [ g5 ]  [ h4 ]  [ g4 ] , [ N g1 ]  As I said earlier could take [ N g5 ] but its very unsound. This is the book position which is very strange considering after 6 moves we have a load of passed pawns and no minor or major pieces developed.
 [ B g5 ] , [ Q e7 ]  More developing. The knight is pinned!
 [ O-O ]  [ B x c3 ]  [ B x c3 ] , [ d x c3 ]  the rest of the game is easy so enjoy.
 [ R x c6 ]  [ d5 ] , [ f6 ]  check and get a good piece
 [ K f7 ]  [ K f2 ]  [ Q b3 ]  [ Q x b3 ]  [ N x b3 ] , [ B d3 ]  Otherwise ...N-[ R4 ] wins at once as after... K-[ K2 ] Black would swap off the Rooks and win with ...P-[ K N4 ] and ...P-[ K R5 ] supported by the K.
 [ c4 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ K c3 ] , [ a5 ]  This pawn is not protected. Moving [ a6 ] might have been better or perhaps Nc5. White moves the queen black plays [ N e4 + ] followed by Nxd6. Threat eliminated. Except... 37. ...[ N e5 ] 38. Qf5+. White might set up perpetual check. So there is this--b5. White cannot move the c pawn but still Qf5+. That doesn't look bad.
 [ g6 ] , [ Q h4 ]  Now the bishop is under threat. It should be noted that poppy-cock about good and bad bishops means little here. White's dcb hasn't even moved and won't move for the entirety of this game. Black's dcb instead is roving round the board looking powerful. But instead it's a distraction for Black that takes its attention away from the real weakness: that forward Queen which also looks strong in that centre but is really soon to be exposed as weak.
 [ a3 ]  [ R a c8 ]  [ N e4 ] , [ B e7 ]  Better than ...[ B b8 ] as the pressure against [ h2 ] is not as potent as White's queenside and center pressure. Here I can swing the Bishop to [ f6 ] and to [ g7 ] after ...[ g6 ] if necessary.
 [ B e6 ] , [ B f4 ]  developing the QB outside the pawn formation. [ e3 ] is to follow and then the KB. 6. [ B g5 ] merely invites Black to develop a minor piece in response (...[ B e7 ] ...[ N e7 ] or ...Nf6) and probably commits the B to swapping off. I prefer to contest control of [ e5 ] and d6.
 [ N b8 ]  [ R f e1 ]  [ N b d7 ] , [ Q h3 ]  piling pressure on the H7 square
 [ d5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ h4 ] , [ B b4 + ]  A naive move or a plan?
 [ B x g5 ]  [ N x g5 ] , [ g6 ]  Excellent move! Note that 18. ...[ N f5 ] 19. [ B x f5 ] [ e x f5 ] 20. Qh5! is winning for White
 [ N f6 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ d3 ]  [ N c5 ] , [ d4 ]  White hunts the black knight. 3. ... Ne4?! was probably not black's best move for the knight. The experts recommend 3. ... [ N g4 ] or 3. ... [ N d5 ] but really after 2. ... [ N f6 ] black has seriously hindered his effort to equalize the opening. White spends a couple moves developing a strong center with tempo chasing the black knight. Now black's best move is probably just 5. ... [ N a6 ] a dismal home for the proud king's knight. Naturally both moves on the e-file are off limits. 5. ... Ne6? loses a piece to a fork with 6. d5.
 [ c3 ]  [ B a5 ] , [ d5 ]  i futher gain momentum by attacking the knight
 [ e4 ] , [ d5 ]  I'm still experimenting with the scandinavian and its mostly working well for me
 [ B f5 ] , [ N a4 ]  Interesting try by white: if Qxb NxB. But then [ Q x d5 ] wins a full piece. I didn't see it in the game and played...
 [ K h2 ]  [ Q f4 + ] , [ K h3 ]  32. [ K h3 ] - not [ K g2 ] as it will lead to Henry copping Old Matey starting with the move 32. .... Qg4+.
 [ Q d5 + ] , [ K b5 ]  .
 [ K e8 ]  [ K b2 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ K c2 ] , [ K d7 ]  Can't travel too far........
 [ K x h7 ]  [ N g5 + ] , [ K g6 ]  The King has to go forward or else the White Queen goes to [ h5 ] with a quick conclusion.
 [ K x e4 ]  [ Q c6 + ]  [ K e3 ]  [ Q x g2 ] , [ Q e4 + ]  this seems like a pretty stupid move to me but what do I know.
 [ N b1 ] , [ Q a5 ]  I played Soumya Kalkarni (920) the game before. She tried to break in the sides too. That game ended I lost. It is a good plan.
 [ O-O ] , [ N g e2 ]  This has recently popped out again and it seems to be just change of move order. The knight on [ g1 ] wants to get out anyway and white usually just plays [ B e3 ] or [ B g5 ] transposing into the main lines.
 [ d5 ] , [ e3 ]  Similar a COlle system
 [ R x e6 ] , [ R d2 d8 + ]  I force off one pair of Rooks.
 [ B x a6 ] , [ R x a6 ]  22. Qxa6??? is bad because of [ Q x g2 ] mate.
 [ R d1 ]  [ N b6 ]  [ b3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ B f6 ]  [ B x f6 ] , [ Q x f6 ]  By pursuing the exchange White has gained the e column but lost some of his developmental advantage.
 [ R g1 ]  [ K e4 ] , [ R x g2 ]  Actually game over.. 33. ... [ R g3 ] and 34. ... [ R x h3 ] are the next moves..
 [ N c3 ] , [ Q a5 ]  [ B d2 ] [ c6 ] followed by Qc7. Quite a nice trip but black is kind of solid.
 [ B b2 ] , [ B e7 ]  This looks like an awkward square for the Bishop but I could not find a place for it that had a purpose. I just want to castle
 [ Q f3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B c4 ] , [ B c5 ]  As you can see he brought out his queen early in the game. White is at a disadvantage but he has beaten me in the past by bringing out his queen early.
 [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ Q x d5 ] , [ N c3 ]  3. [ N c3 ] develops the Knight helps to control the center and gains tempo by attacking the Black queen.
 [ a3 ] , [ N d4 + ]  I calculated this will force white to exchange the bishop.
 [ B x e5 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ N f d7 ] , [ f4 ]  To break this close position.
 [ K x c7 ]  [ Q f4 + ]  [ Q d6 ]  [ R c1 + ]  [ K d7 ]  [ Q x d6 + ]  [ K x d6 ]  [ R c8 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ R x h8 ] , [ K c7 ]  
 [ K b1 ] , [ B d7 ]  For some reason I quite don't remember I didn't continue with the plan that I had thought of earlier.
 [ R f e1 ]  [ B x e4 ] , [ R x e4 ]  We are pretty much level here though I have to say that white looks much more active.
 [ R f d8 ] , [ f4 ]  I was thinking about this move but....in this way K is a little too uncovered.
 [ a3 ]  [ N g x e5 ]  [ a x b4 ] , [ N d3 # ]  jatayu just got the message Game Won Congratulations.
 [ Q e2 ] , [ Q x g5 ]  an alternative was to take the [ N d4 ] and this might have helped prevent White's other N from wreaking havoc with Nb5-[ c7 ] but I preferred to take the B with the prospect of capturing the [ f6 ] pawn without disrupting my K-side pawns.
 [ K g6 ] , [ N c6 ]  A trick to make his rook move to a8.
 [ c4 ] , [ N f6 ]  forced
 [ B x h8 ]  [ g x f3 ] , [ N x f3 ]  happily accepted
 [ K a7 ]  [ N c4 ]  [ N d5 ] , [ B g3 ]  I really wanted to keep my B-pair.
 [ R g8 + ]  [ K h6 ] , [ R f8 ]  ! The f pawn appears to be very weak.
 [ N e5 ] , [ N f8 ]  Again not the best.
 [ Q c1 ] , [ h5 ]  I'm not sure about this move which really weakens my dark squares - not what I want! I wanted to block in his bishop with 31...[ g5 ] but then 32.[ h4 ] looks strong. How else to defend the h pawn though? Defending it with the Queen invites 32.Qc7. However in such a case I could have simply brought my Queen back to [ e2 ] and followed this up with ...b5. This probably would have been the best choice for me.
 [ B b4 + ] , [ N b c3 ]  12. [ N b [ c3 ] ] - I block the check on [ c3 ] by developing my remaining knight - clear those decks I say!
 [ Q b3 ] , [ h x g4 ]  Geller tries to counter by threatening a discovered check.
 [ O-O ]  [ N x e2 + ] , [ K h1 ]  and material is suddenly= but my development confers a decisive advantage.
 [ O-O ] , [ N g5 ]  rare is it that I get this far afield with my troops... I really ever do this and wish my future opponents well.....
 [ O-O-O ]  [ N b4 ] , [ a3 ]  good attack on the developing knight
 [ d4 ] , [ e x d4 ]  She takes my d-pawn here I was thinking to take with my queen so I could after a trade put my knight on [ d4 ] and play the other knight to [ c3 ] which looks a little bit familiar. Taking the pawn with the knight is also possible of course but it just didn't feel so good to me at the time. I see now in the data base that it is the most played move...
 [ Q e4 ] , [ R b8 ]  Now that his bishop's protected he's threatening N[ c x e5 ] with a discovered attack on the queen.
 [ N x c4 ] , [ Q d3 ]  Another fork.
 [ B c4 ]  [ N f5 ] , [ R d1 ]  Principle of attack: If we can increase our activity while forcing the opponent to decrease his own activity we should really consider it.
 [ K x f7 ]  [ K e3 ]  [ K e6 ] , [ K e4 ]  !! I have the opposition!
 [ c5 ]  [ f4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ N g5 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ Q x g4 ] , [ N x g4 ]  The starting position. Black has one square to move his king [ d7 ]  [ B x f7 + ]  [ K d7 ] , [ B e6 + ]  White wins the knight compensating for the loss of the Queen.
 [ Q f7 + ]  [ K h8 ] , [ Q h7 # ]  Well done Rednif_tap. Thanks for the lesson.
 [ R x b7 + ] , [ K f6 ]  This is the ending position... White had some 4 minutes left black had 6 or so... I never heard from him again... He timed out... Coward!
 [ B e2 ] , [ N e4 ]  As scary as it seems this move rarely is a threat in this scheme.
 [ d3 ] , [ B f5 ]  Finally I get this piece off the back row.
 [ N x c8 ]  [ R f x c8 ] , [ g3 ]  I'll play along the diagonal.
 [ g x f6 ] , [ d x c6 ]  white try to attach dxc6. But I move root.
 [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B e7 ] , [ B g5 ]  This is all standard theory of the QGD.
 [ N f3 ] , [ h5 ]  ?! Black's Rook is in a precarious spot with only one retreat square but it's safe for now and with both Rooks on the kingside he plans to break through White's pawns and get all his pieces into the attack before the King can escape the center.
 [ f3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N b3 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ O-O-O ] , [ R c8 ]  An important move in the Dragon - Black may later sacrifice the rook for the knight on c3.
 [ N f d7 ]  [ c3 ]  [ c5 ]  [ f4 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N d f3 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ Q b6 ]  [ N e2 ] , [ f5 ]  So far the main ideas of the Tarrasch variation were more or less deployed. Neither of us 2 knew enough theory to know the continuation. Now the White comes to the first serious decision: taking the pawn e.p. implies also taking the c-pawn and playing an open sharp position. I believed the black would gain too much space and initiative and prepared myself for a long war.
 [ g3 ] , [ d5 ]  stonewall
 [ R e7 ] , [ f5 ]  White attacks the kingside.
 [ a6 ] , [ O-O-O ]  ? Though this looked reasonable at the time it was quickly made to look stupid. Black's attack develops naturally thanks to the flexible disposition of his pieces and pawns. I haven't decided whether castling kingside or not castling at all would have been better. Perhaps the latter.
 [ Q a4 + ]  [ N d7 ]  [ N d b5 ]  [ a6 ]  [ Q b3 ]  [ a x b5 ]  [ N x b5 ]  [ B x b5 ] , [ Q x b5 ]  +2!
 [ B x d6 ] , [ e x d6 ]  B[ x B a6 + ] first then PxBd6.
 [ K f8 ]  [ K d2 ] , [ N e8 ]  Now I'm guessing black envisions this knight flanking to the kingside.
 [ a5 ] , [ R h a1 ]  The rooks are doubled.
 [ B g2 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ R e d1 ] , [ N c5 ]  This move seems stronger then the obvious Ne5. From here the Knight blocks [ c5 ] and aims at both [ a4 ] and e4. The plan is still to break through with g5-g4. Black can easily wins a few pawns but I am in no hurry. I considered it a winning position already.
 [ R d2 + ]  [ K f1 ] , [ R x a2 ]  It's all over white must deal with the threats of my two connected passed pawns and [ N d2 + ] with a fork. White resigns.
 [ d x e4 ]  [ K f7 ]  [ K e2 ]  [ K f6 ]  [ K f2 ]  [ K g5 ]  [ K f3 ]  [ K h4 ]  [ K g2 ]  [ K g4 ]  [ K f2 ]  [ K h3 ]  [ K f1 ]  [ K g3 ]  [ K g1 ]  [ K f3 ]  [ K f1 ]  [ K x e4 ]  [ K e2 ]  [ d3 + ]  [ K f2 ]  [ K d4 ]  [ K f3 ]  [ K c3 ]  [ K f2 ] , [ K c2 ]  White resigns as Black's d-pawn Queens in 2 moves.
 [ B f5 ] , [ N c3 ]  Here I can make several moves such as: 11. ... [ B e6 ] which I don't like because I'm moving the same piece again and into a more defensive position or 11. ... [ N c e7 ] which I think might have been a better choice than the one I make.
 [ a5 ]  [ B x d6 ]  [ Q x c4 ]  [ Q x c4 ] , [ R x c4 ]  in my opinion a good position for white. I still have the initiative.
 [ O-O ] , [ B d6 ]  Space to castle very quickly.
 [ B c6 ] , [ B b2 ]  And it does prevent the loss of the [ a2 ] pawn - 28...Rxa2?? 29.Rx[ a2 ] Qx[ a2 ] 30.[ Q x c6 ] [ Q x b2 ] 31.[ Q x e6 + ] and suddenly White has counterplay... but what about the [ e3 ] pawn?
 [ N d3 ] , [ N f6 ]  Black gets a breath of fresh air and finally has the chance to develop.
 [ c x d5 ] , [ N x d5 ]  with … [ Q x d5 ] black allows to white the best variations
 [ B e6 + ]  [ K c6 ]  [ B x g4 ] , [ e5 ]  I've seen this move a few times I like the following little combination although I'm not sure if its totally the strongest series of moves.
 [ N g4 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ N x f2 + ] , [ K g1 ]  The most I can get out of this is an exchange
 [ O-O ]  [ N f6 ] , [ N c3 ]  he on the other hand could imagine to go on [ [ d5 ] ] or [ b5 ] (which he will) whenever he wants and by the resultance of an exchange on [ [ d5 ] ] have a dangerous pawn there pointing [ e6 ] and c6.
 [ B d2 ] , [ c x d4 ]  What i do now take the g pawn or c pawn.
 [ e3 ]  [ a6 ]  [ a3 ]  [ b5 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ g5 ] , [ N f d2 ]  I could have castled instead but I didn't want my N chased off. I can always castle Queenside if need be.
 [ N c3 ]  [ d x c4 ]  [ a4 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ N h4 ] , [ B d7 ]  6. .... Fou Leblanc is chased back to d7. Whenever I think of putting my pieces onto active squares they somehow get chased back - sigh and double sigh.
 [ f x e5 ]  [ f x e5 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ B d7 ] , [ Q h5 + ]  Waste of a good tempo? Better is Qxd5.
 [ N e2 ]  [ d4 ]  [ f4 ]  [ Q d5 ]  [ R g1 ]  [ e5 ]  [ B g2 ] , [ B b4 + ]  This was not a wise idea. The reason is that white can block the check by interposing a pawn. Black must move the queen out of danger meaning the bishop falls to the blocking pawn (Pc3).
 [ B x b2 + ]  [ K x b2 ]  [ B x d5 ]  [ g4 ]  [ R h e7 ]  [ R h f1 ] , [ b4 ]  32...[ b4 ] believe it or not i now have mate threats.
 [ B b6 ] , [ b4 ]  I like this guy. He finds the right one.
 [ K d8 ]  [ N x a8 ] , [ e6 ]  I suppose Black is trying to get some control of the centre and develop his DSB.
 [ B e3 ]  [ e6 ] , [ N a4 ]  I'm bewildered about the moves played in an unusual opening: Why is Black not paying attention to his winning threat and is more focused on my queenside threat? I really think I shouldn't have played moves 7 and 8.
 [ e4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ d5 ] , [ B d3 ]  not the usual lines. basically I think that not following the main lines in openings is not so good - especially for low rated players. I think one should go with the rules that grater has seen and annotated before. In a game of low rated players it will be hard to prove ones strength in positional play when you go out of theory so early in the game.
 [ N g f3 ] , [ B x c2 ]  White misses it so black takes the pawn.
 [ N x e4 ]  [ N x e4 ] , [ N x c4 ]  This is an interesting move by Roland. Unfortunately for me it's not something that I would've considered since in general I don't like to grab a pawn with a piece when it's defended by a pawn. As then we'd be talking about giving up a piece for a pawn. However Ken has backup in case black were to take with either the Q or B. I think that if Ken were to play 11.[ b x c4 ] Roland would recapture with his [ B b7 ] as opposed to his Q to prevent further exchanges.
 [ N x f7 ]  [ Q x g4 ] , [ Q d7 ]  Up one all trades benefit white though it is still pretty early in the game to start counting pawns.
 [ K g6 ]  [ R d8 ]  [ B c6 ]  [ R d6 + ] , [ K h7 ]  Probably Black should have intervened with rook here (57...Re6)
 [ N x e4 ] , [ B c5 ]  And now we have a puzzle-like position -> the f-pawn is pinned to the queen the knight is pinned to the queen who is indirectly pinned to the king and the rook is being attacked!
 [ e x f3 ]  [ B x f3 ]  [ N e5 ] , [ N d5 ]  White threatens to win material: Nd5[ x e7 ]  [ B h4 ]  [ N f4 ]  [ N x f3 + ] , [ R x f3 ]  Black has the pair of bishops
 [ B x f5 ]  [ e x f5 ]  [ R x c2 ] , [ R a b1 ]  Learning from the previous mistake I prevent him leveling out. I also could've protected with [ B e3 ] but didn't want to undevelop as everything that happened earlier with getting pieces would've appeared to be nothing. And I don't like waisting time for no reason.
 [ a6 ] , [ R e7 ]  I now offer a Rook trade.
 [ B e2 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ a3 ]  11. [ a3 ] - prophylactic move to prevent a black knight from landing on b4.
 [ c6 ] , [ R d7 ]  Rook on the 7th!
 [ R x h4 ]  [ g x h4 ] , [ g3 ]  Thinking about what to do I advance a pawn. I also kept in mind that Bert must be careful and not underestimate as otherwise I might be able to promote. While it appears so this isn't Hope Chess because it's not what I'm hoping for. I'm sure he won't but what it boils down to is that I'm doing anything for counterplay seeing that the position is more or less lost. The idea is not getting nervous and seeing if you can do anything to get out trouble. Unfortunately it isn't but thinking the way I do helps me last longer however.
 [ K f3 ] , [ a3 ]  Time to finish this. If black can get white to trade a piece to prevent this pawn from promoting the remaining material advantage (piece+pawn) should decide things quite nicely on the kingside.
 [ g3 ]  [ f5 ]  [ K g2 ]  [ N f7 ]  [ Q d2 ] , [ h6 ]  Starting a fight for the black squares on the K side but the weakening of the white squares offers White an alternative target.
 [ f3 ] , [ B c8 ]  my bishop prepares for b[ x N h3 ] making castling near impossible for white and creating more doubled pawns.
 [ a6 ]  [ N h3 ]  [ b5 ]  [ N f4 ]  [ N a5 ] , [ Q b1 ]  19...[ N a4 ] runs into 20. B[ x N c4 ]  [ g4 ] , [ e x f3 ]  And here I ran into the cross roads should I keep Queens on the board or not. Ultimately I thought Queens on the board would keep the game lively.
 [ R d2 ]  [ b6 ]  [ R e2 ]  [ K f8 ] , [ R x e8 + ]  This really surprised me! My pawn is beginning to gain more value!
 [ R f6 ] , [ Q h7 ]  So instead I put pressure on the h file. Once again without success but at least this time the plan did not backfire.
 [ R c8 + ]  [ K b4 ]  [ R x c4 + ]  [ K x c4 ] , [ K x a6 ]  In the original rules of chess my 48th move would have given me the win with Black down to Bare King. But with the current rules the position is a draw.
 [ N x c6 ]  [ Q x c6 ] , [ B x f6 ]  This is the first red flag.
 [ N g3 ] , [ N d3 ]  Black now wants to get rid of white's last hope the h-pawn. After that he can squeeze the win without worrying some random runners on the edge of the world.
 [ d5 ]  [ c4 ]  [ c6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ e3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ B d2 ] , [ N b d7 ]  So far nothing new under the sun. A variation of the Semi-Slav played by many Grand Masters in the 90s but more or less disappeared in the new millenium. White is ahead in development while Black gained a small run in creating outposts and building an attack.
 [ K x e7 ] , [ O-O ]  I need both rooks out now.
 [ R x g6 ] , [ f5 ]  And now my king-side pawns are all on squares his bishop cannot touch. I had thought this would give me time for rook maneuvers or to bring my king forward to lend his support all without worrying about black's bishop.
 [ e x d4 ] , [ B x c3 + ]  ?! Clearing the way for [ Q a5 ] with a tactical hit on his Bg5.
 [ N f5 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ B x e4 ]  [ d x e4 ] , [ N d2 ]  I have rid the board of black's pesky light square bishop but at what price? Note the weaknesses I left open at [ d4 ] and e5.
 [ h5 ]  [ f4 ] , [ f5 ]  ! 22. ... [ e x f4 ] would break the black center with disastrous consequences for black. At least with this exchange black destroys white's center as well.
 [ e4 ] , [ c5 ]  The Sicilian is often seen at master level. It can lead to very sharp play as explained in some other annotations of mine. I normally see 1...[ e5 ] in my games.
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ e3 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ B e2 ] , [ B x f3 ]  I would not have initiated this bishop for knight trade. I prefer bishops....especially in the early game.
 [ B b5 + ]  [ B d7 ]  [ B x d7 + ]  [ Q x d7 ] , [ O-O ]  Did not think he'd castle King side. I need to bring knight up to prevent his knight from getting to [ e5 ] but don't trade if he goes there it opens f
 [ g3 ]  [ e5 ]  [ B g2 ]  [ d5 ] , [ N f3 ]  ?
 [ B b5 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ R h d1 ]  If black plays well I have nothing. But this means to play [ b6 ] right now and after [ R d8 ] Bb7.
 [ N x d2 ]  [ K x d2 ]  [ O-O ] , [ N f3 ]  I complete minor piece development and have a major developmental advantage over him.
 [ R x a5 ]  [ R x a5 ] , [ R d8 ]  i guess to prevent [ N d7 ] - [ B x d7 ] - [ c x d7 ] and then [ B c8 ] which would be dramatic. But instead black loses its only threat to b1... on the other hand with [ b7 ] and [ b4 ] occupied there was no more threat for a good while...
 [ K f4 ]  [ K e6 ]  [ K g5 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ K f4 ]  [ K d6 ]  [ K e3 ] , [ K e6 ]  47. ....... Ke6?? - with 40 moves of the 50 move rule to play out black leaves his bishop en prise. He realises this and resigns before I play Kxe3. It is quite easy to fall asleep in an endgame like this. Beware - you could be in for a very rude awakening!
 [ N x c6 ]  [ B x c6 ] , [ Q x d6 ]  Oups there goes my queen.
 [ K d7 ] , [ N x a8 ]  Now he asked "Are you talking about your move as a serious blunder or mine? I had actually considered allowing you to capture the knight. But that was a difficult decision" Then I said it's not that. In many respects you are successful. What it is might just be your main weakness and if so this how to turn that weakness into a strength. Plus it's also a learning experience and how you learn from your mistakes. That's why were here and reason that I enjoy mentoring. Actually what I meant is that your previous move so 11...exd5?? was a blunder. Then he said "Oh yes I understand. agreed Then I move my Queen impulsive and aggressive."
 [ B e1 ]  [ g5 ]  [ B x h4 ] , [ g x h4 ]  the [ h4 ] pawn is completely lost there is no possible way to save it.
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ N c6 ]  Normal.
 [ N x d2 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N g f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ d6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B e6 ]  [ b3 ]  [ N g4 ]  [ h3 ] , [ N f6 ]  Maybe I did [ N g4 ] just to waste a move. Nothing is really going on.
 [ N x e7 + ]  [ Q x e7 ]  [ B x d6 ]  [ Q f6 ]  [ B x f8 ]  [ N f4 ]  [ Q b5 ]  [ K x f8 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ K g7 ]  [ R d7 ]  [ Q g5 ]  [ R x f7 + ] , [ K g8 ]  Here White has the crushing 24.Rg7+!! Check out the following variations. A) 24...[ K h8 ] 25.[ N f7 + ] [ K x g7 ] 26.[ N x g5 ] [ B x g5 ] 27.[ Q x b7 + ] wins easily. B) 24...[ B x g7 ] 25.[ Q b3 + ] [ K h8 ] 26.[ N f7 + ] [ K g8 ] 27.Nh6+! [ K h8 ] 28.[ Q g8 + ] [ R x g8 ] 29.[ N f7 # ] Philidor's Legacy! C) Black gets eaten alive after 24...[ K x g7 ] 25.[ Q d7 + ] [ K g8 ] 26.[ Q x c8 + ] [ K g7 ] (26...[ B f8 ] fails miserably to 27.Qc4+) 27.[ Q d7 + ] [ K g8 ] 28.[ Q f7 + ] [ K h8 ] 29.Ng4! threatening 30.[ N f6 ] with a winning position. D) Escaping with 24...[ K f8 ] doesn't help after 25.Rg8+! [ K x g8 ] 26.[ Q b3 + ] [ K g7 ] 27.[ Q x b7 + ] [ K f6 ] 28.[ N g4 + ] [ K e6 ] 29.[ Q x c8 + ] and Black is finished.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B c4 ] , [ d5 ]  This only drops a pawn. 4. [ N f6 ] ... 5. [ d5 ] would have been good positional play. 4. ex[ d5 ] [ N b4 ] 5. [ N c3 ] as shown in this game leaves you not only down in development but also down a pawn.
 [ K d3 ]  [ Q a3 + ] , [ K c2 ]  White will run out of checks soon...
 [ R c8 ] , [ f x e5 ]  This probably was not the right move but I wanted to open a line back to the Queenside for my [ g5 ] Bishop. The drawback is that it also lets Black open a line to my Queenside for his dark squared Bishop. But then I was also hoping that I could do something on the Kingside before he did something on the Queenside.
 [ g3 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ g x h4 ]  [ B x f3 ] , [ B e3 ]  trying to rescue the pinned piece
 [ N e2 ] , [ Q a5 ]  That move was in a way needed cause I was treatening to play [ B c7 ] and then attack his queen with my pawns which would've lead to some problems for him. [ Q a5 ] also attacks my [ a2 ] pawn. I refused to return my knight on [ c3 ] cause I had just moved it.
 [ d6 ]  [ d5 ] , [ N b d7 ]  This blocks in blacks LSB but it's still the best square for the knight.
 [ O-O ] , [ B a3 ]  Preparing for [ B b2 ] [ N x h4 ] [ N x h4 ] [ B x h4 ] doesn't win a pawn because of a discovered attack after Bc2.
 [ Q x h2 + ]  [ K f1 ] , [ B c4 + ]  34. ..... [ B c4 + ] - and now I wave the white flag as the only way to block the check is with the Q and B. Both lead to heavy material loss. Again well played David.
 [ Q a5 ]  [ Q c2 ]  [ R a c8 ]  [ f4 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ N f3 ]  I have to wonder if [ N x c6 ] was better even though it exchanges white's central knight.
 [ N f6 ] , [ N f3 ]  both knights come out
 [ K g7 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ K f8 ] , [ c3 ]  32. [ c3 ] - prevents [ N d4 ] and keeps black's queenside pawns doubled and isolated.
 [ N c3 ] , [ N f6 ]  3. ........... [ N f6 ] - develops a piece and defends the advanced e pawn.
 [ R f d2 ] , [ R x e3 ]  Black goes all in and avoids hole hacked by the bishop but...
 [ R e8 ]  [ Q f3 ] , [ f5 ]  too eager for play: best is [ d6 ] [ B d3 ] [ N d4 ] [ Q f2 ] [ N c6 ] 0-0 Bg4; this is only helping White...
 [ a5 ] , [ N e2 ]  I moved my knight out ready to castle but I didn't notice my [ f3 ] pawn was completely defenseless.
 [ N d5 ]  [ B h2 ]  [ R c8 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ B x e2 ]  [ Q x e2 ]  [ c5 ] , [ R a c1 ]  Here Black can capture on [ d4 ] and give White an isolated pawn but then White gets the c-file.
 [ e6 ] , [ b3 ]  2. [ b3 ] - a little offbeat but prepares to fianchetto his dsb onto b2.
 [ d x c3 ] , [ b x c3 ]  I lose the exchange so material is now even but I have gained an open b-file.
 [ R c8 ]  [ Q a3 + ]  [ K g8 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ R d8 ]  [ f4 ]  [ N d f6 ]  [ B f3 ]  [ a5 ]  [ R d c1 ] , [ N d6 ]  Oh what fun...
 [ N c5 ] , [ g4 ]  If [ h x g4 ] h5. His Kingside is "naked" while my pieces can easily reach it.
 [ d7 ] , [ B d8 ]  Forced!
 [ e5 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ b6 ]  ?! Not really sure about this move.
 [ e3 ]  [ d x e3 ]  [ B x e3 ]  [ N x e3 ]  [ f x e3 ]  [ Q a5 + ]  [ K f2 ]  [ Q d2 + ]  [ B e2 ]  [ Q x b2 ]  [ N h3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ R h d1 + ]  [ K c7 ]  [ N f4 ]  [ Q e5 ]  [ N d5 + ]  [ K c8 ]  [ B g4 + ]  [ e6 ]  [ N f4 ]  [ Q b2 + ]  [ K g3 ]  [ Q e5 ]  [ B x e6 + ]  [ K c7 ]  [ R d7 + ]  [ K b6 ]  [ R b1 + ]  [ B b4 ]  [ R d5 ]  [ Q x e3 + ]  [ K g4 ]  [ R h f8 ]  [ g3 ]  [ R x f4 + ]  [ g x f4 ]  [ Q x e6 + ]  [ f5 ]  [ Q x d5 ]  [ f x g6 ]  [ Q e4 + ]  [ K h5 ]  [ Q x g6 + ]  [ K h4 ]  [ Q x b1 ]  [ a4 ]  [ B e7 + ]  [ K h3 ]  [ Q d3 + ]  [ K g4 ]  [ R g8 + ]  [ K f4 ]  [ Q f1 + ]  [ K e4 ]  [ R g4 + ]  [ K e3 ]  [ Q h3 + ]  [ K f2 ]  [ R g2 + ]  [ K f1 ]  [ Q f3 + ]  [ K e1 ] , [ Q e2 # ]  White struggled like a shoal of fish in a net. But I filleted his king...eventually :-). Thanks for looking at this game!
 [ N d3 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ b3 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ Q e2 ]  It's all starting to look a little cramped which I don't really like but if I can boost my e pawn things should open up.
 [ d3 ]  [ O-O ] , [ B d2 ]  Not the most critical variation. Other moves are [ B g5 ] and Ne1.
 [ B d5 ] , [ R f6 ]  White's king is trapped in a few move. Can white find a way out? I don't think so but anyway it is nice to see how the mate net works.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N e2 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ N b c3 ]  "Book" for this opening an original Alapin creation.
 [ R e3 ]  [ N h6 ]  [ N x e4 ] , [ R d8 ]  I was under the impression that 13.....[ N g4 ] 14.[ R e2 ] just left me a pwn up for nothing. This way it gets more complicated.
 [ Q x d7 ]  [ R x d7 ]  [ f2 ]  [ R f1 ]  [ K c5 ] , [ R g7 ]  Once this bishop is gone Black will find it much more difficult to advance his pawns.
 [ e5 ]  [ Q e3 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ Q g5 ]  [ B f8 ]  [ B d2 ]  [ h6 ] , [ N d5 ]  comments form RD: At move 12 the trade of Q's is a big mistake. White has the lead in development and it will be very hard for Black to develop his [ B f8 ] if you just play 12 [ Q g3 ] intending to continue 13 Nd5. After this White's game goes downhill. White had a big edge before the trade of Q's.
 [ N e2 ] , [ R x a2 ]  Since the d file is now closed black feels safe enough to pick up the unprotected a pawn.
 [ c x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ] , [ N a4 ]  Duh to attack c6.
 [ Q x e5 ]  [ b6 ]  [ Q b8 ] , [ b7 ]  resign - cant stop the promotion
 [ O-O ]  [ N c6 ] , [ a3 ]  Threatening to boost with [ b4 ] and also threatening to boost with c4. I wasn't very familiar with this opening so somewhere I have made an inaccuracy allowing these threats.
 [ Q b5 ]  [ e5 ]  [ B d5 ]  [ e x f6 + ] , [ K x f6 ]  25. ......... Kxf6?? Suicide Suicide and double suicide! Glenda is as pleased as punch to be relieved from defensive duties. As the enemy bishop is only protected by the Witch then Glenda moving onto [ d4 ] is a double attack or fork. As the king is in check black must deal with that and the lsb must be abandoned to his fate leaving my opponent a whole rook down.
 [ B b6 ] , [ a4 ]  Continuing the plan and also threatening to trap the bishop.
 [ N x b5 ]  [ a x b5 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B e7 ]  [ B e3 ] , [ c5 ]  Accepted the chance of en passant as I can take straight back and still be left with a clean pawn line.
 [ N g4 ] , [ B x a6 ]  My hesitation costs me the ability to keep him from castling.
 [ g4 ]  [ N h4 ] , [ f5 ]  Threatening to open the f-file and attacking the [ f7 ] weakness
 [ d5 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ c6 ] , [ e3 ]  I go for the main line
 [ N h4 ]  [ Q h5 ]  [ Q e6 + ]  [ K h8 ]  [ N f5 ]  [ b4 ] , [ N e4 ]  Everything is now ready to aim at Black's K
 [ h x g3 ] , [ f x g4 ]  Wins the bishop back but mate follows
 [ B e7 ]  [ O-O-O ] , [ O-O ]  Both sides have castled white has better development and better center control while black has slightly more space and much more secure King position. I give white the slight edge right now despite the hampered bishop.
 [ K f2 ] , [ Q d8 ]  This was my pure intuition: I saw a nice mate if white takes the N in [ g3 ] and I went for it.
 [ R x g8 ] , [ N x g8 ]  ...so I can exchange rooks. What I intended to do next was to hoover up the pawns on [ f5 ] and [ h5 ] to make mine on [ f4 ] and [ h4 ] passed.
 [ d6 ]  [ f3 ]  [ O-O ] , [ Q d2 ]  The game has transposed into a 9.[ B c4 ] Rauzer.
 [ R h5 ] , [ a6 ]  Tidying up the loose queenside before continuing.
 [ N b d7 ] , [ f4 ]  Grabbing more central space and preparing for a [ e5 ] break in the future. The weakening of my dark squares around my king is not too toxic because black lacks the piece placement to exploit it plus his pawn bulwark on [ c5 ] clogs up the a7-[ g1 ] diagonal.
 [ B d4 ] , [ g5 ]  seeing My position is better trade rook in order to get two of his minor pieces and still have discovered threat as well as threat on his rook still.
 [ e x d5 ] , [ Q b3 ]  I think developing the kingside is a higher priority. I'm also not convinced this is the best square for the queen.
 [ R x g4 + ]  [ K f2 ]  [ R g2 + ]  [ K e1 ] , [ Q h1 # ]  It was a good game I think the white had more possibilities to win and better positions during the game but finally I was a bit lucky but also I defend the attacks successfully and finished it with checkmate. nice play
 [ h4 ]  [ R c4 ]  [ R h1 ]  [ R c e4 ]  [ N g3 ]  [ R e4 e1 ]  [ R x e1 ] , [ R x e1 ]  35 ........ [ R x e1 ] - after a bit of shilly shallying over the last few moves I am glad to exchange off one pair of rooks - now it really is rook and pawn against a knight. I should have been confident of winning this one but my opponent was more than 200 points north of my rating and this is only the second time in my entire life that I have beaten an 1800 player. The last time this happened was 10 years ago when I had a BCF rating of 80 (Elo 1240) and my opponent's was BCF 153 (Elo 1824)! So this was very nerve wracking especially as I had to watch where I put my rook and my king to evade dastardly knight forks.
 [ R f8 ] , [ f4 ]  ?! I don't like this at all. This pawn was well-placed on f3; now it just looks vulnerable. White would probably be having more luck with a queenside attack here.
 [ B x b4 ]  [ R x b4 ] , [ Q x f5 ]  Threatening 29.[ N g5 ] or 29.Qg5ch.
 [ Q h4 + ]  [ g3 ]  [ N x g3 ]  [ h x g3 ]  [ Q x h1 ] , [ N h3 ]  He declines my R on [ f8 ] and he has no hopes to trap my queen. Or so I trust.
 [ B f5 ] , [ Q b3 ]  I had never seen this move before so I decided to follow the database. This move seemed pretty nice to me because it attacks the pawns on [ d5 ] and b7. On the other hand white has already moved his Queen and if black should manage to hunt the queen while developing his own pieces he might get a huge opening advantage.
 [ c x d5 ]  [ Q x d5 ] , [ Q a1 ]  Crossing one's fingers and hoping but their is a tactical problem.
 [ O-O ]  [ N x b5 ]  [ N x b5 ] , [ d5 ]  Black's open lines are more active than white's so it's ok to open up the game. By the other side [ d6 ] instead won't have been bad. The white knight will lose a move to return where it belongs and black is shielded. If white goes [ e5 ] the exchanges (forced) won't leave black in a bad position - with equality (if I'm not wrong!).
 [ K d2 ]  [ f x g5 ]  [ h x g5 ] , [ h6 ]  Ok so give your damn check in [ h6 ] but now the position is looser...
 [ g4 ]  [ b4 ]  [ N x c6 ]  [ Q x c6 ] , [ N d5 ]  Based on the weakness of the long diagonal.
 [ N x c7 ]  [ B x f2 + ]  [ K x f2 ]  [ Q x c7 ] , [ Q h7 + ]  The game ends in a draw by threefold rep. In conclusion even though the game is a sure draw after 11. [ B x h7 ] I feel that it is a good game for a novice to know since the pressure down the h-file maybe enough to scare a black opponent into a rash defense. Especially after 13. ...[ f6 ] after which 14. [ Q d5 ] could give what the upper hand.
 [ R x c1 ]  [ K x c1 ] , [ g6 ]  With doubled up pawns It is now pretty much a bishop a king and five pawns against a king and four and a half pawns.
 [ N f5 ] , [ B d3 ]  this move was supposed to give some air to the queen.
 [ N c3 ] , [ Q f5 ]  ? Another mistake this allows white to continue to harass the queen while building an insurmountable lead in development and center control.
 [ R b x d1 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ B x d3 ]  [ R x d3 ]  [ R f e8 ] , [ R f d1 ]  except this one i did not expect...
 [ B x f3 ]  [ Q x f3 ] , [ N g5 ]  Well I regret this but it was the only way to keep active.
 [ Q x b2 ] , [ Q x e3 + ]  Here again i had to look at it hard...
 [ N x f6 + ]  [ B x f6 ] , [ Q g6 + ]  I have invited evil into my home. This can't end well.
 [ Q h6 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ Q g5 ] , [ B x h7 + ]  
 [ Q e3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ R f d1 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ Q x d4 ] , [ Q a5 ]  I thought Black would exchange queens but really there was no imperative to do so in fact it encouraged overconfidence by White.
 [ h2 ] , [ g4 ]  Accuracy to the very end. After Karpov's phenomenal play it would have been an absolute tragedy to have fallen into the trap 54 􀀺[ b7 ] l:t[ h8 ] 55 c8'ii'?? l:.[ x c8 ] 56 􀀺[ x c8 ] i..[ f5 ] when Black draws e.g. 57 i..h 1 e4! 58 [ a4 ] W[ f2 ] 59 i..[ x e4 ] i..[ x e4 ] 60 .l:t[ d2 + ] 􀀺[ x g3 ] 61 !:t[ x h2 ] 􀀺xh2.
 [ N x d3 ]  [ Q x d3 ] , [ B e5 ]  Black threatens to play [ c5 ] now and when the N moves leave [ b2 ] exposed.
 [ N d5 ] , [ Q a5 ]  ?? The final mistake. Refusing to put his Queen in quarantine on [ b8 ] Black misses the trap and this time White follows through correctly.
 [ O-O ] , [ N e8 ]  clearing the way for [ f5 ]  [ f5 ]  [ B x c5 ]  [ b x c5 ]  [ B d3 ] , [ f4 ]  i decided to close the center even more with this move to prepare g6-g5-[ g4 ] opening lines on the kingside. In some lines a [ B x h3 ] sac might be possible also.
 [ K g3 ]  [ N x b4 ] , [ K h4 ]  But now I'll feast too.
 [ f4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ N x e5 ] , [ f x e5 ]  Exchange of knights.
 [ N b6 ]  [ R d4 ]  [ R d8 ] , [ R x e4 ]  As predicted... I forsaw this.
 [ N c7 + ] , [ K x c4 ]  19. ...... [ K x c4 ] - forced.
 [ Q g5 + ]  [ K b1 ] , [ g6 ]  21. ...... g6?! I received a pm from andywm who said ..... Hello jstevens1! I didn't like move 21 for you. I like to keep all my K side castle pawns intact. I think that is where it started to crumble. Andy ........ Do you the rest of the Inquest Jury agree with this? If so do you suggest an improvement?
 [ a4 ] , [ B d7 ]  Black should have focused on creating his own counterplay instead of trying to stop mine.
 [ B b1 ] , [ B g7 ]  58. ... [ B g7 ] - my last throw of the dice - a pin!
 [ R d1 ]  [ R x d1 + ] , [ Q x d1 ]  And now white is making it easy for black to trade down pieces and try to leverage his pawn advantage into a winning endgame.
 [ d x e6 ] , [ B x e6 ]  2 pieces out but no center. It will be easy to develop for white.
 [ R d1 ]  [ B c4 ] , [ Q f2 ]  ! White Queen has many work She must to protect the K-pawn structure from a possible [ Q g6 ] Knight will need protection after it backs down because of the Bishop but at the same time after [ c6 ] if possible [ Q a7 ] is a good counterattack for this reason [ K g2 ] or [ K h2 ] is not good because could compromise the plan
 [ B x d3 + ]  [ R x d3 ] , [ e4 ]  Fork! Here i accepted the trade of Knights because i was going to have a very strong passed pawn in exchange.
 [ b x c6 ]  [ R f2 ] , [ Q e7 ]  I found [ R f2 ] and he blunders by playing [ Q e7 ] and immediately after moving he resigned. The incoming mate in 6 is easy to see. 30.[ N g5 ] [ Q x g5 ] 31.[ Q x g5 ] [ B a6 ] 32.[ R g1 ] [ B b5 + ] 33.[ c x b5 ] [ c x b5 + ] 34. [ K x b5 ] [ a6 + ] 35.[ K a4 ] and nothing can stop 36.[ Q x g7 # ] I hope you found this game interesting with the many blunders on both sides and the cool opening where white was so clearly ahead!
 [ K f2 ] , [ N e7 ]  re-positioning the knight to add an attacker on the rook
 [ N b3 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ B e3 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ N b d7 ] , [ a4 ]  Pretty standard stuff although the queenside is a bit congested with the two knights. Here I plan to do [ a5 ] if my opponent does Nb6.
 [ g3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ B g2 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ N h6 ]  Usually the Dutch will play ..[ N f6 ] but here Black may be like to maximalized his Bishop attacking range and also manuevering the Knight to [ N f7 ] later.
 [ B x e4 ] , [ B f6 ]  Thats it this move makes white in danger. Also weak points of [ b2 ] pawn with this move is nightmare. Also White has to escape queen but it makes worst for b2. Resignation for white !!!!
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ] , [ N c3 ]  The Vienna game my favourite opening.
 [ e6 ]  [ R d2 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ e7 ] , [ b5 ]  this move was needed much earlier in the game...
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ] , [ N c3 ]  I was happy to see this over an exchange which is something that I have previously refused to study.
 [ R d5 ]  [ Q b3 ]  [ R d6 + ] , [ K f5 ]  46. .... [ K f5 ] - the BK moves nearer to Henry hoping to weave a mating net with his beloved spouse around him.
 [ Q c4 ] , [ N e4 ]  ?
 [ R c1 ] , [ N x g2 ]  This move. It proved to win the game with a knight sacrifice but also seems inherently risky. My thinking was that the rook would take the knight on [ g2 ] leaving the pawn on [ f4 ] undefended. Planning 23. [ R x h2 ] Qx[ f4 ] and then both of white's rooks are directly threatened and [ R x e5 ] is possible attacking white's queen. But is this really sound?
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N x e5 ] , [ N c6 ]  This is a line of the Petroff that while unsound from Black's perspective contains a number of tactical traps for white to fall into e.g. 4.[ N x c6 ] [ d x c6 ] 5.[ e5 ] [ N e4 ] 6.d3? Bc5!
 [ B b7 ] , [ a4 ]  Time to weaken his Queen-side but the flip side of this move is that I am unable to take that move back. Once the pawns move forward they can never go back - so I have created some weaknesses too!
 [ e4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ d4 ] , [ Q f6 ]  A rather quiet first move for Black but this second move is rather curious. Interesting.
 [ c x d5 ] , [ R x f3 ]  the beginning of the end...
 [ Q f4 ]  [ g3 ] , [ Q c1 + ]  the end...
 [ B b3 ] , [ B b7 ]  I strengthen my defence
 [ c x b4 ]  [ Q x e4 + ] , [ B e2 ]  White has a Bishop for two pawns and is significantly ahead in development already. Black has a passed d-pawn but it is indefensible and has no prospects--in fact my *missing* pawns are greater benefits for me because they provide beautiful open lines through the center.
 [ B x f3 ] , [ R f1 ]  So doing what can be done for counterplay I attack his Bf3. I am not surprised that Carl retreats back to b7.
 [ B b4 + ]  [ B d2 ]  [ B x d2 + ]  [ N b x d2 ] , [ d6 ]  Maybe unnecessary. Better is [ B b7 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ B x f5 ]  [ d x c4 ]  [ N x c4 ] , [ O-O ]  Almost all of white's pieces are active and hold the center of the board. Black has an nonactive Q-Knight poor pawn structure and unpleasant opened diagonal a2-[ g8 ]  [ Q c6 ]  [ e4 ] , [ R e8 ]  ...[ d5 ] is better - would close the diagonal a2-[ g8 ] and would give a chance to consolidate
 [ B x e5 ] , [ d x e5 ]  A much more appealing position for white now presents on the castling flank. On the other hand BQ is pointing to [ R c1 ] and hence [ Q g4 ] cannot be played immediately.
 [ B c5 + ]  [ K g3 ]  [ N e7 ]  [ B h3 ]  [ K d8 ]  [ B x c8 ]  [ N x c8 ] , [ R c1 ]  A very good move by White. Black only has one response to stop him from losing the bishop.
 [ c x d4 ] , [ N x d4 ]  The exchange... right now I like the way the game looks despite elyhim hogging up all the white squares with his pawns.
 [ N x d6 + ]  [ K h8 ] , [ R x e5 ]  I could have played [ Q x e5 ] here & forced the trade of Queens but I didn't want to. If after [ R x e5 ] Black brought the Queen home then everything gets traded & I win the Endgame. Black doesn't want to trade either. So I figured he would grab my a pawn instead & threaten my back rank.
 [ c6 ]  [ R h2 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N g2 ]  [ K e5 ]  [ N e1 ]  [ R f5 ]  [ K e3 ]  [ d4 + ]  [ K e2 ] , [ K f4 ]  This is dangerous - either the rooks come off or the king gets trapped on the edge of the board. Also I can use the g file to attack
 [ K h2 ] , [ Q c4 ]  Hm i feel good here. See why? I have [ f4 ] in mind!
 [ Q x e6 + ]  [ K d3 ] , [ R e d8 # ]  good mate! In my opinion you won because all of your pieces were on good active squares and you developed all of your pieces before attacking. Well Done!
 [ B h4 ]  [ g5 ] , [ B g3 ]  Continuation of my plan.
 [ b4 ]  [ c x b4 ]  [ a3 ]  [ K b1 ]  [ c3 ]  [ b5 ] , [ a2 + ]  41. ..... [ a2 + ] and # in 4. Notice that this is a decoy. Henry must capture but the c pawn now crowns.
 [ R h e8 ] , [ Q b3 ]  Maybe better was [ Q c4 ] to prevent [ N g4 ] but [ R e4 ] would have done it anyway.
 [ R x a3 ]  [ N c4 ]  [ R c3 ]  [ N d6 ] , [ R x e3 ]  Rxe3??. I saw [ e8 + ] as a threat for the knight but only a threat as I didn't really expect to be able to play it. I was simply trying to use threats to keep blacks active pieces busy whilst moving mine into better positions.
 [ N e3 ]  [ N f8 ] , [ N f5 + ]  I'm on a nice square with my knight and its supported and free from pawn attack. Bonus: Black is in check. If Black eats it with his bishop I'll be able to start opening up the middle directly underneath his king.
 [ Q x c6 + ]  [ K x c6 ] , [ R x a5 ]  This was his last chance to do something. I tried making this into a puzzle and the automatic mover went to [ a2 ] with the rook. This would have made things more difficult indeed but it would only have taken me longer to get to the win.
 [ B e3 ]  [ Q x b2 ]  [ Q d3 ]  [ N g4 ] , [ N d1 ]  ?? [ N a4 ] would have been better because this allows [ Q x a1 ] loses the rook 18.[ N a4 ] also stops ... [ Q c3 ] [ Q x c3 ] [ B x c3 ] which forks both rooks
 [ N c7 ] , [ b4 ]  white is on the move BEFORE black...
 [ K c2 ] , [ K f3 ]  White was convinced and resigned: a very good fight against a worthy opponent...
 [ h x g5 ] , [ h x g5 ]  Black is forced to exchange knights and creates a two pawn wall in the center. However the pawns are weak and are easy targets. for the rook and bishop pairs!
 [ e x d6 ]  [ Q x b3 ]  [ a x b3 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ B x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N b6 ] , [ R a c1 ]  A good move disallowing long-castling and discouraging Kd7.
 [ b x a6 ] , [ O-O ]  Feeling more and more confident I castle. Now this was delayed until it appeared that I got what I wanted which was noted a move earlier.
 [ Q c3 ] , [ N d3 ]  ?! Surprising knight sac not totally sound.
 [ R f2 + ]  [ K e1 ]  [ R a2 ]  [ b4 ] , [ R x a6 ]  Instead of removing my rook with his king my opponent stops my pawn on the sixth rank
 [ K d8 ]  [ Q x d6 + ]  [ N d7 ]  [ Q h6 ]  [ Q c1 ]  [ d6 ]  [ N c5 ]  [ Q f6 + ]  [ K d7 ]  [ Q e7 + ]  [ K c6 ]  [ Q c7 + ]  [ K b5 ] , [ d7 ]  NxP[ d7 ] would be followed by QxQ a disappointing result for black. I opt for a series of checks. If I can get my queen out of the way [ N e6 ] would fork white's queens. but this would be easily avoided by [ Q b6 + ] and the white queens frog march the black king up against the a wall. Ugh!
 [ K h8 ]  [ R b x a7 ] , [ R a c8 + ]  The game was lost anyway at this point. This was a nice little theoretical game from both sides with the sneaky mating idea of g4-[ g5 ] being blacks undoing.
 [ Q x c1 + ]  [ Q x c1 ]  [ B x c1 ]  [ K x c1 ] , [ N x a2 + ]  23. ...... [ N x a2 + ] - the point. After this plethora of blood letting Etienne ends up two pawns to the good.
 [ B b5 ]  [ K f7 ]  [ R a2 ]  [ R c7 ]  [ R a1 ]  [ R c2 ] , [ g3 ]  Now White is worried about a check on his King rather than pushing his pawn like he wanted to before he can't make up his mind!
 [ Q h3 ] , [ g5 ]  A potentially game ending blunder as if play continues 15. [ Q x h6 ] white mounts a near-unstoppable kingside assault. 15...[ g x f4 ] allows mate in five: 16.Nxd7! [ N e4 ] 17[ N f6 + ] [ N x f6 ] 18. [ R e5 ] [ N e4 ] 19. [ R h5 ] ... and I'll leave it to you to work out the rest ;)
 [ c x b3 ] , [ Q x b3 ]  Although this may seem premature I preferred it to axb3. It raises the future possibility of [ B c4 ] if only I can get rid of the black b pawn and I wanted to keep my options open for my dsb
 [ N d7 ] , [ B c4 ]  I aim for [ f7 ] the weak square in Black's camp.
 [ a6 ]  [ R b3 ]  [ R d7 ]  [ N e6 + ] , [ K e8 ]  Moving my king closer to the fighting-scene.
 [ N e3 + ]  [ K e5 ]  [ B d5 ]  [ K d4 ]  [ B x e4 ]  [ B x e4 ]  [ N g4 ]  [ h3 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ B f3 ]  51. [ B f3 ] - keeping one set of minor pieces on the board - if you are a pawn down or more in a king and pawn endgame it is a lost endgame (assuming no doubletons or isolanis)
 [ N d5 ] , [ K d8 ]  now he cannot castle
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N g5 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ N x f7 ]  [ K x f7 ]  [ Q f3 + ]  [ K e6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ N c e7 ]  8. ........ [ N c e7 ] - all moves up to here are the same as Fried Pt 1. Ion now deviates with 9. [ d4 ] instead of Qe4.
 [ Q e5 ] , [ b2 ]  Passed pawns must be pushed!
 [ Q e7 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ b6 ]  [ e3 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N b d7 ] , [ N b5 ]  With my king in safety and my pieces in the center I mount my attack.
 [ K a3 ] , [ K b5 ]  ...and my king chases my opponent's down...
 [ e x d4 ]  [ R e1 ] , [ d5 ]  7...f5; 8. [ N x d4 ] is better for White.
 [ K g2 ] , [ K d5 ]  Frees the pin on the e pawn
 [ N x f2 ]  [ K x f2 ]  [ B x e1 + ] , [ K x e1 ]  Recapturing with the king is superior than 12. Qxe1... which would cause the queen to be displaced soon enough by a Black rook on e8. Also recapturing with the f3-knight would essentially 'undevelop' the piece and open up the king drastically.
 [ Q e2 ] , [ N x c3 ]  Opens up a discovered attack on the bishop.
 [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ] , [ N f6 ]  Moving his knight instead of capturing my pawn with his queen surprised me.
 [ b x c4 ]  [ R h6 + ] , [ K d7 ]  50. ... [ K f7 ] 51. [ K e4 ] leads to forced continuations... Now after [ K e4 ] Nxc3+...
 [ b x a3 ]  [ O-O ] , [ O-O ]  It was interesting [ [ [ g4 ] ] ] sac a pawn in order to penetrate: [ [ [ g4 ] ] ] Nx[ [ [ g4 ] ] ] Nd7! or [ [ [ g4 ] ] ] Bx[ [ [ g4 ] ] ] NxB NxN [ B d6 ] Rmoves [ B c5 ] Qmoves B[ x N c6 ] anything takes [ B x a7 ] or . A very tricky way to mix up the game I should have tried it. But I dind't see it during the game.
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ] , [ a3 ]  It seems unusual which I usually do in my rapid games. Actually I do not prefer the Sicilian Defense because it will become quite complex to me in these games.
 [ O-O ] , [ Q x d4 + ]  Best move for black here gain another piece and force my King to move. I could block with my rook but Rule #6 comes to mind better not to pin oneself.
 [ N c3 ] , [ O-O ]  Now I need to finish my Q-side development.
 [ B d6 ] , [ c3 ]  pxp exploits the pin pressures the N punishes the weak move maintains the initiative. [ [ c3 ] ] makes little sense here if you want to play [ d4 ] just play it you don't need [ [ c3 ] ] to support. Remember time and space can be as valuable as material especially time.
 [ R g7 ]  [ R c1 + ] , [ K d6 ]  I don't like playing with my King in the wide open like this. White has a couple of chances for check. Plus I have a rook that seems to be paralyzed in corner... never good to leave the big iron out of the fray!
 [ N x d3 ]  [ Q x d3 ] , [ b6 ]  With the idea of [ c5 ] maybe? I thought so and didn´t like it but I did not considered that after ...c5: dxc d column is open and [ e6 ] is a weak point to attack. Shame on me (I just saw that during this analysis)
 [ N f6 ] , [ B x f6 + ]  Check #9 and I don't understand this sacrifice. // Suriin ang # 9 at hindi ko maintindihan ang sakripisyo.
 [ O-O ]  [ B x c4 ]  [ Q x c4 ] , [ Q f3 ]  White looks as though he is clearly aiming to attack Black's kingside: perhaps he is aiming for [ Q g3 ] [ B x h6 ] and [ Q x g7 ] . Black's queen is far away Black's minor pieces will clearly have trouble mobilising to defend and ...[ g6 ] with only lead to more trouble after fxg6. I think this would have won White the game!
 [ f x e4 ]  [ B x e4 + ]  [ f5 ] , [ f4 ]  Gaining a tempo with threat against Blacks Queen. Is also fixing Blacks f5-pawn.
 [ K x h4 ]  [ K g2 ]  [ g3 ]  [ K g1 ] , [ K h3 ]  just walk my pawn down the board
 [ f x e6 ] , [ B x e6 ]  I had to think about it but I thought this was best.
 [ e x f5 ]  [ g x f5 ] , [ f6 ]  A rather sad move to make but almost forced. 19...[ g x [ f5 ] ] loses right away to 20. [ B g5 ] while the attempt to exchange pieces then capture on [ f5 ] still leads to disaster 19...[ N x e3 ] 20. [ Q x e3 ] [ B x d3 + ] 21. [ Q x d3 ] [ g x [ f5 ] ] 22. Nh5!
 [ B x e4 ]  [ d x e4 ] , [ N c2 ]  Trying to create a blockade on [ e3 ]  [ Q x a7 ]  [ R d3 ] , [ b4 ]  ? This pawns will become very weak maybe [ Q b6 ] was better...
 [ d4 ] , [ e x d4 ]  Exchange variation of Philidor's defense.
 [ R e7 ]  [ Q f8 + ]  [ Q e8 ]  [ Q x e8 + ]  [ R x e8 ] , [ f4 ]  39. [ f4 ] - despite the queen trade I will still have to watch those kingside pawns. However I now have an extra piece in Fou Lenoir. At the moment he is still out of play but never fear I have now found a use for him. Over the next few moves you will see just what use I will be putting him to.
 [ R x d5 ]  [ R x f2 ]  [ Q c7 + ]  [ K f6 ]  [ Q d8 + ]  [ K g6 ]  [ Q g5 + ]  [ K f7 ] , [ Q h5 + ]  He keeps behind his pawn well so I said forget it I'll just trade Q's and still be a R up.
 [ B c5 ] , [ N x c6 ]  ok i will retake after first i prepare an easy mate on [ f2 ] (which must be easy to defend isnt it ?)
 [ d4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ a6 ]  Normal developement here and now I "lose a tempo" with this move instead to go on with the inmediate c5. But it's on purpose. I just don't like to go - again and again - into [ B b5 + ] etc. It can be very boring.
 [ B x h2 + ] , [ K x h2 ]  Fritz recommends 24. [ K x h2 ] (0.70) Obligatory.
 [ a5 ]  [ f4 ] , [ R b2 ]  Threatens Rxg2+.
 [ d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ e4 ] , [ e5 ]  My introduction I would like to remind our players that pawns have 4 job functions; a. Protect the king b. Protect other pieces c. Fight for territory & space d. The threat of promotion.
 [ c5 ] , [ g4 ]  I didn't expect [ g4 ] on the next move already. Talk about a complicated position. I can play [ B x c3 ] or cxd4. Bx[ g4 ] doesn't look good to me. If I play [ B x c3 ] I'm most worried about gxf5. If his bishop weren't on [ d3 ] I could play [ Q g5 + ] and stir things up which leads me back to [ c x d4 ] as my next move.
 [ g3 + ] , [ Q x g3 ]  Black cannot give perpetual check for the white queen will prevent it.
 [ O-O ] , [ f3 ]  9.[ f3 ] To prevent Knight infiltrations.
 [ e x d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ B b4 ] , [ e5 ]  ?! She tries to make it interesting and open up the centre and you never know maybe it was the best move to play against me considering the skill difference.
 [ R a c8 ]  [ b x c4 ]  [ Q x c4 + ] , [ Q x c4 + ]  at this time I only had hope for a draw.
 [ N c e2 ] , [ N e5 ]  Determined to keep niggling away at that Queen too
 [ B d7 ] , [ N x d5 ]  Unexpected move by black. I cannot pass up the free pawn and now a threat on [ c7 ] to gain black's rook.
 [ K d2 ] , [ B e6 ]  King moves out of check and I move my LB back to [ e6 ] to prevent capture by [ f3 ] pawn.
 [ c5 + ]  [ d x c6 ]  [ e ]  [ p ] , [ B x c6 ]  My opponent is on the ropes with roughly 2/3 minutes on his clock. When there is an opponent in time trouble feel free to make troubles to him and create real complications.
 [ R g3 ] , [ K h6 ]  Can't let myself stay pinned.
 [ a x b5 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ e5 ]  Expecting [ N d5 ] followed by my Qxb3. Not [ B x c5 ] the responding [ N x c5 ] will give black an immediate advantage. I need to move faster than black and delay him as much as possible.
 [ N h4 ] , [ Q d5 ]  I plan to castle queenside anyway so this gets the queen out of the way. I really didn't want to play [ B g6 ] and block the rook that I just moved. What will I do if he plays Bd3? Maybe trade bishops and then he's threatening [ Q x h7 ] so I can play [ Q h5 ] to guard the pawn and attack his knight.
 [ K f5 ]  [ K g3 ]  [ N x f4 ]  [ K f3 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ K g3 ]  [ N h5 + ]  [ K f3 ]  [ B x h4 ] , [ K e3 ]  The mating net being cast...
 [ e5 ]  [ c3 ]  [ N f5 ] , [ R x d6 ]  30. [ R x d6 ] - After this move black finally resigns on the grounds of ruinous loss of material. After [ N x d3 ] [ f x e3 ] white is an overwhelming 10 points up on material. White brilliantly exploited the trapped rook on [ a8 ] in the middle game and caused black to lose very heavy material. An excellent Expert Victory for ab15 in a blitz game!
 [ K x e6 ] , [ Q g4 + ]  queens finally in the game
 [ Q c7 ] , [ N d5 ]  I liked this move although I'm not sure if it's completely sound. If 19... [ N x [ d5 ] ] then 20. [ Q x [ d5 ] ] with an attack on the d-pawn. More on that later. If Black chooses to move the queen he has to be careful: If 19... Qc6? (threatening to take the white queen if the knight on [ d5 ] moves) leads of course to 20. [ N x e7 + ] [ K h8 ] 21. [ N x c6 ] and wins. If 19... [ Q d7 ] then 20. [ f6 ] [ N f5 ] 21. [ N e7 + ] [ K h8 ] 22. [ B x f5 ] with a dangerous attack. So I guess the only alternative for Black would be to retreat the queen again with 19... [ Q d8 ] where I would probably play 20. [ R g1 ] (intending 21. f6) to continue my kingside attack.
 [ f x e5 ] , [ N x e5 ]  18. [ N x e5 ] - I leave the knight on the board as it still cannot escape without the rook on [ a8 ] being taken for starters. This move now threatens Nxg6. I have threats on both sides of the board. My opponent times out but gameknot analysis shows that I am winning hands down. Freddy if you had the black pieces here how would you continue this game? Can you turn the tables on me - this is your challenge. Anyhow I hope you have all had a good read. Kind regards - Joanne
 [ K e8 ]  [ R x f8 + ]  [ B x f8 ]  [ Q h g6 + ]  [ K e7 ]  [ Q g8 f7 + ]  [ K d8 ] , [ Q x f8 + ]  White has two queens but is losing.
 [ B x h6 ]  [ g x h6 ] , [ N e5 ]  White must press the attack. Even if he wins 2 of Black's tripled KRP's an endgame would be lost. Blacks passed KRP would be crushing.
 [ B b5 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ B x c6 ]  [ d x c6 ]  [ d3 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ h3 ]  [ B h5 ]  [ Q e2 ]  [ B d4 ]  [ B d2 ] , [ c5 ]  HE's trying to rid his doubled pawn.
 [ Q e4 + ] , [ K f6 ]  Yes out in the open!
 [ O-O ] , [ N g4 ]  Now I am just looking for to play knight on [ h6 ] and pawn to f5.
 [ R b8 ] , [ R e d2 ]  not [ N c3 ] now because [ b4 ] is good to annoy me.
 [ K x g5 ]  [ Q d2 + ]  [ K h4 ]  [ g3 + ]  [ K h3 ] , [ B g2 # ]  See? The ending is beautiful. I tell you playing the King's Gambit is an adventure. So now you know go out and play it! Just remember to put in your research and make sure you got the strategies all sorted. Thanks for watching! -thatbennyguy
 [ R b1 ]  [ e6 ] , [ B g5 ]  this was very clever
 [ R e1 ]  [ b4 ]  [ b3 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ a4 ]  [ b x a3 ]  [ e ] , [ p ]  Thank God for en passant!
 [ R d8 ]  [ Q h6 + ]  [ K e8 ]  [ N x g6 ]  [ f x g6 ]  [ Q x g6 + ]  [ K e7 ] , [ Q g5 + ]  not 32.exf -[ R f8 ] and black can some how stay a live but after 32.Qg5+! Black is un protected now .
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ c4 ]  [ d x c4 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ b5 ]  [ N x b5 ]  [ B a6 ]  [ N a3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ Q a4 + ]  [ Q d7 ]  [ Q x d7 + ]  [ N x d7 ]  [ e3 ]  [ B x a3 ]  [ b x a3 ]  [ R b8 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ c5 ]  [ d x c5 ]  [ N x c5 ]  [ B d2 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B x c4 ]  [ B x c4 ]  [ N x c4 ]  [ N d3 + ]  [ K e2 ]  [ R f d8 ]  [ R h d1 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ B a5 ]  [ R d5 ]  [ R x d3 ]  [ R x d3 ]  [ K x d3 ]  [ N x f2 + ]  [ K e2 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ R d1 ]  [ g5 ]  [ K f3 ]  [ f5 ]  [ N d6 ]  [ g4 + ]  [ K f4 ]  [ N x d6 ]  [ R x d6 ]  [ K f7 ]  [ B b4 ]  [ R b7 ]  [ h3 ]  [ g x h3 ]  [ g x h3 ]  [ R c7 ]  [ R d8 ]  [ K g6 ]  [ K e5 ]  [ R c2 ]  [ K x e6 ]  [ R x a2 ]  [ R g8 + ]  [ K h6 ]  [ K x f5 ] , [ R h2 ]  Black wants the pawn. Let's poison it.
 [ g4 ] , [ f x g4 ]  Now I move my g pawn up to [ g4 ] and black captures with his pawn at f5.
 [ N d4 ]  [ K c7 ]  [ N e6 + ]  [ K b7 ] , [ N d4 ]  The knight has to move back to protect c2.
 [ K e8 ] , [ R a e1 ]  King is pinned not much I can do to stave off the inevitable now... ready...
 [ N c6 ]  [ a3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ f4 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ b6 ]  [ b4 ]  [ c x b4 ]  [ a x b4 ]  [ N f5 ]  [ N b5 ]  [ a6 ]  [ e4 ]  [ N d6 ]  [ B b2 ]  [ f6 ]  [ e5 ]  [ f x e5 ]  [ B x e5 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ g4 ]  [ R g8 ]  [ Q b3 ]  [ a x b5 ] , [ R x a8 ]  1st castle took down
 [ Q b2 ]  [ R d3 d2 ]  [ Q c1 ] , [ R d8 d3 ]  Now the pieces are in place to attack the kingside. All I would have to do now is to move my E pawn.
 [ f5 ] , [ N e5 ]  With the Black KB pawn no longer able to contest the square I seize the outpost for my Knight.
 [ e3 ]  [ N b d7 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ Q a5 ]  The defining move of the Cambridge Springs variation. Black threatens a number of strokes including [ B b4 ] winning a pawn and [ d x c4 ] discovering an attack on the Bg5.
 [ B b7 ] , [ d4 ]  Going to blow open the centre rid knight and nail him on H7 with my Queen
 [ Q f5 + ]  [ Q g6 ]  [ Q h3 + ]  [ Q h6 ]  [ Q x h6 + ] , [ K x h6 ]  Can you spot white's best move here? I didn't during the game.
 [ K h7 ]  [ R g3 ] , [ R g7 ]  I'll remove the rooks if he doesn't and if he plays along the 3rd rank I'll simply play Re7.
 [ R e g1 ]  [ Q f2 ]  [ R g f1 ]  [ Q g2 ]  [ R h g1 ]  [ Q h2 ]  [ Q x h2 ]  [ R x h2 ] , [ R f x d1 ]  if 54.[ R h7 ] trying to counterattack then r[ d f1 ] threatens mate win.
 [ N x e5 ] , [ f x e5 ]  white has the edge here but it is still going to be difficult to win against best play by black
 [ Q x e4 + ]  [ B e3 ] , [ Q x c2 ]  A tempting move but Black is in heaps of trouble due to underdevelopment and his one developed piece the queen is too far away from the king to help with the coming shot...
 [ B f5 ]  [ e3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B e2 ]  [ a6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ b5 ]  [ Q d1 ]  [ R c8 ]  [ B d2 ] , [ Q d6 ]  Whites position is solid but black has the iniative and definite compensation.Black is almost fully developed and ready to pressure whites Q-side and centre.
 [ N x b5 ]  [ a x b5 ] , [ h4 ]  ? White needs to turn his full attention to the queenside or else he'll simply get steamrolled.
 [ N b5 ]  [ B x d2 + ]  [ N x d2 ]  [ B x b5 ]  [ a x b5 ]  [ O-O ]  [ R b1 ]  [ R f c8 ]  [ O-O ]  [ Q d6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N g4 ] , [ N e5 ]  here things started to look better
 [ N e f5 ]  [ e4 ]  [ c5 ] , [ Q d1 ]  I could have done 13.[ b3 ] but what happens in the next two moves is magically mysterious.
 [ R e1 + ]  [ K d7 ] , [ K g2 ]  No chance of getting the Rook either.
 [ N a3 ]  [ Q e7 ]  [ h3 ] , [ B e6 ]  10. ..... [ B e6 ] - clearing the decks and preparing a bishop trade.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ] , [ f4 ]  Kings' Gambit: try it because I grew fond of it...
 [ g5 ] , [ N h5 ]  Better was 11..[ b4 ] not allowing any of my pieces to occupy the [ d5 ] square. (a pawn would)
 [ f4 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ Q f3 ] , [ N f8 ]  (EZB) White's attack is the more dangerous inasmuch as it can lead to a mate but there is no weakness in Black's camp and his plan will be to hold White's attack and to obtain a preponderance on the Q side with the ultimate object of obtaining an advanced passed Pawn and queening it... ...White's only hope is centered in his attack whilst Black has every incentive to bring about an end game.
 [ e6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d5 ] , [ e5 ]  5. [ e5 ] - I try and cramp the Master Mater for style.....
 [ c x d4 ] , [ Q a5 + ]  Pointless move. Again [ N f6 ] was better
 [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ] , [ B c4 ]  3. [ B c4 ] stumps me a little. I don't see it in my Sicilian book (which is admittedly quite old) nor do I see it referenced in a couple other books I have on general openings. I cannot even find it on wikipedia. I don't know what to call it. However I do see it in the World DB and it has the highest winning percentage for white and also the highest rating of white players who choose this move. Despite that it is played barely more than 1% of the time as white's 3rd move in this position. Further I don't see the purpose. It makes no immediate threats and it doesn't really gain much ground in the center either. I may have just been better off with 3. d4.
 [ B d2 ]  [ N b6 ]  [ B b4 ] , [ Q d5 ]  23. .... [ Q d5 ] - offering a queen trade which for once I decline!
 [ f4 ]  [ R a e8 ]  [ f5 ]  [ B h5 ] , [ R a e1 ]  Critical point what can black do? [ a5 ] is met by [ a4 ] [ B g4 ] is met by Qf4.
 [ g4 ] , [ B c6 ]  and the summer palace is no longer suitable for vacation.
 [ N x f6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ Q e2 ]  [ e6 ]  [ B g5 ] , [ B g4 ]  This super-refinement reduces all of White's attacking prospects. Petrosian has a knack for snuffing out such dreams twenty moves before they even enter his opponent's head!
 [ b3 ] , [ K h3 ]  This shouldn't be hard to figure out now. I'll give closing thoughts at the end. Just watch.
 [ Q c5 ] , [ g5 ]  here this pawn has to be taken with h-pawn because if 21..hxg 22.bxg6.... followed by 23.q[ f7 ] mate.
 [ a6 ]  [ B f3 ] , [ Q f7 ]  Queen moves to safety but is still along the same diagonal as her king.
 [ O-O-O ] , [ O-O ]  ! white feels secure after this... the midgame is becoming very interesting and long.
 [ Q x d4 ]  [ O-O ] , [ b4 ]  b4! And now we'll see............
 [ N x e4 ] , [ Q d4 ]  generally developing the Q early is really frowned upon. for good reason White should gain tempo after tempo attacking the Q with the minor pieces and pawns. 4.[ N f6 ] is better.
 [ R d8 ]  [ g5 ]  [ N c5 ]  [ K g7 ]  [ N d7 ] , [ g x f4 ]  Also possible is ...Be7.
 [ N c3 ] , [ O-O-O ]  Even with an open c-file I castle long anyway.
 [ B g5 ] , [ h5 ]  12. .... [ [ h5 ] ] - trying to stop the Witch getting to [ [ h5 ] ] but Klaus now warns me she is bound for g6. I manage to delay this by advancing my pawn to [ e4 ] but Klaus finds another way to increase the pain.
 [ R a d8 ] , [ R f e1 ]  with my development complete I plan to try a queen side pawn storm via [ a3 ] and b4.
 [ K e8 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ B g8 ]  [ K g6 ]  [ B d5 ]  [ K g7 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ N f5 ]  [ B b3 ]  [ B b4 ]  [ K d8 ]  [ f7 ]  [ B x f7 ]  [ K x f7 ]  [ K c7 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ K d8 ]  [ B a5 + ]  [ K c8 ]  [ K e7 ]  [ K b7 ]  [ K x d7 ]  [ K b8 ]  [ c6 ]  [ K a7 ]  [ c7 ]  [ K b7 ]  [ c8 = Q + ] , [ K a7 ]  Black fights for a stalemate. While the black king gets trampled by the knight--black never throws in the towel. It was an admirable struggle well played.
 [ e x f6 ] , [ d x c4 ]  Now it is in fact *Black* who has a strong Pawn center.
 [ g x f4 ]  [ g x f4 ]  [ f x e5 ]  [ f x e5 ] , [ K c7 ]  Ad lib... Black is thriving into trouble... I was reckoning...
 [ f3 ]  [ g x f3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e5 ] , [ B e7 ]  9. ..... [ B e7 ] - at last Fou Lenoir is soon gonna lend Henry his cassock!
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B c4 ] , [ N h6 ]  Not expecting that at all. I figured he would play Nf6. I like this better. I decide to humiliate that silly knight for even thinking about developing to the side of the board. When Baby is in the corner I aim to set her free. And that's what I ended up doing.
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ] , [ e4 ]  I've been really starting to like gambits lately; mainly unsound ones. I was actually considering the true blackmar gambit (1.[ d4 ] [ d5 ] 2.[ e4 ] dx[ e4 ] 3.f3) although it's dubious because of 3...[ e5 ] I still think it has a psychological advantage because of its seldom use in chess.
 [ K g6 ] , [ N d4 ]  A better position for my knight as it is unthreatened.
 [ d4 ] , [ N x c6 ]  Too tempting to resist...
 [ B c5 + ]  [ e3 ]  [ a6 ]  [ d4 ] , [ B b4 ]  I think this move was dubious it wastes half a tempo whilst being easily refuted. However...I'll leave it to others to explore better options...
 [ h4 ] , [ Q f6 ]  I really want White to retreat his Knight. I could have threatened it with [ h6 ] but he might have just ignored the threat... taking the Knight would open the h-File for White's Rook. Now I'm threatening a Knight Fork with Nxf2.
 [ N e5 ]  [ d x c4 ]  [ N x c6 ]  [ b x c6 ]  [ B x c4 ]  [ N d5 ] , [ N x d5 ]  White improves Black's pawn structure for the benefit of closing off the d-file making Black's KB a spectator for a while. White's own pieces meanwhile are free to seek happy squares.
 [ B e4 ] , [ N x c7 + ]  ignores the bishop completely the best thing to do
 [ Q x g3 ] , [ g5 ]  White takes black bishop on g3. Black pawn moves to g5. Note white is now +1
 [ N h3 + ]  [ K h1 ]  [ Q g1 + ]  [ R f x g1 ] , [ N f2 # ]  White only made 3 real mistakes in the game but rather than focus on the specific moves I'll offer some advice. I think what was lacking was any urgency to fully develop his pieces. Instead of focusing on the white pawn that was effectively dead White should have worked to finalize development sooner. White moved his queen into Black territory twice without a clear strategy and the second time it should have been maintaining defense. When making forays into enemy territory seek to use multiple pieces to have a sustained presence and threat. Finally you have to play defensively sometimes. Don't move out pieces that are critical to defense and consider all potential moves on enemy attacks and understand when you have to trade even if it's not to your advantage. Being ahead in points doesn't matter if you get checkmated. Thanks for your comments and review.
 [ N f4 ]  [ R x d1 + ]  [ K x d1 ]  [ K g7 ] , [ K d2 ]  Each side begins to bring their king in to the center.
 [ R f d8 ]  [ Q c2 ]  [ B x f3 ] , [ g x f3 ]  16. [ g x f3 ] - black busts up Bob's castled position but will he be able to capitalise on this?
 [ g x h5 ] , [ B d2 ]  finally his bishop moved. but its doing nothing. but what else? he needs to untangle his pieces i guess.
 [ R a6 ] , [ g4 ]  Continuing my kingside pawn storm although with so few pieces I'm searching for an endgame advantage.
 [ R x g1 ] , [ R x g1 ]  This relinquishing of the open file was Black's long-term error. It cleared the way for a devastating tactic...
 [ b x c5 ] , [ B c4 ]  Again 7. [ [ g4 ] ] looks very tempting but it still fails to gain the trapped knight after 7. ... g5! and now if 8. [ g x h5 ] black replies with 8. ... [ [ g4 ] ] striking at white's pinned knight. Instead white opts for developing a piece and preparing to castle. We'll see about grabbing that knight after white's rook moves off of h1.
 [ B d6 ] , [ B f4 ]  ? The knight is too far forward to receive enough support to compensate for the attacks that can be brought to bear on it.
 [ Q d2 ] , [ N d4 ]  probably should of castled but I like to regain the tempo I lost earlier.
 [ N x b8 ]  [ f4 ]  [ K f8 ] , [ f5 ]  For the sake of a pleasant interlude to this intense annotation it may be of interest to know the origin of the expression 'grophworthy' - a term derived from the Gopite/Draphenium hybrid mineral 'Grophenite'; now and again Wackyworld's clouds turn a yolky colour due to an infection from a vapour-eating parasite known as Loshtophitus. Fortunately a government-paid agency known as 'A Whiter Wackyworld' are responsible for directly administering 'Grophenite' into clouds when symptoms first emerge and the parasite is rapidly dissolved. For as long as 80 years common citizens from the Graw City would point a finger to the sky at a yellow cloud remarking 'that cloud's grophworty' over the years the expression was adopted in many sports including cloud-surfing cloud-skiing cloud-jesting cloud-chestnuting cloud-chess and eventually chess.
 [ Q x g5 + ]  [ Q x g5 + ] , [ K x g5 ]  69. ……. [ K x g5 ] - after all the fireworks just the two kings are left on the board - a draw by dead game - even though I have conceded a low draw here (thankfully the game was unrated) things could have been so much worse so it is certainly a case of wheew and triple wheew!
 [ Q d2 ] , [ Q d3 ]  Interesting black's trying to get some minor piece activity but it wouldn't have made any difference really if he's just taken the Queen. Alternative variation: 20... [ Q x d2 ] 21. [ N x d2 ] [ B d3 ] [The only difference with this variation is that black is a move behind. He's attacking the pawn after it's already been defended.]
 [ R e1 + ] , [ K f8 ]  Not [ K d7 ] losing the queen of course and not [ K d8 ] blocking forever my rook.
 [ f6 ]  [ B e3 ] , [ f5 ]  Note that this same position could have been reached with 9 [ B e3 ] in one move less since Black would not have played 16...[ f6 ] but gone straight to16...f5.
 [ d3 ] , [ d5 ]  Gaining back a tempo by attacking the B. Whether White exchanges Pawns first or not the B must retreat.
 [ c5 ] , [ N c4 ]  This gives me the chance to "use" my dead [ N a3 ] for something... I wouldn't let it escape...
 [ h4 ]  [ K b6 ] , [ h3 ]  50. ..... [ h3 ] - ....... but I think I am gonna win it!
 [ N x d4 ] , [ B c5 ]  Houdini thinks that this is much worse than natural moves like [ N c6 ] or Nf6. Now [ B e3 ] would have the threat of Nxe6.
 [ N f3 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ c4 ]  Queen's Gambit formation...
 [ Q h3 ] , [ N x d4 ]  ?? This loses material.
 [ N c2 ]  [ Q h6 ] , [ N x e1 + ]  more or less trying to take some control
 [ h5 ] , [ K f2 ]  unpin the King...
 [ Q e7 ] , [ N e2 ]  Making room for castle to cross board
 [ Q g3 + ]  [ K g1 ] , [ R e1 # ]  The final position.
 [ N e5 + ]  [ K e8 ]  [ N c7 + ] , [ K e7 ]  The knights come and check the king twice and he is being cornered himself. The rook is about to be taken.
 [ B b3 ]  [ B x b3 ]  [ Q x b3 ]  [ R a e8 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ Q e6 ] , [ Q c2 ]  14. [ Q c2 ] - hmm - white declines a queen trade. I smell a possible threat of [ Q x h7 # ] way way down the line. I now play the prophylactic [ h6 ] to prevent a knight from landing on g5.
 [ a3 ]  [ h6 ]  [ R h3 ]  [ g5 ]  [ R h4 + ]  [ K g3 ] , [ f x g5 ]  "Here I decided to wave the white flag on the grounds of ruinous loss of material viz:- 49. [ K g3 ] [ f x g5 ] 50. [ R x b6 ] [ K e7 ] 51. [ R a6 ] [ R x h6 ] 52. [ R x a3 ] [ R h4 ] 53. [ R e3 ] [ K f6 ] "
 [ d5 ] , [ g3 ]  I admit that this isn't the best opening and i don't really know how to use but i got board so decided to try some new openings
 [ K x h7 ]  [ K h3 ]  [ Q f5 + ] , [ g4 ]  I try to block.
 [ Q f4 ]  [ K f8 ]  [ N e4 ] , [ R d8 ]  22. ...... [ R d8 ] - challenging the d file. Looking at white's position you wonder how in the heck did he lose?!
 [ R d2 ]  [ N a6 ] , [ g3 ]  Whoops...
 [ O-O ] , [ N e5 ]  Looking to move to Nc6.attacking Queen and bishop.
 [ d6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ a6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ h6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ e4 ]  [ B h7 ] , [ g3 ]  I think we're well off the book line English by now but I'm still thinking [ B g2 ] and castling king side at some point.
 [ Q c1 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ N d5 ] , [ Q e5 ]  and again not the brigthest
 [ Q x d3 ]  [ Q x a5 ] , [ O-O ]  Better castle sooner rather than later..I'm feeling a little exposed.
 [ B f2 ] , [ N c3 ]  To win the pawn on a2.
 [ B g4 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ a6 ]  Not the best better would probably be n[ f6 ] or nc6.
 [ N g5 ] , [ f6 ]  Looking good. PxP BxN repeating the pin...
 [ Q e7 ]  [ N e2 ]  [ R d8 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ R x d1 + ] , [ N x d1 ]  ? Maybe better captured with King. Anyway glad to finally see some retreat.
 [ N b4 ] , [ B b5 + ]  ?! But this check is uncessary and should throw that tiny edge away. I think that white delivered the check just because it's possible. But black can force the Bishop back and gain tempo. Ok how should black proceed Erika?
 [ N d7 ]  [ Q h5 ] , [ B f6 ]  [ N f6 ] and I have had to think something but the way back to [ e5 ] is still open.
 [ R d3 ]  [ e5 ]  [ R a d1 ]  [ R a7 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ R b7 ]  [ Q g4 ]  [ N b8 ]  [ Q h5 + ]  [ g6 ]  [ Q h6 ]  [ Q c8 ]  [ B d6 ] , [ N c6 ]  I'm thinking of tripling up on the d file with the queen but a continuation I looked at had me not only losing the advantage but the game as well! The exchanges led to Black queening a pawn with his knight protecting it.
 [ K x d7 ]  [ Q f5 + ] , [ K e8 ]  And the kings tucked away safely again. This is a strong place for the king because of my pieces on the queenside defending the open file.
 [ B c4 ] , [ h6 ]  I was bracing for [ [ [ b5 ] ] ] first. Then it would have been either put the bishop on [ b3 ] and risk trading it off its good diagonal after [ N a5 ] or scurry back to e2. Now I have time to prevent b5. The bishop's current diagonal looks pretty good since the [ f7 ] square is lightly defended and he's still a few moves away from castling. However [ h6 ] stops my knight from joining the fray. And if he had played [ [ [ b5 ] ] ] first a Bx[ f7 ] sacrifice wouldn't have lead anywhere. [6. ...[ [ [ b5 ] ] ] 7. B[ b3 ] [ N a5 ] 8. [ d3 ] Nx[ b3 ] 9. ax[ b3 ] Bb7]
 [ c x b4 ] , [ Q d4 ]  ! This is Kamsky's brilliant find. The knight and pawn are forked though black has what looks like a clever response.
 [ Q b3 + ] , [ N b4 ]  Can I have a (!)? I tried with 41. [ K x a5 ] but [ N c6 + ] 42. QxN (the only one or Ra8#!) [ Q a3 + ] 43. [ K b5 ] (if [ Q a4 ] [ R b8 + ] and wins) [ R b8 + ] 44. [ N b6 ] [ Q b3 + ] and the perpetual threat comes again! (This was what I thought but it was not true: 45. [ K a6 ] [ Q a3 + ] 46. [ N a5 ] and black is lost since he has no checks anymore. I didn't see it so I decided to play the sacrifice.
 [ R a6 ]  [ h6 ] , [ g x h6 ]  now [ f6 ] pawn will promote
 [ B x h1 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ B g8 ]  [ B e4 ] , [ Q x e4 ]  
 [ B e3 ]  [ Q a5 ] , [ Q x h7 + ]  and a check
 [ N e4 ] , [ R x a2 ]  30. ......... R x a2?? - no he can't and now he pays with his king. My Christmas has come early! I play 31. [ N f6 ] and my opponent resigned after I announced 32. [ R x h7 # ] next move (an Arabian Mate). Beware of knights - they can catch you unawares and give you knightmares!! In my opponent's case it was Arabian Knightmares!! After the awful shock of my game with Bob I needed this shot in the arm like manna from heaven!!
 [ Q x f5 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ Q x f2 + ]  [ K d1 ]  [ Q f3 + ]  [ B e2 ] , [ Q d5 ]  P[ h3 ] was also vulnerable.
 [ B x h3 ] , [ N h4 ]  Once again continuing my plan of Nf5. [ R h1 ] will have some more power after the bishops are traded. Notice that the bishop on [ [ h3 ] ] and [ g2 ] create an interesting relationship. Black wants me to take the [ [ h3 ] ] bishop. Bx[ [ h3 ] ] Qx[ [ h3 ] ] and the queen is very hard to remove from that square not to mention [ N g4 ] is a threat. I want him to trade so I can put my rook on h1. Bx[ g2 ] Kx[ g2 ] most anything Rh1.
 [ B x d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ N f3 ]  This move surprised me I was expecting Knight b3. Maybe because he wants to make his knight an attacking piece when I castle.
 [ B f7 ]  [ Q b8 ] , [ B x g8 ]  Safeway was acting impulsively now
 [ B a5 ] , [ B e2 ]  White cannot put off moving his bishop any longer. White considered capturing on [ [ d5 ] ] first but rejected that line because the black knight on [ [ d5 ] ] (after recapture) would make development of his knight on [ b1 ] more difficult.
 [ N f3 ] , [ e6 ]  this is a ok move... i think [ N f6 ] was best
 [ N g6 ] , [ B g3 ]  Not wanting to exchange bishop for knight here. The two bishops side by side are a strong battery.
 [ c3 + ]  [ K e4 ] , [ K e2 ]  Now White's king has the opposition but he can be outflanked on the king side.

The objective of the game is to capture the opponent's 2 rooks (not including promoted pawns) whilst avoiding checking the opponent's king. As soon as the opponent's king is checked the opponent wins the game. If no move can be played without checking the opponent's king the game is a draw. ___ 6.1 Special Rules: If either player hesitates just as they are about to make a move the opponent is allowed to cry out 'Maggot-Moose' and they will be rewarded with a free legal move of their opponents pieces. The words 'Maggot-Moose' must be said articulately; 'Magga-Moose' 'Maggom-Toos' or 'Mag-Moose' are not acceptable. If a player temporarily leaves the game for any reason during play it is acceptable for the opponent to slyly move pieces around at their discretion. If for any reason either player leaves the game before it has finished and doesn't return within exactly 5 minutes both players must be roasted and fed to the spectators.
 [ R x h7 ]  [ Q x h7 ]  [ Q x b2 ]  [ R b1 ]  [ Q x c3 ] , [ R x b7 ]  I though maybe there will be some compensation but no way.
 [ O-O ] , [ R a7 ]  Here 11... [ Q x e4 ] was not possible because of 12. Re1! [ Q x f4 ] 13. Re8=.
 [ B a3 ]  [ b5 ]  [ B d6 ] , [ B x e3 ]  44. [ B x e3 ] - the bishop is finally able to gobble up that passer. I now have a one pawn advantage but can I convert it. If I do then although this is an unrated game this will be my biggest triumph on gameknot. Just look at those ratings!!
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ N f6 ]  The Petroff one of the more counterattacking responses to [ e4 ] and Nf3.
 [ a3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ Q d1 ]  ?? The Queen must retreat along the a1-[ h8 ] diagonal. Now...
 [ R g8 ] , [ R b7 + ]  and now: if [ K h8 ] I have [ K f6 ] if [ R g7 ] I have [ R b6 ] back to the initial position for the second time
 [ K f8 ]  [ N x h7 + ]  [ K e7 ] , [ Q f6 # ]  Black never gets the chance to mate on e2.
 [ R c a3 ] , [ f4 ]  {Lagrave Polgar - 66%} (26...[ R b7 ] {Nakamura - 34%}) I think Nakamura is looking to avoid Nb6. The move that was chosen forces white to move his bishop. Maybe [ N c8 ] followed by [ B c4 ] in order to advance the pawn to [ a6 ] and then move the knight to [ a7 ] to try and make it more active.
 [ e4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B b4 ]  [ e5 ] , [ N c6 ]  Blocking the c pawn
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ] , [ h4 ]  That move threw me for a loop but didn't cause me to stray from my normal developmental steps. I don't know if your intention was to distract me or not but you did get my attention... lol
 [ g6 ]  [ K c3 ]  [ K g7 ] , [ K c4 ]  (!?) A little dubious I feel. White could just about have forced a draw at this or the previous move by attacking the c- and a-pawns: 23.[ R c4 ] [ R c8 ] 24.[ R a4 ] [ R a8 ] etc. Now the rook's access to the Q-side is blocked and King has almost lost touch with his own pawns...
 [ c6 ] , [ e3 ]  Supporting my bastion and opening a line for the KB.
 [ N f6 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N d2 ]  [ c5 ]  [ c3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ f4 ]  post-mortem : The end of the thematic line
 [ Q x g4 ]  [ N x d4 ] , [ Q d1 ]  Forced. White doesn't want to give up the dark squares with [ B x d4 ] and as black threatens both ...[ N c2 + ] and ...[ d5 ] with a discovered attack the Q must move.
 [ K b5 ] , [ b3 ]  34. [ b3 ] - to stop the black king in his tracks for as long as possible.
 [ g4 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B c4 ] , [ d5 ]  A useful freeing move for Black. He's happy to give back the pawn in return for open play and a counter attack.
 [ N c3 ]  [ R b c1 ]  [ R x c1 ]  [ R x c1 ] , [ R x b3 ]  ?? The last couple of moves were played relatively fast but by this time we were playing for almost two and a half hours. Can you guess what white played next?
 [ b4 ]  [ R e4 ]  [ K b3 ]  [ R h4 ] , [ K a4 ]  ?? I had to threat his rook with [ Q d8 ] or advance the pawn to b5.
 [ N x e7 ] , [ B c4 ]  Down four points all trades benefit black.
 [ R e1 ]  [ a6 ] , [ B x c6 ]  ?? Giving up the Bishop pair on an open board for what? A 'tempo'.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ Q d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e x d6 ]  [ e ]  [ p ]  [ N x d6 ]  [ Q e5 + ]  [ Q e7 ]  [ Q x e7 + ] , [ B x e7 ]  I decide on a queen-for queen swap as mine can't leave her file
 [ N x c6 ] , [ b x c6 ]  While Black's Queenside may appear weakened he has succeeded in bringing two pawns in direct approach to the centre.
 [ a5 ]  [ f4 ]  [ b4 ]  [ B a6 ]  [ R c2 ]  [ a4 ]  [ R c3 ]  [ R d3 ]  [ R x d3 ]  [ B x d3 ]  [ R c8 ]  [ K f2 ]  [ R c3 ]  [ R d1 ]  [ b3 ]  [ K e2 ]  [ b2 ]  [ R b1 ]  [ R a3 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ d3 + ]  [ K d2 ]  [ K g7 ]  [ R x b2 ]  [ f6 ]  [ B c6 ]  [ g5 ]  [ R b7 + ]  [ K f8 ]  [ e x f6 ] , [ g x f4 ]  Ok so reassessing the board this game turned into an endgame to casting the net for checkmate.
 [ N e7 + ] , [ K f7 ]  Very smart. And now I lose a piece by force. Did you see it coming?
 [ c5 ]  [ O-O ] , [ a6 ]  6. ..... [ a6 ] - preparing a possible b5.
 [ f5 ] , [ e x f5 ]  i took the [ f5 ] pawn why not?
 [ e4 ]  [ c6 ] , [ N f3 ]  Here's another variation I'm not familiar with.
 [ b x c5 ] , [ Q c7 ]  Getting out of the pin. Note the Queen is on the [ c7 ] diagonal leading to his monarch.
 [ R x f5 ]  [ K x f5 ]  [ K g7 ]  [ e7 ]  [ K f7 ]  [ K e4 ]  [ c3 ]  [ K d3 ]  [ K x e7 ]  [ K x c3 ]  [ K f6 ]  [ K d3 ]  [ K g5 ]  [ K e3 ]  [ K x h5 ]  [ K f2 ]  [ K g4 ]  [ K g2 ] , [ h5 ]  
 [ Q d7 ] , [ R d1 ]  the move that will eventually win the game. That rook is awkwardly placed on [ e5 ]  [ f4 ] , [ R g3 ]  [ R h5 ] was a better choice but blacks options diminish after [ Q e2 ] etc.
 [ c x d5 ] , [ Q x d5 ]  Threatening mate early is a mistake; it's easily rebuffed by the 26. [ B e4 ] skewer.
 [ N d2 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ Q d5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ B e4 ]  [ Q e2 ]  [ B x f3 ]  [ Q x f3 ]  [ Q x f3 ]  [ g x f3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ f4 ] , [ N b8 ]  The queenside being blocked black switches to the kingside
 [ N x d5 ]  [ B c4 ] , [ N x c3 ]  I don't think this can be the best response from black. Helps White hold the d4-pawn and gives him the half open b-file whereas Black has to develop his DSB before he can take advantage of the half-open c-file. Alternative variation: 7. ... [ e6 ] 8. [ N f3 ] [ B e7 ] 9. O-O O-O 10. [ R e1 ] [ a6 ] [Maybe a better try for Black]
 [ B h4 ]  [ R f1 ] , [ R d e7 ]  Now Black can take on [ f4 ] pawn.
 [ Q x f4 ] , [ B f3 ]  13. [ B f3 ] - Fou Leblanc sidesteps the Witch and a possible discovery is lined up on the h1-[ a8 ] diagonal.
 [ K f1 ]  [ R f8 ]  [ N f g5 ]  [ N e6 ]  [ N x e6 ] , [ f x e6 ]  The f-line is open.
 [ B g5 ] , [ Q f3 ]  Oh terrible! [ N d2 + ] and the white queen must move to [ e2 ] to block. Then N[ x N c4 ] for free. Black is better off with NxB+ followed by NxR White loses two major pieces in as many moves.
 [ O-O ] , [ d6 ]  A desirable move would have been ...[ [ d5 ] ] but that is not really feasible here on account of 8...[ [ d5 ] ] 9.ex[ [ d5 ] ] Nxd5? 10.Bx[ [ d5 ] ] Qx[ [ d5 ] ] 11.[ N c7 ] etc. This more circumspect advance sensibly closes up the centre.
 [ K e7 ]  [ Q g7 + ]  [ K d8 ]  [ B f6 + ]  [ K e8 ] , [ B g6 # ]  and that's game.
 [ K d4 ]  [ K f8 ]  [ K e5 ]  [ K g8 ]  [ K f5 ]  [ K f8 ]  [ K g6 ]  [ K g8 ] , [ R b8 # ]  ...and I keep my king moving up to the 6th rank and with my opponent moving his king onto the same file my rook could advance to the top rank for a king and rook checkmate.
 [ R d b1 ] , [ N d4 ]  And finally the pressure gets to my opponent. Both his bishops are not doing much and he's nearly desperate for something to do. The game could still end up a draw even here; but he chooses now to fight for activity and doesn't quite get it right. His next few moves are designed to wrest control of the a or perhaps b file and free up the position a bit. Again there are tactics for me and this time they're much more obvious and disastrous for white.
 [ b x c3 ] , [ c5 ]  Still in opening book theory I was actually surprised to see this move. Most players are not that schooled this deep in the Nimzo-indian (Samisch Variation). In fact I have no idea what the response from white is supposed to be here.
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ c6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ Q x d4 ]  [ B f8 ]  [ N e5 ] , [ Q f6 ]  Powerful central development now lets see what else we can bring in....
 [ Q h6 ] , [ B x c3 ]  After this move I will respond by retaking. Afterall I am not going to give this knight away. This however is standard (the most common response with this move.)
 [ O-O-O ] , [ h6 ]  Preventing [ B [ g5 ] ] perhaps? That plan wasn't even on my mind. More likely planning [ N h7 ] followed by [ N [ g5 ] ] in an effort to destabilize the f3-pawn? Or does it prepare [ g5 ] and Bg7? Who knows?
 [ R e4 ]  [ K g6 ] , [ R e5 ]  Even with the R there is no way for Black to stop all of the pawns.
 [ B d3 ]  [ f x e5 ]  [ d x e5 ] , [ c4 ]  Advancing the C5 pawn.
 [ Q f6 + ]  [ K e8 ]  [ Q f7 + ]  [ K d8 ]  [ f6 ]  [ Q d6 ] , [ K x e3 ]  the culprit is arrested: meanwhile Black is fighting an upcoming mate on the other side of the board...
 [ B c4 + ] , [ K g7 ]  I need to get rid of his knight So I can get his queen using my bishop I will force him to move his knight.
 [ O-O-O ] , [ N d5 ]  First step: open a line for my QR to use.
 [ N e2 ] , [ B b7 ]  White's 19. [ N e2 ] seems to serve little purpose. It has nowhere to move that presents any threat to black. In fact it opens up [ e4 ] which looks like a great home for a black knight. But I choose a move that might give me an opportunity to pin and exchange white's knight.
 [ B x h4 ] , [ N e7 ]  ? Oops! I think that was just a mistake. [ Q d7 ] was the same.
 [ N c3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ e4 ] , [ d6 ]  Black has made the normal first few moves for a KID moves which can usually be played in almost any order. Move order *can* be used by Black to limit/allow various methods of advance by White but this is generally a very subtle finesse. For instance Black can castle instead of playing ...[ d6 ] inviting White to advance the pawn to [ e5 ] hitting the N which then drops back to e8. White will then attack to use his center as an aggressive weapon (the Classical idea) and Black will defend to demonstrate how White's center is actually overextended and weak (the Hypermodern idea). Neither side is "right" it's just a matter of taste (especially at a level below GM).
 [ e6 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ Q e2 ] , [ O-O ]  Black castles removing his King from the white Queen's line of fire.
 [ B x f3 ]  [ g x f3 ] , [ K h7 ]  ?! As soon as I made the move I realised how much better 10. [ N d4 ] was but it turns out to be a similar result.
 [ c x b5 ] , [ Q c2 ]  (!) Rather than lose the file after 24...Qxc1?? Inviting the Q exchange Black hopes to establish a rook on the 7th whence he can haul in White's Q-side pawns: 25.[ Q x c2 ] [ R x c2 ] 26.[ B c1 ] [ R c8 ] with strong counterplay. Of course to achieve this much activity Black hardly notices the loss of a second pawn...
 [ Q e2 ]  [ f x g4 ]  [ b x c6 ]  [ R x c6 ]  [ R x g4 ] , [ Q h5 ]  Pinning the R. Only move which doesn't loose material is [ R e1 ] (or b2) - to protect the queen. After [ f5 ] by black and a subseuqnet exchange of Qs black should be able to spoil white's central pawn chain with [ b6 ] and push his connected K-side pawns. It is a bit unclear but I think black would definately be better.
 [ N b d7 ] , [ e3 ]  ...but not playing it actually since it is beter for white to try to strangle black instead of releasing the pressure. Besides it would leave a semiopen column to black and I'm not ready to defend or to use it to attack.
 [ f6 ] , [ Q a2 + ]  Probably [ Q b1 ] threatening [ e4 ] threatening [ g6 ] would have been better. Black can't go fxg since [ N x g5 ] goes deeply into his king's court.
 [ c3 ] , [ b x c3 ]  Black pushes and I trade Pawns.
 [ B e7 ]  [ R e c1 ] , [ R x c1 + ]  This is now a real mistake from me: Giving up the open file. However the time pressure is becoming real factor since I have about 4 minutes left and no increment. I should certainly know better than this but it is actually a psychologicalt "disease" players from GM to beginner have. They understand the position they know what they should do but they think and think and suddenly do somethign ridiculous like this. Their thought is "Well I gotta do something so I'll just do this". Time pressure causes this mainly since we can't find the good candidates in low time. My opponent only had a minute more but he started playing very fast once he realized he had lost a pawn. *But here is a little puzzle; What is the best move? I'll reveal my analysis in the end.
 [ f6 ] , [ c x d5 ]  I notice I have enough attackers to win a pawn here.
 [ N h7 ]  [ e4 ] , [ O-O ]  introducing a problem: f4...
 [ N c3 ] , [ e6 ]  So black appears to have the dragon formation fully set up. I am woefully behind in development.
 [ e4 ] , [ c5 ]  Hi here a blitz game. I've got black and this is the Sicilian defense.
 [ Q f4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e x d6 ]  [ e ]  [ p ] , [ c6 ]  It's probably better to take the pawn.
 [ Q x b5 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ Q b6 + ]  [ K e7 ] , [ g6 ]  The pawn seems to be of use in providing certain distractions while weaving a good mating net.
 [ B d4 ] , [ N f6 ]  [ B e7 ] is an interesting alternative. For example 18....[ B e7 ] 19. [ B x g7 ] [ R g8 ] 20.[ B d4 ] Be4! with some counterplay for the sacrifice. In addition 20....[ B f6 ] is alternative. Black gains an open g file for the pawn and an opportunity to swap Whites dangerous black diagonal bishop. Obviously declining the offered pawn leads to different lines but Black is no worse off regardless. And still gets gets his bishop active and a chance to castle if White declines the offer.
 [ K f8 ] , [ B x a8 ]  Or instead of [ Q d6 ] the rook could've moved and then [ B x c6 ] winning the queen. Thanks for reading my fifth SO vs. SOE.
 [ f x g4 ]  [ h x g4 ]  [ R x f2 ]  [ R h7 ] , [ g3 ]  29. [ g3 ] - after being 5 material points up The Champ offers Afro a draw! Afro accepts. Afro can get one material point back by playing fx[ g3 ] forking rook and pawn on [ h2 ] (which is pinned) and he can also bring his queen to [ h4 ] and suddenly Old Matey hangs over the champ so he may need to bring his pieces back and defend against it so it is High Draw honours to Afro - well played there!
 [ d5 ] , [ d6 ]  ...[ e6 ] is more accurate
 [ O-O ] , [ B g4 ]  A major departure for me. I've never played it before; I'm not sure I will again. 7...[ N b d7 ] or maybe 7...[ Q c7 ] were preferable.
 [ g4 ]  [ N d7 ] , [ R g1 ]  Menchik forces the pace. She intends a powerful attack on Thomas' King.
 [ e6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ O-O ]  Castled by move 4
 [ K e2 ] , [ N x f3 ]  Finally a piece can come in to attack the blocker of the pawn and White's rook better not move because Black simply promotes and then the queen and rook come in for the kill
 [ N x c4 ] , [ R f d1 ]  Rook into action >> d file
 [ B x e2 ]  [ K x e2 ] , [ N x d4 + ]  and white resigned. thanks for reading please feel free to make comments
 [ Q x e3 ]  [ f x e3 ] , [ R g8 ]  With Queen's traded off he looks to pressure these half-open files. Given [ g4 ] can be played preventing the h-pawn would probably have slowed White a bit.
 [ K d3 ]  [ R x d2 + ]  [ K x d2 ]  [ N e4 + ] , [ K d3 ]  34. [ K e2 ] cannot change destiny [ N x g3 ] 35. [ K f3 ] Nf5etc..
 [ N x e4 ] , [ B h4 ]  I should have retreated to [ e3 ]  [ g5 ] , [ B g3 ]  he is already dictating where I put my pieces
 [ N c4 ] , [ K f7 ]  I'm thinking that my darksquare Bishop is a pretty bad piece although the trade doubles my pawns
 [ B d7 ]  [ N b d2 ] , [ R c8 ]  Black no longer has any good moves!
 [ K e6 ]  [ b5 ]  [ K d6 ]  [ R g2 ]  [ N f4 ]  [ R a2 ]  [ R g8 ]  [ R a6 ]  [ K d7 ]  [ N b8 + ]  [ K e7 ]  [ B c5 + ]  [ K f7 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ N e6 ]  [ b6 ]  [ R d8 ]  [ b7 ]  [ R x d7 ]  [ b8 = Q ]  [ N x c5 ] , [ R x f6 + ]  
 [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B g4 ] , [ Q b3 ]  Attacking the two weak points [ b7 ] and [ f7 ]  [ e6 ] , [ Q x b7 ]  So White has gained a material advantage from his positional one.
 [ K g1 ]  [ Q h2 + ]  [ K f2 ]  [ R f8 + ]  [ K e1 ]  [ Q g3 + ]  [ K d1 ]  [ R x f1 + ] , [ Q x f1 ]  Trading off.
 [ Q x e6 ] , [ R c4 ]  I move the rook to bring it across to help but it is all way too late.......
 [ K h1 ] , [ R g8 ]  Better - however hopeless - was 25...[ Q x f7 ] which would have contained the damage to the major exchange (queen for rook). Now a bishop gets carried off as well.
 [ N x g4 ] , [ N c2 + ]  Mistake. In order to do this move you need to remove the defending queen first. Much better is b5! or equalizing play with Nxg4.
 [ N x g3 ] , [ f x e4 ]  f:e4? Maybe it was an inattention.
 [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ a6 ]  Najdorf... I'll have to renew it soon
 [ f x e4 ]  [ R e1 ] , [ f5 ]  It worked perfectly as planned... and I kept my piece.
 [ Q h6 + ] , [ Q f6 ]  Chose against [ R f6 ] here because of the loss of the pawn.
 [ B e7 ] , [ Q e2 ]  Left open for any direction of castling
 [ e4 ] , [ e5 ]  Both players start of with the King's Pawn Game.
 [ N d2 ]  [ g5 ]  [ N b1 ]  [ N d f7 ] , [ N c3 ]  25. [ N c3 ] - feeling that I have a reasonable position I decided to offer a draw here. Jim wanted to play on because he felt it was still too early in the game. As it turned out my position did go south from here although it was exactly 20 moves later that I was to wave the white flag. Looking at the position now I see that black does have a slight edge due to the placement of his knight on e5. Still if you don't ask you don't get.
 [ R f f8 ]  [ N g6 ] , [ B b6 ]  And he gets his part in the action.
 [ h x g5 ]  [ h x g5 ]  [ R x h8 ]  [ B x h8 ] , [ N x g5 ]  Better than [ B x g5 ] f6.
 [ d5 ]  [ c4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ c x d5 ] , [ Q x d5 ]  This is an unusual line of the Queen's Gambit Declined: Marshal Defence: Exchange Variation. Obviously now 4.[ e4 ] is unplayable.
 [ N c3 ] , [ B e7 ]  This is a move I consider almost as a defeat since it doesn't threaten anything. But I have to castle if I want some attacking chances.
 [ R e3 ] , [ Q c6 ]  25. [ Q c6 ] - must keep the pressure on the threat of [ N f3 + ] is renewed.
 [ R g7 + ]  [ K h2 ]  [ f x e4 ] , [ d x e4 ]  [ R x e4 ] BxN and [ B x e4 ] [ R x f2 + ] then [ Q x h3 ] (you see not to play [ e6 ] was a good decision...)
 [ N c a4 ]  [ N x a4 ]  [ N x a4 ] , [ h4 ]  Not surprisingly Charles is going for an open flank.
 [ B g5 ] , [ e6 ]  Expecting [ h4 ] but with this move he appears to be protecting his pawn structure and developing at the same time
 [ R f d8 ]  [ R d3 ]  [ a5 ]  [ Q b6 ]  [ R a6 ] , [ Q e3 ]  Still stymied but I like that black has removed one rook placing it on [ a6 ] where it will do his king no good. It suggests that a kingside attack might be warranted.
 [ B x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ] , [ Q b6 ]  15. ...... [ Q b6 ] - an excellent move nasty double attack on the f pawn.
 [ N c7 ] , [ e5 ]  15. [ e5 ] - a speculative pawn sac for aggressive play.
 [ g x f5 + ]  [ K x f5 ]  [ N x a7 ] , [ h5 ]  Racing for the finish line.
 [ Q h6 ]  [ Q b2 + ] , [ K e1 ]  43...[ R g8 ] is essentially forced here.
 [ Q x c8 + ]  [ K e7 ]  [ Q c4 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ f3 ]  I want to defend my e pawn of course.
 [ Q c8 ]  [ B g2 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ R b e1 ]  [ R e7 ]  [ f x e5 ] , [ B x e5 ]  25. ........ [ B x e5 ] - pawn trade.
 [ e2 + ]  [ N x c5 ]  [ e x f1 = Q + ]  [ R x f1 ] , [ d x c5 ]  I'm a rook to a pawn down.
 [ B f3 ]  [ R h f1 ]  [ B x d5 ] , [ K c2 ]  [ K b1 ] would protect [ a2 ] while getting the king off black's black bishop diagonal. I assume [ K c2 ] was to free [ N d2 ] for movement.
 [ K c3 ]  [ g4 ]  [ K d2 ]  [ g3 ]  [ K e2 ]  [ K h3 ]  [ K f1 ] , [ d5 ]  Can't continue with my g pawn or white could go for a draw I think.
 [ K g2 ]  [ R c3 ]  [ R a4 ]  [ R c2 + ]  [ K h3 ]  [ a2 ]  [ K g3 ]  [ f5 ]  [ h3 ]  [ g5 ] , [ h4 ]  That was mistake on his part that I missed [ g x h4 + ] [ K x h4 ] and [ R x c4 + ] wins.
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B b5 ] , [ N f6 ]  3. ....... [ N f6 ] - normally [ a6 ] is played here but this move is pretty good.
 [ O-O ] , [ O-O ]  At this point what I see is both sides evenly developed though I feel that white's pieces are more mobile. This I feel gives me a minor positional edge I feel.
 [ d4 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ f3 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ B b5 + ] , [ N b d7 ]  5. ......... [ N b d7 ] - eschews [ c6 ] as that will enable me to get rid of my doubled d pawn and be a clear pawn up.
 [ f5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ O-O ] , [ b3 ]  (I wouldn't recommend dxe either.)
 [ h4 ] , [ g4 ]  ?! (Dubious) [ g x h4 ] would have opened the g file for counterplay which would have been dangerous for Black after [ R g1 ] and Bb2; however this also prevented Black from invading on the kingside.
 [ N f3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B g5 ]  [ Q e6 + ]  [ B e2 ] , [ R e8 ]  At this point I saw a mating opportunity. All i need to do is castle and get my [ a1 ] rook to e1. If he sacreifices the queen to save mate at least i've won the queen. If not then its mate. Plus my queen is already attacking kingside and you black square bishop is positioned perfectly for a mate ooportuniy later down the track.
 [ N x f5 + ]  [ R x f5 ]  [ R x c3 ] , [ N x c3 ]  Things still look bleak down by a full rook there looks to be no hope for me.
 [ b3 ]  [ c5 ]  [ B b2 ] , [ N c6 ]  8. ..... [ N c6 ] - Charlotte is beginning to get the hang of how the knights move.
 [ B x d3 ] , [ B e6 ]  Instead of [ B e6 ] [ R f6 ] would protect that bishop. Now white is bound to trade bishop for rook.
 [ B x c5 ] , [ Q d3 ]  Not an extremely useful move. Moves like [ B d3 ] [ N f3 ] would be good developing and aiming to castle.
 [ N e1 ]  [ c5 ]  [ R g c3 ]  [ Q a7 ]  [ b x c5 ]  [ b x c5 ] , [ R c d3 ]  why Rd3? I don't see why [ R x c5 ] is bad
 [ R x a2 ] , [ B b4 ]  I take pawn at [ a2 ] with my rook and black moves DB down to protect [ a3 ] pawn and attacking my knight at d2.
 [ N d2 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ b3 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ N e7 ] , [ N b5 ]  Hoping to trade down a bit.
 [ N f6 ] , [ N c3 ]  defends the [ e4 ] pawn
 [ c4 ]  [ N f4 ]  [ B f1 ] , [ N x d4 ]  Colle picks up a second Pawn. The Knight is apparently hanging but Colle can win Menchik's Knight on [ Q2 ] in return.
 [ b x c6 ] , [ O-O ]  castle
 [ R x c8 ]  [ d3 ] , [ R x c7 ]  While this delays my development that c-pawn must go
 [ a x b5 ]  [ a x b5 ] , [ g3 ]  Preparing to advance on the side where White has the majority I assume.
 [ K e7 ]  [ K e4 ] , [ K f7 ]  
 [ Q h3 ]  [ e x f5 ]  [ R x f5 ] , [ N x d3 ]  Not sure if this is best for black but it doesn´t seem bad. Rook on 8th line still is a valuable defensive piece.
 [ K e7 ] , [ K g2 ]  (?!) The first sign that White is unsure how to proceed. Broadly speaking the idea seems right but methinks [ K f2 ] was the better choice. As a result I was very tempted indeed to play 24...Re2ch 25.[ N x e2 ] [ R x d1 ] reducing the ending to simpler terms. But I thought to gain a bit of time by beginning a K-side advance straight away.
 [ B d3 ]  [ d6 ] , [ N c3 ]  [ N c3 ] to tempt Black knight into trading
 [ K b2 ] , [ N c5 ]  Chasing the queen around doesn't really achieve anything. 20...[ f5 ] looks good at first glance but after 21.[ Q c4 ] Black is in some difficulty. 20...[ R d8 ] or 20...[ R b8 ] is best.
 [ K e2 ]  [ Q e4 + ]  [ B e3 ] , [ R c4 ]  The rook finally arrives at [ c4 ] with tempo and eyes up the [ c2 ] square. I thought this was a strong move but didn't quite appreciate how strong until I started to examine the white queen's options for retreating from the attack.
 [ c5 ] , [ f4 ]  ?! This is not any standard line I know of. More common are 2.[ N f3 ] or 2.Nc3. With this move White announces in no uncertain terms his desire to utterly control the center (and foreshadows a propensity for pawn-pushing).
 [ B x d5 ]  [ Q x a7 ]  [ N b3 ]  [ g3 ]  [ K g8 ]  [ a4 ]  [ R d a8 ]  [ Q d7 ]  [ R f d8 ]  [ Q b5 ] , [ R a5 ]  I want to push my passed pawn but that will prove difficult
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ B b4 + ]  [ c3 ] , [ e x d4 ]  Probably should have moved the bishop out of danger.
 [ Q f7 ]  [ Q x c7 ]  [ Q x c7 ]  [ N x c7 ]  [ R e7 ]  [ N b5 ]  [ a6 ]  [ N x d6 ]  [ R d7 ]  [ K c1 ]  [ R e7 ]  [ N c4 ]  [ b5 ]  [ N e3 ]  [ f4 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ R f7 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ g5 ]  [ R e7 ]  [ R x e7 ]  [ N x e7 ]  [ a5 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ a4 ]  [ K d2 ]  [ K g6 ]  [ K d3 ] , [ K f6 ]  He should play 38...[ K f5 ] challenging white's King which now marches to the center.
 [ d4 ] , [ e6 ]  White moves his queen pawn to [ d4 ] and I move my e pawn out to e6.
 [ e4 ] , [ c5 ]  I immediately played [ c5 ] and hit the clock.
 [ K h4 ] , [ R x d3 ]  He told me to finish this game quickly he had to go... My reply: OK I win quickly and you can go.
 [ Q e3 ]  [ Q b2 + ]  [ N e2 ]  [ c3 ]  [ Q x e5 + ]  [ K c6 ] , [ Q e6 + ]  I'll Avenge you my brave dead knight! You may be gone but you are NOT forgotten!!
 [ R c1 + ]  [ K g2 ]  [ R x f6 ]  [ Q h5 + ]  [ K g7 ] , [ Q g5 + ]  Computer analysis give White a big advantage in previous moves... 42. ... [ R c1 + ] doesn't seem a decisive error if 42. ... [ R c d7 ] (defending the Knight keeping connected the Rooks) then 43. [ Q h5 + ] [ K g8 ] 44. [ B c4 ] wins the Rook.
 [ N h5 ]  [ K x a7 ]  [ N f4 ]  [ K b6 ]  [ N x h3 ] , [ K c5 ]  60 . [ K c5 ] - the white king is approaching fast? Will he get to [ g1 ] on time? I now guard the queening square with [ N f2 ] which will force white to give up his bishop. Notice that I cannot lose this game with the fall of the h pawn whatever happens now.
 [ Q x h6 ]  [ B x h6 ]  [ R g2 g1 ]  [ R d x g1 ] , [ h x g1 = Q + ]  Minor mistake. [ R x g1 ] gets me a queen instead of a rook. But damage done
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B b5 ] , [ g6 ]  to put white out of the more common tracks...
 [ B d3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N g5 ] , [ g6 ]  best move and most common to guard the h pawn.
 [ b5 ] , [ a4 ]  A4 lures him in. If he takes the pawn C4 and A4 are now undefended for a free pawn.
 [ R e1 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ B x e7 ]  [ N g x e7 ]  [ N b d2 ] , [ O-O ]  !?Inviting an attack.Since I decided my [ d4 ] pawn was a goner I decided to castle.I had been half expecting for my opponent to sac on [ h7 ] but I decided that the worst I could do is draw with good play.The flow of the game changes and the rest is a good example of attack and defence
 [ B x f6 ] , [ R a b1 ]  so i can move my b pawn or my queen without losing material
 [ K x f6 ] , [ N g4 + ]  !!
 [ c4 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N e5 ]  [ B x e2 ]  [ Q x e2 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ B x e5 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ B g3 ]  [ f5 ]  [ c5 ] , [ g5 ]  That is a risky move. But I did not like being squeezed so I tried to attack.
 [ f x e6 ]  [ R x e6 + ]  [ R x e6 ]  [ N c7 + ]  [ K d8 ]  [ N x e6 + ]  [ K c8 ] , [ Q g8 + ]  36. [ Q g8 ] !! - this move forces black to give up his knight.
 [ B d5 ] , [ f x g7 ]  P for P...
 [ N c6 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ Q d3 ]  [ N x b5 ]  [ Q x b5 ] , [ N x e4 ]  5. ...... [ N x e4 ] - first blood to Buddy NN. However does he lose from here? Well read on.
 [ B b4 ] , [ N x e5 ]  for sure he had no other choice but to go with what he had planned. i dont want to eat his Rook i want to reposition my Bishop on [ d6 ] without his queen or black bishop getting involved
 [ h5 ] , [ B x g4 ]  ? Maybe better was [ h3 ] forcing me into the exchange. Anyway. This represent an unique opportunity to open the h column for my rook and keep white distracted from d5.
 [ Q c4 + ]  [ K g6 ] , [ Q h4 ]  Attacking two pieces but..Qh4!
 [ Q x e4 ]  [ N x e4 ] , [ N f4 ]  18. ..... [ N f4 ] - a nasty attack on my [ g2 ] pawn. Also a knight fork is threatened on e2.
 [ N f6 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ d4 ]  [ d6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ N b6 ] , [ e x d6 ]  The exchange variation. My preferred way to play against the Alkhine I have never tried the four pawn attack and instead play the exchange variation which is a little less ambitios but good none the less. I am actually going for a specific sub variation the one I call the weird v variation.
 [ Q d7 ] , [ Q c2 ]  [ B x b7 ] was definitely the play to eliminate the threat but I will take it.
 [ B x g5 ] , [ Q x e5 + ]  Forking King and Bishop. What can White do about it?
 [ B x c4 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N f3 ] , [ b6 ]  ...[ c5 ] is better.
 [ B x d3 ] , [ g6 ]  I think 9...[ d5 ] was still better letting the bishop protect the knight and threatening to fork his pieces with 10...[ e4 ] if he doesn't react
 [ R h1 ] , [ Q x h1 + ]  He could resign here with a clean conscience
 [ d4 ] , [ N f6 ]  9. ...... Nf6! - this developing move has a sinister purpose. The [ e4 ] pawn is under threat and I am also threatening [ N g4 ] taking advantage of the pin on the [ f2 ] knight.
 [ N x b6 + ] , [ K e7 ]  ?! ...and not Kc6... because after [ R b1 ] white would become really dangerous.
 [ f3 ] , [ g6 ]  Finally! No more traps can be set by White. The [ d4 ] pawn's triumphant teasing will end
 [ c x b4 ]  [ c x b4 ] , [ c5 ]  This seems to make things unnecessarily easy for white. The trade creates two connected passed panws. More resilient would have been 41...[ [ b5 ] ] which locks down the position with all of black's pawns on light squares where they are invaulnerable to the white bishop. At that point white might try to get behind enemy lines with the king through [ e4 ] and abusing zugzwang. I am not entirely certain that it will actually lead to a win unequivocally or that it is a theoreticl draw and I merely misplayed the following variations. In any case [ [ b5 ] ] would certainly allow white to mess up.
 [ B x h7 + ]  [ K h8 ] , [ B d3 ]  Ok the egomania I mentioned in the intro kicks into high gear. I'm now a pawn up with a pleasing and active position. Time to liquidate everything in sight.
 [ B x f7 + ]  [ K x f7 ] , [ g3 ]  ! Calculated to win the pin picks up the knight for two pawns
 [ K d2 ]  [ N x c1 ] , [ K x c1 ]  making matters worse: [ R x c1 ] would have made a difference...
 [ d4 ] , [ f3 ]  Knight on [ h6 ] it's in danger for a good cause
 [ f x g4 ]  [ f x g4 ]  [ N x g4 + ] , [ K f3 ]  I'm brushing up against the boundary of suicidal logic here. I'm looking for ways to use my king as a totally offensive weapon along with my great looking bishop and the g file I will surely own.
 [ N x e5 ]  [ N e6 ] , [ Q b6 ]  blunder but the center was mine enough...
 [ f5 ] , [ g5 ]  Black makes a mistake here restricting his mobility.
 [ N b6 ] , [ N e7 ]  Well that tears it. It's two-on-one attacking the doomed black pawn on d6. Black can't save it. Or can he? I entered the next two conditional moves and crossed my fingers. No not hope chess because the move was necessary to save the pawn either way but I was hoping for a happy outcome.
 [ B d7 ] , [ f x e5 ]  ?? Also procuring the f file for my Rook! But also a mistake. I had the Knight on [ g4 ] trapped and now I let him out of the cage.
 [ d x c4 ]  [ K b8 ] , [ g5 ]  22.[ a3 ] [ N c6 ] 23. [ N c6 ] Ne2! with the idea Cc1-d3.
 [ R d5 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ Q c3 ]  [ R c f8 ] , [ Q d2 ]  If I can get my pieces lined up then Black is forced into trades
 [ B e6 ] , [ Q b7 + ]  At this point I'm starting to press black's entire piece structure back toward the [ h8 ] corner.
 [ B d7 ] , [ Q d6 ]  Threatening the rook on b8. If I were Black I would do [ Q d8 ] to try and protect myself from checkmate
 [ R e d8 ]  [ B b2 ]  [ K f7 ]  [ K g2 ]  [ h5 ]  [ h3 ]  [ g5 ]  [ g4 ]  [ K g6 ] , [ R f1 ]  ICC: I think black has a faint edge here but don't think it will turn into anything real unless Magnus decides on another "adventure".
 [ N c3 ] , [ B h6 ]  Alex could have gone for the draw; 30...[ Q h2 ] (threatening ..[ Q h1 ] mate) 31.[ N e2 ] [ Q e5 ] 32.[ N c3 ] [ Q h2 ] etc. but he probably felt he had more winning chances since the white King is more exposed to attacks.
 [ d6 ] , [ h3 ]  A sensible precaution to stop [ B g4 ] which would be very good for Black with the knight on d4.
 [ O-O ]  [ g4 ]  [ B x c3 ] , [ b x c3 ]  I prefer to capture with pawns when it brings it closer to the center. Unfortunately however my DSB is the worst of bad bishops.
 [ N c6 ]  [ N d2 ] , [ f6 ]  [ f6 ] leaving a hole in the kingside but trying to prevent a Kingside attack winning.
 [ h6 ]  [ N h3 ]  [ Q x d4 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ Q b4 ]  [ O-O-O ]  [ c6 ]  [ R d4 ]  [ Q a5 ]  [ B d2 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ R x g4 ] , [ N x g4 ]  Exchange two pieces for one rook... It must be..
 [ d x e5 ]  [ N g4 ] , [ e4 ]  The "intelligent" answer. First time I face it.
 [ d4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ h6 ]  [ g4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ c3 ]  [ Q b6 ] , [ Q c2 ]  Or [ Q b3 ] wiser an higher levels.
 [ N d5 ]  [ f6 ] , [ N b4 ]  He wasted tempo with that what was he trying to do?
 [ N c6 + ]  [ b x c6 ]  [ R x c6 ]  [ d4 + ]  [ K d3 ]  [ N d5 ] , [ g3 ]  That's all
 [ K f2 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ N b7 ]  [ g5 ]  [ h x g5 + ] , [ K x g5 ]  My plan here was to force through the h pawn. I did'nt expect it to take so long.
 [ a6 ] , [ a4 ]  Not really helpful.
 [ Q e7 ]  [ N x f7 ]  [ R x f7 ]  [ B x f7 + ]  [ Q x f7 ]  [ Q x f7 + ] , [ K x f7 ]  The exchange is a disaster for White even though the count comes even. Black is developed and controls the center: White is entirely not and all his pieces are block in. My game plan from here is to control the center gain a pawn majority as the position permits and roll to victory.
 [ Q f3 ]  [ R a7 ]  [ B b3 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ R a e1 ]  [ B x e5 ]  [ R x e5 ]  [ R c7 ]  [ Q g3 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ R f e1 ]  [ B d5 ]  [ B x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ Q f3 ]  [ Q d7 ]  [ Q x d5 ] , [ e x d5 ]  Here my opponent trades his queen for a rook and a knight. This is a high risk exchange but I could be in quite a bit of trouble if he plays the extra pieces right. So keeping my cool is imperative here.
 [ N x b6 ] , [ a x b6 ]  now here I can do [ h6 ] ignoring the series of checks 26 [ Q x a2 ] k[ c1 ] 27 [ Q a3 ] (or [ Q a1 ] will lose the queen for the mate threat ) but I choose (wrongly ) this line ...
 [ N g f6 ]  [ N d3 ]  [ R a e8 ]  [ R a d1 ]  [ g5 ]  [ d5 ] , [ e5 ]  I was about to resign around here. Just compare the Black Knight on [ e4 ] with the White Bishop on b2! Blacks Bishop on [ b7 ] can always get into play via [ c8 ] to comparison.
 [ a4 ] , [ f4 ]  !
 [ N b7 ]  [ a3 ]  [ N c8 ] , [ B c5 ]  nothing convincing with [ B c7 ]  [ R d8 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ N c d6 ] , [ B b3 ]  the fear is to finish with opposite bishops that would lead to a draw.
 [ c6 ]  [ f4 ]  [ N c4 ] , [ Q f3 ]  13.Qf3? Sets up a clear opportunity for me...
 [ a4 ]  [ K b4 ] , [ N d5 + ]  Another idea I had is 54... [ c5 + ] 55. [ K x c5 ] (forced!) [ a3 ] 56. [ N [ c2 ] ] [ a2 ] 57. [ K b4 ] [ N d5 + ] 58. [ K b3 ] [ N e3 ] 59. [ N a1 ] [ c2 ] 60. Nx[ c2 ] Nx[ c2 ] 61 Kxa2... which is a draw.
 [ B x b7 ] , [ B d3 ]  so you could have taken the pawn and not paid a penalty now it is a straight exchange and you don't come out ahead.
 [ K b3 ] , [ c4 + ]  21. ...... [ c4 + ] - a king hunt begins in earnest.
 [ d5 ] , [ d4 ]  Now basically a transposition from 1.[ d4 ] [ d5 ] 2.[ N f3 ] which I am perfectly fine with
 [ Q g6 ]  [ B x d8 ] , [ B h3 ]  This move is not really that good...
 [ Q x b6 + ] , [ K c8 ]  Forced
 [ h4 ]  [ a3 ]  [ h5 ] , [ a2 ]  45. .... [ a2 ] - just one move away from Glendadom but Bob now waves the white flag. Commiserations Bob you gave me a terrible scare in the middlegame but somehow Henry escaped and I am just sooooo relieved. Coach Ion and Gameknot analysis will not hesitate to point out just how Henry managed to get away!
 [ R c8 ] , [ a4 ]  offering a trade
 [ K b2 ] , [ B f6 + ]  No I'm not going to trade rooks. I'm going to win a rook.
 [ R e1 + ] , [ B e6 ]  Black interposes with the wrong piece. Had he anticipated the next move he would have played Be7.
 [ N c3 ] , [ c5 ]  I am unfamiliar with this line - the Tartakower I think it is called.
 [ Q e5 ]  [ R e1 ] , [ N c6 ]  Cuts off the Bishop's attack on the King's pawn which had been preventing the massacre that follows. I am unsure what Black's better option was.
 [ d6 ]  [ h3 ]  [ O-O ] , [ N f3 ]  This is where I depart from main line theory by playing c5. Up to this point database is showing thousands of games that went exactly this way. For future reference theory prefers [ e5 ] here.
 [ Q g4 + ]  [ K x h7 ] , [ B x f6 ]  threatening check mate in 1...
 [ R d8 + ]  [ K c1 ]  [ R d c8 ]  [ K b2 ] , [ R f5 ]  Now black can try ...[ R x c3 ] which creates further delay.
 [ b x c6 ]  [ b x c6 ]  [ N a3 ]  [ B x a3 ]  [ B x a3 ]  [ N e7 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N f3 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ N g5 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ h5 ] , [ Q d6 ]  Ugh. What would have been mildly cool is [ d4 ] which focuses the black bishop on g2. Though white could certainly interrupt with [ B e4 ] or f2. At least black would be seizing the initiative.
 [ N x f6 ] , [ R x f6 ]  30...Rxf6--I expected 30...[ B x f6 ] which would have been followed by 31. [ B c7 + ] [ Q x c7 ] 32. [ R x c7 ] [ K x c7 ] 33. [ R x e6 ] giving White a 2-pawn advantage in the endgame. Instead Black took with the Rook and then resigned. I saw the continuation as 31. [ B x f6 ] [ B x f6 ] 32. [ R g8 + ] and then a multitude of problems for Black. As I noted this was my last game in this tourney. With the win I secured 3rd place behind freddy and joanne. This was a wonderful learning experience and my thanks to freddy for inviting me and and to everyone who participated in the tourney. I look forward to seeing all of you across the board!
 [ R x c4 + ]  [ K b7 ] , [ B c5 ]  the bishop in [ b6 ] isn't too dangerous.
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ c4 ]  [ d x c4 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ e3 ]  [ b5 ]  [ a4 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ a x b5 ]  [ B x b5 ]  [ N a3 ]  [ c6 ]  [ B x c4 ]  [ B x c4 ]  [ N x c4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ B d2 ]  [ h6 ]  [ N a5 ]  [ a6 ]  [ R c1 ] , [ N e4 ]  When black takes the bishop white's knight is lost. White could stave off impending doom by advancing the pawn to b4. Better yet just move Na5-c4. Black can't press a pawn against any piece in the c file. Best though is NxPc6. It's a free pawn as N[ x N c6 ] would be followed by RxNc6.
 [ N e4 ] , [ B f4 ]  ummmmmmmmm trying to sacre his queen away...
 [ B e2 ]  [ a5 ]  [ b x a5 ] , [ R x a5 ]  At this point taking with the rook I think is the best idea. The idea being to tuck the [ a8 ] rook in behind once development is complete.
 [ R d x c3 ] , [ Q b4 ]  changing the piece doing the pinning now the e pawn is undefendable and the knight also needs a defender
 [ Q d7 ]  [ Q x b4 ]  [ Q x d5 ] , [ B x c4 ]  and now he takes the gambit pawn back and gains tempo at the same time.
 [ e6 ]  [ R h4 + ]  [ K f3 ]  [ R x a4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ K b3 ]  [ e4 ]  [ R d4 ] , [ e3 ]  The two passed pawns are too powerful and even if White has a bishop this match will end in a draw.
 [ R x e1 + ] , [ Q x e1 ]  another exchange black figures he is getting out of space maybe better to avoid the mate threats on the first rank
 [ Q e4 ]  [ Q g5 + ]  [ K f1 ]  [ Q c1 + ]  [ Q e1 ] , [ Q x e1 + ]  To trade Queens are the easiest way to win.
 [ R b1 ]  [ Q x b1 + ]  [ K h2 ]  [ Q f5 ]  [ g3 ] , [ Q g4 ]  38. ..... [ Q g4 ] - Glenda moves in to confine the WK to the first two ranks.
 [ Q x e5 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ R b8 ] , [ B d3 ]  Better here would have been Bd2! Where I will have trouble holding onto the [ h5 ] knight. However I do certainly get compensation in the form of an attack. After 17.. [ R b4 ] 18. [ g4 ] [ Q b8 ] 19. Qx[ h5 ] [ g6 ] 20. [ Q a5 ] Rxb2. However [ B d3 ] here is passive.
 [ c x b3 ]  [ b5 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ N e7 ]  [ R a c1 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ R x d5 ]  [ B e5 ] , [ R d x c5 ]  19. R[ d x c5 ] - up until here I have been using the World Database but I have been making decisions as to what I thought was best for me. However I overlooked this pawn capture. I kicked myself for making such a basic oversight but I consoled myself with the fact that about 2 or 3 Experts made the same error. [ B x b2 ] is out of the question due to [ R x c2 ] !
 [ g5 ]  [ N d7 ] , [ Q h4 ]  24. [ Q h4 ] - further in!
 [ e5 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ N x e5 ] , [ B x e5 ]  14. ...... [ B x e5 ] - at least my position looks a little less cramped with that plethora of exchanges.
 [ N c3 ]  [ Q x f4 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ N c6 ]  white king is really in a middle of problems
 [ K g1 ]  [ K h3 ]  [ K h1 ] , [ g2 + ]  49. ...... [ [ g2 ] + ] - my pawn forces King Chris into a stalemate position. The pawn on [ g2 ] will be consumed by King Chris but look at all those lurvely juicy white p(r)awns! Henry is in for a feast!
 [ K e8 ]  [ R x b7 ] , [ N a5 ]  Attacking the rook which will move 3 more times in a row
 [ O-O ]  [ N a6 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N d7 ] , [ c4 ]  10. [ B b5 ] N[ a x c5 ] 11. [ N d4 ] [ f6 ] 12. [ f4 ] was better.
 [ N x c5 ]  [ K x g5 ]  [ N x a4 ]  [ B d4 ] , [ K b1 ]  This is where black got the opportunity to win it. I made my move at night and couldn't even sleep because it looked like black had won it. All he needed to do was block my king at this very point with Be3. My king had to get to the h flange in about the same number of moves black needed to queen his pawn. By blocking my king preventing black would have been nearly impossible.
 [ c4 ]  [ B b4 + ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B x c3 + ] , [ b x c3 ]  One of the openings I dislike very greatly is the catalan. There is quite a lot of theory in it as well. The capture of the [ c3 ] knight gives the position the structure of a nimzo indian which is part of my main opening repertoire.
 [ R x a5 ]  [ b x a5 ]  [ K g7 ]  [ K c5 ]  [ K f6 ]  [ K b6 ]  [ g5 ] , [ f x g5 + ]  56. [ f x g5 + ] - there is no saving the pawn on [ a6 ] and Glenda making a re-appearance on a8. Julio sees this and waves the white flag. Solid play from Julio up until he left his [ e6 ] pawn en prise. When you are down on pawn material in an endgame it pays to keep at least a piece on to give you some drawing chances. I hope you have all had a good read and there will soon be another annotation coming up this one will feature tactics in the middlegame which will net heavy material.
 [ N b3 + ]  [ Q x b3 ]  [ R x b3 ]  [ R x a8 + ]  [ N e8 ] , [ B d1 ]  If 32... R-[ N3 ] 33 B-[ R4 ] R-[ K3 ] 34 R-[ Q N1 ] with the irresistible threat of R/1-N8.
 [ K g8 ] , [ R e7 ]  Threatening Pawn.
 [ N f6 ]  [ d3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f d7 ]  [ d4 ] , [ O-O ]  Move 7 He's castled i'm thinking my two pawns in the centre are a slighty vunerable to attacks from both flanks possibly.
 [ f x e4 ] , [ N x e4 ]  !? Deflecting his knight.
 [ K g1 ] , [ d x c3 ]  the pawn-take and now things look fairly solid for Black...
 [ e3 ] , [ B d7 ]  
 [ N f3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ c4 ]  [ d x c4 ]  [ Q a4 + ]  [ N c6 ]  [ Q x c4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ g3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ B g2 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B d6 ]  [ d4 ] , [ O-O ]  The starting position. Both sides have castled but still need to complete their development.
 [ e4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e5 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ d4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ a6 ]  All standard stuff. I could have played [ c5 ] here but then the [ B b5 + ] etc gives me a too known game.
 [ B d6 ] , [ R h4 ]  So he goes after my h2. The idea is that if I don't watch out he'll exchange his [ B b2 ] for my [ N f6 ] which will allow him to get my pawn.
 [ R c7 ] , [ h4 ]  If the bishop takes [ g5 ] it opens the g column for me.
 [ B e4 + ]  [ K g3 ]  [ R f7 f3 + ]  [ K h4 ] , [ R f3 f4 + ]  If he'd have taken my rook the game would've been his. Too attached to his queen.
 [ B d2 ] , [ N g6 ]  my turn to bring a bloody knight to the fight !
 [ B b2 ] , [ B x c4 ]  The collapse has begun!
 [ O-O ] , [ N a6 ]  Which kind of attack is black planning on the queenside?
 [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ] , [ Q e7 + ]  The only way to save the Knight without retreating black's queen is badly placed (it would be better on [ c7 ] or [ b6 ] to support a queenside counter attack) Black will continue to suffer for not capturing on [ d4 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ N e5 ] , [ N b5 ]  An odd attack that is easily refuted by [ a6 ]  [ Q x f7 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ B e7 ]  Preparing to castle
 [ c x d5 ] , [ R a c1 ]  Fully controlling the c-file. Notice that [ c8 ] cannot be used as a defense square due to the threat of a fork.
 [ K f7 ]  [ B g6 + ]  [ K e6 ] , [ Q e2 + ]  Or 32.[ Q f5 + ] [ K x e7 ] 33.Qf7#/Qe5#/[ Q f6 # ]  [ B e4 ] , [ Q x e4 # ]  Note that the king's defenses have been completely destroyed and the effectiveness of the bishops working as a pair.
 [ e x f4 ] , [ e5 ]  I leave that pawn for better position
 [ B d3 ] , [ N f6 ]  Now I bring up my knight...
 [ K c8 ] , [ Q e7 ]  I was trying to force black in a sort of mate postion but he managed to escape.
 [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ a6 ] , [ B x c6 ]  Instead of retreating I decided to exchange right away. And it wasn't just because I could exchange. I like to hold off. But had I retreated with 4.[ B a4 ] then would come something like 4...[ b5 ] 5.[ B b3 ] and after 5...[ N a5 ] I'm forced to exchange. I'd rather exchange now then at that point. That's because unlike the doubled pawns that Tom will wind up with I don't want to allow doubled pawns on my side along the b file. As that would be of an asset. And I didn't want to play 4.[ B d3 ] as that blocks my center pawn. In fact I told my student reachforgoals that it's not a good idea. However there's one move that I failed to consider. So instead of exchanging I think that best would've been 4.[ B e2 ] As I also considered [ B c4 ] and asked myself what would happen is Tom attacks 4...c6. 4.[ B f1 ] also came into consideration but I didn't want to undevelop my LSB which would make it difficult to castle. So had I given it a little more thought 4.[ B e2 ] is what I would've played instead.
 [ B e3 ]  [ B x h4 + ]  [ B f2 ]  [ B x f2 + ] , [ K x f2 ]  12. [ K x f2 ] - after this trade King Ben loses his right to castle. However that king is happier placed than Henry and white is far ahead in development.
 [ B x d1 ] , [ N x e6 ]  Threatening [ N e7 + ]  [ K d2 ]  [ R d8 ]  [ K c1 ] , [ B e6 ]  Trying to trade
 [ K x g7 ]  [ Q h6 + ]  [ K f7 ]  [ Q h7 + ]  [ K e6 ]  [ e x d5 + ] , [ K f5 ]  Hoping for 33.[ R f1 + ] [ K g4 ] 34.[ Q x g6 + ] [ Q g5 + ] and Black escapes.
 [ Q a6 ]  [ R e2 ] , [ R f2 ]  Block and protect. Rook doing a valiant job of bodyguarding the lowly but rather important g pawn.
 [ e x d6 ]  [ c x d6 + ] , [ K d7 ]  29. ..... [ K d7 ] - my passer is blockaded.
 [ Q x a8 ] , [ R h f1 ]  Can you guess my winning in this position?
 [ c5 ]  [ e3 ] , [ N f6 ]  Black gets his "Battle Donkey" in the mix. Battle Donkey is a copyrighted phrase by fredmcgriff so I'll have to pay him a royalty now which is unfair because he has a lot of money and I don't.
 [ Q x h3 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ Q g4 + ]  [ K e3 ] , [ Q x d1 ]  now you have no chance
 [ N e5 ]  [ N x e5 ] , [ R x e5 ]  21. …… [ R x e5 ] - knight trade.
 [ B e3 ]  [ R d8 ] , [ Q d3 ]  Wanting to maintain the battery and not sure what else to play I make this rather pointless move.
 [ h3 ] , [ N f6 ]  Expected..
 [ N c2 ]  [ B e4 ] , [ N x d4 ]  Finally removing the annoying central rook.
 [ d5 ]  [ Q x e5 + ]  [ N e7 ]  [ e x d5 ] , [ Q x d5 ]  beat agression with agression ;)
 [ b5 ]  [ Q b3 ]  [ Q e7 ]  [ B x d6 ] , [ Q x d6 ]  20. ..... [ Q x d6 ] - mission accomplished.
 [ R c g8 ] , [ Q f4 ]  Thank God there was no threat. He just wants my rook to come there.
 [ c2 ]  [ a4 ]  [ c1 = Q ]  [ a6 ] , [ Q c2 + ]  And now I'm ready to win my first rated game.
 [ f x g5 ]  [ B x g3 ]  [ R f1 ]  [ Q x h4 ]  [ R x f5 ] , [ Q h1 # ]  the end
 [ a6 ] , [ d4 ]  Makes a break through the center
 [ K b6 ]  [ R b7 + ]  [ K a5 ]  [ R x a7 + ]  [ K b6 ] , [ R a6 + ]  And now I'm going for mate but it wasn't clear cut how knowing that he could answer with 23...[ K c7 ] Had Tom played that I would've had a difficult figuring out what to do. But with this move it's very easy.
 [ b3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B b2 ]  [ d6 ]  [ e3 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ d4 ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ B e7 ] , [ O-O ]  Standard development so far.
 [ h1 = Q ] , [ N g6 # ]  This is a complicated endgame to study and mastering it is a lot more complicated than mastering the knight-bishop checkmate or the 2 bishops vs. 1 knight checkmate. Even though endings like this are rare just the ideas and concepts will help you in similar endings and using these tactical ideas will allow you to win logically in complicated endgames rather than memorizing billions of possible endgame piece placements and positions that are forced mate in over 100 moves. Extreme calculation and technique is the key to winning endgames and winning them will take time and effort so it's best to study endgames rather than openings since the simplicity of few pieces helps you better understand chess and improve your overall chess.
 [ Q a5 ]  [ B d4 ]  [ f6 ]  [ R x e4 ]  [ R x e4 ]  [ Q x e4 ]  [ R d8 ]  [ B c3 ] , [ Q a7 + ]  I was trying to do anything to break out but his possition was very good and left me no where to break him
 [ B x f6 ]  [ e x f6 ] , [ e5 ]  Black's attempt to offer a queen trade and dampen white's attack. Upon white's decline of the trade offer the black queen is now mobilised. GK's analysis does show that 23... [ R g8 ] would have been superior. However given that this is a lost position for black best is to play with the intention of creating a sharp middle game which occurs upon black's queen becoming active.
 [ N d7 ]  [ h4 ]  [ h6 ]  [ h5 ]  [ B h7 ] , [ f4 ]  This feels risky from White's side of the board but probably feels frightening from Black's side!
 [ O-O ]  [ N b c3 ]  [ R b8 ] , [ Q x a7 ]  and with another one.
 [ B g5 ]  [ N c2 ]  [ O-O ] , [ a4 ]  The idea of this move is by exchanging a pawn to create an isolated pawn for Black on the queen-side.
 [ d x e5 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ Q x d1 + ]  [ R x d1 ] , [ N g4 ]  White has eliminated both e-pawns traded queens and got his rook involved far earlier than normal. Here it's a good thing. Black is going to try to harass White with his knight.
 [ e4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ] , [ Q x d5 ]  never a healthy idea...
 [ N h3 ] , [ N d4 ]  Queen move number 300 out of 6 moves.. nice :P
 [ B c5 ] , [ a3 ]  The "normal" move is to stop the b4-[ b5 ] advance. But I wanted to surprise him. This is the risk of this kind of opening.
 [ N d4 ]  [ N h4 ]  [ g6 ]  [ g5 ]  [ h x g5 ]  [ B x g5 ]  [ O-O-O ] , [ Q d2 ]  This is a blunder! I am allowed to take the knight on h4...
 [ b6 ]  [ b4 ] , [ B x a4 ]  Black can try this because of white's weak first rank (the rook can not leave because of mate).
 [ R x f8 ]  [ Q x f8 + ]  [ K c6 ] , [ a3 ]  ? White's queen falls easy prey here. QxQ+ forces black to do something so white can castle and protect the [ a1 ] rook from the continued black knight threat. This pawn threat against the bishop does nothing to save the white queen. The trade would have given white a big advantage now that he was ahead 3 points.
 [ a6 ]  [ f2 ]  [ a7 ]  [ f1 = Q ] , [ a8 = Q ]  i took a while to try to see if i can force a queen exchange. i couldnt see one. i could only see perpetual checks into a position where i might make a mistake.
 [ a6 ]  [ B x c6 ] , [ d x c6 ]  ...exchange variation
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ c6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ b5 ]  [ B b3 ]  [ c5 ] , [ N x b5 ]  ugly victim of war...
 [ c6 ] , [ B g2 ]  
 [ b x c4 ]  [ R x d3 ]  [ c x d3 ]  [ N g3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N f5 + ]  [ K f8 ]  [ R b4 ]  [ g x f5 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ f4 ]  [ c4 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ h5 ]  [ K e7 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ R b8 ]  [ R x b8 ]  [ N x b8 ]  [ B x h7 ]  [ a5 ]  [ B x d3 ]  [ K f6 ]  [ h6 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ h4 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ h7 ]  [ K g7 ]  [ B e4 ]  [ R c7 ]  [ h5 ]  [ R x c4 ]  [ h6 + ]  [ K h8 ]  [ B d5 ]  [ R c3 ]  [ a4 ]  [ K x h7 ]  [ K d2 ] , [ R x f3 ]  Well fought by white.
 [ N e5 ]  [ N c4 ] , [ Q e2 ]  No good would come of the immediate exchange on c4. Even with this move White is not definitely committed to the exchange.
 [ B c5 ] , [ R d5 ]  Particularly if you are going to return to the same square!
 [ N e5 ] , [ R h1 # ]  Mate! It's easy to miss things in a blitz game.
 [ d5 ] , [ e x d5 ]  Scandinavian gambit accepted
 [ Q g4 ]  [ f5 ]  [ Q h5 ]  [ Q e7 ]  [ K g1 ] , [ g6 ]  Now look I have to move my queen - and I liked that spot.
 [ b x a4 ]  [ Q x a4 ] , [ B d6 ]  Preparing to castle
 [ K d7 ] , [ N x f6 + ]  Grab the black queen with check.
 [ B x d1 ]  [ R x d1 ] , [ Q e8 ]  19... [ Q e8 ] was played with the "threat" of 20... Rd8?? (met by 21. Bxf7+) in mind. However it's a good move weakening White' king. After 20. [ f4 ] Black can play 20... [ Q b8 ] with (e.g.) 21. [ b3 ] [ Q b6 + ] and a reasonable counterattack.
 [ Q x a6 ] , [ R c6 ]  ? On a normal basis I would not mark this. However my attitude is the mistake not the actual move. What is the logic behind this? Well I am still obsessed with trying to gain tempo by chasing pieces. Therefore I decided to chase his queen.
 [ f4 ] , [ B x d4 ]  I can go [ B c7 ] and I have no idea if this could have been better.
 [ f x e4 ] , [ B x e4 ]  The idea was that my opponent would not have resisted to take the bishop and leave my knight in the "pole position" for a [ Q h4 + ] attack. The knight can easily be defended by the f pawn while white has no pawn to kick it. But my opponent didn't fall into it.
 [ e x d4 ] , [ e5 ]  Pressing the attack. This will help you develop your position without sacrificing material. Good strong opening.
 [ Q b4 ] , [ Q d5 ]  I had dreams of playing ...[ R f1 ] mate but White stops this and practically forces trades that will lead to an equal ending.
 [ d5 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ B b4 ]  And now we have an early deviation from the database which continued 4...[ d [ e4 ] ] 5. [ Q [ e4 ] ] [ N f6 ] 6. Qh4. With the text move [ e4 ] loses a defender and [ d5 ] loses an attacker.
 [ B c7 ]  [ N b6 ]  [ B x b6 ] , [ a x b6 ]  Well at least the black pawns feel stronger than the white pawns though it won't do black much good.
 [ K g8 ]  [ Q d8 + ]  [ K f7 ]  [ Q d7 + ]  [ K g8 ]  [ Q e6 + ]  [ K g7 ] , [ Q x d6 ]  Now White has also come to the conclusion that this game will be a draw and decides to give Black the cahnce to give perpetual check. There was no way to break through.
 [ K d2 ]  [ a5 ] , [ R c5 ]  48. [ R c5 ] - overlooked that - white will win a pawn back. However Glenda has eyes on [ f1 ] and g2!
 [ e4 ]  [ d6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B d3 ]  [ N b d7 ]  [ O-O ]  [ e5 ] , [ d5 ]  dont want to exchange of pawns at the center
 [ N f3 ] , [ c5 ]  And already on move three we are out of the databases I checked after the game. maybe this is bad since white can push his e pawn here but I was willing to try the resulting position. The point behind [ c5 ] is to 1. deny white [ d4 ] and 2. to play on the queenside. if white were to play [ e5 ] here I would maybe play Nd5!? and if the knight exchanges then good centre pawns.
 [ N b4 ] , [ N e5 ]  Here i did not want an exchange of knights so i decided to harass the queen a bit more
 [ g6 ] , [ B x g6 + ]  Now I could have played [ Q x g6 ] and it would have worked just as well but I didn't think of it.
 [ K f3 ] , [ Q x h7 ]  Good thinking but too little too late. Black's turn now to control the final sequence of the game. He must however finish it in this sequence or he risks throwing it away given White's slim material advantage. But how?
 [ Q b1 ]  [ N x b3 ] , [ B x b3 ]  White would have been better off taking the rook. It is worth more.
 [ N f6 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ N x e5 ] , [ B b7 ]  Black development complete with 2 priest together targeting the white king
 [ R f6 ]  [ N g4 ]  [ R e6 ]  [ R e1 ] , [ R b6 ]  Not seing the trap initiated with the last move. If 22...[ N f5 ] to stop the threat of [ N d4 ] then 23.[ Q d5 ] [ Q e7 ] 24.[ N x e5 ] crashes through.
 [ e x d5 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ] , [ Q d3 ]  ?! Of course I don't want to liquidate but if I move my B Carl will exchange my R. Well I'd rather liquidate the piece that's worth less. But what I did not consider was mobility which is very important and shows that I still need work on it. Similar to what Ken previously said you don't just base things on point value. Unfortunately that's what I based it on and didn't consider how mobile my Be3. After thinking about it now I've concluded that my [ B e3 ] was worth more in this position. Better was 22.[ B d2 ] or 22.Bc1. Of those 2 candidate moves I think that 22.[ B d2 ] since I could use that to recapture if black were to play ...Rxe1+. But this inaccuracy increases Carl's advantage for the same reason that fiercequeen mentioned in her most recent annotation when she and discussed about mobility.
 [ B x d5 ]  [ Q x d5 ]  [ a5 ]  [ R f e1 ]  [ R a b8 ] , [ e5 ]  looking for some space
 [ Q h3 + ]  [ K d4 ]  [ Q h8 + ] , [ K e3 ]  Staying near my knight there's not many other thing to do.
 [ B e3 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ N d b5 ]  Taking advantage of the weakness on [ b5 ] and in future d6.
 [ R d2 ] , [ R a c1 ]  Trying to hold material desperately..
 [ e4 ]  [ B x e4 ]  [ N f6 + ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ Q x d7 ]  [ R f d8 ] , [ Q g4 ]  white doesn't waste time taking the [ b7 ] pawn
 [ Q e3 + ]  [ R d2 ] , [ Q x f3 ]  ??
 [ B d3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ f4 ]  [ B b4 ]  [ B d2 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ] , [ K h1 ]  I'm not sure this is the most challenging move at White's disposal. Developing with say [ Q e2 ] or Qe1-[ h4 ] is probably more relevant to the struggle for the center. Still White will have to make this move eventually so it is safe at least.
 [ K d3 ]  [ f4 ]  [ h4 ]  [ Q e4 + ]  [ K e2 ]  [ Q x e3 + ]  [ K f1 ] , [ B g2 + ]  I'm not sure this is sound.
 [ a3 ]  [ N d7 f6 ]  [ e4 ]  [ N c7 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ N e6 ]  [ R c4 ] , [ N x f4 ]  doubled pawns!
 [ f5 ]  [ e x f5 ]  [ B x f5 ]  [ B x g7 ]  [ K x g7 ] , [ N e3 ]  Hunting that black bishop.
 [ b x c5 ]  [ b x c5 ]  [ R x c5 + ]  [ d x c5 ]  [ B x c5 ]  [ R x a3 ]  [ B x a3 ]  [ R h8 ]  [ R c1 + ]  [ K b8 ]  [ f5 ]  [ B e8 ]  [ B d6 + ]  [ K a7 ]  [ B g6 ]  [ R g8 ]  [ B x e8 ]  [ R x e8 ]  [ R c8 ]  [ R h8 ] , [ B e7 ]  The position is resignable for black right here. The problem goes back to the central pawn formation he allowed at move 17...Nxd4.
 [ B h4 ] , [ Q c7 ]  Queen on a good diagonal.
 [ f3 ] , [ e x f3 ]  19 [ g x f3 ] [ B e6 ] and well didn't really get to deconstruct the diagonal but have instead lured the king's defenders all forward which can have negative ramifications for White in the late middle or endgame. IF instead 19 [ B x f3 ] then time to think music. 19...[ Q h5 ] threatens the weakest part of a pawn chain; the base. That's my lead line for the bishop recapture but I haven't really thought about it much as I think the pawn recapture is far more likely.
 [ O-O ]  [ B e7 ] , [ N a3 ]  ?! usually when a knight develops via [ [ a3 ] ] or [ h3 ] its intention is to carry on to [ [ [ c4 ] ] ] or [ f4 ] or else it is maneuvering to [ [ c2 ] ] or [ f2 ] usually in order to help facilitate some sort of pawn break. In this case black controls the [ [ [ c4 ] ] ] square so the knight is simply out of play on [ [ a3 ] ] and doesn't do anything with regards to the centre. redeploying to [ [ c2 ] ] doesn't accomplish anything since since a later [ [ b4 ] ] can easily be met with c4. With that in mind this knight move doesn't make any sense perhaps white was hoping I'd play ...[ [ b4 ] ] when the knight could make use of the [ [ [ c4 ] ] ] square but that's hope chess and making moves with the idea being to hope your opponent will voluntarily make a weakness is a bad way to play chess
 [ N f3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ c4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ a6 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ e3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ Q b3 ]  [ c6 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ N b d7 ]  [ O-O ]  [ h6 ]  [ B h4 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ R a c1 ]  [ N h5 ]  [ B x e7 ]  [ R x e7 ]  [ a4 ]  [ R b8 ]  [ N e2 ]  [ Q b6 ]  [ Q c3 ]  [ N f8 ]  [ b4 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ b5 ]  [ a x b5 ]  [ a x b5 ]  [ c x b5 ]  [ Q b4 ]  [ R c7 ]  [ Q x b5 ]  [ Q x b5 ]  [ B x b5 ]  [ R b c8 ]  [ R x c7 ]  [ R x c7 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ f3 ]  [ N f8 d7 ]  [ R b1 ]  [ N e8 ]  [ N x d7 ]  [ B x d7 ]  [ B x d7 ]  [ R x d7 ]  [ K f2 ]  [ N d6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N c4 ]  [ R b5 ]  [ N a3 ]  [ R x d5 ]  [ R x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ b5 ]  [ K e2 ]  [ K f8 ]  [ K d3 ]  [ K e8 ]  [ K c3 ]  [ K d7 ]  [ K b4 ]  [ N c2 + ]  [ K x b5 ] , [ K d6 ]  White to play.
 [ K b1 ]  [ R c a8 ] , [ R d3 ]  Giving White a chance to grab either rook but the king is what I'm after here so best to force mate after [ N x b3 ]  [ N x b3 ]  [ Q e7 ] , [ R a2 a1 # ]  
 [ b x a3 ]  [ d x c3 ] , [ Q c2 ]  ..i've focussed on development rather than worrying about the pawn blacks white square bishop is stuck [ R a8 ] is doing nothing and his only viable option is 0-0....
 [ e4 ] , [ e5 ]  An opening experiment; I usually play the Sicilian. In this game I prepare to defend against the Ruy Lopez.
 [ K d3 ] , [ K d7 ]  He knows he can take the pawn anyway sooner or later.
 [ R x e1 ] , [ f6 ]  At the start i thought it was a good move but then i saw the mistake he had made.
 [ e3 ] , [ c5 ]  Normally Black plays 5...[ b6 ] after [ [ e3 ] ] here with the idea that White has failed to take control of central light squares so Black should try to take advantage of this. Of course my theoretical knowledge is deficient given that I only recently started studying the Nimzo-Indian. 5...[ [ [ [ d5 ] ] ] ] also leads to a common position although the normal move order there is 1.[ d4 ] [ N f6 ] 2.[ c4 ] [ e6 ] 3.[ N c3 ] [ B b4 ] 4.[ Q c2 ] [ [ [ [ d5 ] ] ] ] 5.[ [ e3 ] ] O-O. Since I don't play 4...[ [ [ [ d5 ] ] ] ] of course I wouldn't play 5...[ [ [ [ d5 ] ] ] ] here.
 [ b4 ]  [ Q d8 ] , [ c5 ]  I'm now gaining a lot of space and dangerous past pawns.
 [ R b8 ]  [ e x d6 ]  [ B h6 ]  [ R c2 ]  [ R e8 ] , [ N e4 ]  wants Rc7.
 [ d5 ]  [ c4 ] , [ c5 ]  QGD symmetrical (Austrian) defense I have only played against this opening once looks like it should be a very open fast paced game.
 [ B f5 ]  [ N f4 ]  [ R a d8 ]  [ R e1 ] , [ R x e1 + ]  I shouldn't have taken it it gives up the open file
 [ B x g4 ]  [ f3 ] , [ Q x e3 ]  ! White loses more material by taking the bishop after ...RxR.
 [ b x c6 ]  [ N e5 ] , [ Q c7 ]  It seemed like the most logical move but you also have to consider [ B d6 ] and [ B a6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B d6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ d x c5 ] , [ B x c5 ]  From now on you have to pay attention to the move [ B x h3 ] followed by [ Q g3 ] + by the pin of the f-pawn.
 [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ] , [ e6 ]  Instead we play the first moves of a Nimzo-Indian. White must now choose whether to enter the Nimzo with 3. [ N c3 ] or to avoid it.
 [ R g2 ]  [ N g5 ]  [ R x f2 ] , [ B a6 ]  Or Bh5. I am trying to build a mate net or at least to go pawns grabbing myself since my pawns are more advanced. I am accepting to lose [ e3 ] too.
 [ B a3 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ B b3 + ] , [ K g7 ]  [ K h8 ] was safer as we shall see.
 [ h4 ] , [ a6 ]  I believe my opponent noted the weak [ [ [ e5 ] ] ] and planned to wage a pawn storm like my plan by defending and preparing b5. After 9.[ h4 ] blacks should forget about Nh5. thus [ B g7 ] does not get the chance to make [ [ [ e5 ] ] ] possible. If 9...[ N h5 ] 10.Bh2! [ [ [ e5 ] ] ] 11.g4! followed by dxe QxQ and Bxe wins a pawn.
 [ K e8 ] , [ N d5 ]  Two pieces threated by the pawn on [ c6 ] and no one can be really taken (the Knight due to the pin the Bishop since the Queen is threated by the [ N d5 ] and after 13. ... [ Q x b5 ] there is 14. Nc7+!)
 [ N e5 ] , [ B f4 ]  Menacing to eliminate one of the defensors of [ f7 ]  [ R c8 ] , [ B x e5 ]  To avoid 12. Nxc4. Now black has the choice. If 12. ... [ h x g5 ] 13. [ R d1 ] menacing d6. Probably for this reason black chooses the other option which is worse
 [ B x d6 ]  [ R x d6 ]  [ R x e4 ]  [ K x e4 ]  [ R e8 + ] , [ R e6 ]  Black was probably not expecting this but I had recognized that it was necessary to stop the black rook getting to e3. Black now has an unpleasant choice; an equal pawn ending which will be decided by white's c-pawn or a rook ending where white's strong extra d-pawn will probably prove decisive.
 [ N c3 ] , [ d5 ]  Preparing to exchange. I probably should've declined this though after the first lesson with Ken. The reason I accepted it was due to me getting hooked on what's called the exchange variations. That can take place with the Spanish Opening or the Ruy Lopez and it does involve exchanging this early. The starting the position to that is similar. We also see something like that in the Morra Gambit. Even though it's not any of that being hooked on remembering those variations I decided to apply what I know from those variations since I am still in unfamiliar territory. My idea is to become familiar but I feel that I'm doing things the wrong way as this was the only variation that I looked at. And the thing is that it's important to look at more then one variation as Ken noted in our first game which is exactly what I failed to do here.
 [ N c6 ] , [ Q f3 + ]  the obvious move
 [ N b d7 ]  [ Q e2 ] , [ R b8 ]  The rook behind the b pawn almost always seems to work out well.
 [ K e3 ] , [ d4 + ]  56. ..... [ d4 + ] now the white pawns on [ c5 ] and [ a5 ] are absolute sitting ducks!
 [ f3 ] , [ N b3 ]  Both sides are quite persistent. The a4-pawn is lost but the long-awaited central advance is also ready.
 [ B g2 ] , [ B c5 ]  Centre control allows castleing
 [ N x e5 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ Q x e5 ] , [ Q f3 ]  I dont know what I was thinking I think I was worried about black pushing on my king with his queen and [ g4 ] knite im just guessing here...I dont remember. I just recently started to look at the last 10 moves or so before I make my move because I was making some bad moves for the fast that I was forgetting the flow of the game. I was playing way to many games at once and was not playing well never again shall I play 50 at once its just not fun
 [ O-O ] , [ O-O ]  So does she.
 [ N f6 ]  [ B c4 ] , [ N c6 ]  this leads to a quiet game after 4.[ d3 ] a more exciting game occurs after 3...[ N x e4 ] 4.[ N x e4 ] [ d5 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ d5 ] , [ Q e2 ]  as good a way as any to keep the material balance.
 [ N e7 ]  [ B e6 + ]  [ K h8 ] , [ R f7 ]  Attacking the g pawn.
 [ K b8 ] , [ Q b7 # ]  
 [ d4 + ]  [ f3 ]  [ d x e3 ]  [ R b e1 ]  [ R c3 ]  [ Q d4 ]  [ Q x f3 + ]  [ R g2 ]  [ R c2 ]  [ R e g1 ]  [ R x g2 ]  [ R x g2 ]  [ e2 ]  [ e7 ] , [ e1 = Q + ]  Thank you for watching. Comment and analyse if you want to!
 [ N x e5 ] , [ B d6 ]  !? I was going to say that you missed the fork on [ f7 ] but then I realized you had seen it and seen further. This next tactical exchange is impressive on your part showing potential far beyond your current rating. Still it doesn't get a full '!' because the whole thing would be unnecessary if you'd just defended f7.
 [ K x a6 ]  [ g5 ]  [ K x b5 ] , [ g4 ]  now will be [ h x g4 ] and [ h x g4 ] and I have the before mentioned two pawns against one on the king's wing with an assured march until promotion and a won Q vs 2 or 3 pawns endgame this game show the importance of an overall endgame strategy and proceed to convert any positional advantage in a won endgame...
 [ K f8 ] , [ h4 ]  The race is on. I have an ace up my sleeve but I doubt it has much chance of working.
 [ N g e4 ]  [ h5 ]  [ N c5 ]  [ B g3 ] , [ N d3 + ]  Not the fastest way to win. [ R d8 ] was mate in 9 but now black just promotes the pawn.
 [ g4 ]  [ g6 ]  [ g5 ]  [ B g7 ] , [ h5 ]  White starts an early attack against black king
 [ K e3 ] , [ K d5 ]  A hint of psychology to this move. It looks aggressive and White's reply is pretty forced but White is now looking to hold the draw and gets suckered into a repetition. 35. ... [ K d7 ] is stronger because I can triangulate the king to lose a tempo if necessary. 36. [ B g7 ] [ K e7 ] 37. [ B h6 ] [ K f7 ] 38. [ h4 ] [ K e6 ] 39. [ h5 ] [ K e7 ] 40. [ B g7 ] [ K f7 ] and I can waste a move by playing Ke7.
 [ N f6 ] , [ R e1 ]  Protecting the pawn on e4.
 [ K x d6 ] , [ K f5 ]  Again I think [ K g5 ] would have been better. This time because he cannot play [ K g4 ] but he could play Kh4.
 [ R x b1 ] , [ R x b1 + ]  And I also don't mind being check any more now then I did earlier.
 [ Q x e2 + ] , [ K x e2 ]  Queens swapped black definitely has the better position as white cannot castle and is down on development.
 [ h5 ]  [ R d7 ]  [ N f5 ]  [ N x f5 ]  [ B x f5 ] , [ e7 ]  An unusually good move for me (well I think so). Normally I would have protected with one or t'other of the rooks but I figured if he takes the rook I reunite my pawns and he has a problem.
 [ K a7 ] , [ B b2 ]  14. [ B b2 ] - Bob tucked his king safely out of the way but I move Fou Lenoir to this square anyway because it is a developing move and I have the choice of where to put Henry.
 [ K b8 ] , [ N f3 ]  Attacking the Queen and also defending h2...
 [ B x b2 + ]  [ Q x b2 ]  [ Q x b2 + ]  [ K x b2 ]  [ K c7 ]  [ R d7 + ]  [ K b6 ] , [ e5 ]  If 25... [ R h e8 ] 26. Rd6+.
 [ N f6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ h6 ] , [ d3 ]  Again a bit passive [ d4 ] EARLIER is probably better as it makes [ B g5 ] with a pin possible and threatens to isolate the black d pawn.
 [ R e8 ]  [ R a7 ] , [ Q b6 ]  Black has been able to race around and defend everything so far. But White's forthcoming sacrifice enables him to enter on the K side.
 [ c5 ] , [ B b2 ]  Not 9. [ d x c5 ] [ B x c3 + ] winning the rook. The bishop moves to [ b2 ] rather than [ e3 ] to allow the possibility of future exchange but in retrospect this feels cramped.
 [ B c5 ] , [ e5 ]  22. [ e5 ] - King Myrydin has let himself be stuck in the centre and a pawn thrust exploits it. This will set of a chain of events that will win an important pawn.
 [ Q h4 + ]  [ K e3 ]  [ e x f3 + ]  [ K d3 ]  [ f x e2 ] , [ R x f5 ]  Why not take the queen? P[ x R f1 + ] is then answered by NxQ RxN. Black ends up with two rooks against the white rook instead of a queen and rook and well positioned pawn...
 [ K g1 ] , [ N x c2 ]  I like this move. I take a pawn and pin the rook to the king at the same time.
 [ B f3 ] , [ R h2 ]  Hoping to bait Black into a very favorable exchange with 14...[ N g4 ] 15.[ N x f3 ] [ N x h2 ] 16.Nxh2.
 [ a x b4 ]  [ c x b4 ] , [ R d6 ]  Once again I force Black's Rook into a defensive posture.
 [ N x f5 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N f6 ] , [ N e1 ]  14. [ N e1 ] - here is the innaccuracy:- -0.46 » 14. [ N e1 ] [ Q [ f4 ] ] 15. [ Q f3 ] [ Q x a4 ] 16. [ Q x f5 ] [ R f e8 ] 17. [ N f3 ] [ R e2 ] 18. [ N g5 ] [ R a e8 ] 19. [ K h1 ] [ Q [ c6 ] ] 20. [ R b1 ] [ B d4 ] Best: +0.16 » 14. [ K h1 ] [ c6 ] 15. [ b4 ] [ B c7 ] 16. [ f4 ] [ a5 ] 17. [ B b2 ] ax[ b4 ] 18. [ B e5 ] [ Q e7 ] 19. [ B b3 ] [ R f e8 ] 20. [ R e1 ] [ B b6 ] I guess that [ K f1 ] would have probably have been a good idea at this point at least the [ f2 ] pawn will have no longer been pinned against Henry by that wretched dsb on b6.
 [ Q x c4 ]  [ B b7 ] , [ R a d1 ]  White has completed development because he hasn't wasted any moves. Black's development is defensive and his bishop pair isn't doing him any good because the bishops have limited mobility. All of White's pieces are very mobile
 [ B x d4 ] , [ d6 ]  Finally releasing the LSB fourteen moves into the game. By playing this move rather than ...[ b5 ] Black also signals a change in direction: he will now break on [ e5 ] rather than [ d5 ] giving him some much-needed space.
 [ N x e4 ] , [ B x e4 ]  White now gets his chance to play [ Q d6 ] but sees that it will run out of gas. Meanwhile he loses the exchange.
 [ Q x b4 + ]  [ K e8 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ Q b5 + ]  [ c6 ]  [ Q x b7 ]  [ N c e7 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ c x d5 ] , [ B g5 ]  The black position is falling apart. If 21... [ R c8 ] 22. [ B x e7 ] If 21... [ R f8 ] 22. [ B x e7 ] [ R f7 ] 23. [ R f1 ] [ R b8 ] (23... [ R x e7 ] 24. Qc6+) 24. [ R x f7 ] [ R x b7 ] 25. [ B x d8 ] [ K x f7 ] 26. [ R c1 ] [ R x b2 ] 27. [ R c7 + ] [ K e8 ] 28. [ B e7 ] [ R x g2 ] 29. [ R x a7 ] [ R x h2 ] 30. [ B d6 ] [ R g2 ] 31. [ e6 ]  [ B x e7 ]  [ Q c8 ] , [ Q x c8 + ]  Simplest. A strong alternative is ... 23. [ Q x d5 ] [ K x [ e7 ] ] 24. O-O [ Q [ [ e6 ] ] ] (24... [ R f8 ] 25. Qd6+) (24... [ K e8 ] 25. [ [ e6 ] ] (25. [ R a c1 ] [ Q b8 ] (25... [ Q d8 ] 26. Qf7#) 26. [ [ e6 ] ] [ Q d8 ] 27. Qc6+) 25... [ R b8 ] (25... [ Q c7 ] 26. [ R a c1 ] [ R c8 ] (26... [ Q [ e7 ] ] 27. Qc6+) 27. [ R x c7 ] (27. [ e7 ] [ Q x c1 ] 28. [ Q f7 + ] [ K d7 ] 29. e8=Q+) 27... Rxc7) 26. e7) 25. [ Q b7 + ]  [ R x c8 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ g5 ]  [ O-O ]  [ a6 ]  [ R f6 ]  [ R a8 ]  [ R a f1 ]  [ h5 ] , [ e6 ]  
 [ K f2 ]  [ K b5 ] , [ N c3 + ]  [ N d2 ] would have completely blockaded me. By exchanging rooks I have some chances.
 [ O-O ] , [ a5 ]  my thinking is that i'd like a spot for my knight to develop to but would like to use the [ d7 ] square as an option for the king should i need it from attack
 [ N f6 ] , [ N c x e4 ]  having nothing better than [ B e2 ] [ B e7 ] 0-0 0-0 [ B e3 ] [ h6 ] [ N h3 ] I decided to set the board on fire...
 [ Q g5 ]  [ R e3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ R g3 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ Q x d2 ] , [ B x d2 ]  The queens are exchanged off and I unbelievavly already regarded the game as won. Like a beginner I made the mistake of only counting the material on the whole board not in certain areas of the board.
 [ N x e5 ] , [ d x e5 ]  Black gains a very menacing pawn structure on the king-side which is counter balanced by white's advanced past d-pawn
 [ Q x e6 ] , [ N g5 ]  Now I am encouraged to swap queens strengthening that three pawn advantage.
 [ R d d7 ] , [ N e6 ]  Ok....can I have [ f8 ] then instead? She is determined not to fall for any of these....
 [ a6 ] , [ f3 ]  to attack the N
 [ Q e5 ] , [ B x f6 ]  At this point I was hoping that he played [ Q x f6 ] so I would do [ Q x e4 ] liberating my Bishop and getting a pawn back.
 [ K g7 ]  [ K f2 ]  [ R f h8 ]  [ R e h1 ]  [ R x h1 ]  [ R x h1 ] , [ Q x a2 ]  Seizing the defenseless pawn. The trick now however is to make sure that my queen can stay relevant. Notice that my pieces are somewhat askew to the right.
 [ R c1 ]  [ K e7 ]  [ R a1 ] , [ R e h8 ]  as planed
 [ N e5 ] , [ R x d4 ]  and moreover a mechanical mistake that loses the queen
 [ R x d7 ]  [ N x d7 + ]  [ K c8 ]  [ N c5 ]  [ N c7 ] , [ K f4 ]  54. [ K f4 ] - the WK comes in with devastating effect. After one spite check I decided to wave the white flag after 55. [ K f5 ] - there is no way I will be able to prevent the WK from gobbling up my kingside pawns - the white kingside pawns will be unstoppable. Oh well I will just have to keep on trying to end that losing run. Hope you've had a good read. Bye for now - Joanne.
 [ Q x f6 ] , [ Q x f6 ]  1
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ d3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ h6 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ Q x f6 ]  [ N d5 ] , [ Q d8 ]  The starting position.
 [ N f6 ]  [ d x e5 ] , [ N x e4 ]  Now we have a pawn less
 [ e5 ] , [ N c3 ]  Going back seeing that black blocked himself from the previous threat. However black can simply play [ [ e4 ] ] (which he does) and you have wasted valuable time shuffling the knight. What was called for was [ f3 ] to stop or contend with the [ [ e4 ] ] push.
 [ Q b6 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ N g e7 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ a6 ] , [ c4 ]  Opening up the position for my bishops
 [ R e g1 ] , [ Q f6 + ]  Forced in order to protect the [ g7 ] pawn
 [ Q f3 ]  [ R g1 ] , [ R d8 ]  21. [ R d8 ] - now Old Matey is threatening to descend on d1!
 [ B h6 ]  [ R e4 ]  [ R d2 + ] , [ K b3 ]  I have a plan forming in my head. If I can put a pawn on [ b5 ] a neat little checkmate should emerge but first I decide to reinforce the knight.
 [ a5 ] , [ R e8 ]  Positioning the rook on the same file as the white queen creating tactical opportunities
 [ d3 ] , [ a6 ]  This move by black prevents [ N b5 ] eyeing [ d6 ] and threatening the rook/king fork. In this position it's easily defended so that was not even in my thoughts. Black is going to castle kingside now so I need to castle and launch an attack before he does.
 [ d x e5 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ N x e5 ] , [ N f6 ]  Gives his bishop pair
 [ c4 ]  [ d5 ] , [ e3 ]  We've arrived at a Slav defense if a little nonstandard. White should have very little trouble developing whereas Black will be looking for an eventual break through the center to mobilize his forces.
 [ Q d3 ] , [ Q c4 ]  Saving my queen
 [ Q x c6 + ] , [ N e6 ]  ! NO more CHECKS and the N is saved. And [ Q x g3 # ] is threatened...
 [ R d1 ] , [ Q g7 ]  Leaving my d-pawn underprotected but obviously not en prise unless White wants to part with his queen :-)
 [ h6 ] , [ g5 ]  With the long range cover of the dark square bishop the g pawn threatens the black knight whilst also threatening to tear the king's shield of pawns away ... however White has missed something - something that Black did not miss.
 [ N c6 ] , [ d5 ]  Now white closes the centre whilst hitting the knight. And now that the centre has been closed up play will now take place on the wings. White will attack on the queen side whereas black will attack on the kingside which is where he has the most space
 [ g5 ]  [ Q e6 + ]  [ K g7 ]  [ R f7 + ]  [ K h8 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ Q g8 ]  [ R x h7 + ]  [ Q x h7 ]  [ B x h7 ]  [ K x h7 ] , [ Q x e7 + ]  
 [ e5 ] , [ N f3 ]  This is also the most popular and after looking at other option decided to go with it.
 [ e x d5 ] , [ N f6 ]  And no not [ Q x d5 ] way to passive for my liking this most of the time gives a much nicer game to play.
 [ e5 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ d3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ B g5 ] , [ B g7 ]  Black continues its usual and proven development
 [ B b7 ]  [ R b d1 ]  [ B d5 ] , [ b3 ]  Protecting the a pawn and setting up a c-pawn push.
 [ R x c6 ]  [ e x f6 ]  [ N f4 ] , [ R h6 ]  ? Better was [ R g3 ] giving away the h pawn for Rh2+.
 [ R h1 ] , [ Q g5 ]  Pin the pawn again while I decide what to do
 [ N x e4 ]  [ f x e4 ] , [ B d2 ]  And this gives me the chance to play...
 [ c4 ] , [ R f7 + ]  To force the black king to go to [ g8 ]  [ B f6 ] , [ a6 ]  Now advance the a pawn
 [ h6 ]  [ K g8 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ g6 ]  [ R h1 + ]  [ K g5 ] , [ c4 ]  just clutching at straws...
 [ e4 ] , [ e5 ]  super excited to be playing against erika
 [ d5 ]  [ g3 ]  [ c5 ]  [ B g2 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ d3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ e5 ]  [ N b d2 ]  [ B e7 ] , [ e4 ]  (brulla) Now the typical King's Indian Attack-development is finished and the middle game is about to start.
 [ K e7 ]  [ R d7 + ]  [ K f6 ]  [ R c6 + ]  [ K g5 ]  [ B x e5 ] , [ R e8 ]  [ f4 ] is not possible...
 [ R x d4 ]  [ R b7 ] , [ B g7 + ]  ! Bang! White finds a second nice sacrifice which wins the game.
 [ B b2 ]  [ B x g2 ]  [ K x g2 ] , [ N c6 ]  Also strong is ..[ Q b7 ] taking control of the long diagonal. White ought to contest this via Qf3! exchanging into a drawish endgame. The text presses for an advantage allowing White the sequence 15.[ Q f3 ] [ N x [ e5 ] ] 16.[ d x [ e5 ] ] when White's light-square control faces off against Black's queenside majority and obvious target on the doubled [ e5 ] pawn. Highly imbalanced.
 [ N c3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B g5 ] , [ N c6 ]  Some more standard development. Both sides are developing their pieces. Both have developed the pieces although white might be slightly better co-ordinated.
 [ h4 ]  [ K g7 ]  [ h5 ]  [ K f7 ]  [ h6 ]  [ a4 ] , [ a3 ]  Zugzwang... but [ h7 ] will win quickly.
 [ g3 ] , [ B h6 ]  Even less squares now for the Black DSB. But [ B h6 ] still looks out on a few sqaures and it is almost back to [ g7 ] which would be good if the King was nearby.
 [ B e3 ]  [ N g e7 ] , [ N f3 ]  Both sides develop their pieces according to the tactical demands.
 [ O-O-O ]  [ b6 ] , [ h4 ]  ! I believe this is becoming standard much in the way you would play the Yugoslav attack against the dragon.
 [ Q c8 ] , [ N d4 ]  Threatening [ N f3 ]  [ K g6 ]  [ Q e8 + ] , [ K g5 ]  55 ... [ K f6 ] 56 [ R x h6 ]  [ Q f8 ] , [ R g6 ]  Thinking long and hard about the safety of my king after every move at this point luckily his pawns cannot afford to move and so I'm relatively safe.
 [ e4 ]  [ c6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ d x e4 ]  The Classical Variation. My favorite as Black and as White!
 [ N d5 ] , [ B g4 ]  Beginners mistake. Not seeing the check by capturing the defender of the attacker and winning a piece with tempo
 [ N g7 ] , [ K f1 ]  H: The king becomes bystander and feels no heat from black's forces.
 [ c6 ]  [ N b d2 ] , [ N d6 ]  avoids the exchange of knights
 [ R a c8 ] , [ e5 ]  White falls apart Alternative variation: 19. [ K h1 ]  [ B x e4 + ]  [ Q g2 ] , [ R h3 ]  Alternative variation: 25... [ R h3 ] 26. [ B d4 ] [ R x h2 + ] 27. [ K g1 ] [ R x g2 + ] 28. [ K h1 ] [ R h2 + ] 29.[ K g1 ] [ R h1 # ] Alternative variation: 25... [ B x g2 + ] [is easily refuted] 26. [ K x g2 ] [ R c2 + ] 27. [ K g3 ] 0-1
 [ R a8 ]  [ b4 ]  [ K h3 ] , [ R b2 ]  still saw no hopes for those pawns he must see something maybe he wants to distract me.
 [ Q b6 ]  [ Q f3 ]  [ O-O-O ] , [ Q f5 + ]  wrong leaving [ N c3 ] without defense not exploits Ng5-[ f7 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N x e6 ]  [ N e7 ] , [ Q f7 ]  the only way to save Ne6.
 [ B d3 ] , [ f x e4 ]  !? Trying to open up the position and make his pieces more active. Also this is pretty much the only way of convincingly demonstrating the wrongness of White's [ f4 ] push.
 [ d5 ]  [ N b4 ] , [ a3 ]  Go ahead. Chat Lake-bay that move was horrendous.
 [ N e7 ]  [ N g f3 ]  [ N g6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N h5 ] , [ N g5 ]  The turn of the game.______12.[ N e1 ] looks ok but restrict the attack and take the square for a Qe1-h4. i don't look more because [ N g5 ] looks very interesting______12.[ N g5 ] f6_13.[ Q x h5 ] fxg5_14.[ N x g6 ] hxg6_15.[ B x g6 ] Re8_ 16.Qh7_and i suppose [ g7 ] will be taken by the white queen (but i can't visualize well in my mind) ______or______13...h6_14.[ B x g6 ] and it looks like the line above______ If take with the knight :______12...f6_13.[ N x g6 ] hxg6_14.[ B x g6 ] But it can't visualize more______ 12...[ N f6 ] and it is hard to see a line after this move. An idea can be 13.Rf3-[ h3 ] and then throw the knight or the rook on [ h7 ] to remove Nf6. [ Q h5 ] will be then possible.
 [ g5 ] , [ d5 ]  one of us finally takes the offensive. pins are all well and good but iwas high time we started clearing part of the board.
 [ B x d6 ] , [ R d8 ]  ? Not the best thanks to my next move.
 [ O-O ] , [ Q b3 ]  In the Queen gambit declined whites most pressing problem is where to develop the queen. Expereince bears witness to the fact that black easily equalizes after [ Q b3 ] [ Q c2 ] and Qe2.
 [ N x d4 ]  [ c3 ]  [ N x f3 + ] , [ g x f3 ]  12. [ g x f3 ] - knight trade.
 [ N f6 ] , [ g3 ]  3. [ g3 ] - white has played the Vienna Opening with 2. [ N c3 ] and now plays an unusual g3. This is another way to support the [ e4 ] pawn.
 [ K e3 ] , [ N b3 ]  [ N b3 ] was designed to waste his time moving his ineffective rook to safety while freeing the [ c5 ] square for my bishop to finally play a useful role in the game. Frankly at this point I'm not certain I was willing to take his rook with my very powerful knight should he chose 20. [ R f1 ] to make better use of his other rook instead.
 [ Q d5 ] , [ R b d1 ]  I remove one of my Rooks from attack.
 [ B x f6 ]  [ B d5 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ B e6 ] , [ B x e6 ]  and now is black that will have his pawn structure disturbed - Although necessarily not a bad thing as we will see in the end of the game as he does has a central majority that he will be able to exploit latter on
 [ N h2 ] , [ Q h3 ]  I'm attacking the unprotected Knight so something has to be done.
 [ B e2 ]  [ O-O ] , [ N c3 ]  Probably better is [ c4 ] but this is sound.
 [ N c6 ]  [ B c3 ]  [ N d x e5 ]  [ Q x d5 + ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ R d1 ] , [ f6 ]  With the queens off losing the right to castle is less important
 [ d x e4 ]  [ Q g4 ] , [ N f6 ]  all known theory and quite relieving for me as most of my games encounter 4.[ e5 ] and the knight always seams awkward to me on [ e7 ] after whites kingside thrust.
 [ K e3 ]  [ Q g5 + ]  [ K d3 ]  [ Q f4 ] , [ R g1 ]  Nope Nf1.
 [ c5 ] , [ e3 ]  This is a mistake actually since should black move [ Q b6 ] white has problems defending b2.
 [ O-O ] , [ d6 ]  developing the last minor piece. black seems ok.
 [ R e1 ]  [ B h3 ]  [ Q c1 ]  [ Q g4 ] , [ Q d1 ]  17. [ Q d1 ] (not much I can do to prevent the following exchange of bishops)
 [ N b c3 ] , [ d6 ]  Good freeing the Q-side. 10...[ d5 ] also looks playable.
 [ R x d6 ]  [ e x f4 ]  [ B x f4 ] , [ N f5 ]  Nf5? .....
 [ K g4 ] , [ Q h3 # ]  Ho! Ho! Ho! Merry Christmas!
 [ N f6 ] , [ d3 ]  Fighting for control of e4.
 [ B x e5 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ b3 ] , [ b4 ]  Now White has a protected passed d-pawn and Black's c-pawn is backwards on a half-open file...
 [ R f6 ]  [ g5 ]  [ h x g5 ]  [ f x g5 ] , [ R g6 ]  This was blacks mistake where he let my queen get closer in for the kill.
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ B c4 ]  Standard opening play so far.
 [ h6 ] , [ B e3 ]  For a while 14. [ B h4 ] was played but I don't think very much of that move.
 [ B h5 ]  [ N x h5 ] , [ Q x h5 ]  so after exchange we can appreciate a advantageous white position. Blacks has his queen side useless with a lsb blocked and a queen far from battlefield. And i'm still threatening f7.
 [ B f5 ] , [ N x f5 ]  12. [ N x f5 ] - I traded my knight for the other bishop. Note that [ Q e7 + ] or [ Q e6 + ] are now bad - reason the knight can go back to [ e3 ] and block and black will have lost a piece. So Jeff recaptures with the knight and I decided to tuck Henry away on the kingside.
 [ K h8 ]  [ R x f1 ] , [ N e5 ]  ? 19...[ Q x b2 ] 20.[ B c1 ] [ Q f6 ] 21.[ Q x d7 ] [ Q x h4 ] 22.[ Q x b7 ] [ R f8 ] is ok for black with a more or less equal position.
 [ N d7 ] , [ N g3 ]  This is where he is able to repose his N. Not sure I ask myself what to do.
 [ R f8 + ] , [ K g7 ]  Or 32...[ R x f8 ] 33.[ Q x f8 # ]  [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B b4 ]  [ B d2 ]  [ O-O ]  [ e3 ] , [ b6 ]  I've always liked the Nimzo-Indian as a versatile black response to the Queen's pawn opening with a reasonable amount of counter play.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ N c6 ]  first few moves standard opening
 [ R b b8 ]  [ K f2 ] , [ R b6 ]  Black has no plan and real good moves.
 [ c4 ] , [ d6 ]  Constrained. White is able to move his pieces around quite easily but I am now unable to develop my bishops and knights where I want them. Would there have been a better move than [ d6 ] to allow that?
 [ K f7 ] , [ N e5 + ]  So I move my knight back so he either has to take my knight and I gain a material points advantage or a moving his king back which will effectively give me a free move.
 [ Q x d4 ] , [ Q b3 ]  Better would be 15. [ Q x d4 ] [ N x d4 ] 16. [ R d1 ] [ N c2 ] 17. [ R b1 ] [ R f d8 ] 18. [ R x d8 ] [ R x d8 ] 19. [ B d4 ] where white is down a pawn but can probably play for a draw in the endgame.
 [ g5 ]  [ R f d1 ] , [ Q x b2 ]  Getting some pawn back for his piece but this open files on the queenside which is where his king resides.
 [ N x c4 ] , [ R x c4 ]  Another fork. Moving the knight loses the pawn at c2.
 [ B f5 ] , [ B d3 ]  At last a logical move by White. It blocks the advancement of the pawn and exchanges off the recently developed bishop. Too bad I could not exchange off Black's dark squared bishop.
 [ N f3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ d6 ] , [ g3 ]  Instead of building a pawn center with [ e4 ] I went with developing [ B g2 ] to control whites squares on h1-[ a8 ] diagonal
 [ B d7 ] , [ O-O ]  The opening has been a success for White. He has good central control and prospects of a gradual queenside advance. There is no direct plan for Black so it starts to drift for a few moves with disastrous consequences. The bishop is already a little clumsy on d7; I suspect a strong human player would have started to devise a plan to liberate the game back on move 10.
 [ Q c6 ]  [ B x c5 ]  [ Q x c5 ] , [ N d6 + ]  perhaps he doesnt only get the advantage of [ N b5 ] but also manages to infiltrate into the base
 [ e4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e5 ]  [ c5 ]  [ c3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ Q b6 ] , [ a4 ]  The line that I know for white is to play 6. [ a3 ] 7. [ b4 ] with [ B b2 ] to follow. Since white didn't play this line this determines Black's next move.
 [ f x g6 ] , [ B x g6 + ]  his check forces him to move. I knew he wouldn't cover with the queen and I knew he couldn't come closer with his king (the only way would be on the diagonal)
 [ a1 = Q ]  [ b8 = Q + ]  [ K f7 ] , [ g8 = Q + ]  The power of queening with check: White has the extra tempo needed to create another queen...also with check!
 [ B x b8 ]  [ R x b8 ] , [ Q f4 ]  Forking the Rook and Bishop meaning Black has to move his Queen back.
 [ c x d4 ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ B x d4 ]  [ R c1 ]  [ B f2 + ]  [ K e2 ] , [ B x g1 ]  Winning a piece and saving attack with possible [ B g4 ]  [ Q d3 ]  [ B g4 + ]  [ K d2 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ c5 ]  [ B x c5 ]  [ h3 ]  [ R d8 ]  [ h x g4 ]  [ R x d3 + ]  [ B x d3 ]  [ f6 ]  [ B h4 ] , [ B e3 + ]  
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ a6 ]  [ B a4 ] , [ d6 ]  4. ........... [ d6 ] - after a standard Ruy Lopez I decide to reinforce my [ e5 ] pawn. A drawback of this move is that white can still play [ B x c6 ] inflicting a queenside pawn bust-up - although on the upside I will have the bishop pair.
 [ N f6 ] , [ B c4 ]  !? I attack Black's weak [ f7 ] pawn while leaving my queen open for an attack. Black has two main moves here: Either block the bishop with 5...[ [ e6 ] ] where the advanced e pawn eventually falls (5...[ [ e6 ] ] 6.Nc3) OR threaten the white queen with 5...Bg4. Both are good.
 [ a4 ]  [ R a7 ]  [ R x c3 ]  [ R x a4 ] , [ R c4 ]  I was hoping to be able to win another pawn here but I'd overlooked the reply. However I will still be left with a strong possibly won position...
 [ B x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ] , [ N x f7 ]  A nice sacrifice which Black has to accept risking the loss of his rook otherwise. This exposes Black's king.
 [ b x c6 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ R h d1 ] , [ R a7 ]  I probably could've won the piece back if his pawn was still on the 7th rank.
 [ Q e8 ] , [ N d5 ]  'the knight is the knight!'
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ B c4 ]  introducing the Italian Party with an early attack on f7... usually follows [ B c5 ] [ c3 ] (preparing d4) Nf6; after [ N g5 ] 0-0 so White usually continues with d4...
 [ B x c3 ]  [ b x c3 ]  [ Q x c3 ]  [ B x f5 ] , [ N e7 ]  Prevents 15. Qd8. But what was about to come ..... .
 [ R x f7 ]  [ B x f7 + ]  [ K x f7 ]  [ d3 ]  [ K g8 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B e7 ] , [ B b2 ]  decided i should control the biggest diagonal
 [ K d1 ] , [ B b3 + ]  And extended family....
 [ B d2 ] , [ N b d7 ]  So I ask myself what next and try to work on a different variation by completing my development. Of course I had also considered 14...[ N [ c6 ] ] with the idea of 15...[ N d4 ] which forks. Well I would've played but it was then about what comes between those lines that could make it fail. And I realized that after 14...[ N [ c6 ] ] Jack would more then likely answer with 15.[ N b1 ] which attacks my Q first. He could still do it now but the N looks more passive and less dangerous. When that happens Jack usually holds off on the attack which is the case here. Whereas he wouldn't have if I had developed this to [ c6 ] instead.
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ B c5 ] , [ a3 ]  pointless unless you want to go [ b4 ]  [ d6 ] , [ h5 ]  a very weak pawn at this pont
 [ R x d4 ]  [ Q x d4 ] , [ h6 ]  Thinks the threats are over...
 [ K e7 ] , [ Q g7 + ]  Step. The end of the dance white now wins the black queen.
 [ R f d1 ] , [ B d8 ]  Thinking about to move my queen leaving [ a5 ] under protection of my bishop. If [ R b8 ] happen I can move my king to [ e7 ] without any problem.
 [ K h7 ] , [ Q x b7 ]  Now I have lost my [ b7 ] pawn I no longer have a good opportunity to attack whites central pawn.
 [ d6 ]  [ K e6 ]  [ d7 ] , [ K x d7 ]  I kept on pushing looking for a stalemate
 [ f x e4 ] , [ d4 ]  Had to bottle out of the swap -- this is now very awkward as [ N x d4 ] is only held back by the fact the knight would then be pinned due to the positioning of the Queen
 [ K g8 ] , [ K g6 ]  The next step in mating is to limit the king to two squares sealed off by my bishop and then complete a mating maneuver with the knight.
 [ K c4 ]  [ a4 ]  [ K b4 ]  [ a5 ]  [ K a3 ]  [ a6 ]  [ K x a2 ]  [ a7 ]  [ K a3 ] , [ a8 = Q + ]  ...and despite losing my QRP I get my queen.
 [ B c5 ]  [ d4 ]  [ B b6 ] , [ N f3 ]  Black's attempts for an early checkmate thwarted now white begins the counterattack.
 [ e6 ] , [ a3 ]  Seems a little early for this. White seems think a [ B b4 + ] from Black is irritating enough to prevent.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ N f6 ]  Ben is a big fan of the Stafford Gambit. Admittedly I still don't know how to play against it as white. I usually place 3. [ d3 ] here but in this game I instead accepted the gambit.
 [ Q h2 + ]  [ K f1 ] , [ R g8 ]  Trying for [ Q g1 # ] or Rg1#. There is only 1 normal way out of this
 [ e x f6 ]  [ g x f6 ] , [ B f4 ]  In this position he is attacking and threatening to capture my rook with Bxb8. If this happens my rook will be exchanged for his knight.
 [ N a2 ]  [ a5 ]  [ c5 ]  [ Q e8 ]  [ b6 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ B x b5 ]  [ Q x b5 ]  [ B d2 ] , [ Q c4 ]  I think it was too early to advance your queen at this point. I think [ e5 ] would have worked better to break the pawn chain and get your other bishop and knight into the mix.
 [ R c8 ] , [ O-O ]  wondering could black have played [ [ c4 ] ] now but pawn on [ [ c4 ] ] may have need more support maybe by [ B a6 ] .. looks messy but black needs something active as quickly as possible. The only other option I could see was [ e6 ] which would normally free the black position but the white knight on [ g5 ] is accidentally stopping this
 [ d5 ] , [ d4 ]  After [ d4 ] the game would be more open. Early captures and counter movements would drive the action during the match.
 [ B d2 ]  [ O-O ] , [ N b5 ]  (?!) White decides to gain the bishop pair but at the cost of time.
 [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ a6 ]  [ a4 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N f6 ]  [ d3 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ N e2 ]  [ O-O ]  [ c3 ]  [ e5 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ h3 ]  [ h6 ]  [ N g3 ]  [ N a5 ]  [ B a2 ]  [ c4 ]  [ d4 ] , [ b5 ]  The [ a6 ] [ b5 ] [ c4 ] pawn-chain proves to be durable enough to determine outcome of the game.
 [ b3 ] , [ B d6 ]  Both Tal's bishops point ominously at Spassky's King-side.
 [ N d4 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ N d2 f3 ] , [ c5 ]  Gaining space with the "weak" doubled pawn. Maybe it will prove to be quite strong after all?
 [ B h4 ]  [ R b2 ]  [ Q e1 ]  [ R x a2 ]  [ R a1 ]  [ R a c2 ]  [ R d1 ]  [ Q b2 ]  [ R b1 ]  [ Q a2 ] , [ R g1 ]  This gives black the possibility of a smothered mate on [ f2 ] if he can deflect the queen and the bishop
 [ N e5 ] , [ Q d5 ]  Time to go to attack. Two pawns at the same time.
 [ Q x c5 ]  [ a6 ]  [ Q x c7 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ B e4 ]  [ c x b2 ]  [ B x b2 ]  [ h5 ] , [ Q a7 ]  Black will need to play [ K d8 ] to protect the remaining rook from the queen. [ N c8 ] might also work. Either way black will probably play BxPg7. But the pawn will prove cheaper than the rook.
 [ b3 ]  [ c x b3 ] , [ a x b3 ]  17. [ a x b3 ] - pawn trade - I then decided to tuck Henry away on the kingside.
 [ Q g6 ] , [ N c3 ]  Alright he brings his knight out. He could do [ B e4 ] now threatening my queen.
 [ K d2 ] , [ B h6 + ]  Now [ K c2 ] gives him a nasty knight check on d3. I don't want to move back onto the d1-[ h5 ] diagonal. [ K d3 ] looks suicidal after [ R d8 ] so that leaves one square.
 [ c5 ]  [ d x c5 ]  [ b x c5 ]  [ B b2 ] , [ B b7 ]  it is clear that this opening is all about prolonged symmetry: who is the first to break it up?
 [ c4 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ Q a5 + ] , [ Q d2 ]  This was a surprise. I expected a knight retreat this right away told me this would not be my typical game.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ N a4 ]  [ B b6 ]  [ N x b6 ] , [ a x b6 ]  The beginning of problems--poor compensation for a king bishop.
 [ K f6 ] , [ N f5 ]  Now my knight can move on as it is no longer needed to protect my king back there.
 [ N b8 ] , [ e4 ]  In just two moves white has gained massive advantage after just one single mistake by black.
 [ O-O ]  [ Q d2 ] , [ N c6 ]  "The -advantage of this old continuation over the more modern 9.[ B [ c4 ] ] lies in the fact that the counter-play associated with Bc8-d7.......Rf8-[ c8 ] and Nc6-e5-[ c4 ] is now ineffective; the bishop can take the knight from [ f1 ] not from [ b3 ] saving white 2 tempi"-Gufeld and Stetsko. I chose 9.0-0-0 as it generally leads to more simplified positions than 9.[ B c4 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ N x c6 ]  [ b x c6 ] , [ B d4 ]  12.[ N x d5 ] accepting the pawn sac gives black too much counterplay for my liking.The move played blunts the power of the Dragon DSB and contests the dark squares.
 [ B x f1 ] , [ B x f1 ]  So she looses a Rook and pawn for a bishop.
 [ K c2 ] , [ N f4 ]  The plan is to swing rook to g5.
 [ Q c4 ] , [ R d5 ]  Maybe if it was live game I would think about exchanging and go to hte ending with advantage (line d doubled pawns weak white rocks). But it is not interesting.
 [ R x a6 ] , [ h5 ]  Can you spot the mate in 9?
 [ N e c6 ]  [ e x d6 ]  [ B x d6 ] , [ N c3 ]  k[ c3 ] applying pressure to [ d5 ]  [ N x e6 ] , [ B x b4 ]  [ B b4 ] this move is to open up his queen to attack by my rooks
 [ K e8 ]  [ Q g6 + ] , [ K e7 ]  Only possible move
 [ O-O-O ] , [ N d4 ]  hoping he'll trade
 [ R x f1 ]  [ B d4 + ]  [ K h2 ]  [ R x f1 ]  [ Q x d6 ] , [ d1 = Q ]  now it's pretty much all over for white
 [ B g5 ] , [ B e7 ]  This isn't what I would normally do I tend to prefer [ B c4 ] but I decided to give this a go
 [ K g2 ]  [ h5 ]  [ N d2 ]  [ N e7 ] , [ N f3 ]  ? a complete waste of a move perhaps [ h4 ] for the next dozen moves white habitually wastes tempos for no reason
 [ d x c6 ]  [ b x c6 ]  [ B c4 + ]  [ N f7 ]  [ B x f4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ Q x d6 ]  [ e x f4 ]  [ R a d1 ]  [ Q g5 ]  [ B x f7 + ]  [ R x f7 ]  [ Q x c6 ]  [ f3 ]  [ g3 ]  [ N b6 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ Q d6 ]  [ N c4 ]  [ Q b4 ]  [ R c8 ]  [ b3 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ N e3 ]  [ Q h6 ]  [ R d5 ]  [ N g4 ]  [ N x g4 ]  [ B x g4 ]  [ h4 ]  [ R x c2 ]  [ R f d1 ]  [ R c8 ]  [ e5 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ R d5 d8 + ]  [ R x d8 ]  [ R x d8 + ]  [ K g7 ]  [ Q c3 ]  [ Q h5 ] , [ K f1 ]  The Author offers an exercise here. Black to play and win!
 [ Q f5 ] , [ g4 ]  Trying to keep the pressure up I moved without thinking. This is a blunder on my part.
 [ N c3 ]  [ Q c8 ] , [ K h2 ]  my challenger is not going to let me doit ! i have to find a another plan again ....
 [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ B b5 ]  The Ruy Lopez. I was tempted to play 3. [ B c4 ] here but I did not want the possibility of my opponent playing the Two Knights Defense with 3... [ N f6 ] so I decided to play the "Spanish Torture" an opening I have played from the Black side many times.
 [ N x e6 ] , [ Q c8 ]  I could win the bishop but I wanted to go on with the attack instead... and I almost lost!
 [ g x f6 ]  [ g x f6 ] , [ K h8 ]  Necessary. 21 ...Nxf6? 22 [ Q g5 + ] [ K h8 ] 23 [ Q x f6 + ] [ K g8 ] 24 Rg1#.
 [ N x d5 ]  [ Q x d5 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ Q c6 ]  A good sanctuary for the Queen. It was later to prove a handy jumping off place for a counter-offensive to meet White's K-side attack. At this point there is little to choose between the sides. Black has the bishop pair and White has doubled pawns. Yet White's game is solid and has no real weaknesses except maybe at [ c2 ] and that is well masked. But having seen that Black's K-side is lacking defenders White judges the time propitious to begin K-side operations.
 [ N b a2 ] , [ N d c4 ]  finally i have a knight at c4!! i am surprised white didn't try to stop me he probably wasn't on the same wavelength!!
 [ e4 ] , [ c5 ]  My favorite Black opening the Sicilian.
 [ a5 ]  [ R c d8 ]  [ B c1 ] , [ R d1 + ]  Oof!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
 [ B g5 ]  [ e6 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ a6 ] , [ O-O-O ]  8. 0-0-0 - I think this is where it all transposes into the Richter-Rauzer. Maybe [ b5 ] is a good move here but the most popular move in the db suggests [ B d7 ] played by many an Expert and Master so [ B d7 ] it is.
 [ B b2 ]  [ R e7 ] , [ K f8 ]  A blunder on his part.
 [ K c7 ]  [ Q x f6 ]  [ R g8 ] , [ Q f7 + ]  Another tactic now that I am going to win a rook I will be up an entire queen and the rest of the game was won easily.
 [ R b5 ] , [ N d7 ]  Now we see another reason why Karpov put his rook on cl - after 19 ... i.xa2? 20 c4! the enemy bishop is lost!
 [ N d5 ] , [ B b5 ]  Bb5?? B on [ g5 ] att2 [ d e f1 ] !!! Better B[ x B e7 ] QxB;B[ x N c6 ] bxc6;0-0...
 [ e x f4 ] , [ R e1 + ]  Simple and strong.
 [ K g3 ]  [ K e7 ]  [ K f4 ] , [ K e6 ]  …[ R a4 ] is much better...almost winning. Pins the R!
 [ B x f6 ]  [ Q x f6 + ] , [ K g8 ]  Obviously not 27... [ K h7 ] which allows 28.[ B f5 ] .
 [ K x g2 ] , [ K f7 ]  King toward the center
 [ d5 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ B g4 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ Q c7 ] , [ g3 ]  Pretty much forced.
 [ R a c1 ] , [ Q e8 ]  Aiming to shift my attention to the kingside via the h5-[ e8 ] diagonal.
 [ R g6 ]  [ N b3 ]  [ R b8 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ a6 ] , [ Q f3 ]  The knight is proving to be a real pain
 [ O-O ] , [ f5 ]  White sacrifices a pawn to clear the g line and make the f-line free for his rook
 [ d6 ] , [ N f d2 ]  ....
 [ Q g5 + ]  [ K f2 ]  [ Q h4 + ] , [ Q g3 ]  But I have no better choice
 [ R e8 ] , [ N g5 ]  Only way to keep the pawn.
 [ B f7 ]  [ N f5 ]  [ B h5 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ B x e2 ] , [ N x e2 ]  My punishment for ignoring Keres' rule: never play 0-0-0 or 0-0. Play [ f3 ] Kf2... From now on fourth I will always have to exchange bishops at [ e2 ] and take back with a pinned knight...
 [ R g2 ] , [ Q x h4 + ]  free pawn again and with check now.
 [ Q x d5 ] , [ N e7 ]  I revenge the knight and he falls back with his other knight threatening my lady Queen
 [ B x a8 ] , [ Q h4 + ]  oponent gives up only 2 possible moves. 17 [ g3 ] [ Q x g3 + ] 18 [ K f1 ] [ Q f2 ] mate please comment. trying to face higher elo rating oponents and having a decent winning streak as of this game (who knows in the future)
 [ B d4 + ]  [ K g6 ]  [ c5 ] , [ a2 ]  There are a few promising continuations for white but to be safe he needs to advance his king. I am counting on queening first. My original thoughts were that he can realistically make me abandon the a pawn with a move like [ [ d6 ] ] shifting the center of play to where he is strongest and can most easily control but I have to consider that 53.[ [ d6 ] ] Bx[ [ d6 ] ] wins the pawn for free because of the a pawn. The white bishop is already overworked which is why I believe white's best move is Ke5.
 [ e4 ] , [ R x c3 ]  I sacrifice part of my material advantage to reach and ending where my material advantage is simpler.
 [ Q d6 ] , [ N f3 ]  Two minors four pawns etc...
 [ O-O ]  [ N f3 ] , [ N b d7 ]  I always find [ N b d7 ] a difficult move to counter as my dark squared Bishop is now essentially without many good squares and taking the Knight seems wrong.
 [ B c3 ] , [ Q a7 ]  Trying to eliminate the passed Pawn and secure a material advantage.
 [ B x b5 ] , [ a x b5 ]  ...and we exchange.
 [ B g3 ] , [ N x c3 ]  i overlooked that one
 [ B b5 ]  [ a6 ]  [ B x c6 ]  [ d x c6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B g4 ]  [ d3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ] , [ B c5 ]  The first little excitement approaches ...
 [ R g2 + ]  [ K h7 ]  [ R x f8 ]  [ N f5 ]  [ R g6 ]  [ d x e5 ] , [ R g f6 ]  His next move was the ending. I guess he overlooked what was coming.
 [ B x d6 ] , [ N f6 ]  My dark squared bishop is very strong now and dislodging it with one of the knights is going to take considerable time
 [ R x c3 + ]  [ N b3 ]  [ N d5 x b4 ] , [ Q x b4 ]  Maybe just distracted by something else? Anything would have been better but especially g4.
 [ N c4 ] , [ B c5 ]  Threatening the rook but also giving the Bishop more scope to manoeuver.
 [ Q h3 ] , [ R f7 ]  There's nothing better than this - to stop the c-pawn's advance. White now needs to find an infiltration point and this has its challenges since the obvious c-file (behind his passer) is blocked by Black's N.
 [ R e1 ] , [ Q f4 ]  Threatens mate at h2.
 [ R h3 ]  [ N x f2 ] , [ R g3 ]  ...essentially forcing him back to [ g5 ] but having a tempo for doubling rooks on e. In doing this I'm leaving [ h4 ] unprotected.
 [ e4 ] , [ d5 ]  My usual Scandinavian...
 [ B x f7 ]  [ R x f7 ] , [ R x d7 ]  Another sacrifice (to take away the guard from [ f8 ] so the knight can go there).
 [ e x d4 ] , [ d3 ]  I also could have castled at this point. However I like this move better at the moment. Why? If 5.0-0 5...[ Q e7 ] is a feasibility. If that happens my e pawn is left hanging. In addition I have to play this move sooner or later so why not now?
 [ N x f6 ]  [ R e2 ] , [ Q g7 ]  Yet another Queen move clearly planning a pawn storm on my king.
 [ B e3 ]  [ R c8 ]  [ g4 ]  [ N x e3 ] , [ f x e3 ]  white's [ e3 ] pawn is pinned.
 [ f4 ]  [ a6 ]  [ f3 ]  [ a7 ] , [ R g2 # ]  
 [ B c3 ] , [ R f8 ]  Exchange sounds good for me! :-D
 [ N f6 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N d5 ] , [ d4 ]  now the position is looking quite Alekhines defence like but with the black c pawn on [ c5 ]  [ c x d4 ] , [ c x d4 ]  apparently [ N f3 ] is more accurate here as the d pawn is pinned to the knight on [ d5 ] but i think it would just transpose to the game next move anyway
 [ e x d5 ] , [ N x d5 ]  exchanged pawns
 [ a4 ]  [ B f3 ] , [ Q h2 ]  But to be sincere my position doesn't offer many libertes either. The only way to progress for black is to open the g column. OF course it means to open my own's king position dangerously. I tried.
 [ R x h1 ]  [ B x h1 ]  [ R e7 ] , [ h3 ]  A useless move.
 [ f4 ]  [ e x f4 ]  [ B x f4 ]  [ b5 ] , [ K h8 ]  !? Alternative variation: 17... [ R f7 ] [!?] 18. [ N e3 ] [ N f8 ] 19. [ N c d1 ] [ N e6 ] 20. [ g3 ] [ B x e3 ] 21. [ N x e3 ] [ N g5 ] [⩱]
 [ N f4 ] , [ Q x g4 ]  With the [ g4 ] pawn gone White can block a battery along the h-file with Ng5-[ h3 ] when desired. Also White is poised to do [ B x f4 ] removing another annoying attacker. But Hans overlooked......
 [ Q a6 + ]  [ K d8 ] , [ O-O-O ]  With the WQ still defending the [ N e2 ] White finally gets a chance to castle! It does little-to-nothing for his King's safety but it brings a Rook over to [ d1 ] and gets the WK out of the way allowing the White Rooks to finally connect on the back rank.
 [ f5 ]  [ g x f5 ]  [ N x c4 ]  [ K x c4 ] , [ e x f5 ]  Excellent defense by Caruana. Game 4 tomorrow! In case if you are wondering Black's Bishop in on the wrong corner. So all white has to do is put his King on [ h1 ] and draw. Black cannot make progress so draw. I really try not to go into the detail computer lines. Anyone can read those things off their engines. I am trying to give you more from my personal world championship experience and the thinking and maneuvering from both players. Hope you do not mind! That's my coaching side!
 [ f x e5 ]  [ R e8 ] , [ Q f5 ]  although it might be too late for Black...
 [ Q h4 ]  [ e x f5 ] , [ g x f5 ]  After some exchanges White is still a healthy pawn up.
 [ b3 ] , [ N h5 ]  Eying the [ f4 ] outpost.
 [ g4 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ g5 ] , [ N d7 ]  Tricky position black has been pushed back but isn't exactly cramped d-knight can go to [ b6 ] e-knight has [ f5 ] or [ d5 ] after [ d4 ] is played and both bishops have some squares. Meanwhile white has three undeveloped pieces on his kingside.
 [ N e4 ] , [ d5 ]  !
 [ c4 ]  [ g6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ e4 ]  [ d6 ]  [ f4 ] , [ O-O ]  This is the starting position of the KID:4PA. White has taken advantage of Black's hypermodern play - Black has not yet committed to a central formation - and grabbed a large share of the centre in exchange for a very slight advantage in development for Black. Black will try to work against White's central control in the sharp variations that can ensue from this position. I personally am hoping to play above my rating in this tournament since I have done quite a lot of preparation on the 4PA! I am also hoping to gain valuable experience of this sharp opening in this tournament.
 [ R x e3 ] , [ Q x e3 ]  Fair enough now he has a few options. [ f5 ] which is in my opinion probably the best option being greedy and gobbling up the pawn on [ a2 ] which leads to a scary Qf4+. Or moving his queen away to avoid the shenanigans. Note added later on: For those interested I looked at what would have happened if Qx[ a2 ] would have been played. Qx[ a2 ] loses for black in every single combination except for 1 in which it draws due to repetition. Reason being because after I force his king all the way back to [ f8 ] I'm able to just capture his bishop. It's still a rocky road from there but black was correct not to take it.
 [ R e2 ]  [ R c1 + ] , [ K g2 ]  It may be worth mentioning that my opponent was running short of time but would gain an extra 15 minutes at move 35; thus neither of us was thinking much at this point asI wanted to deny white the chance to think during my time.
 [ g5 ] , [ K e3 ]  25. [ K e3 ] - I play it now.
 [ B x e6 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ d x e5 ] , [ f x e6 ]  now black is left with an open king side and no defence to the poor king in the center.
 [ N d2 ]  [ Q e2 ]  [ Q d4 ]  [ Q x e7 ]  [ Q x a1 + ]  [ K g2 ] , [ Q f1 # ]  
 [ Q g5 ] , [ K f1 ]  After this move I decided to sacrifice the exchange and try to take advantage of White's strangely placed pieces.
 [ Q d5 ]  [ Q x d5 ]  [ B x d5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B b7 ] , [ N x b5 ]  !
 [ B c5 ]  [ a x b4 ]  [ a x b4 ]  [ c x b4 ] , [ B x b4 ]  45. ..... [ B x b4 ] - this trade has now resulted in me getting another passer on the queenside.
 [ R h2 + ] , [ K g1 ]  [ h2 ] must seek open spaces.
 [ B b3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ f3 ]  [ N a5 ] , [ Q d2 ]  10. [ Q [ d2 ] ] - Glenda moves to [ d2 ] to clear the decks and to think about an exchange of dsbs on g7.
 [ R g4 ]  [ c4 ] , [ B c2 ]  31.Rg5! [ c x b3 ] 32.[ R h5 ] would have been faster.
 [ K e3 ]  [ K e6 ]  [ K d4 ] , [ a5 ]  Black wants to get his king to [ e5 ] but not at the cost of losing the e-pawn after 31. ... Kf5. I considered doing it anyway then demolishing white's kingside pawns and promoting on the kingside while white was busy preventing queenside promotion but that felt a little too much like running up the score. Much more fun to pretend the six kingside pawns don't exist.
 [ N f3 ] , [ d5 ]  I like my chances with [ d5 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ B b5 ]  Well we're no longer in Bird land. Actually think this move for White is giving Black a small advantage.
 [ B f1 ]  [ B f5 ] , [ B d3 ]  19. Bd3? - Dave pointed out that this was a bad mistake because it did allow a sac on h3. I really did want to keep Glenda on that diagonal and I did not want Dave's lsb to get complete control of the b1-[ h7 ] diagonal.
 [ d x e3 + ] , [ Q x e3 ]  Of course white now threatens 20.[ N d6 + ] due to the X-Ray attack by the white Queen which will pin the dark squared bishop to e7. I'm not in a rush so I'm looking out for all tactical threats before I move a piece.
 [ e5 ] , [ Q e2 ]  Black advances into the center white counters by pinning the [ [ e5 ] ] pawn to its king. This also puts winning numbers on [ [ e5 ] ] threatening to play fx[ [ e5 ] ] next move which will fork the black queen and knight and win additional material.
 [ b5 ]  [ a x b6 ]  [ e ]  [ p ]  [ R x b6 ] , [ b3 ]  I was considering [ b4 ] here but that would leave black a pawn up after my little trick.
 [ e x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ g6 ]  [ O-O ] , [ B h6 ]  I was expecting [ B g7 ]  [ B x e3 ]  [ Q x e3 ] , [ N e5 ]  Attack the [ c4 ] pawn. After [ N e7 ] I would have probablt played [ Q h6 ] to prevent 0-0.
 [ f4 ] , [ f6 ]  Looking to weaken White's K-side Pawns as well.
 [ O-O ]  [ B e7 ]  [ Q e2 ] , [ O-O ]  White really needs to develop his queenside. Black has a solid defensive position although prospects for an attack are not too bright and that stranded queen is still a worry.
 [ N c3 ] , [ a6 ]  again: too cautious; preventing [ N b5 ] - as I always do - is immaterial here: I usually plan [ [ d4 ] ] here to drive away [ N c3 ] and that was already better than this (after [ [ d4 ] ] [ N b5 ] f6!)... even a direct [ f6 ] - or even [ f5 ] - would have won at least several tempi...
 [ R a c8 ] , [ R f e1 ]  my bishop is well protected. His cannot arm mine... so what is the point? A long time plan trying to mate on 8th line?
 [ N e5 ] , [ R x e5 ]  I gladly take the free Knight.
 [ Q g7 ] , [ B x b7 ]  White wants to simplify as mush as possible
 [ Q d6 ] , [ R d8 ]  White recognizes the potential threat to his King from the open d file and so moves his Queen to help control it. Black counters by challenging the queen in that file with his rook. This also sets up [ B x e2 + ] as a viable option by removing the possibility of # because the struggle for control of open space in this game is now concentrated on the d file and no longer the e...
 [ B b7 ] , [ e3 ]  White opens the diagonal for his LSB (Light Squared Bishop) prepares to castle in a couple more moves. The pawn seems a little passive on [ e3 ] and might better have been moved to [ e4 ] instead where it would block the fianchettoed black bishop on the long diagonal though it might become tenuous to defend it on e4.
 [ f x e5 ]  [ N x e5 ] , [ Q f6 ]  I thought that this was wrong as now the [ c7 ] square is undefended. Maybe [ N e7 ] returning some of the material.
 [ N c7 ] , [ R a7 ]  I think this was a mistake [ R b8 ] looks far better and would have kept his rook in play.
 [ K d7 ] , [ R x a6 ]  Now I am a piece up and can threaten black with check.
 [ B x c3 + ]  [ b x c3 ]  [ d x c4 ] , [ B x c4 ]  “Undoubled” pawns
 [ R d1 ]  [ N g3 ] , [ R d5 ]  In this situation anything is possible.
 [ R c b1 ]  [ B b4 ]  [ R h d1 ]  [ B c3 ]  [ R d3 ]  [ K e6 ] , [ R c1 ]  This is the first time in the game that the computer evaluation gets over -0.8 in favor of Black. It now gives an advantage of -0.94 to Black.
 [ e x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ N f4 ]  [ c4 ]  [ g6 ]  [ f x g6 ]  [ f5 ]  [ g7 ]  [ K x g7 ] , [ Q g3 + ]  Move breaks the indirect pin of black's white bishop
 [ B b5 ]  [ B c3 ]  [ Q d8 ] , [ N x f6 ]  !
 [ e5 ]  [ B x e5 ]  [ f x e5 ]  [ c x b5 ]  [ e x f6 ]  [ g x f6 ] , [ Q g4 + ]  Now that there is a clear path to Black's King and White has three pieces readily available he will commence the attack. White's two pieces trained on the [ f6 ] pawn spell certain doom for Black. White will play Bx[ f6 ] on his next move attacking Black's Queen and threatening mate with Qg7.
 [ K c8 ]  [ R a f1 ]  [ b6 ] , [ R f7 f8 + ]  I attack the king...
 [ K x h8 ] , [ Q h5 + ]  Giving my rook more time to get out of there.
 [ B c4 ]  [ N g f6 ] , [ N g5 ]  This was at the time it was first played by A. Karpov a revolutionary move. The whole point of the move was to punish black of a haste 6...h6. Because of [ B x f7 + + ]  [ e6 ] , [ Q e2 ]  A typical move where white adds to the control of [ e4 ] and increases pressure on e6.
 [ R x a6 ] , [ c6 ]  I don't know why she played this.
 [ h7 ]  [ R h8 ] , [ Q h6 ]  oh oh I didn't see it. But be calm.
 [ d5 ]  [ a6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ R e3 ]  Pins the knight.
 [ B c4 ]  [ N b6 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ B x c6 ] , [ d x c6 ]  An oddly developed position. White has advanced pawns which largely negate the fiancetto and Black's remaining knight is poorly placed to contest the center.
 [ Q e7 ]  [ h3 ] , [ O-O-O ]  I'm ahead in development and castled while white is moving pawns.
 [ K b8 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ K a8 ]  [ R a b1 ]  [ Q x d4 ] , [ N b5 ]  Alternative variation: 22. [ Q x d4 ] [ e x d4 ] 23. [ N b5 ] [ B x b5 ] 24. [ R x b5 ] [ B d6 ] $15
 [ c5 ]  [ b4 ]  [ a x b4 ]  [ c x b4 ] , [ c x b4 ]  Excellent! A pawn race! Who will promote first...?
 [ Q f3 + ]  [ K g8 ] , [ Q f7 # ]  One lesson to be learned is to evaluate carefully before deciding to take anything. Asking yourself why your opponent gave it away is important. If you just decide to grab without analyzing it can mean disaster we saw this on both sides. But the main moral is based on what shamash said. "It's not about how much you learn but applying what you've learned and using them towards your game." By remembering this moral I was able to plan the variations that led to that nasty pin which won black's Queen. And I remembered about the positional sacs which I used to deliver this mate.
 [ b x c4 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ N x d5 ] , [ N e4 ]  Ok Now black is a pawn dow. Now I can play 9 ... [ N b6 ] and consolidates the c4-pawn. But I choice to castle.
 [ Q x b2 ]  [ B h4 ] , [ R h8 ]  Not sure what this was about. Now Black loses a rook too.
 [ f5 ]  [ R x d4 ]  [ f x e6 ] , [ f x e6 ]  19. .... [ f x e6 ] - the first breach in the wall is made.
 [ B g7 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ c5 ]  This is the way to play the Pirc if you want to avoid White's Pawn-[ e5 ] attack instead of 0-0.
 [ e4 ] , [ e5 ]  this is the perfect set up for the goring gambit
 [ d1 = Q + ]  [ K h2 ]  [ Q x f3 ]  [ g x f3 ] , [ c3 ]  
 [ Q h4 + ]  [ N f2 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ d3 ] , [ N b4 ]  Now with the queen on [ h4 ] (so [ K d1 ] is ruled out as a defence) this move is good.
 [ d x e7 ]  [ N x e7 ] , [ R c7 ]  ! Computer-esque. Had I not been a Morra fanatic and lover of positional binds I'd have never found such a silly looking move. The rook although doing little at the moment creates potential lateral pressure along the 7th rank thus ruling out a d-pawn move for a while. The rook threatens future tactics such as potentially trapping the bishop on its starting square or capturing a knight on [ c6 ] for a deflection. Now black must answer the question: what is your plan to get through or out of this mess? The sad answer is nothing. White: "Having fun black?" Black: "No." White: "Good."
 [ a6 ]  [ K c3 ]  [ K c6 ]  [ K b2 ]  [ b5 ]  [ c x b5 + ] , [ K x b5 ]  40 ................. [ K x b5 ] - the predicted pawn swap has taken place but I am a bit surprised that black has taken back with the king and split up his queenside pawns.
 [ b4 ] , [ B d6 ]  Structurally this is like a reversed Sicilian Dragon but where White has an extra tempo. 11. [ b4 ] is first deviation from the So-Caruana game. Yes the position looks harmless but Caruana must remain focus. This is exactly the type of position Carlsen wants and he got it. Of course after 12. [ N x d4 ] [ e x d4 ] 13. [ B x d4 ] Black regains the Pawn right back after 13...[ B x g3 ] 14. [ h x g3 ] Qxd4.
 [ e6 ] , [ c4 ]  A delayed c4.
 [ Q x b4 ]  [ R a b1 ]  [ Q e7 ]  [ B f3 ]  [ R a d8 ]  [ R b5 ] , [ N h4 ]  This move serves couple of purposes - attacking a bishop (currently bishop prevents black from playing ...e2) and attacking [ f4 ] pawn.
 [ B x d4 ]  [ N x d4 + ]  [ K x g3 ]  [ K x c5 ]  [ K f4 ]  [ K b4 ]  [ K e3 ] , [ N c6 ]  Pressuring e5.
 [ R a d8 ]  [ Q e7 ]  [ R d3 d7 ]  [ a8 = Q ]  [ Q x a8 ]  [ R h6 + ]  [ K x h6 ]  [ Q x f6 + ]  [ K h5 ]  [ K h2 ]  [ R h8 ]  [ K h3 ]  [ R d4 ]  [ Q f7 + ]  [ K h6 ]  [ Q f6 + ]  [ K h5 ]  [ Q f7 + ]  [ K h6 ]  [ Q f6 + ] , [ K h5 ]  after a few slight inaccuracies by black white did manage to get a small but enduring initiative. This however was not enough to win. The ending was never in doubt.
 [ R b8 ]  [ R x a3 ] , [ R x b6 ]  Again my opponent complimented me. GN has the score of the game as -0.01 and fritz has it equal. While I don't know how equal the game is at this point while we're playing it I know that it's going well. I guess I need to protect [ e5 ] [cue ominous music]
 [ R x c8 ]  [ B x c8 ] , [ b3 ]  34. [ b3 ] - I do have some pawn company now but it is the enemy. I ask him why he wanted to fight us and he replied. That awful Cromwell do you know he has stopped us from all sorts of leisure activities. He has banned acting cock-fighting bear baiting tennis and he is even trying to ban Christmas. Down with the old Scrooge! So that is why I am here today.
 [ g x h5 ] , [ Q e7 ]  Against ...K-[ N1 ] white would play Q-[ N4 ] practically forcing the exchange of Q's and would have an easy endgame win. Black would be down a Pawn and his B would be virtually useless.
 [ a5 ]  [ K c3 ]  [ B e4 ]  [ B e2 ] , [ B c6 ]  No progress can be made for either side.
 [ Q d3 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ d5 ]  [ B f7 ]  [ e4 ] , [ c6 ]  challenging white's strong center
 [ b x a4 ] , [ N e g2 ]  I am headed for [ f4 ] where I attack the weak g-pawn. The key to getting a successful kingside attack is to first attack the pawns.
 [ B b5 ]  [ f4 + ]  [ K d2 ] , [ K d4 ]  Black's king is constantly opposing White's king holding him back and pushing him back at every opportunity.
 [ R h1 ]  [ f x g4 ]  [ K e3 ]  [ K g6 ]  [ K f2 ]  [ h5 ]  [ K g3 ]  [ K g5 ]  [ R h2 ]  [ R f4 ]  [ b3 ]  [ R f3 + ]  [ K g2 ]  [ h4 ]  [ R h1 ]  [ h3 + ]  [ K g1 ]  [ K h4 ]  [ K h2 ]  [ g3 + ]  [ K g1 ]  [ h2 + ]  [ K g2 ] , [ R f2 # ]  Checkmate! White could've stalled the game longer if he had taken my pawn on move 57 but with my extra rook and passed pawn winning would still be simple. White's losing mistake this game was trying to stop me from advancing my pawn majority. He should've tried advancing his own majority on the queenside so that it would be a race to see whose majority advances faster. Remember that in endgames you MUST have active pieces not defensive pieces trying to stop a pawn majority.
 [ h x g6 ] , [ R x g6 ]  I give up the c file but threaten another pawn
 [ O-O ] , [ d x c4 ]  And here we are with first blood. Here I am aiming to restrict any meaningful movement from the White Queen on to my Queen's side.
 [ R g6 ]  [ Q x g4 ]  [ R x g4 ]  [ N e2 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ N x f4 ] , [ R x f4 ]  Black is down to two Rs.
 [ B g5 ]  [ R b7 ] , [ B x h4 ]  With 46...[ Q f4 ] coming with the threat of 47...[ Q g5 # ] white´s position looks lost but haddibje has a magnificent save prepared.
 [ N f3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ B f5 ]  This move would waste time if White followed up with 5.[ Q b3 ] as in the next note. 4...[ B g4 ] is often played here and leads to a more open aggressive game.
 [ a5 ] , [ f6 ]  Mate in 2 moves. The only way to prolong the game would have been [ R g4 ] because if I then play [ N d4 ] the followup will be Rxg7+. But it would only extend it a couple of extra moves.
 [ d x e5 ] , [ d x e5 ]  so now the queen is still in danger
 [ Q e6 ] , [ R f e1 ]  At this point in the last game I was mated by Freddy. I follow the advice of placing the Rook on the same file as the Queen for a possible discovery later on
 [ b4 ]  [ a6 ]  [ b5 ]  [ a x b5 ]  [ c x b5 ] , [ N a5 ]  White wins Pe5.
 [ c5 ]  [ f4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d x e4 ] , [ N g5 ]  White begins the attack on [ f7 ] which will involve losing the queen but will bring Black's king into the open.
 [ a3 ]  [ B x c3 ]  [ Q x c3 ]  [ O-O ] , [ O-O-O ]  The situation looks to be slightly favourable for White. Black's K-side is looking very porous and White has the potential for developing a strong K-side attack: the open g-file; the weak dark squares and the target sitting on [ g6 ] at which White's h-pawns might be aimed. But it is Black to play...
 [ N x e1 ] , [ B d5 ]  ! Another great move. It points the bishop towards white's king while blocking the white queen from retreating back down the d file to defend.
 [ R x c1 + ]  [ K x c1 ] , [ f2 ]  ! Now white is completely lost.
 [ B x e4 ]  [ d x e4 ] , [ Q f4 ]  ! Yes. Not only delaying the capture on [ e4 ] but also giving up the pawn on c2. Good move White's concentration of pieces on the kingside starts to look intimidating.
 [ b4 ]  [ R a8 ]  [ B b2 ] , [ O-O ]  It is time to castle and get both of my rooks into the game
 [ R x e8 ]  [ Q x e8 ] , [ Q x c7 + ]  What can I do? I need time to regroup my pieces I am getting ready to resign. I can't cover my back or second rank sufficiently and [ Q a5 ] can't work because of [ d3 ] and the threat of [ B x f2 + ] winning the Queen.
 [ N g f3 ]  [ B b5 + ]  [ K g1 ] , [ R e e2 ]  26 moves into the game and White is yet to move his rooks has managed to develop his knights to [ e1 ] and [ f3 ] and managed one move combined with his queen and dark-squared bishop. The end is swift.
 [ e6 ] , [ f4 ]  Attacking immediately with a pawn storm on the king side and threatening to win Black's knight with [ e5 ] push. By the way this is the starting position of this thematic tournament.
 [ B g7 ] , [ Q x e5 + ]  18. [ Q x [ e5 ] ] - the [ e5 ] pawn is a free pawn because the [ f6 ] pawn is pinned to the enemy king by Fou Lenoir.
 [ B b7 ] , [ B d3 ]  But first I need to protect. And there were several ways but I thought that this was the best since the only other alternative would be 19.[ R c1 ] But I still have ideas for their Bb7.
 [ d5 ] , [ O-O-O ]  11. [ e x d6 ] e.p.+ would also have been a very nice move.
 [ c5 ]  [ f4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ N g5 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ Q x g4 ]  [ N x g4 ]  [ B x f7 + ]  [ K d7 ]  [ B e6 + ]  [ K c6 ]  [ B x g4 ] , [ e6 ]  I like [ e6 ] for Black as so far it has afforded my quickest development.
 [ N b d7 ]  [ a x b5 ]  [ Q x b5 ]  [ e3 ]  [ Q x b3 ]  [ N x b3 ] , [ B e7 ]  Let's face it both sides have developed pretty oddly. White's idea of a good opening is to fiddle aroud with his queen and waste a move with his rook while Black's pawn formation looks rather weak.
 [ B c3 ] , [ K f7 ]  So preparing to use my King if necessary to help block and/or round up the passed d pawn.
 [ B x e2 ]  [ d6 ] , [ B c4 ]  Now this is a nice moment. Now I did see the combination and played it instantly. Was there a better one?
 [ f5 ]  [ Q e6 + ] , [ N f6 ]  hmmm kinda impossible to give him a check right now...
 [ b5 ] , [ O-O ]  OK development is finished.
 [ K b7 ]  [ Q x b2 + ] , [ K c8 ]  if I was going to trade I would have done it now. but i didn't instead i got a free queen in 3 moves: watch (can you see it?)
 [ e6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N g f6 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ B b4 + ]  [ c3 ]  [ B e7 ] , [ N x f6 + ]  White wants to castle queenside but first captures on [ f6 ] to avoid 9 0-0-0 [ N x e4 ] 10 [ B x e7 ] [ N x f2 ] 11 [ B x d8 ] [ N x d3 + ] 12 [ R x d3 ] [ K x d8 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ N x f6 ]  [ O-O-O ] , [ O-O ]  The kings are on opposite sides of the board. This suggests a sharp game.
 [ Q x f6 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ Q d6 ]  [ c3 ]  [ Q g6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ d6 ]  [ N x c7 ] , [ R b8 ]  I figured free pawn and a safe spot to retreat to. One of my weaknesses I can't resist free pawns even if as in this case it costs me two tempos and the nasty little trap he is about to come up with. I really should know better.
 [ Q x b2 ]  [ Q x b2 ]  [ R x b2 ] , [ R f2 ]  Looking at the possibility of a discovered attack.
 [ Q a5 ]  [ R x e7 + ]  [ K d8 ]  [ Q x g4 ] , [ Q a4 ]  21. ....... [ Q a4 ] - preventing mate on d7.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ] , [ Q h5 ]  white did an unusual move and i found this interesting
 [ c x d4 ] , [ N x d4 ]  ..all his pieces are undeveloped but his one horse which stands nailed..
 [ Q x a5 ] , [ R b a1 ]  No now P[ b6 ] is lost.
 [ d x c5 ] , [ B x c5 ]  7. ...... [ B x c5 ] - but first we have a pawn trade. Although I am a bit behind in development it looks as though I may be able to put my pieces on decent squares without too much interference from white.
 [ B g6 ] , [ N h4 ]  Now that [ f5 ] is a potential outpost White brings the Knight to it. He also clears the f-pawn to advance.
 [ K g7 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ N g8 ]  [ R d6 ]  [ Q d8 ] , [ N x f6 ]  The coup de grace.
 [ K d6 ]  [ h6 ] , [ f5 ]  Another aesthetic if useless move Black tries to divert attention.
 [ R b3 ]  [ Q e4 ] , [ N d3 ]  I don't know how I would have dealt with 30.f3...thankfully I didn't have to.
 [ K d7 ]  [ B e1 ]  [ K c6 ]  [ B f2 ]  [ K d5 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ h5 ]  [ B f2 ]  [ B e8 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ h4 ]  [ B g1 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ K g4 ]  [ g5 ]  [ K h5 ]  [ B x f5 ]  [ K h6 ]  [ g4 ]  [ K h5 ]  [ h3 ]  [ K h4 ]  [ K e4 ]  [ K g3 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ B f2 ]  [ f5 ]  [ c6 ]  [ f4 + ]  [ K h2 ]  [ K f3 ]  [ B g1 ]  [ g3 + ]  [ K h1 ]  [ B d5 ]  [ B b6 ]  [ K e2 + ]  [ K g1 ] , [ h2 # ]

[ Q d2 ] [ N c5 ] 19. [ Q d6 ] [ B f6 ] 20. [ N f3 ] [ Q b7 ] 21. [ Q d2 ] [ N g7 ] [Manolache M (2491)-Sofronie I (2440)/Amara 2007/CBM 117 ext/1-0 (85)]
 [ O-O ]  [ c4 ] , [ d x c4 ]  Heading for the lines of the open Catalan. White does not have the option of [ Q a4 ] . This is the main difference in the Geller system.
 [ Q c7 ] , [ b3 ]  ...which he does.
 [ R f1 ]  [ K g3 ]  [ R g1 + ]  [ K x f4 ]  [ R x g6 ]  [ K e5 ]  [ R g1 ]  [ R b3 + ]  [ K c2 ]  [ R e3 ]  [ K d2 ] , [ K e4 ]  much better was 53...[ f4 ] ! but steel black is wining
 [ B b7 ] , [ e5 ]  A reasonable thrust into the center. Black's queen has a revealed attack coming on her.
 [ R f1 ] , [ B e6 ]  knight sensibly backs away
 [ N f6 ]  [ Q b3 ]  [ Q e7 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N d4 ] , [ N x d4 ]  Black tests white with an early exchange- White doesn't mind.
 [ Q f1 + ]  [ K c2 ] , [ R f7 ]  Afraid of [ R f2 ] but [ R e5 ] gives Black some more activity. At this point barring any huge blunder from White though he should easily win.
 [ N x e4 ]  [ R x e4 ]  [ K d6 ]  [ B g3 + ]  [ K d5 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ b6 ]  [ N e7 + ]  [ K c5 ] , [ R x c8 + ]  forcing the issue...
 [ B e6 ] , [ R a4 ]  odd move leaves the rook awkwardly placed
 [ B b5 ]  [ R d d1 ]  [ B x f1 ]  [ K x f1 ] , [ R d8 ]  Looking to exchange
 [ N g3 + ]  [ K g1 ] , [ Q d4 # ]  short and brutal
 [ K c8 ]  [ R h7 ]  [ a6 ] , [ K a1 ]  34. [ K a1 ] - a waiting move.
 [ B c2 ]  [ N c d7 ]  [ B d2 ]  [ R a c8 ]  [ B c3 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ B b1 ]  [ N x c3 ]  [ R x d7 ] , [ N a4 ]  And this is the position where a draw was agreed on the basis that I am a pawn up in this game a pawn down in the other game. So I ask you to look at the next game and tell your view on who had the best of the deal and why?
 [ B e7 ] , [ N e2 ]  threatening [ N d5 ]  [ B x f2 ]  [ R x h5 ]  [ g x h5 ] , [ B x f5 + ]  it is all over now the connected past pawns will be unstoppable.
 [ N f3 ]  [ d5 ] , [ d4 ]  I broke from my original game plan and opted to counter my opponents first move.
 [ N h2 ]  [ Q d7 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ c6 ] , [ N x g4 ]  White decides to trade his out of position knight for the well positioned bishop and following the forced recapture by the knight (16...[ Q x g4 ] 17. [ d x c6 ] [ b x c6 ] 18. [ B x c6 ] wins a pawn) white can move the bishop away from the attack of the pawn with a tempo attacking the well placed knight.
 [ e5 ]  [ Q h5 ] , [ N c6 ]  not worried about the queen
 [ b4 ]  [ N d5 ] , [ R b8 ]  This move serves 2 purposes: 1 is that [ N c7 + ] no longer costs me the rook 2 is that the rook is on the same line as the white king.
 [ Q a1 + ]  [ K b4 ] , [ Q b2 ]  ? Loses his pawn.
 [ b5 ]  [ K c7 ]  [ b x c6 ] , [ b x c6 ]  Now c line is opened.
 [ N x e4 + ] , [ K e2 ]  22.[ K d1 ] or 22.[ K e1 ] were his only other choices. However 22.[ K e1 ] is the only other move that would have protected his [ f2 ] pawn.
 [ R f7 ] , [ Q a4 ]  Blacks rook is haning and needs to be delt with.
 [ Q f3 + ]  [ K e7 ] , [ Q g3 ]  As the b-pawn could have been taken with check it would have been worth doing so. Black would have had split pawn on the Q-side to protect which might have been enough to tie it down for White to make progress.
 [ B d4 ] , [ N d7 ]  protected only by the king...
 [ R d e1 ] , [ c4 ]  maybe a bit too soon: first [ K h8 ] was to be preferred: but hey this is blitz...
 [ Q x b6 ]  [ Q x b6 ]  [ B x b6 ]  [ R e b8 ] , [ B c5 ]  this situation I have seen several moves before and I have calculated 2 black choice...
 [ O-O ]  [ Q a5 ] , [ a3 ]  Defending the a-pawn but I think [ Q b3 ] was much stronger.
 [ R a c8 ]  [ Q e4 ]  [ R c b8 ] , [ Q d4 ]  Forks the black queen and the pawn on a7. I thought surely this would force the issue trade queens since black wouldn't want to lose another pawn.
 [ B g2 ]  [ d5 ] , [ N f3 ]  The battle lines are drawn...or are they?
 [ N d6 ] , [ R x d6 ]  ! White keeps the queens on the board (instead of Qxd6) which allows him to attack on the K-side while blacks pieces are tied down to defending the passed c-pawn. This move also gains a tempi which will help white.
 [ R g6 ]  [ b x c5 ]  [ B x c5 ]  [ R x c7 ]  [ b4 ]  [ Q f5 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ c x b4 ]  [ R g5 ]  [ Q d7 ]  [ R g6 ] , [ R x c6 ]  I get more pieces off the board...
 [ N c5 ] , [ R f7 ]  Just waiting for a plan! I'm looking at [ b6 ] as my way to break white but I wasn't sure and just wandered.
 [ Q c6 ] , [ Q h5 ]  then i thought i could get a free pawn
 [ Q e7 + ] , [ K x e7 ]  This next series of moves is brilliant!
 [ B b5 ] , [ R c1 ]  Now White has the c-file.
 [ K e4 ] , [ N d4 ]  Perfect position for the knight. The king cannot harass it and the b-pawn is on prise.
 [ N c6 ] , [ B c4 ]  This is a very attacking move.
 [ R e8 ] , [ Q g3 ]  Good no need to miss necessary defensive moves.
 [ a4 ]  [ B x a4 ]  [ Q a5 ]  [ b3 ]  [ R f c8 ] , [ g5 ]  '?' - White tries to revive threats to Black's king but underestimates Black's resources. After the simple ..[ N h5 ] Black's kingside is safe forever.
 [ f5 ]  [ B b2 ] , [ B e6 ]  10. ..... [ B e6 ] - in hindsight this move should have waited because Fou Leblanc is hanging. Loose pieces can become a target for combos.
 [ K x d5 ]  [ K x b5 ]  [ e5 ]  [ c6 ]  [ K d6 ]  [ K b6 ]  [ B f8 ]  [ c7 ]  [ K d7 ]  [ K b7 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ c8 = Q + ]  [ K e7 ]  [ K c6 ]  [ f5 ] , [ Q d7 + ]  now he loses even his bishop (just out of his jail).......the rest is story........don't undervalue ideas and plans in chess....strategy
 [ R d8 ] , [ B d4 ]  again i empower the goodbishop...
 [ B x g2 ]  [ R g1 ] , [ B h3 ]  This is the weapon. My bishop will exchange any white firepower and my material disadvantage is now just -1. There is plenti of game ahead.
 [ Q e1 + ]  [ K c2 ]  [ Q f2 + ]  [ K b3 ]  [ Q x g3 + ] , [ K x b4 ]  Now my king is sorta safe.
 [ N g6 ]  [ B x g6 ] , [ f x g6 ]  9. ........ fxg6? - in retrospect i think it would have been much better to have taken with the other pawn as Henry will soon find life very hot for him.
 [ e x d5 ]  [ N e7 ] , [ a3 ]  The idea here is to move pawn to [ b4 ] soon provoking [ c5 ] but didn't happened in this game.
 [ Q x a2 ] , [ h4 ]  Now can the queen deliver perpetual check? I think so because white can't block with the g-pawn if the rook blocks the rank then I attack on the diagonal (as I'm already on a white square) and if he goes to [ g5 ] the rook can't block anyway. If I can persuade him behind the pawns then even better! Let's see what happens...
 [ Q b6 ]  [ O-O ] , [ N x e5 ]  White is a pawn down. For what benefit? His pieces are all developed and thus more active.
 [ K d7 ]  [ d6 ]  [ K d8 ] , [ K c6 ]  Somewhere around this point my opponent offers a draw. NO WAY!!
 [ R x a5 ]  [ R b2 ]  [ R c5 ]  [ R a2 ]  [ a5 ] , [ K g6 ]  White's main threat is that hanging pawn on the a-file. It is unfortunately for White a bit too close to its starting position to force Black to keep the rook on the a-file.
 [ R e5 ] , [ R a6 ]  forced finally I think he is trying a draw... I've inserted a conditional 58. [ f6 ] Rx[ f6 ] 59. [ R x a5 ] [ K e6 ] 60. [ R a6 + ] [ K e5 ] 61. Rx[ f6 ] Kx[ f6 ] 62. [ K x h6 ] [ K f7 ] 63. [ K h7 ] K[ f6 ] 64. [ K h8 ] [ K g6 ] but there are several other alternatives
 [ B f6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ R f d8 ] , [ N h4 ]  ?! An odd move. 14. [ R f e1 ] ∆ [ e4 ] is more to the point.
 [ b5 ] , [ Q c2 ]  Again white chooses to retire and threatens h2. I was aware of the g3's weakness after [ B x h2 ] but I can't quit taking care of the center.
 [ R x a1 ] , [ R c8 ]  So I threaten mate and try to get his other R.
 [ Q g7 + ] , [ K e8 ]  Forced and now.
 [ Q e5 + ] , [ N g3 ]  here is the mistake: if white had played [ g3 ] I think it was a draw. Now I win a piece.. and the game.
 [ N e3 ] , [ Q g1 ]  Threatening 42...[ Q g3 + ] 43.[ K h5 ] Qxh3#.
 [ N e4 ] , [ B x e4 ]  White exchanges the bishop for the dangerous-looking knight on e4.
 [ B e6 ]  [ B x e6 ]  [ B x c3 + ]  [ b x c3 ] , [ Q x e6 ]  revenge for my mistake. But now I am down a rook.
 [ N b d2 ]  [ c5 ]  [ c3 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ Q c2 ]  I have reached this position in several games and am very comfortable
 [ N c6 ]  [ O-O ] , [ N f6 ]  The last book move in the Sicilian: 2..[ d6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ h3 ]  [ B h5 ]  [ R e1 ] , [ e6 ]  This move consolidates [ d5 ] and gives black a strong center.
 [ b5 ]  [ B b3 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ c3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ d6 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ N a5 ] , [ B c2 ]  My B will be happy here.
 [ B h6 ]  [ Q e2 ] , [ B e3 + ]  Be carefull. :-) I thought long and hard about this move. I had to think about safety and also counter attack. I cant afford to lose another one.
 [ d5 ]  [ c4 ] , [ d x c4 ]  2. ..... [ d x c4 ] - Queen's Gambit Accepted. I have been inclined to accept gambits like these and have had mixed results.
 [ N g e2 ] , [ Q a5 ]  I am unsure what better move there is. (the point of these public annotated games) White did not push his pawn to d5.
 [ B c5 ]  [ c3 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ a4 ]  Probably a bit weak too nervous of this opponent.
 [ g3 ]  [ B h6 ]  [ f4 ]  [ R a d8 ]  [ K d2 ]  [ R d6 ] , [ R h e1 ]  ? [ Q f3 ] was better here; if I can get [ R e3 ] in white's queen will be cut off from the defence of the knight. The computer gives as the best line 21. [ Q f3 ] [ R e6 ] 22. [ R a e1 ] [ R e3 ] 23. [ Q f2 ] [ Q e4 ] 24. [ Q f1 ] [ K f8 ] 25. [ h3 ] (don't really understand those last three moves) RxP! 26. NxR [ Q x d4 + ] 27. [ K c1 ] BxP+ 28. [ K b1 ] BxN when black has three pawns for the exchange and a reasonably active position.
 [ N f1 ] , [ Q x d4 ]  Black lessens White's advantage.
 [ b x c4 ] , [ R x c6 ]  Thank goodness you move the rook at last!
 [ Q b4 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ N d c4 ]  [ N e8 ] , [ N b6 ]  Black has been completely outmanoeuvred.
 [ K f6 ]  [ Q d4 ] , [ K e6 ]  my nights is there for a reason...i guess he could have mooved his king over there..
 [ R h b8 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ N x e3 ]  [ Q x e3 ] , [ R a6 ]  This is an obvious blunder.
 [ B b5 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ Q d3 ]  [ a6 ]  [ B x c6 ] , [ B x c6 ]  More exchange
 [ K e3 ] , [ Q x f2 + ]  ...loses the queen by a fork if not mate. So Joanne gave up. As a trainer (I am not) I would say: "even if you don't want to be aggressive think that the opponent can be. Give a look futher to "tricky" moves think about any possible sac from your opponent. Think he is a kamikaze. Care about "banzai" attacks crazy ones... and get mad! :-)". Another one? :-)
 [ B b7 ]  [ c3 ] , [ N x d3 ]  Simplifying.
 [ B d2 + ]  [ N b4 ] , [ N c4 + ]  18. [ N c4 + ] - Freddy's horsies give me knightmares!!!!
 [ h3 ] , [ g5 ]  Tense situation... white's pressure is hot but black is solid.
 [ R g3 ] , [ Q d6 ]  Trying to find a weakness in white's development but this was difficult.
 [ b x c6 ] , [ B d3 ]  The center will open soon as now White cannot stop ...[ d5 ] so he prevents a Queen exchange (as with his limited space a Queen trade would favor Black). White's midgame plan is now taking shape: he will place his pieces behind his pawns for an eventual assault through the center and against the BK using his slight spacial advantage. Then when he can he will play e4-[ e5 ] to initiate his attack by activating many pieces at once.
 [ N c6 ] , [ K e3 ]  Since 27... [ N b4 ] would be pointless (after 28. [ c3 ] [ N x a2 ] 29. [ R a1 ] black Knight must die) I was expecting again 27... Rg8. I would probably try to hold to [ g2 ] pawn and this would cause the game to last long. Most pragmatic would be given by Fritz 27... [ R g8 ] 28. [ R d1 + ] [ K e6 ] 29. Rd5! Rx[ g2 ] 30. [ R c5 ] [ R h2 ] 31. [ R x h5 ] [ R h3 + ] 32. [ K f2 ] [ R h2 + ] 33.[ K f3 ] h3.
 [ d x c5 ]  [ B x c5 ] , [ N a2 ]  Likewise I don't Joe moved the N here. It didn't appear en-prise. For example 24...[ b4 ] would've obviously been met with 25.ax[ b4 ] and the N is still protected.
 [ R h f1 + ]  [ K g6 ]  [ N e5 + ]  [ K h7 ] , [ R x f7 ]  The Black king has been squeezed into a corner. The White pieces are taking up strong positions in the Black half of the board and are threatening to overwhelm the defenders in short order due in no small part to Black's failure to develop his Queenside which itself was a direct result of Black allowing White to force a recapture by the Black king back on move 5.
 [ K g5 ] , [ R g4 + ]  And the idea behind was this move. Like before I'm trying to get a draw by repetition against him as this is a drawish position. In the past I offered Jack a draw but he's declined. In fact we discussed it in the end of what would've happened if it were offered. It turns out that he also would've declined because of the same thing. In it Jack said that you had to play out the draw and earn before he'd accept the offer.
 [ Q a1 + ]  [ K c2 ]  [ Q a4 + ] , [ K b2 ]  (?) According to Maroczy 22.Kc1! would have forced a draw by perpetual check (22...Qa1+) since 22...Bxb4? is wrong in view of 23.[ c x b4 ] [ R x b4 ] 24.[ Q g5 ] (24.[ Q c2 ] [ Q a3 + ] 25.[ K d2 ] [ R b2 ] 26.[ R c1 ] is also possible) 24...[ Q a3 + ] 25.[ K d2 ] [ R b2 + ] 26.[ K e1 ] [ R x e2 + ] 27.[ K x e2 ] [ Q f3 + ] 28.[ K e1 ] [ Q x h1 + ] 29.[ Q g1 ] [ Q f3 ] 20.Qg3. However with the help of any decent modern engine we can establish that 22...Bf5! (22...[ a5 ] 23.[ Q c2 ] [ Q a3 + ] 24.[ Q b2 ] [ a x b4 ] 25.[ K c2 ] [ B a6 ] 26.Bf1! is unclear) 23 Be1! [ Q a1 + ] 24.[ K c2 ] [ e3 + ] 25.[ K b3 ] [ e x d2 ] 26.[ R x a1 ] [ R e8 ] 27.[ B a6 ] [ d x e1 = Q ] 28.R[ a x e1 ] [ R x e1 ] 29.[ R x e1 ] [ B x h2 ] 30.[ B b7 ] [ B e4 ] 31.[ B x c6 ] [ K f7 ] would nevertheless have given Black a minimal advantage (obviously less than after 17...Bg4!: here it is far closer to a draw). This is the present-day level of attack and defense illustrating the COLOSSAL progress of chess during the past 150 plus years...
 [ B b5 ] , [ O-O-O ]  Castling queenside was maybe Blacks best option here because he had weakened his pawn shield on the kingside. It´s also possible that Black plans a pawn storm on the kingside!
 [ N x g4 ]  [ B e2 ] , [ N f6 ]  Moving the knight to a good position to oversee any battle for the centre with the pawns. Also with whites exposed kingside black won't want his knight being traded off for the bishop as less material reduces the chance of a successful attack.
 [ R e1 ] , [ a6 ]  Preparing to advance my Q-side Pawns a bit.
 [ R x d2 ] , [ B c4 ]  With the material flying off the board fast and furious my advantage has become greatly augmented. Now it's an easy win.
 [ N b7 + ]  [ K c8 ]  [ R x d7 ]  [ K x d7 ]  [ R d1 + ]  [ K c8 ] , [ N f d6 + ]  My two beautiful knights still working in pair.
 [ e x d6 ] , [ R d1 ]  This move I don't understand. Probably making room for the king?
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ c3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ f3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ d3 ] , [ d5 ]  this is premature allowing white to steer the game into a French Defense unfavorable for black. much better was 5 ... [ a6 ]  [ B b5 ] , [ a6 ]  a difficult choice. black decides to force white to exchange the bishop for the knight and then trade off his two resulting "c" pawns by ... [ c5 ] and cxd4.
 [ Q f3 ] , [ Q d7 ]  I was prepared to exchange pieces now. I believe my opponent did not see the reason behind [ Q d7 ] back up by the bishop. The Zig Zag motion by my bishop saved me from defeat. Yes white can capture the h pawn but it is bait! Once we exchange pieces we'll have opposite color bishop's
 [ K x h7 ]  [ Q h5 + ] , [ K g8 ]  My opponent spent almost twenty minutes before making this move! Ofcourse there is only one move for black but he wanted to make sure he had analyzed the position correctly after his 18th move!
 [ N g6 ] , [ N x f5 ]  White isn't quite ready to trade rooks yet so capturing with the knight seems best.
 [ Q h1 ] , [ B h2 + ]  And white resigned because of a lost game(forced check mate in 6): 29...[ B h2 ] 30.[ Q x h2 ] [ R x h2 ] 31.[ R d2 ] R[ a x d2 ] 32.[ R f2 ] R[ d x f2 ] 33.[ N x h6 ] [ g x h6 ] 34.[ a x b5 ] [ N x h3 # ] Thanks for the game and Im very happy for comments!
 [ g5 ]  [ K d4 ]  [ g6 ]  [ e4 ]  [ g7 ]  [ e3 ]  [ g8 = Q ]  [ e2 ]  [ Q d5 + ]  [ K e3 ]  [ Q e4 + ]  [ K d2 ]  [ Q d4 + ]  [ K c1 ]  [ Q x h4 ]  [ K d2 ] , [ Q f4 + ]  Well the story is well known. White wins.
 [ d4 ] , [ N x e4 ]  5. [ N x f7 ] [ K x f7 ] 6. [ Q h5 ] [ K f8 ] 7. [ Q f5 + ] [ N f6 ] fails to regain the material although positionally I have an advantage.
 [ R x c8 + ]  [ K x e7 ] , [ g x h7 ]  nothing can stop the promotion and black needs to sacrifice his bishop to prevent the second pawn promoting or the king getting mated
 [ B x d3 ]  [ N e2 ]  [ O-O-O ] , [ f3 ]  Now the computer says that the continuation is 14.[ f4 ] but I disagree with it. First that that allows black to liquidate with 14...ex[ f4 ] when down material. Plus this achieves a solid pawn chain. Remember when I disagreed over pawn structures and said what I would've well this is the kind of thing I was alluding to. Here it's no blunder because it also improves the mobility of my f R which has the pressure of his LSB due to this half pin against my N.
 [ R c3 ]  [ B d7 ] , [ K f2 ]  The King is one of the most valuable tools in the endgame.
 [ e x d4 ]  [ B x d4 ]  [ B x d4 ]  [ Q x d4 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ Q e3 ]  [ N d e5 ] , [ O-O-O ]  ...except for the [ N f1 ] White is all developed and almost ready to chuck pain onto the K side....
 [ N c2 ] , [ K x a5 ]  26. Nc2! is an amazing move. So quiet yet so powerful. White leaves his rook on [ [ a5 ] ] hanging free for black to gobble it up. Sure white gains black's knight on [ e4 ] so black only wins the exchange but there seems no other threat. So I looked deeper. No way my opponent gave up the exchange for nothing. The knight on [ c2 ] attacks [ b4 ] and keeps the black king from using that as an escape route against the checks to come. I quickly realize that white is about to win black's queen and knight for the cost of two rooks and that I have no way out of it. Not taking the rook on [ [ a5 ] ] is worse than taking it.
 [ B x d6 ]  [ c x d6 ] , [ N f3 ]  So I start developing here.
 [ Q h6 ]  [ d3 ] , [ N h5 ]  Black was trying to a breakthrough with 8...Ng3+. According to my opinion it is better not to move the same piece in the opening moves I like 7...[ c6 ] here.
 [ B e2 ]  [ a3 ]  [ b3 ]  [ N c5 ]  [ O-O-O ]  [ R e8 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ c6 ]  [ h4 ]  [ Q a5 ]  [ h5 ]  [ N e6 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ h x g6 ]  [ h x g6 ]  [ K c2 ]  [ N d c5 ]  [ N x e6 ]  [ N x e6 ]  [ N a4 ]  [ Q e5 ] , [ Q x d6 ]  Why not? It seems the logical way to continue. At the moment my knight covers the important [ b2 ] and [ c3 ] squares.
 [ e4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B b4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ c5 ] , [ a3 ]  Starting position for the MT.
 [ Q b6 ]  [ Q b3 ]  [ Q x b3 ] , [ a x b3 ]  Again this is standard
 [ N d5 + ]  [ K e5 ]  [ N x c7 + ]  [ K d6 ] , [ N b5 + ]  Now I run back. The idea is once again "Capitalizing my advantages. I'm coming up with a plan for the endgame and it's similar to the Double Bishop and the N+B mate using those same strategies. For those that were in the Chess Warriors team and took the test that strategy is the same which I posted in the KOH club about the endgames.
 [ R x d4 ]  [ R x d4 ]  [ Q x d4 ]  [ Q x d4 ] , [ c x d4 ]  trades leaves white with an isolated pawn.
 [ Q d2 ] , [ R f d8 ]  Seems so natural and strong preparing ...Bf8. However here is another rule: When you have activity advantage you must be on the lookout every turn for combinations and tactical shots. Activity creates these tactics. ...[ f6 ] was stronger even though it weakens the kingside.
 [ N c3 ] , [ b4 ]  The calculation process is similar. Lets just go with the main line since there is so much. 16.[ f4 ] [ b x c3 ] 17.[ f x e5 ] [ c x b2 ] 18.[ R b1 ] [ N e6 ] 19.[ B x e6 ] [ Q x d1 ] 20.Rexd1(20.[ B x f7 + ] is a real blunder since it loses a piece) [ f x e6 ] 21.[ e x f6 ] [ R c2 ] with some advantage for black. A huge pain to calculate since there are other lines but it NEEDED to be done before playing b4. I could have easily made a mistkae as well. There is only a positional advantage at the end as Well!
 [ B c4 ] , [ B g4 ]  Black breaks the book but his move [ B g4 ] does not seem very good to me. I like playing with my Bishops against his Knights so if he wants to trade I will oblige him. I will continue to develop my pieces in an attempt to gain space.
 [ a3 ]  [ B x c3 + ]  [ b x c3 ]  [ c6 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ] , [ c4 ]  The right move sequence. Pressuring me before I'm ready
 [ Q x f4 ] , [ c x b5 ]  A very last menace in case if black were too confident.
 [ B x c3 ]  [ N x c3 ]  [ b x c3 ] , [ Q x a3 ]  Black has won a piece.
 [ B x d5 + ] , [ K x e2 ]  ? He should have created a passed pawn with [ c x d5 ] and tried to advance it. This also loses a piece.
 [ c4 ] , [ d x c4 ]  2. ........ d x [ [ c4 ] ] (Wayne hits out at my pawn on [ d4 ] with [ [ c4 ] ] - I take it - I did consult the 1900 database and it appeared to have a good win percentage - perhaps this opening is transposing into a QGA - Queens' Gambit Accepted)
 [ N x c4 ]  [ R x c4 ]  [ O-O ]  [ d4 ] , [ a5 ]  17. ... [ c x d4 ] 18. [ R x c7 ] loses the Queen
 [ N b d2 ]  [ R c8 ]  [ Q b3 ] , [ h5 ]  Black actually has two bad bishops in this position and it's hard to see what he can do.
 [ B b7 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ] , [ c5 ]  Going for a pawn exchange but Shakhriyar has other ideas first and completes his development before that happens.
 [ R x d1 ]  [ R x d1 ] , [ B e7 ]  an interesting position I now expected Rd7- [ Q x b4 ] so if [ Q a7 ] then [ Q e1 ] is good.
 [ N d4 ] , [ d3 ]  open my bishop's line
 [ g3 ] , [ N g4 ]  ? Better much better would have been b4! It would have forced my rook to move.
 [ O-O ] , [ b6 ]  Black made this move mainly to avoid any possible captures on [ c5 ] due to the pin on the Queen. This also leaves the possibility to fianchetto his other Bishop to contest White's Bishop on the other long diagonal
 [ c x d4 ]  [ Q b7 ]  [ Q x g4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ h x g3 ]  [ Q g2 ]  [ R x f2 ] , [ R x f2 ]  No I don't see any escape from this.
 [ Q c7 ] , [ R x e7 ]  now he is down by a pawn!
 [ N c5 ]  [ B x c5 ] , [ d x c5 ]  21. ..... [ d x c5 ] - I trade off Fou Lenoir for a reason. Removal of the Guard!
 [ R x c3 + ] , [ K d2 ]  Not [ d4 ] because after c3-[ c4 ] the a pawn can advance freely.
 [ K g2 ] , [ Q d5 ]  My intention here is to offer a queen trade but I forgot about the Bishop. Shit! Blunder number 2.
 [ Q x c4 ]  [ b x c4 ]  [ R d4 ]  [ R d c8 ] , [ a3 ]  To avoid black playing [ d5 ] followed by [ B x b4 ]  [ B f8 ] , [ N d5 ]  I was rather worried about the Black Bishop coming to [ g7 ] with threats along the long dark squared diagonal
 [ g x f6 ]  [ e3 ]  [ f5 ] , [ R a c1 ]  Putting a rook on the half-open file.
 [ K h8 ]  [ h5 ]  [ N f8 ] , [ h6 ]  The barrier of Pawns must now crumble.
 [ K g2 ] , [ N d8 ]  And the attck on [ e4 ] begins unless he is diverting my attention.
 [ R g1 ] , [ R h5 ]  White's N has nowhere to go!
 [ Q x d6 ]  [ b5 ] , [ R h5 + ]  oh my this is bad.
 [ K g6 ] , [ R c8 ]  Now I want to limit his king's space.
 [ N f3 ] , [ N f6 ]  If [ c5 ] after the exchange my d pawn would be free to advance but for piece protection.
 [ Q f4 + ] , [ K h3 ]  ?? In that same message I said Then after 16...[ Q f4 + ] you had two options but played 17.Kh3?? From then on I wasn't going to take right away as mate was unavoidable. The only move that would've kept you in a little longer was 17.Kh1. The idea being as mentioned in the private message is that I will be able to coordinate my Queen and LSB to deliver the mate since they are going to go on the same diagonal. And that will start with the next move. It's also important to note that just before 18.[ g4 ] was played I came a little close to overlooking the mate I have and considered taking the Knight right away. However I saw the way penelope80 mated duke69 in a training game and I am going to apply the same concept. The idea being as noted is to teach chess in it's most complicated form. That's when I realized that I could do the same thing even when he plays 19.[ K g2 ] as opposed to 20.[ K h2 ] as opposed to 20.Kg1.
 [ N c7 ]  [ Q c5 + ]  [ K g3 ]  [ Q x c3 + ]  [ K h2 ] , [ Q c4 ]  I then went [ Q c4 ] so if he did take the Castle I would have his Bishop
 [ Q x f7 ] , [ R x f7 ]  Once Black takes the rook I would still have an 8 point advantage so Black resigned.
 [ d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ h4 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ f3 ]  [ c6 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ b5 ]  [ g4 ] , [ b4 ]  Rather bold but nothing apparently wrong will make castling a bit difficult since the king side is destroyed. [ N e2 ] [ N b1 ] [ N a4 ] g5. [ N a4 ] seems a bit clumsy of a placement but there is really nothing to threaten it. It has the advantage of covering [ c5 ] square. He will probably try a5. [ N e2 ] blocked bishop. [ N b1 ] boy do I hate going back to where I was.
 [ Q x d4 ]  [ Q x d4 ] , [ R d1 ]  ? At this point I am going to kick his Queen because it has caused a lot of damage. However I was not thinking clearly and this turns out to be another mistake because he is going to win my [ g4 ] pawn for free. BTW that was the only pawn connected so this also leaves my [ f5 ] pawn and DSB hanging.
 [ N x c6 ]  [ N x f4 ]  [ N x d8 ]  [ N d3 ] , [ N f6 + ]  After 26…[ g x f6 ] 27.[ R x e8 ] white is up a rook.
 [ e x d4 ]  [ B d5 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ B x f3 + ]  [ N x f3 ] , [ R x d1 ]  ? -- After the game Al pointed out (quite correctly) that this exchange was a mistake quoting a hoary but still true chess axiom "Every exchange helps the defender." The right move was 29. ...Re8.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ f6 ]  This is a very bad move because of the exposed kingside. Why not play nc6?
 [ O-O ]  [ B e2 ]  [ c5 ] , [ R b1 ]  From my point of view we are now moving into the second phase of the game. Up to now I had been playing what I always play in this position but now my moves are guided by the opening databases. Incidentally this variation is officially known as "the modern exchange variation".
 [ B g7 ] , [ B c4 ]  My opponent probobly doesn't know this line and he's just sticking to principles:develop
 [ K e5 ]  [ K b6 ]  [ K e4 ]  [ K x a6 ]  [ K f3 ]  [ K x b5 ]  [ K x g3 ] , [ K a5 ]  A slight inaccuracy but nothing too drastic. The a-pawn is better to be promoted first as there is less chance of a skewer. Should still be a draw.
 [ K x c3 ] , [ B d7 ]  A quiet move planning to bring the final piece into play the rook on a8. However it turned out to be a massive mistake as it left the knight en prise and had white played 16. [ Q x d4 ] I would have been forced into a queen exchange and lost the whole attack.
 [ R e8 ]  [ R a7 + ]  [ K b8 ] , [ R f7 ]  Now [ R h7 ] is met by ...[ R f6 ] but [ R d7 ] is game over -- the d-pawn will fall Black will have to trade Rooks or else lose the h- and b-pawns and White's King can easily shepherd a pawn -- the e-pawn say -- to promotion.
 [ B x c5 ] , [ B b5 + ]  definatly a mistake
 [ N x g3 ]  [ h x g3 ]  [ Q e8 ] , [ c5 ]  Now in this position no one has real winning posibilities. We followed playing only by inertia
 [ b x a5 ]  [ N x e5 ] , [ f x e5 ]  19.[ d x e5 ] give a big black centre. White (oups it's me) doesn't look roomy :-(
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ f3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ g4 ]  [ B g6 ] , [ e4 ]  Alternative variation: 5. [ h4 ] $11
 [ R f1 f3 ]  [ Q g2 + ]  [ R f3 f2 ]  [ Q g4 + ] , [ K d2 ]  [ R f3 ] would have tied one rook up due to a pin.
 [ N b6 ]  [ g3 ]  [ N h6 ]  [ B h3 ] , [ Q g5 ]  This move begins the series of moves that traps the queen
 [ Q e2 + ]  [ K b3 ]  [ Q e3 + ]  [ K a4 ] , [ Q c5 ]  Black returns the serve to my field having secured a mate threat on b4.
 [ d x e3 ]  [ R x d7 ]  [ e2 + ]  [ K g2 ]  [ e x f1 = Q + ]  [ K x f1 ] , [ K x d7 ]  white is down a pawn here
 [ Q g5 ]  [ N x h6 + ]  [ Q x h6 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ B x f5 ]  [ Q x f5 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ Q x d5 ]  [ b6 ]  [ R e5 ]  [ K g7 ] , [ R x h5 ]  
 [ N f5 ]  [ B x f5 ]  [ g x f5 ] , [ K f2 ]  Preventing queen threat due to black bishop's movement+tower threat
 [ Q h4 + ] , [ K g2 ]  the king finds a very good position
 [ N x c3 ] , [ N x f7 ]  double attack rook!!
 [ B d7 ] , [ g4 ]  entombing black's bishops
 [ b4 ]  [ Q x a6 ] , [ B x a6 ]  31. ..... [ B x a6 ] - a forced queen trade to avoid dropping the rook on c3.
 [ d4 ] , [ c x d4 ]  Center pawn for wing pawn.
 [ R x c7 ]  [ R x c7 ] , [ B e7 ]  This pretended to be wise: if [ R c8 + ] Bd8.
 [ K h7 ] , [ f6 ]  Opens the b1-[ h7 ] diagonal for my queen to use. This will also limit the mobility of the black king
 [ f5 ]  [ d x e6 + ]  [ K x e6 ] , [ B f3 ]  You could probably see why I play [ B f3 ] here right? And now this is what I could call a "good game"
 [ B x g5 ]  [ h x g5 ] , [ N x g5 ]  Sacrifice has opened him up
 [ B e6 ]  [ e5 ]  [ O-O-O ] , [ N e4 ]  Jockeying but with an eye on d6.
 [ K f3 ]  [ d2 ] , [ R d1 ]  42. [ R d1 ] - I think this is a big mistake as [ R a1 ] would have prolonged the game and created complications for me. This move loses spectacularly as follows. I now see the finish line and set up conditional moves.
 [ R d3 d6 ]  [ R a2 ] , [ N x f1 ]  31. ........... [ N x f1 ] - bang goes the exchange for white!
 [ N x e7 ]  [ N x e7 ] , [ Q g5 ]  Black resigned at this point as to much is being threatened 26. [ Q x e7 ] [ K c6 ] 27. [ Q c7 ] checkmate! and 26. [ Q x b5 ] [ K d8 ] 27. [ B x d6 ] Which is winning for White. GREAT GAME!! Paul Keres beating Miguel Najdorf and against his own opening LOL! If you rate this 2 or less you must tell me why you have but if you have any feedback then please send me a message! Cheers!
 [ g x h5 ] , [ B x h5 ]  ...and now it will be hard to attack my B.
 [ K f7 ]  [ N x h8 + ]  [ K e6 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ B x c4 ] , [ R d2 ]  Pulling out the rooks white starts to try to end the game.
 [ K e7 ]  [ B x f6 + ] , [ K x f6 ]  An exchange of minor pieces. Black opts to not double his pawns at the expense of further exposing his king (although it should be relatively comfortable for the time being). Black's position is a little ragged but for now he seems to be holding on reasonably well.
 [ d x e5 ]  [ Q x d1 + ]  [ R x d1 ]  [ R a d8 ]  [ R x d8 ]  [ R x d8 ]  [ R x c4 ]  [ R d1 + ]  [ K h2 ]  [ B x e5 + ]  [ g3 ]  [ R d6 ]  [ f4 ]  [ R d2 + ]  [ K g1 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ R x c6 ]  [ K g7 ]  [ c4 ]  [ R d3 ] , [ c5 ]  A good idea but too late.
 [ b4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ] , [ e x d5 ]  normaly i play [ c x d5 ] this time my intuition tel me to take back with [ e6 ] i dont know wy maybe to stay stronger on queen side ?
 [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ] , [ B c4 ]  More typical is 3. [ d4 ] or 3. [ B b5 + ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ a6 ] , [ O-O ]  According to my opening book White has tried no less than 9 different moves here. 7. [ B b3 ] 7. [ B e3 ] and 7. [ B g5 ] are the more standard continuations.
 [ f x g5 ]  [ K g6 ]  [ h4 ]  [ b5 ]  [ K h2 ]  [ b4 ]  [ K g3 ]  [ b3 ]  [ R b1 ]  [ R b6 ]  [ R b2 ] , [ f6 ]  ?! Helping White secure the draw
 [ a x b3 ]  [ B b4 + ]  [ c3 ] , [ a3 ]  44. ...... [ a3 ] - I can capture Freddy's dsb but I will not be able to prevent the Wicked Witch of the West making an appearance and carting off Henry to the Hospitality Quarters of her castle and subjecting him to goodness knows what every night .... I decided to spare Henry those horrors and waved the white flag. I am now playing my 51st game against him and I am hoping to fine tune Operation Joblock!
 [ R a e1 ]  [ Q h7 ]  [ B f3 ] , [ c6 ]  21. ....... [ c6 ] - screening off white's lsb attack on my [ b7 ] pawn and preparing a hidey hole on [ c7 ] for Henry.
 [ b x a4 ]  [ b x c4 ]  [ d x c4 ] , [ N x c4 ]  15. ....... [ N x c4 ] - ...... breaking apart under the strain!

[ Q x e7 ] [Titova Boric E (2215)-Prodanovic S/Pula 1990/EXT 2000/1-0 (32)]
 [ c4 ]  [ f6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ g6 ]  I asked my opponent if he decided to invent an opening
 [ N b8 ]  [ Q c3 + ] , [ K b7 ]  23. ....... Kb7?? He would have been better off interposing with his queen but I would have been very happy to go into an endgame with a 2 pawn plus!! This move loses loses loses!!
 [ Q c8 ]  [ d4 ]  [ h6 ]  [ b3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N b d2 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ B b2 ]  8. [ B b2 ] - at least I have developed a couple of pieces over the last 2 moves and I am now ready to castle but I defer it for a few moves just to see where my opponent decides to move his king.
 [ R f g8 + ]  [ K f4 ] , [ B x d1 ]  ...and paid the price.
 [ R x b7 ] , [ R d8 ]  Now that they took I'm not worried about the threat. Instead I realized that they're going to grab another pawn. When this happens my instincts were to win back a Knight. Of course that quickly changes.
 [ f3 ] , [ Q x h2 ]  12. .............. [ Q x h2 ] - the h pawn drops.
 [ R h f3 + ]  [ K g4 ]  [ R f g3 + ] , [ K h5 ]  Black can choose to go backwards [ K f5 ] [ g6 ] [ c7 ] and the victory would have been slow and uninsteresting. What if... (surprises are coming)
 [ N f3 ] , [ f5 ]  Interesting approach; uncorking the bottle. Probably 26...[ d5 ] Qx[ d5 ] gives better chances for a counter attack.
 [ R d1 ] , [ Q e7 ]  Playing to [ e6 ] wouldn't have been as good now as I would have allowed White time to play both [ R d1 ] and b4. But perhaps it was better than the text. Alternatively if I had played the king to [ h8 ] after the check then a take on [ f5 ] doesn't come with check.
 [ a5 ]  [ g3 ]  [ a4 ] , [ Q x h1 ]  I know this is useless but I want to win some material back if I'm going to lose.
 [ B d3 ] , [ h6 ]  White was threatening a standard sacrifice with [ B x h7 ] and if [ K x h7 ] Ng5ch and Q to [ h5 ] or [ g4 ] depending on how Black plays gives White either a winning attack or if the bishop is declined at least an extra pawn. This does need to be defended against but [ f5 ] or [ f6 ] are more common replies indeed [ h6 ] was not on any of the databases I use. I had to think for myself from now on!
 [ B e6 ]  [ f3 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ N b d7 ]  [ g4 ]  [ h6 ]  [ O-O-O ]  [ b5 ]  [ h4 ]  [ N b6 ]  [ Q f2 ]  [ N f d7 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ B x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ N c4 ]  [ B x c4 ]  [ b x c4 ]  [ N d2 ]  [ c3 ] , [ N c4 ]  ?! better was 18 [ N e4 ] [ c x b2 ] 19 [ K x b2 ] [ R c8 ]  [ c x b2 + ]  [ K b1 ]  [ Q c8 ] , [ N x b2 ]  ?! Much better was 20 [ N a5 ] [ B d8 ] (20... [ Q c7 ] 21 [ N c6 ] [ N b8 ] 22 Nxe7) 21 [ N c6 ] [ N b8 ] 22 [ N x d8 ] [ Q x d8 ]  [ R b8 ] , [ K a1 ]  ?! Better was 21 [ R d3 ] [ Q b7 ] 22 [ c4 ] [ Q c7 ] 23 [ R b3 ] O-O 24 [ g5 ]  [ B d2 ] , [ Q x c2 ]  Better was 23...[ Q c7 ] now White is back in the game.
 [ R x d6 ]  [ Q x d6 ]  [ B x c4 ]  [ B x c4 ]  [ R x c4 ]  [ R x c4 ]  [ b x c4 ] , [ b5 ]  Now it's a pawn race but White's queening square is protected by his Q whereas Black's is not. Furthermore White's Q controls the centre and threatens Black's exposed K whereas White's K is protected by a ring of pawns
 [ e x d5 ]  [ c x d5 ] , [ d6 ]  Stopping Joe's [ d5 ] from advancing further. That pawn is dangerous and in some variations white is threatening to win a piece. By playing this it's blocked therefore preventing damage.
 [ R d b8 ]  [ N x c6 ] , [ R b7 ]  An irritating setback but sets the scene for a beautiful sacrifice and checkmate. Can you see it?
 [ e4 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ N b d2 ] , [ N e7 ]  Black should have taken its chance to go e5.
 [ d4 ] , [ d5 ]  symmetrical
 [ f4 ]  [ e x f4 ] , [ g x f4 ]  Always an interesting decision: [ N x f4 ] or gxf4? I thought that given his central weakness preserving my central strength might pay off.
 [ R x d1 + ]  [ K g2 ]  [ R c1 ] , [ c x b5 ]  No real choice
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ N x e5 ]  So here have we the petroff (petrov's) defence.
 [ a5 ]  [ Q b5 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ Q x b2 ]  [ R b1 ]  [ Q e5 + ]  [ Q e2 ]  [ Q x e2 + ] , [ K x e2 ]  White is a pawn down but won't stay that way and has much greater activity for his pieces now.
 [ B x d7 ] , [ R x d7 ]  I was surprised and pleased with this exchange.
 [ g x f3 ]  [ B x h3 ] , [ N g4 ]  !! Although it allows Rg-[ e7 ] it traps the bishop while threatening e5. White no longer fears the doubled rooks.
 [ h7 ]  [ R h8 ] , [ R f4 ]  I see my chance to take the [ f5 ] pawn.
 [ N d5 ]  [ f5 ] , [ B d3 ]  Now the best move here for black is probably [ B e6 ] (stopping exf5) and starting to work towards getting rid of the strong knight. But I figured my opponent knew this line pretty well and I decided to try my secret weapon!
 [ b4 ]  [ Q b6 ]  [ N a4 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ c4 ]  [ N b6 ]  [ N x b6 ]  [ Q x b6 ] , [ c5 ]  Now I am pretty happy because this close game decrease my opponent's pair of Bishops.
 [ f3 ]  [ R c7 ]  [ a3 ]  [ K h8 ] , [ h3 ]  Perhaps these precautions are unnecessary but White wants to fully secure his position before launching his attack.
 [ K f8 ] , [ b6 ]  Now it is safe to push the pawn. Black is forced to take.
 [ h3 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ N f3 ]  White has restored the order: for now; the White King is in a bad place...
 [ Q f6 ] , [ N e4 ]  Attacking the queen and defending the bishop so [ R a d8 ] is nothing to fear
 [ K h1 ]  [ f5 ] , [ Q a4 ]  [ Q a4 ] ? blocking the a pawn. 0.91 for black
 [ N f3 ] , [ f6 ]  2. ...... [ f6 ] - this move looks rather weak as it opens up the Fool's Mate diagonal and deprives the king knight of his normal square f6. Mind you Master Freddy played it in a game against a player near his own rating so it can't be too bad here! One word of caution is that Freddy did lose that game http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=10328022&mv=7&rnd=0.25780495819961885 but whether that was the losing move is open to debate!
 [ Q x h3 ]  [ B e4 ] , [ e5 ]  [ f5 ] was a somewhat better possibiity
 [ N b5 ]  [ Q c5 ]  [ B e3 ] , [ Q c6 ]  Do you FEEL the attack? The sacrifice? The open file? attack on a uncastled king?
 [ Q x f8 + ]  [ R x f8 ] , [ R f1 ]  Is black willing to exchange her last rook ?
 [ c5 ]  [ d x c5 ] , [ N x c5 ]  ...that one rook is now cut off from the queenside and white never gets anything going over on the queenside the rest of the game. Interestingly enough black's position is rather solid despite being a piece down. Notice I took on [ c5 ] with the knight and not the bishop inviting the next few moves.
 [ K f2 ] , [ a4 ]  ..white resigns as the pawn will romp home The bishops are offside and have no immediate threats for black to deal with...[ B c8 ] covers [ a2 ] with Be6...black can give up the Rook for [ a1 = Q ] if needs be....
 [ N a1 ] , [ K e4 ]  Bringing in the reserves.
 [ B x b5 ] , [ Q g7 ]  The open g-file hasn't done me any harm either!
 [ g5 ]  [ a5 ]  [ g6 ] , [ f x g6 ]  I was worried here that 34.[ h x g6 ] [ h6 ] would block the attack but perhaps better than my actual move would have been to interpose with 34.[ b x a5 ] [ R x a5 ] taking the rook out of the game first.
 [ a x b4 ] , [ a4 ]  A sneaky try. Immediately I play b3. Were white allowed to support that passed pawn such an advantage could prove to be a winning one in an endgame where the black king must travel all the way to the side of the board to stop it. And it would be hard and likely impossible for black to remove such support once it was done. I cannot allow white to play [ b3 ] period.
 [ B b3 ] , [ d5 ]  Black has great control over the center and a better position.
 [ N e7 ]  [ B b5 + ]  [ B d7 ] , [ B x d7 + ]  I get rid of his second Bishop leaving me at an advantage if a two-minor-piece end game arises.
 [ N c3 ] , [ Q d8 ]  I expected Qa5.
 [ Q d1 ] , [ g6 ]  Extra tempo and no real attack yet from white allows me to fiachetto my kingside bishop
 [ f x g5 ] , [ B x g5 ]  Protects White's pawn at [ e7 ] creates a passed pawn on [ f2 ] and isolates Black's pawn at h7.
 [ O-O ] , [ N d2 ]  White attacks my bishop. I was thinking about [ f5 ] but I decided to play it easy.
 [ Q x b5 ] , [ R f7 ]  Now that white is ahead every trade is to his advantage.
 [ B e7 ]  [ N c4 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ O-O ] , [ b5 ]  in the next move the white will play his 5th move with the Knight. just half of the moves he made. a terrible waist of time.
 [ B x f6 ]  [ N x b3 ]  [ B x c3 ] , [ N c5 ]  While a bishop pawn combo is usually good [ N e4 + ] gives black another bishop.
 [ h6 ] , [ Q d3 ]  15. [ Q d3 ] - ssss here's the Wicked Witch of the West and she is eyeing up h7. Soon I fear it will be time for another Deadly Dash for Henry.
 [ b x c3 ] , [ N f6 ]  At this point I still havent been noticed what opportunity my opponent has left me.
 [ R x h1 ]  [ d4 ] , [ R c1 + ]  My first good move in a long time
 [ d5 ] , [ e x d5 ]  And as expected the dreaded exchange variation.
 [ N x e8 + ] , [ K g8 ]  Should have taken the knight since it would have removed a piece and pinned his other knight for a little while.
 [ g6 ] , [ c4 ]  This diversion is way to early. I should figure out how to get a grip on the c-file first if I am going to open it up.
 [ R h3 ]  [ R c8 ] , [ K b1 ]  good idea by white to remove any possible pin threats later in the game but IMHO too passive. Better was to continue with the pawn attack. Maybe you were also interested in protecting a2.
 [ h6 ]  [ N d5 + ] , [ K e6 ]  His mistake but all other moves don't end too well for black anyway.
 [ Q a6 ]  [ N d4 ] , [ e6 ]  16. ...[ e6 ] shuts down white's knights.
 [ d5 ]  [ R g6 ]  [ B e7 + ]  [ K g8 ] , [ g3 ]  Black is busted of course.
 [ B b7 ]  [ O-O ] , [ B e7 ]  I would be aiming for [ a6 ] followed by [ c5 ] trying to open up the diagonal for my LSB while trying to break up the centre. White would be trying to play followed by [ e5 ] or d5.
 [ N f3 ]  [ b5 ] , [ a3 ]  This doesn't achieve anything and better would have been [ B e3 ] or [ B f4 ] following up with Nbd2. Then at a later stage you could perhaps have played a4.
 [ Q f4 + ]  [ Q x f4 ] , [ N x f4 ]  my king is better place so I thought it compensates the lack of a pwan.
 [ a3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ e5 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ N g5 ] , [ N d5 ]  A terrible miscalculation. My opponent missed the strong strong attack that follows the trades.
 [ g4 ] , [ N h4 ]  Finger in the dyke time!
 [ N c3 ] , [ b5 ]  Completing the cage.
 [ b5 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ Q e2 ]  [ b4 ] , [ B b5 ]  I have a piece more so I go on exchanges.
 [ a5 ] , [ R b1 # ]  0-1
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ b3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ B b2 ] , [ B f5 ]  This is the first time I have had someone play a London-type system against my opening.
 [ R g8 ] , [ f4 ]  This move comes too late. I have no qualms over exchanging pieces now.
 [ g6 ] , [ R x f4 ]  Now he threatens to checkmate me. (He's a really good player.)
 [ R d3 ]  [ N f5 ]  [ R c5 ]  [ N d4 ] , [ B d1 ]  35.[ B a5 ] better. after ...[ R a7 ] [ B b2 ] the d button does not fall immediately.
 [ B e6 ] , [ N x f6 + ]  ?? what's the rush? white has a good center. playing [ d3 ] with [ N d2 ] and [ f4 ] is a fine plan.
 [ Q x e5 + ] , [ Q e7 ]  Ouch. Here I would choose Be7.
 [ Q x c5 ]  [ Q a4 + ]  [ B d7 ]  [ Q b3 ] , [ f5 ]  allows knight where i want it
 [ O-O ]  [ N x e3 ]  [ Q x e3 ] , [ O-O ]  White has a slight lead in development so... It's time to open the position.
 [ R a b1 ]  [ B g7 ] , [ B d6 ]  i didnt want to take the bishop because the bishop is part of my plan
 [ b3 ] , [ B e4 ]  Now a breath. This "osè" move and I have space to move my king to b7. More than that I prevent his Qe5! It was a good moment to get the dsb out of it initial square? Maybe but after [ B e6 ] I had to retreat it. And I insist I didn't want to passively play it on e7. On [ g7 ] maybe. But it will be aiming to an empty diagonal...
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ f4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ e x f4 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ Q x d5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ Q d8 ]  [ d4 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ Q e2 + ]  [ Q e7 ]  [ Q x e7 + ]  [ B x e7 ]  [ B x f4 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B x c7 ] , [ N c6 ]  [ N c6 ] looks natural however the best move here is Bf5.
 [ N c6 ]  [ a3 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ B a2 ]  [ g5 ] , [ N f3 ]  [ N x f3 ] could save the undefended pawn.
 [ B a3 ] , [ d6 ]  The only move.
 [ K d1 ] , [ Q e2 # ]  but so was this :-)
 [ R h4 ]  [ h5 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ N g6 ]  [ R h1 ]  [ B x f3 ]  [ g x f3 ]  [ c5 ]  [ d x c6 ]  [ e ] , [ p ]  I do like en passant. Unless there is another more potent move I'll always take it. I find it often unsettles people more psychological warfare than anything.
 [ Q g6 ]  [ Q e8 ]  [ Q x e8 ] , [ R a x e8 ]  from now a an endgame is developed where i'm +1
 [ O-O ] , [ d6 ]  At this point he is planning to pin my knight with 5...[ B g4 ] but it does not matter. If 5...Bg4?! 6.Be2! breaking the pin immediately. As I had noted earlier this is where I begin to get aggressive. Therefore I am going to attack his [ e5 ] pawn and force an exchange. Why? In one of my previous annotations Expert inadowman noted that [ d4 ] is best in this position. I believe this is a different exchange variation. If I am correct an exchange variation has more transpositions then any other variations because an exchange variation=a position where multiple exchanges occur.
 [ B x b3 ] , [ a x b3 ]  Now he can't stop me promoting the question is - can I stop him?
 [ a x b3 ] , [ f6 ]  19. ...[ f6 ] Maybe 19. ...[ R c7 ] would have anticipate the Rook battery.
 [ Q e3 ]  [ R x d3 ]  [ Q x d3 ] , [ B x e5 ]  Black is winning. The active bishops and dark-square control are more than enough compensation for the exchange.
 [ B a5 ] , [ d x e5 ]  Well I guess I could do that.
 [ B x h7 ]  [ R e6 + ]  [ K d7 ]  [ R h6 ]  [ B e4 ]  [ R h4 ]  [ K d6 ]  [ R h6 + ]  [ K e5 ]  [ R h8 ] , [ R d2 ]  The best chance to push the White's King aside.
 [ N d4 ]  [ B x b7 ] , [ Q x b7 ]  19. ..... [ Q x b7 ] - now more wood disappears from the board - white's chances of counterplay are being reduced further.
 [ N d7 ] , [ R d2 ]  preparing to double the rooks on d-file adding more pressure on white.
 [ B f2 ]  [ B e4 ]  [ R c1 ]  [ R b2 ] , [ K g1 ]  I had not spotted 39...[ K h7 ] which makes 39. [ K g3 ] unviable. However I was going for the win (I refused a draw offer certainly within the last couple of moves) and thought that it would simply lead to a draw by repetition or my king getting trapped on [ h5 ] and mated.
 [ h3 ] , [ B c6 ]  The white bishop is the supreme unit on the battlefield and the h1-[ a8 ] diagonal is his turf. This bishop is a 19-point bishop. He's a bishop so he's worth three points. He also guarantees the white pawn's promotion that's an 8 point gain for white and he denies the black pawn's promotion preventing an 8 point gain for black. 3+8+8 = 19 hence a 19-point bishop.
 [ b4 ]  [ Q a4 + ]  [ K d2 ]  [ N g4 ] , [ Q x a4 ]  THAT probably caught him off guard.
 [ R c1 ]  [ K g7 ] , [ B d2 ]  The problem of weak pawns: too many to defend even for the bishop pair.
 [ B b4 ] , [ O-O ]  Castling gives black Pe4. Maybe Qc2?
 [ N e4 + ]  [ K g1 ] , [ Q d6 ]  I was trying to prevent [ N b4 ] and keep the Queens on the board. Also I'm preparing to bring the rooks into play.
 [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ B b5 ] , [ B e7 ]  black shouldn't mind changing the bishop for the knight on c6. with a strong center and a pair of bishops in an open game it is clearly that he is on the upper hand.
 [ d6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ a6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ b5 ]  [ B d5 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ a3 ]  [ R b8 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ g5 ]  [ Q d2 ] , [ f5 ]  Attempt to challenge bishop aggressively at possible cost of pawn but also likely it blocks off defense of knight.
 [ Q e6 ]  [ B d4 ]  [ h6 ] , [ K g1 ]  positional play right now.
 [ B f6 ]  [ e5 ]  [ Q x f3 ]  [ g x f3 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ K g2 ] , [ B a6 ]  Alternative variation: 22... [ R a2 ] $5 [and Black can already relax] 23. [ N d6 ] [ B c6 ] 24. [ c4 ] $19
 [ R x d8 ]  [ Q x a4 ] , [ R d2 ]  [Despite being a whole queen in arrears Black is winning here]
 [ R f e8 ]  [ R f d1 ] , [ Q e7 ]  This was the losing move. My opponent joked after my next move "just wanted to make sure you were paying attention." Well I was.
 [ N x b5 ]  [ Q x b5 ]  [ R c1 + ]  [ K g2 ]  [ Q c2 ] , [ Q c5 + ]  ! trading queens and getting closer to victory.
 [ B x a2 ] , [ R e5 ]  No fear of [ Q a1 + ] but I have to protect my bishop on f5...or do I?
 [ Q e7 ] , [ N x h8 ]  7. [ N x h8 ] - Ion's greedy knight gobbles up nuntar's rook but this could be a costly loss of tempo.
 [ R x h6 + ]  [ K c5 ] , [ R a6 ]  Targeting the a-pawn next which also cannot be defended.
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ B c4 ] , [ B g7 ]  I played this to get into less known territories than the Yugoslav attack which in some lines is 20 moves long. I don't really want to get into a theory debate with my opponent.
 [ R b8 ]  [ b x c8 = Q ]  [ Q x c8 ] , [ Q d5 ]  ?? For what purpose? [ Q c2 ] and [ Q c4 ] were on the path of winning the game
 [ K e2 ] , [ Q x b5 ]  Black is now up by a bishop and a knight.
 [ B x c7 ]  [ B x h8 ]  [ K f7 ] , [ B e5 ]  Now ahead in material but lacking badly in activity White needs to open lines so he offers a trade and a pawn as a poisoned incentive...
 [ d x e4 ]  [ f x e4 ] , [ N x e4 ]  Black went up a pawn and white is freaking out. The middle files are open and that is VERY dangerous when black's rooks are close to taking charge on the files.
 [ f x e5 ]  [ N x e5 ] , [ N x a4 ]  Despite being up a pawn I need to get my rooks into the game.
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ c4 ]  [ c6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ e3 ]  [ N b d7 ]  [ B d3 ] , [ B d6 ]  i would continue with development if i was playing white with the simple 7.0-0 not 7.[ c5 ] as played next by white.
 [ K h2 ]  [ K e3 ]  [ K x h3 ]  [ K x d4 ]  [ K g3 ]  [ K c3 ]  [ K f3 ]  [ K x b3 ]  [ K e3 ]  [ c5 ]  [ K d3 ]  [ c4 + ]  [ K d2 ]  [ K b2 ]  [ K e3 ]  [ c3 ]  [ K d3 ] , [ c2 ]  From this position white respectfully resigns.
 [ N e7 ]  [ c4 ]  [ d6 ]  [ Q d3 ]  [ N c5 ]  [ Q c3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B e2 ]  [ B g4 ] , [ O-O ]  White has more space.
 [ O-O ] , [ Q g3 ]  Instead of castling or bringing the [ a3 ] knight back into play white makes another bad queen move. [ B h6 ] is easily met with Bf6.
 [ R x d5 ] , [ R x d5 ]  19. Rxd5?? - I now dig myself deeper into the mire. It is only after I took on [ d5 ] and pressed the submit button that I saw the deadly [ N f2 ] threatening a discovery. Here are two variations that lose - anything else and Glenda drops. Variation A 19. Rx[ d5 ] [ N x f2 ] 20. [ Q e2 ] [ N d3 + ] 21. [ K h1 ] [ N x c1 ] 22. [ Q d1 ] Nx[ d5 ] 23. Qxc1. Variation B 19. Rx[ d5 ] [ N x f2 ] 20. [ R x d6 ] [ N h3 + ] 21. [ K h1 ] [ Q g1 + ] 22. [ N x g1 ] Nf2#. Yup this is where Henry is buried Six Feet Under a brilliant Smothered Mate. After this analysis due to my opponent's OPTIMUM RATING I knew that she would not miss that so I waved the white flag. I hope I can put up a better show against her as black.
 [ R c e8 ] , [ B b5 ]  Indeed the reply was rook again to e8. I was going to play [ B b5 ] again but wondered whether I should wait a move before offering the draw. Perhaps now she would move the rook to a less active location? So I made the move but not the offer although it looked like there might just be one more move. If she replied [ R e c8 ] I'd reply [ B a6 ] and suggest the truce.
 [ K f6 ] , [ N d2 ]  55 - [ N d4 ] loses to 56.[ h5 ] - [ K g8 ] 57.[ B d3 ] - [ N e6 ] 58.h6.
 [ K c4 ]  [ K f6 ] , [ K d4 ]  Seeing that the obvious 44. [ K b5 ] fails to make any progress (and also allows Black to gain more space with ...e5) the White king changes direction. Over optimistically I took this as a sign that White might not have a clear winning plan.
 [ R d8 ]  [ c5 ]  [ R x h2 ]  [ R e3 + ]  [ K d5 ]  [ R e5 + ]  [ K c6 ]  [ R e7 ]  [ h5 ] , [ B x h2 ]  I took advantage of this mistake here...
 [ Q f6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ d4 ] , [ e x d4 ]  This move is not found in the database. Not sure why--it seems like a good one.
 [ Q x e5 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ Q e7 ]  Well I get my queen out but I need to develop fast.
 [ N f6 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ N g5 ]  [ O-O ] , [ B x f7 + ]  ?? This sacrifices a bishop for a pawn!
 [ N d5 ] , [ Q b7 ]  Preventing Ne7.
 [ B d3 ] , [ a6 ]  12. ..... [ a6 ] - preventing further encroachment of a white piece on b5.
 [ O-O ] , [ B f3 ]  This was because I thought [ N g4 ] is a thread
 [ B x a6 ]  [ N e7 ]  [ h4 ]  [ Q f6 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ N b6 ]  [ K d8 ]  [ N x d7 ]  [ Q g6 ]  [ Q x g6 ]  [ h x g6 ]  [ d x c5 ]  [ B c7 ]  [ b3 ]  [ R h5 ]  [ B b2 ]  [ f6 ]  [ g4 ]  [ R h8 ]  [ N x f6 ]  [ R f8 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ R f7 ]  [ f4 ]  [ B b8 ]  [ c6 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ K c8 ]  [ B x g6 ]  [ R a7 ]  [ B d4 ]  [ R a6 ]  [ B f5 + ]  [ K b8 ]  [ R c1 ]  [ B c7 ]  [ N x c7 ]  [ K x c7 ] , [ B e5 + ]  
 [ R h b8 ] , [ R x b8 ]  No time to think but [ R c7 ] seemed just to help him after Be5.
 [ h4 ]  [ h3 ] , [ N d7 ]  He completes his minor piece development but I have all my pieces off their home square.
 [ K d2 ]  [ N c4 + ]  [ K c1 ]  [ Q b2 + ]  [ K d1 ] , [ Q d2 # ]  Thanks for reading any constructive comments would be greatly appreciated
 [ K x g7 ] , [ N g5 ]  At this point I thought that I had the game won. I thought that I had seen every move that he could make and I thought it was over. No matter what he moved I could easily see a forced mate if he moves his king anywhere I have forced mate and I thought that no matter what piece he moved he couldn't stop the attack but I was so into the game that I had missed a simple move.
 [ B x e7 ]  [ Q x e7 ]  [ N x d5 ] , [ B x d5 ]  So it's not closed.
 [ R f b8 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ a5 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ N h5 ]  [ B g5 ] , [ h4 ]  At this point [ Q g3 ] immediately might have been better. That pawn at [ h4 ] was a thorn in my side later.
 [ R x d7 + ]  [ N x d7 ] , [ N c4 ]  Protects [ d6 ] and creates the possibility of [ N e5 ] trying to queen still.
 [ B h5 ] , [ B g5 ]  Pinning the knight.
 [ R f6 ]  [ d6 ] , [ Q g4 ]  Trying to remove the Knight
 [ K c1 ]  [ K c3 ]  [ K d1 ] , [ d2 ]  47. ......... [ d2 ] - this brings about a white flag from my opponent as he is now deep in Zuggieland! He has only 2 legal moves left [ g4 ] which is scuicide as either f or h pawn can simply take it and waltz through to queen or [ K e2 ] allowing [ K c2 ] and on the next turn kaboom Glenda reappears! I am so relieved at the outcome of this game as I thought I was in a lot of trouble in the middlegame with a cramped position. I still have a tendency to play passively which I am trying to correct but all the same my rating is now 1698 which is now the highest it has ever been on gameknot and I only need one more win or high draw to push me over the 1700 frontier!
 [ N b d7 ]  [ c6 ] , [ B x b4 ]  Good move. White won't get the pawn back easily.
 [ B d1 + ]  [ K g5 ]  [ h4 + ]  [ K f4 ] , [ g3 # ]  Nice win when for a moment is looked anything but !!
 [ N f4 ]  [ B x f4 ] , [ e x f4 ]  16. .... [ e x f4 ] - this minor piece trade doubles up black's kingside pawns. Maybe black is trying to play for an endgame with opposite colour bishops and earn a possible draw. Hmm.
 [ B b7 ] , [ O-O ]  Completing the K-side development.
 [ e5 ] , [ N f3 ]  Hoping for [ N c6 ] 3.[ d4 ] with a scotch.
 [ K e6 ]  [ R d5 ]  [ R a2 + ] , [ R d2 ]  I can afford to block with an advantage of a bishop...
 [ R d5 ]  [ Q e3 + ]  [ K h1 ] , [ g4 ]  I am finally getting the chance to start really closing in on his King.
 [ B x d2 ]  [ B x d2 + ]  [ Q x d2 ]  [ N c5 ]  [ Q d4 ]  [ a5 ]  [ R d1 ] , [ N f e4 ]  mistake probably but i had a good reason at the moment just didn't think about his bishop moving to [ g2 ]  [ f x e4 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ B g2 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ N b5 ]  [ N c5 ]  [ B x b7 ]  [ N x b7 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ R x e2 ]  i don't really know why i did that i guess it was just to mess him up. But when i did it i realized i should have done [ c5 ] or [ c6 ] instead
 [ R d2 ] , [ B x e4 ]  The knight was defending the [ d2 ] square.It appears that white has lost a piece.on 19.[ d4 ] black would have played ex[ d4 ] attacking the knight on e4.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ] , [ d3 ]  why playing that passive as white?
 [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ g6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ e4 ]  [ d6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B e2 ]  [ e5 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N c6 ]  [ d5 ] , [ N e7 ]  This is the main line. Now White has various options.
 [ e6 ]  [ d4 ] , [ d5 ]  Opening possition from the tourney.
 [ R a c8 ] , [ R a c1 ]  Both sides bring rooks the ever important c file.
 [ b5 ] , [ B e2 ]  11. [ B e2 ] - to prepare a check on [ h5 ] to stop black from castling. In retrospect I am wondering whether [ N d2 ] was better at this point then if black plays [ f4 ] then Nb3.
 [ b5 ] , [ B b3 ]  bishop in the place to control a2-[ g8 ] and prepared to b1-[ h6 ] which is powerful attack to the king side
 [ R b1 ] , [ R c c1 ]  Again forced.
 [ N x g5 ] , [ N e7 ]  going to defend with [ N f5 ] if White bishop does not take [ e3 ]  [ B x e3 ] , [ N f5 ]  White should keep bishop defending [ d4 ] and White wins easily
 [ Q c2 ] , [ a6 ]  Wanting to gain more space on the queenside with [ b5 ] but...
 [ R f e1 ] , [ h6 ]  Black sees fit to finally give his king luft. 28...[ R x e1 ] and 28...[ R x d2 ] both fail to back rank mates! After mostly reacting to Black at this point I feel like I have an initiative. But how to use it?
 [ b5 ] , [ a5 ]  pawns are frozen but more importantly he is in zugzwang. my goal once he started moving those pawns. remember to count the moves out. zugzwang sucks especially for the opponent.
 [ R g2 ]  [ Q h5 ]  [ K g1 ] , [ R x h4 ]  A little unfortunate as I realize I probably miss played and couldn't add to my advantage. White now has the choice of whether he wants to go 2 rooks vs. a queen or exchange of the queens and a rook.
 [ N e3 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ e x f6 ]  [ R x f6 ] , [ N g5 ]  White tries to attack the base of Black's pawn chain at e6.
 [ B x f6 ]  [ b5 ] , [ R g d1 ]  (W) Not sure the point of that. I kind of like 18. Pa5. NxP[ a5 ] [ B [ e7 ] ] forks the black queen and rook. Can't fork wile [ N c6 ] is guarding [ e7 ] though. [ R g4 ] is another move with promise. White would dearly love to move [ Q h6 ] but cannot while Q[ x B f6 ] (the queen is the only piece covering white's black bishop).
 [ B a4 ] , [ N e5 ]  Loses a piece [ B e2 ] would have been better. 23.... Be2; 24.[ B x d7 ] Rxc3+; 25.bxc3; Nxd7; 26.[ R e2 ] Bc4; white has won material.
 [ R g1 ]  [ R f3 ]  [ K d2 ] , [ R h3 ]  30...[ R f3 ] like i thought 31.Kd2... [ R h3 ]  [ R g5 ]  [ K f3 ]  [ R g3 + ]  [ K e4 ]  [ R g4 + ]  [ K d5 ] , [ R g3 ]  36...[ R g5 ] 37.Kf3... [ R g3 ] 38.Ke4... [ R g4 ] 39.Kd5... [ R g3 ] and he tries to catch [ d3 ] pawn but i try to catch b pawn too so....
 [ N h3 ] , [ N h6 ]  Las negras amenazan ganar material: Ch6[ x g4 ] Alternative variation: 15... [ b5 ] $17
 [ K f3 ] , [ K g8 ]  safety first
 [ Q g4 ] , [ R d2 ]  Do you notice that in a way I've got like three of his pieces pinned. I already mentioned the pawn on [ h2 ] but also his bishop. If the bishop moves I get the pawn on a2. And if the bishop's pinned then so's the rook. Even if I don't know what all I'll do yet I know I have more options than he does.
 [ N c6 ]  [ R f1 ] , [ B d4 ]  principle of fear- In positions that are messy and complicated we should not feel scared(We will but we should not let thaat affect our moves). Just always use your calculation and thought process in those positions and always try to make attacks if you can. Making attacks will scare your opponent who may blunder.
 [ R x g2 ]  [ R b8 + ]  [ R g8 ]  [ R b b7 ]  [ R g1 + ]  [ K b2 ]  [ R d6 ]  [ R f x h7 + ]  [ K g8 ]  [ R h e7 ]  [ K f8 ]  [ R x e5 ]  [ R d2 ]  [ R c5 ]  [ R d8 ]  [ R a5 ]  [ R c8 ] , [ R a x a7 ]  White has managed to pick up all the black pawns but black keep on fighting
 [ B x e3 + ]  [ R x e3 ] , [ Q h4 ]  a day went by and i forgot that plan. :(
 [ B x f4 ] , [ Q x f4 ]  Now a huge amount of pressure is exerted on the e-file white is clearly in a difficult position.
 [ Q x c3 + ]  [ K e2 ] , [ R x e7 + ]  Taking advantage of his weaknesses. And no matter where he goes I will win that N.
 [ N g1 ] , [ Q h4 + ]  14..... [ Q h4 + ] - ..... for Glenda! This is not where Glenda usually resides sadly this unfamiliar territory proves to be her undoing later on.
 [ a6 ] , [ B c4 ]  attack on the undefended [ f7 ] pawn
 [ R x c4 ]  [ B b3 ]  [ R x e4 ]  [ d6 + ]  [ K f6 ] , [ R c3 c7 ]  Also to consider [ R f3 ]  [ R c5 ]  [ R c1 x c5 ]  [ R e1 + ]  [ K g2 ]  [ B f1 + ]  [ K f3 ]  [ b x c5 ] , [ R x c5 ]  [ R x d7 ] or [ R x a7 ] would be faced by c4. I'm not sure who is better in any case.
 [ b3 ] , [ N b6 ]  ?! After the game I said that I thought this was the decisive mistake. Now I can get the Black king into the free. Better was 21...[ N a5 ] which can eventually be followed by 21...[ N c6 ] bringing the knight back into the game (didn't I say that 20...[ N c6 ] was better last move?). 21...[ N a3 ] is not good either because of 22.[ d x c5 ] [ d x c5 ] 23.Qf2! with the threat of 23.[ c4 ] when the knight will be caught with 24.[ Q b2 ] as well as the threat of 23.[ Q x c5 ] winning a pawn.
 [ f x e6 ]  [ O-O-O ]  [ e5 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ N x f6 + ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ Q h5 + ]  [ K d7 ]  [ Q g4 + ]  [ K e7 ]  [ h4 ]  [ Q d7 ]  [ Q f3 ]  [ R h f8 ] , [ Q e2 ]  What would be a half way cool move for black here would be [ Q a4 ] which attacks two different undefended pawns (P[ e4 ] & Pa2). White must choose which one to save.
 [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ e5 ]  The signature move of the Sveshnikov Sicillian
 [ Q x g7 ] , [ N e7 ]  Unfortunately for Black the only way to keep his rook is to sac his knight.
 [ f5 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ K g7 ]  [ g4 ]  [ e3 ] , [ R g1 ]  White acknowledges the exposed threat.
 [ B e6 ] , [ B c4 ]  Now he is looking to exchange so I will make that exchange as this benefits my position.
 [ N x e5 ]  [ B x e5 ]  [ f x e5 ]  [ Q x e5 ]  [ N d2 ]  [ R f8 ]  [ R x f8 + ]  [ K x f8 ]  [ R f1 + ]  [ K e7 ]  [ R e1 ] , [ a5 ]  As did that expected Q-[ g3 ] tbh.
 [ c x d4 ] , [ Q c8 ]  [ Q e8 ] but after [ N x c7 ] [ Q h5 ] and black attacks. Now note that [ e5 ] is followed by BxR and I'm not sure my attack will overwhelm him up to that point.
 [ d5 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ c6 ]  Ken wants to exchange pawns. The bad part is that I don't have the patience yet as this was played before that important. So I only did a little research to figure out if the exchange benefits me. In other words what do I get? After only a few seconds to a minute I decide that it's worth it. For the idea is attempting to break through. Now looking at a little more I don't there's much to get from this exchange. Therefore when I see something like this I will delay it and let him take first. As I see something that might have been a little more beneficial had I allowed ...[ c x d5 ] for after [ e x d5 ] there's something about white's d pawn that appears to be stronger. Thus at the very least another move like 6.[ B g5 ] ought to have been considered and in a situation like this it will be next time.
 [ R x d2 ]  [ Q g5 ]  [ h4 ]  [ Q e7 ] , [ Q d4 + ]  There is no good place to hide.
 [ N g3 ] , [ e5 ]  This unduly concedes f5. The Black must call the far-away forces to the king-side: 17. … [ R b e8 ] 18. [ Q h6 ] Qf7. The [ c4 ] pawn and the black bishop are laughable.
 [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ a6 ] , [ B a4 ]  [ B a4 ] refuses the straight exchange.
 [ d4 ]  [ B x c4 ] , [ d x e5 ]  Even trade but white comes out ahead with a fork
 [ K g4 ]  [ N h4 ]  [ N c6 + ] , [ K x b6 ]  ...and again...
 [ c3 ] , [ f x e4 ]  I move my pawn to [ d3 ] supporting my [ d4 ] pawn and black captures my pawn at [ e4 ] and attacking my LB.
 [ K c6 ] , [ Q c4 + ]  King is now trapped but his Knight can come to his rescue here briefly..
 [ N c6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ O-O ] , [ a6 ]  asking the question
 [ e x f6 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ d x c5 ]  [ B x c3 + ] , [ b x c3 ]  White's pawn structure is ruined and he's down in material. It SHOULD be a sinch to win this but being a teenager I do something dumb and impulsive that allows Mr. Clark to get back into the game.
 [ c8 = Q ] , [ R a3 + ]  Attempting to slow down the inevitable.
 [ e5 ]  [ B g3 ] , [ f6 ]  a very peculiar move...
 [ N c4 ]  [ B x c4 ]  [ d x c4 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ B g4 ]  This is where I feel the loss of my white bishop.
 [ N g6 ] , [ B a3 ]  My bishop was not doing much on [ c1 ] and I wanted to be in a position to play [ b5 ] and have the ability to potentially make a recapture on [ c5 ] with something other than my knight so that he would still be free to drop back to [ f2 ] if needed
 [ Q x d5 ] , [ N c3 ]  Forcing the queen out of the center.
 [ O-O ] , [ O-O-O ]  Everything went according to my plan.
 [ B e6 ] , [ Q b5 ]  threatening [ b7 ]  [ R a c8 ] , [ N d2 ]  I try and bring my knight to attack the pawns
 [ B x b5 ]  [ c x b5 ] , [ R c7 ]  Even now I don't have a clear attack. I think I should have just exchanged as many rooks I could and play with the queen over b6. I'm not sure I played for that really.
 [ N f6 ] , [ e3 ]  Reinforcing the center once more.
 [ B x c3 ]  [ d x e6 ]  [ B x e1 ]  [ Q h8 + ]  [ K e7 ]  [ Q x g7 ]  [ B x f2 + ]  [ K x f2 ]  [ K x e6 ] , [ B f5 + ]  The bishop invites the king out to play.
 [ Q x g7 ]  [ R a g8 ] , [ Q h6 ]  i think [ Q d4 ] was better here although black can't claim any compensation after the text move
 [ N x e5 ]  [ g4 ] , [ f x g4 ]  Now my pawn will go over and promote. Easy as that.
 [ h4 ]  [ B h2 ] , [ Q a1 ]  I never understood this move. It is a mistake because I win a pawn (the c-pawn is unprotected). Every move your opponent makes leaves something behind and when you are attacking or counterattacking you need to find your opponents weaknesses and act on them.
 [ d x c5 ]  [ Q a5 + ]  [ N c3 ] , [ d x c5 ]  According to Houdini White already has a full point advantage. Alternative variation: 4... [ Q x c5 ] 5. [ B e3 ] [ Q a5 ] [Is slightly better.]
 [ N x h5 ] , [ R x h5 ]  without thinking it twice.
 [ B x a5 ]  [ R f1 + ]  [ B e1 ] , [ R x e1 # ]  And the game comes to an end hope you enjoyed.
 [ f4 ] , [ Q b6 ]  Aiming at the two weak points in White's position: [ b2 ] and especially d4. The White queen once again has to take up guard duties.
 [ c6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d5 ] , [ e5 ]  White pushs with intent of staking more space in the center baring in mind the risk of over-extension.
 [ R d2 ] , [ Q x a3 ]  My king is now shielded so I have to activate my other rook and the queen. The material is... EVEN!
 [ c4 ]  [ N e7 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N d7 ]  [ Q c2 ]  [ O-O ]  [ R a c1 ]  [ h6 ]  [ h3 ] , [ e5 ]  Black has finally prepared e5.
 [ N f5 ]  [ N x f5 ]  [ g x f5 ] , [ R d2 ]  Preparing to triple...
 [ f4 ]  [ N g6 ] , [ a3 ]  Trying to send both knights into uncomfortable positions.
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ c4 ]  [ d x c4 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ e3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ B x c4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ Q a4 + ]  [ B d7 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ a3 ]  [ a6 ]  [ B x d7 + ]  [ Q x d7 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ Q x d7 + ]  [ N x d7 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ K e2 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ f4 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ b4 ]  [ B f6 ]  [ B b2 ]  [ N b6 ]  [ R a c1 ]  [ N c4 ]  [ R c2 ]  [ O-O ]  [ K f2 ]  [ R f e8 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ R a c8 ]  [ B c1 ]  [ g6 ]  [ g3 ]  [ R e4 ]  [ N b3 ]  [ b6 ]  [ a4 ]  [ N d6 ]  [ R x c8 + ]  [ N x c8 ]  [ B d2 ]  [ N d6 ]  [ a5 ]  [ b x a5 ]  [ N x a5 ]  [ d4 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ d x e3 + ]  [ R x e3 ]  [ R x e3 ]  [ B x e3 ]  [ N c4 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ N d2 ]  [ N b8 ]  [ N e4 + ]  [ K f3 ]  [ N d2 + ]  [ K e2 ]  [ N b3 ]  [ N x a6 ]  [ N x c5 ]  [ N x c5 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ K d3 ]  [ K f8 ]  [ K c4 ]  [ K e8 ]  [ b5 ]  [ K d8 ]  [ K d5 ]  [ K c7 ]  [ N b3 ]  [ K b6 ]  [ K c4 ]  [ h6 ]  [ h3 ]  [ f5 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ N e6 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ g4 ]  [ f x g4 ]  [ h x g4 ] , [ h5 ]  Key decision: [ f5 ] not pxh5.
 [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ a6 ]  thewrongreason: What I now have here is what Jack made me memorize. But he didn't mention anything else after this position from the first 6 moves. I guess I still base it on concepts but I'm sure that there's a lot more to the Nadjorf then just this. bhidragon: There is indeed much more to the Najdorf than this lol. I’m going to try to develop a concept here that is simply something I’ve come to realize over the years and it all boils down to this: How do you rationalize the move 5. ... [ [ [ a6 ] ] ] in the Sicilian Najdorf. Truth be told my computer melted down two days ago (thanks for the crappy update Microsoft) and I’m having to type on my iPad which I absolutely hate to do. So if it’s OK with you I’m going to hold that discussion till my new desktop gets delivered. I’ll slow down the play of this game a bit (within the 3-day time limit of course) so we don’t have to make too many “not discussed” moves. thewrongreason: That's fine. There is one question when you ask about rationalizing do you mean why is it played? Or is it about what concept goes into it? bhidragon: By rationalize I mean how can you argue that this is a good move. So I think both of your definitions are somewhat accurate thewrongreason: Makes perfect sense. What I like about 5...[ [ [ a6 ] ] ] is that it prevents 6.[ N b5 ] (which I wouldn't be too worried about) or 6.Bb5+. But I would not want to be placed in check there even if it's a mere nuisance. And the reason why is because even if I don't move my K where I'd be able to castle one of the pieces would be directly pinned. Even if the pin isn't of concern I don't enjoy having my pieces tied down like that. 5...[ [ [ a6 ] ] ] puts a stop to that. bhidragon: Avoiding the pin is one of the major reasons for a6. Others are more subtle.
 [ B x f6 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ Q x f6 ]  [ Q x f6 ]  [ R x f6 ]  [ R a d8 ]  [ g4 ] , [ d5 ]  19. ........ d5??? After a plethora of exchanges the rook has camped out onto f6. I should have played [ R e8 ] - [ d6 ] (although perhaps my opponent may well have doubled on the e file - if so then it would have been a good idea to move the [ d8 ] rook to [ d7 ] to back up the f pawn) then try to exchange off the backward pawn. Now folks here comes a lost endgame!!
 [ h6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ h5 ]  [ B h7 ]  [ c4 ] , [ e6 ]  9. ...... e6- I now open up Fou Lenoir's diagonal white has an imposing pawn centre already.
 [ K x f1 ] , [ R x d2 ]  And the bishop is gone but the trouble is still not over.
 [ N x b6 ] , [ a x b6 ]  Ok I know I have to play [ a3 ] sooner or later. But now I have to make a plan. I don't see a clear plan: to attack the kingside with [ Q h5 ] didn't seem enough.
 [ f x g4 ] , [ O-O ]  !? Just under the fire. But I am so well placed...
 [ R x f4 ]  [ K x f4 ]  [ R g2 ] , [ h3 ]  Now it is even simpler and black's activity has been extinguished.
 [ d5 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ Q x f6 ] , [ d x e4 ]  At this stage I think black has the edge due to the fact that he has his queen developed.
 [ e6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ f6 ]  [ B f4 ] , [ g5 ]  black starts looking for a strange defesive pawn formation
 [ K e6 ]  [ K e4 ]  [ K f7 ]  [ K d5 ]  [ K g6 ]  [ K e6 ]  [ N g8 ] , [ R x f6 + ]  I decided to force a draw
 [ B x f3 ]  [ B x f3 ]  [ N e5 ] , [ B e2 ]  Maintaining the bishop pair.
 [ N d7 ] , [ f4 ]  With the knight gone now I move [ f4 ] effectively wasting another tempo. But the pressure on my king is more palatable with that knight gone so... bleh. At least I'm trying to make my plan work.
 [ Q x d8 ]  [ B x h6 ] , [ Q f6 ]  I considered 26...Bxd3!? (with attack on the White bishop) but I wanted to keep things simple. Moreover he returned quite soon so I didn't have the time to fully work out the consequences.
 [ N b1 ] , [ N c5 ]  A discovered attack on the queen that wins the b-pawn for good.
 [ h4 ] , [ B d7 ]  lets take this to the other side of the board.
 [ B g3 ] , [ N x e4 ]  I'm not convinced by the following exchange white plays though. Although bishops are better than knights in this position this move improves black's pawn formation greatly.
 [ N x e6 ]  [ f x e6 ]  [ B f3 ]  [ N x g3 ]  [ h x g3 ] , [ N e5 ]  There is no need to protect [ b7 ] as I have a queen fork on [ b6 ] with check if he does take.
 [ R x g7 + ]  [ h x g7 ] , [ K x g7 ]  What? What? WHAT? Is he just toying with me now? 38. ...[ Q g5 ] 39. [ K f1 ] [ R f5 ] mops up easily. This hasty King move lets White climb more than halfway out of the hole he had dug for himself.
 [ Q h4 ] , [ N f3 ]  Danger of 3 move repetition here
 [ h6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ a6 ]  [ O-O ] , [ N e7 ]  Small error by Black. Gives up his pawn on [ e5 ] for free. I think that I would have done 7. ... [ d6 ] before Ne7.
 [ f6 ]  [ N b3 ] , [ N d4 ]  Well played!
 [ N h5 ] , [ g4 ]  Thought about kxk but decided to block off the bishop first.
 [ R b1 ]  [ R d2 ]  [ R a8 + ]  [ B d8 + ] , [ K c6 ]  Black has saved his king...and can now concentrate on the pawn...
 [ N x d3 ] , [ Q x d3 ]  After this however I lost track of what was played. As I had 14...[ Q e7 ] 15.[ R a e1 ] [ R d8 ] 16.[ Q d2 ] but then black left his Queen vulnerable and I failed to take his Queen. Well that didn't happen as not only didn't Loyd leave his Queen en-prise.
 [ N x d5 ]  [ c x d5 ] , [ B x d5 ]  Again black is poorly developed at a big disadvantage positionally and down a pawn.
 [ e x d6 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ Q b6 ]  [ N a3 ]  [ a6 ]  [ N a c4 ]  [ Q d8 ]  [ N e3 ] , [ N d7 f6 ]  ? Black should play ...cxd first.
 [ Q x d5 ] , [ B h6 ]  Connecting the rooks with tempo.
 [ b4 ]  [ K b5 ] , [ c3 ]  !! and pawn ... ... passed away
 [ O-O ]  [ N e2 ] , [ B x f2 + ]  ! This move takes a pawn that would retreat my N forces king exposure and promotes my upcoming attack!
 [ B x c5 ] , [ R f3 ]  Trying to get a kingside attack going and protecting e3.
 [ B d4 ] , [ R a8 ]  Because white has the strong bishop and two connected past pawns black does not stand a chance. All he can hope for is a draw.
 [ b x c3 ]  [ R x b8 ] , [ Q x e6 + ]  14. [ Q x e6 + ] - I am about to lose a pawn though.
 [ N d e5 ] , [ g5 ]  At this point I realised that the whites king side advance had effectvly been halted. With the kingside practially shut down its time for black to swicth and start pushing himself but on the queen side where black seems to have better prospects.
 [ B x c3 ]  [ b x c3 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ B x e4 ]  [ B x e4 ]  [ R h d1 ]  [ d6 ]  [ R d4 ] , [ B b7 ]  Now I felt that I was winning so I played safe.
 [ e4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ d5 ] , [ e5 ]  French Advance Variation. Black to play.
 [ e6 ]  [ d3 ] , [ d5 ]  Black also moves twice the same piece but for immediate attack
 [ c3 ] , [ c x d4 ]  ? Probably 21...[ R c8 ] or 21...[ c4 ] were better. Remember this is blitz and both players are starting to run low on time but the text gives White some real equalizing chances.
 [ h3 ] , [ B d7 ]  Now why did I do that? It's a useless move. Most likely I made it just to get the bishop off the 8-th rank. [ B e6 ] atleast would have made some difference.
 [ c3 ] , [ R a d8 ]  White is clearly better positionally. His peice are more active than mine. As you can see I have a small problem of inactivity.
 [ N x f3 ] , [ N d7 ]  Why move it when you don't have to? Again 10...[ b5 ] was best. If you had to move the knight then [ e8 ] is a better square. It doesn't obstruct your bishop and it also protects the weak square g7.
 [ N f d5 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ N c7 ]  [ N c5 ] , [ B a8 ]  White is maybe a little better here but Black has things covered up pretty well.
 [ f4 ] , [ Q f5 ]  ??
 [ O-O ]  [ B g5 ]  [ d6 ]  [ h3 ]  [ h6 ]  [ B h4 ]  [ a6 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ g5 ] , [ N x g5 ]  ! White sacrafices in hopes of winning a pawn and/or weakening the kingside for a quick mate.
 [ K f1 ]  [ f3 ]  [ g x f3 ]  [ g x f3 ] , [ N x f3 ]  17. [ N x f3 ] - I sacrifice a pawn to denude the WK and launch a direct mating attack. Unfortunately Glenda needs a little assistance in order to do this.
 [ R x h6 + ]  [ K g8 ]  [ B h7 + ]  [ K f8 ] , [ B d3 ]  Black can take the bishop on [ d3 ] but it gets followed by [ R h8 ] checkmate.
 [ R a1 + ]  [ K c2 ] , [ f2 ]  As now she will promote on her next move.
 [ a3 ]  [ N x d3 ]  [ Q x d3 ]  [ b5 ]  [ b4 ] , [ R f d8 ]  I back up the center pawn
 [ d4 ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ Q x d4 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ B x c6 ]  [ B x c6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B e7 ] , [ b4 ]  Whether Black should castle kingside now but after [ B b2 ] White's attack will be on kingside B and Q directly attacking [ g7 ] if knight moves its checkmate.
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ N c3 ]  Was expecting 2.[ c4 ] for the Indian Defense something which I've got quite good at since one of the players in Costa Coffee plays it almost every game! [ N c3 ] confused me slightly it blocks c-pawn early on.
 [ N f7 ] , [ N c2 ]  Mistake. This allows the text move. I think 20 [ f4 ] was better. If 20...[ N x h6 ] 21. [ f5 ] with the double attack on the bishop and knight.
 [ g x f5 ] , [ e x f5 + ]  White's plan is revealed. 25. [ e x f5 ] gives check and so White's rook can now attack the Black king as well.
 [ R e1 ]  [ N b4 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ R c8 ]  [ B f1 ] , [ d3 ]  That [ d3 ] pawn is like a fishbone in White's throat.Black now has the threat of ...[ N c2 ] forking both Rooks.
 [ Q f4 ] , [ Q d5 ]  Threatening mate on [ g2 ] but...
 [ N d4 ] , [ B x a6 ]  22. [ B x a6 ] - and another black pawn bites the dust - I now have 3 queenside passers!
 [ R x c7 ]  [ Q x c7 + ]  [ K a7 ]  [ Q c5 + ]  [ K b8 ]  [ Q c7 + ]  [ K a7 ] , [ Q c5 + ]  Right here I messed up on my ipad. I meant [ Q c4 ]  [ K b8 ]  [ Q c7 + ]  [ K a7 ]  [ Q c4 ]  [ R c8 ]  [ Q d4 + ]  [ K b8 ] , [ N b6 ]  Looking to simplify cause I am ahead
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ d4 ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ Q e7 ] , [ N f5 ]  Inviting an early insane position in the opening. Should be a lesson to not follow the DB blindly I did not come out well in this...
 [ f3 ] , [ g6 ]  the only prevention. this opens holes in the fortress the rooks aren't doing anything and the N is out to pasture. I have got to turn things around
 [ N x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ] , [ Q x d5 ]  12. [ Q x d5 ] - that Wicked Witch of the West is at the centre of things now sssss!
 [ N a4 ]  [ g5 ] , [ N a c5 ]  White takes final control over the promotion-square [ b8 ] which will cost Black at least a piece. Therefore Black chose to resign. I hope this game will inspire you to look more for the option of the exchange sacrifice. If it works it is a great weapon!
 [ b x c3 ]  [ N b d7 ] , [ N d6 + ]  This have I oversee too...
 [ a x b3 ]  [ B e4 + ]  [ K c1 ]  [ R c2 + ]  [ K b1 ] , [ R a2 + ]  white resigns
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ g6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ e4 ] , [ d6 ]  I've always been a big fan of the King's Indian Defense. That's what the KID stands for in my screen name "Kia-Kid".
 [ B x f3 ]  [ g x f3 ] , [ N x f1 ]  I didn't think this was a great move and was relieved when I saw it. At this point I thought I could maybe win even. (Note my opponent is threatening checkmate on [ h2 ] in a sneaky way!)
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ d6 ]  the philidor a ok game
 [ N f3 ]  [ g5 ]  [ B c4 ] , [ g4 ]  Nothing out of the ordinary here.
 [ R x b8 ] , [ R x b8 ]  Now black has gained an open b-line
 [ N d4 ] , [ Q f1 ]  ?
 [ B f8 ] , [ h4 ]  I don't get h4. Why not Nd4?
 [ B f4 ]  [ c5 ] , [ d5 ]  This is a mistake. He must open the white diagonal not to block it.
 [ g x f4 ]  [ R x e8 + ]  [ K c7 ] , [ e7 ]  One square away. Black's king cannot approach: 37. ... Kd7? is met with 38. [ R d8 + ] K-any 39. e8=Q. So black must try another way.
 [ K f8 ]  [ B a4 ] , [ K g7 ]  ??

 [ N b6 ] , [ N f1 ]  I made this move just to reposition the knight and add a bit of support to [ d4 ] althouth it allows black to swap a knight for a bishop on a fairly open board. I don't think there are really any particularly good places to put the bishop though.
 [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ] , [ Q x d5 ]  The early development of the queen offers an excellent target.
 [ h4 ]  [ R f7 ] , [ K h3 ]  A waste of a move because....
 [ Q d8 ]  [ B x f3 ] , [ R x f3 ]  Well I got the bishop. I'm getting ready to end this now.
 [ N d7 ]  [ B e3 ] , [ Q x h1 ]  At this point I was half-expecting this exchange ... 11. [ f3 ] [ b6 ] 12. [ Q d5 ] [ R c8 ] ... but he long castles.
 [ K e2 ]  [ Q b2 + ]  [ K f3 ]  [ Q f6 + ]  [ K e2 ] , [ Q b2 + ]  3 fold repetition: black declares draw. Total for white: 4 blunder 2 mistakes 2 missed win. Total for black: 5 blunder 4 mistakes.
 [ N x b6 ]  [ f3 ]  [ N d7 + ] , [ K d4 ]  forced to defend [ c5 ] and support e4-e3-[ e2 ] now if [ N b8 ] I can't play [ e3 ] or I will get mated with [ N c6 + + ]  [ d5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ e3 ] , [ B g4 ]  Bird's opening Lasker variation this was the second game with a Bird's opening I play at the same time now with white pieces probably my opponents tried to confuse me although it was my opponent in the other game that chose to play the Bird's against me...
 [ a5 ] , [ N a8 ]  It is almost as if she could read my mind! Black prepares to stop the white knight from going Nc3-a4-b6.
 [ e4 ]  [ g6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ c6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ] , [ e5 ]  attack in the middle
 [ N x d5 ]  [ B x d5 ]  [ O-O ] , [ c3 ]  Defending the c-pawn and allowing white's knight to get off of that horrible [ a3 ] square.
 [ f x g7 ]  [ R g8 ]  [ a3 ] , [ B a5 ]  I'm partial to [ B x c3 + ] here instead. Why isn't that knight free?
 [ N c6 ] , [ Q a6 + ]  With that being said this is how Andy responds since Ken is in check.
 [ R b8 ] , [ a x b5 ]  Isolates his pawns as [ c x b5 ] loses to [ B x d5 ]  [ R x b5 ]  [ B a4 ] , [ R b6 ]  forced. blacks rook on [ b6 ] now looks rather uncomfortable
 [ Q f6 + ]  [ R g7 ]  [ Q x h6 + ]  [ R h7 ] , [ Q x f8 # ]  
 [ Q f3 ] , [ f6 ]  Can't take the freebie cos of the mate in one.

 [ Q g2 ]  [ f x e4 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ Q h5 ]  [ N h4 ] , [ B d7 ]  Sloppy move didn't think about defence.
 [ f4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ] , [ N c e2 ]  This is a blitz game and I clearly didn't want to be skewered by the d pawn's advance. But [ Q e2 ] is surely stronger for me.
 [ N h4 + ]  [ K h3 ]  [ N f5 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ K f1 ]  [ B b6 ]  [ K e2 ]  [ K h2 ]  [ K f1 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ K e2 ]  [ K g1 ]  [ N h6 ]  [ g3 ]  [ N f5 ]  [ g2 ]  [ N h4 ] , [ B f2 ]  Another mistake but I didn't think it mattered he had the pawn.
 [ B b7 ]  [ d4 ]  [ a6 ]  [ e3 ]  [ a x b5 ] , [ N x b5 ]  6. [ N x b5 ] - seems to consolidate white's pawn advantage doubleton removed and I have an outside passed a pawn.
 [ R x g4 + ]  [ K h3 ]  [ R f4 ]  [ K g3 ]  [ R d4 ]  [ d6 ] , [ R x d6 ]  Nothing to exploit for white anymore. It honours him NOT to have gone on. The mate is still very far but there is no hope. Please forgive my misassessements - and correct me at will! I will be grateful
 [ c4 ]  [ Q c6 ]  [ N b5 ]  [ a6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ R a d8 ]  [ a3 ] , [ R d7 ]  here black can not be too aggressive. 18 ... [ R d4 ] is ably met by 19 Ne4!
 [ K h8 ]  [ R d4 ] , [ f5 ]  Defending the [ h4 ] square
 [ f x g4 ]  [ f x e5 ]  [ B g5 + ]  [ K d7 ]  [ B x a6 ]  [ B b4 + ]  [ K f2 ]  [ c6 ]  [ B x b7 ]  [ R a b8 ]  [ a3 ]  [ B f8 ]  [ B x c6 + ]  [ K d6 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ R x b2 + ]  [ K f3 ] , [ R h7 ]  ? I would have moved P[ a6 ] or Pa5. [ R h7 ] permits N[ x B f8 ] for free.
 [ K b1 ] , [ Q c7 ]  !! Black does not bother with the gain of a Pawn (21....Rxf3) as he wants to win in the quickest manner.
 [ B f4 + ]  [ K g1 ] , [ B x e2 ]  If you calculate the position if white plays BxB thinking about exchanging queens you'll see it gives me pawns [ d3 ] and c2.
 [ K e8 ]  [ b5 ] , [ N e5 ]  Instead 39... [ N d8 ] 40. [ B d4 ] [ K d7 ] 41. [ R x f6 ] puts up minuscule more resistance.
 [ R b1 ]  [ N g e7 ]  [ h3 ]  [ O-O ] , [ N h2 ]  At the time I thought that [ [ h3 ] ] was just a dont know what to do so how bout [ [ h3 ] ] sort of thing. It's not till after this that I realised it was probably to free the f pawn. though come to think of it the N could have simply gone to [ d2 ] instead of creating a potential target for black with h3.
 [ a6 ]  [ R e3 ]  [ B f7 ]  [ B x g3 + ]  [ K h3 ]  [ B e1 + ]  [ K g2 ] , [ B x h4 ]  Destructing chain ofg pawns and starting to create " prison cell " for white's King.
 [ g4 ]  [ B g6 ]  [ N g e2 ]  [ c5 ] , [ h4 ]  7. [ h4 ] - it's the sort of thing the Master Mater would do - advance the g and h pawns (before castling kingside) and deter me from castling kingside. Here Fou Leblanc is under the hammer and soon I will have to play [ h6 ] or [ h5 ] to create a bolt-hole for him.
 [ N x e6 ] , [ f x e6 ]  so white is winning time...and persist in preventing black to castle!
 [ Q x c2 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ B x a8 ] , [ N x e5 ]  Black is getting delusional...
 [ N f5 ] , [ N c5 ]  !!
 [ K x f2 ] , [ B b7 ]  trapping the knight
 [ B g4 ]  [ e x f3 + ]  [ B x f3 ]  [ R f e8 + ]  [ K d1 ]  [ Q x h4 ] , [ B x c6 ]  My opponent obviously missed my next move or had anticipated it and knew that mate could only be avoided by sacrificing the queen. Effectively spells the end.
 [ N x f7 ]  [ R h7 ]  [ e5 ] , [ Q c6 ]  [ Q h4 ] would have been better. You cannot help but seeing how vulnerable the H file is to white's queen. And at some point black needs to get his [ b8 ] knight moving since the other one is basically stuck.
 [ K e6 ]  [ K g4 ]  [ N h1 ] , [ K h3 ]  Another choice is c4. Someone wiser than me would tell if this was better.
 [ O-O ] , [ b6 ]  hoping to get the bishop onto the [ d5 ] pawn
 [ B d8 ]  [ R e1 + ]  [ K f8 ]  [ Q x d8 + ]  [ K g7 ]  [ Q x d3 ]  [ R a2 ] , [ R g1 ]  ?? Going for a K side attack but much better was 42.[ Q c3 + ] and after Erika gets out of check 43.[ Q x a5 ] (winning another pawn) followed by 44.[ R e7 ] and 45.[ Q d7 ] are overwhelming for black. With this move Erika will win back a pawn. With this move black has a really good that I overlooked which would've pinned and won the Q.
 [ K h2 ] , [ a5 ]  ? Trying to get the passed pawn moving but [ B d2 ] was necessary since [ N e6 ] is deadly.
 [ e x d5 ] , [ e x d5 ]  White is good here because I have an isolated d-pawn which I could lose if I don't defend it properly.
 [ f x e6 ] , [ N x e6 ]  The best move. Black has no decent defense and cannot even castle queenside and will still lose material or be checkmated. The knaves climbed that threat ladder and now the heavy pieces extract their toll...
 [ K b5 ]  [ K d4 ]  [ K b4 ]  [ Q b6 + ]  [ K a3 ] , [ K c3 ]  Mate in 1
 [ N e4 ]  [ Q d3 ] , [ a6 ]  black is not developing pieces. it is hard to play that way.
 [ R e5 ]  [ Q d7 ]  [ R a e1 ] , [ B e6 ]  Here we see the activity of White's pieces is thanks to constant tempo-winning moves all his pieces are developed (with the [ B h6 ] being the oddity!) and when compared to Black's pinned e6-bishop a rook on [ g8 ] forced to cover the g7-pawn and the queen with no strong squares to choose from - things are looking bleak for Bisguier.
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ c4 ]  [ d x c4 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ e3 ]  [ b5 ]  [ a4 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ a x b5 ]  [ B x b5 ]  [ N a3 ]  [ c6 ]  [ B x c4 ]  [ B x c4 ]  [ N x c4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ B d2 ]  [ h6 ]  [ N a5 ]  [ a6 ]  [ R c1 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ B c3 ]  [ N x c3 ]  [ b x c3 ]  [ Q x a5 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B a3 ]  [ R c2 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ Q d3 ]  [ Q b5 ]  [ c4 ]  [ Q f5 ]  [ e4 ]  [ Q a5 ]  [ e5 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ d5 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ Q x d5 ]  [ Q c3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ Q e3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ R d2 ]  [ Q b5 ]  [ Q e4 ]  [ a5 ]  [ R d7 ]  [ R f e8 ]  [ R c1 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ Q f4 ]  [ R e7 ]  [ R d2 ]  [ B a3 ]  [ R c d1 ]  [ Q b7 ]  [ h4 ] , [ B b4 ]  The bishop move led me to move my rook where I need it anyway.
 [ Q x c6 ] , [ N b d2 ]  After queen captures Bishop White's knight finally moves at 13th move of the game. Self invited underdevelopment and giving the opponent an edge over the game. Also Knight's move at [ d2 ] is wrong as it is taking away Queen's protection to [ [ d3 ] ] pawn. Black can now capture the free pawn at [ [ d3 ] ] by its Rook at d8. What a blunder. This is what happens if the pieces are not developed at the opening stage. Here now White do not have any game plan and he want to take out his knight. He cant take out his knight at [ a3 ] as Black will capture it with it's Bishop at [ e7 ] thereby creating weakness for White as White need to capture Bishop with its [ b2 ] pawn resulting in Double Pawn.
 [ B x g4 + ]  [ e6 ]  [ R h e1 ]  [ f5 ]  [ B f3 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ e5 ]  [ B x f3 ]  [ g x f3 ]  [ R h8 ]  [ R d6 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ R e d1 ]  [ R a7 ]  [ a4 ]  [ R h8 ]  [ R x e6 ]  [ N f8 ]  [ R x b6 ]  [ R h3 ]  [ R d3 ]  [ K c7 ]  [ R d d6 ]  [ R x f3 ]  [ R b c6 + ]  [ K b7 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ R h3 ]  [ B x c5 ]  [ R h7 ]  [ B x a7 ]  [ K x a7 ]  [ R c8 ]  [ R h8 ]  [ R c7 + ]  [ K b8 ]  [ R g7 ]  [ K c8 ]  [ R a6 ]  [ K b8 ]  [ R a a7 ]  [ R x h2 ]  [ R a e7 ]  [ R x f2 ] , [ R e8 # ]  
 [ b x c4 ]  [ e4 ]  [ Q a5 ]  [ B d2 ] , [ B a6 ]  Unusual but not entirely unheard-of. I very rarely see a bishop developed straight onto the side of the board but Windows Vista clearly thinks it is the best move in this situation to defend the c4-pawn.
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ B b4 ]  Nimzo-Indian. highly popular in the last decade.
 [ N c6 ] , [ a3 ]  Important defensive move. My knight is eyeing c6-[ b4 ] then b4-c2.
 [ B x g5 ]  [ B x e5 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ R x e5 ]  [ B f4 ] , [ R b5 ]  Excellent idea! It turns out that after 42.[ K c4 ] black can play 42. ... b3!! and after 43.[ K x b5 ] [ b2 ] white having one rook and one bishop more can't win! 44.[ R c1 ] [ b x c1 Q ] 45.[ B x c1 ] [ K d7 ] and white cannot take the [ a4 ] pawn and prevent black king to get into a8. Great endgame! It looks that there is no way for white to win :-(
 [ R x c3 ]  [ R x c3 ]  [ Q x c3 ] , [ Q x f7 + ]  Big Blunder. Gives up a queen and a bishop for a rook and a pawn.
 [ Q e4 ]  [ R f5 ]  [ f4 ] , [ b5 ]  14. ....... b5? - it is to be noted that rt4sm (Bob) played this move here against a guy called valeriuzaharia. He lost but in the final position he had two rooks against a Q 2 pawns. Hmm might have played on there. Valeriuzaharia merely backed off his bishop to [ b3 ] but Ion had a much stronger continuation - 15.g4. In retrospect I should have played [ h5 ] first to prevent [ g4 ] therefore preparing b5.
 [ d x c3 ] , [ Q e4 ]  This is quite a huge mistake as you will see.
 [ R g1 ]  [ R x h2 ]  [ R x g6 ]  [ R h4 ] , [ R g3 ]  Blocking off [ c3 ] or d3.
 [ c x d4 ] , [ R c8 + ]  The first check of the game.
 [ Q x e7 + ] , [ B x e7 ]  Well white is slighly better now.
 [ Q c1 ]  [ R x d2 ]  [ Q x d2 ]  [ Q x c6 ] , [ f4 ]  The only way to win is to block the massive pawn center white built up. Can you find the best move?
 [ c x d5 ] , [ R g3 ]  I understand this move. It get's white's last piece out and achieves mobilization. While there's nothing wrong with this move I would've preferred 20.[ R b1 ] doubling his R's. And that's because while not in this position it's good practice because in general doubled rooks are very dangerous that can pose immediate mating threats even when you're behind. However I would've recaptured immediately with 20.Rxb7. However that move will be played sooner or later.
 [ B x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ] , [ R d7 x d5 ]  As it happens that pawn was too well defended; Black wins a pawn against the ill-conceived attack and with his Rooks now doubled and White's knight sidelined Black has the advantage.
 [ Q g6 + ]  [ K h8 ]  [ Q x h6 + ] , [ K g8 ]  33. .... [ K g8 ] - now let's take stock. Remove both rooks from the board and the game will most certainly be drawn as white will have nothing better than Ye Olde Perpetualle. Remove both sets of major pieces and it is game set and match to Yours Truly! But alas both sets of major pieces are on the board and the Witch only needs one piece to assist her and what with Henry's enforced moonshine the assistance of a rook is deadly.
 [ Q b6 ] , [ b4 ]  Now white plays a good move to hold the pawn. Is the c pawn weak? Probably not. If black concentrates his force on the c pawn he will be invaded on the light squares. 14...[ R c8 ] 15.Qf3(h5) [ R x c2 ] 16.[ Q x f7 + ] [ K d8 ] 17.[ R a2 ] and white will mop up the K side pawns after dealing with some minor nuisances on the Q side. This is just one line. 15.[ B c4 ] is already good enough with [ Q h5 ] coming up.
 [ K h7 ]  [ N a1 ]  [ Q b5 ]  [ N c2 ]  [ N e7 ]  [ N b4 ] , [ B g6 ]  Now the bishop has been activated. When pawns are locked in a chain as they are in this game you want your bishop in front of the chain.
 [ K e2 ] , [ B x a1 ]  He took the bate :D Enjoy it!
 [ R a5 a8 + ]  [ K c7 ] , [ R x f8 ]  He still takes my bishop
 [ O-O-O ] , [ f6 ]  I now castle to bring the rooks together to support my centre pawn push. Black moves his pawn to f6. This pawn is protected by the knight at [ e8 ] and [ h6 ] rook.
 [ e4 ] , [ R x e4 + ]  White follows that error with 15. e4??? which loses the white queen free of charge.
 [ a5 ]  [ h4 ]  [ h6 ]  [ N h3 ] , [ K d7 ]  The queenside doesn't look like a completely safe place for the king but it seems safer than the kingside.
 [ e x d5 ]  [ c x d5 ] , [ N e5 ]  Knight escape #1. The trade's aftermath rendered White's pawn's almost useless.
 [ B x e6 ]  [ N b4 ] , [ B b3 ]  12. [ B b3 ] - to prevent Nc2+.
 [ e5 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ B x e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ b3 ]  [ c6 ]  [ B b2 ] , [ Q c7 ]  I lost much time for this [ B b2 ] and the black figures targeting my king.
 [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B e2 ] , [ e6 ]  here it comes..
 [ f x g4 ]  [ h x g4 ] , [ h6 ]  I tell myself that this is gonna be slow steady advancement.
 [ R e1 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N b d2 ]  [ B x f3 + ]  [ B x f3 ]  [ c6 ] , [ b3 ]  LOOK AT THIS !!! do you see what i see ? my bishop is just wait for this wonderfull rook in [ a1 ] ! the question where do i put the knight ? i can take [ g4 ] or may be just put it in e4...and then in [ f2 ] what about [ d5 ] ? whould you did it ? I did you know why ?
 [ Q e3 + ]  [ K c2 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ g3 ]  [ B a4 + ]  [ K b2 ]  [ Q b3 + ]  [ K c1 ] , [ Q c2 # ]  and there it is... thanks for the game easy19!!
 [ N f6 ] , [ N c3 ]  Having more attacking power on d5. But now that a piece of low value is protecting [ d5 ] n[ c6 ] can be played
 [ N d8 ] , [ N x a5 ]  Black surrendered the pawn but I'm not sure why. Maybe he was just opening the c-file for his rook.
 [ Q g3 ] , [ K f8 ]  Wasting time
 [ e x d5 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ B b3 ]  [ d4 ]  [ R a d1 ]  [ Q b6 ]  [ B x d4 ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ Q x e7 ]  [ d x c3 ]  [ R d6 ]  [ R a e8 ]  [ Q x f8 + ]  [ K x f8 ]  [ R x b6 ]  [ a x b6 ]  [ b x c3 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ R d1 ]  [ N x c3 ]  [ R a1 ]  [ R d8 ]  [ K f1 ]  [ B a6 + ]  [ K g1 ]  [ R d1 + ]  [ R x d1 ]  [ N x d1 ]  [ c4 ]  [ N b2 ]  [ f3 ]  [ B x c4 ]  [ B x c4 ]  [ N x c4 ]  [ K f2 ]  [ K e7 ]  [ K e2 ]  [ K d6 ]  [ K d3 ] , [ K d5 ]  White resigns
 [ N f3 ] , [ R a7 ]  Planning to double on the d file but without restricting my queen's movements too much.
 [ R a c1 ] , [ B b7 ]  I looked at 14. ...[ N d5 ] but did not like the fact that it weakens the pressure on d4. Besides it is overly agressive and not very caro-kann like!
 [ R f2 ] , [ N x b2 ]  25. Rf2? loses a pawn. It was the f-rook that needed to move to [ b1 ] and then capture on b7. This way 26. R[ b1 ] loses the pawn on [ a4 ] and black remains a pawn ahead but even better that extra pawn is a passed pawn.
 [ R h f1 ] , [ c5 ]  Creating space for the knight but [ c6 ] may have been more effective as taking on [ b4 ] seems subpar since it would open a line of attack for the white rook.
 [ N e4 ]  [ R c6 ]  [ N f g5 ] , [ B d4 + ]  23. .... [ B d4 + ] - seemingly a good way to evade knight capture and avoid breaking up Henry's position. But Dongoodman finds another way.
 [ e6 ]  [ d x e6 ] , [ B x e6 ]  The basic Icelandic asset.
 [ B e7 ]  [ N f4 ]  [ O-O ]  [ Q e2 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ N f x d5 ] , [ N x d5 ]  ?? Goodnight Irene. That move beckons mate-in-3.
 [ B d2 ]  [ N e7 ]  [ O-O-O ] , [ R h g8 ]  Both sides complete their development and I take the chance to drive the White Queen.
 [ B x b5 ]  [ Q x b5 ]  [ Q x e5 + ]  [ K d1 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ Q h5 + ] , [ R e2 ]  In my humble opinion the game is dead even. Black's extra pawn is very weak and will fall at some point in the game so I'm not even counting it as a material advantage.
 [ N g3 ]  [ B g6 ]  [ h4 ]  [ h6 ] , [ N f3 ]  Caro-Kann Defense\Capablanca Variation - Main Line\6.[ h4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N e5 ] , [ B h7 ]  A rather withdrawn play by black opposed with nice expansion of white. However center is rather week what gives a lot of possibilities to regain initiative for black
 [ B x d7 ] , [ N x h8 ]  Forgot about the rook
 [ N d2 ]  [ B x e2 ] , [ Q x e2 ]  Now I like [ N x e2 ] instead of [ Q x e2 ] - what do you think?
 [ d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ] , [ c5 ]  well now it may transpose into a silcian.
 [ h x g4 ]  [ Q x g4 ]  [ Q x d2 ]  [ Q h5 + ]  [ K g1 ] , [ B x f5 ]  24. .................. [ B x f5 ] - restores material equality.
 [ K d2 ]  [ c3 + ]  [ K c2 ] , [ K c4 ]  Prevents White from escaping to cause mischief. Edit: sicilian_monster pointed out this is a horrible mistake because of the possibility of 41. [ B e2 ] .
 [ O-O ] , [ B c8 ]  Here black beginings a desparate attack on white's king which is easily refuted. Black has lost his ability to attack on the queenside and so turns to the kingside.
 [ N x d1 ] , [ b6 ]  My knight is now worringly far away from the ever-advancing b-pawn. Although I had worked out that because the white king must move to [ a6 ] to accompany the pawn my knight has time to stop it because after [ N c3 ] Nd5. [ N b4 ] will deliver check and therefore can get to C6 to stop the pawn in time!
 [ B d2 ]  [ N x d2 ]  [ Q x d2 ]  [ Q x c5 ]  [ O-O-O ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N b3 ] , [ B x c3 ]  Probably unsound to trade my bishop pair away.
 [ Q d2 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N a4 ] , [ Q e6 ]  Now black seems to be better.
 [ K e7 ] , [ R h d3 ]  This ties black completely to the defense of d6. Allowing white to start a pawn march on the king side.
 [ a5 ] , [ N a2 ]  WN seem to be more restricted as time passes while black seem to be fairly protected.
 [ e x d5 ] , [ N x d5 ]  He can pick up a pawn but...
 [ Q d2 ] , [ B d5 ]  what about moving my bishop can't forget my cutie. And after this move I offered him a draw. And surprisingly he accepts it.
 [ O-O-O ]  [ B g3 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ Q x b4 ] , [ R c1 + ]  Alternative variation: 18. [ N c3 ] [ Q x d4 ] (18... Bc6) (18... [ e x d4 ] 19. [ R a c1 ] [ d x c3 ] (19... [ B c6 ] 20.

 [ R b8 ] , [ R a d1 ]  White is totally dominant in the centre but Black has no significant weaknesses so it won't be easy to convert this to a win. The logical continuation is an attack on Black's undefended kingside.
 [ B e7 ]  [ h4 ]  [ N d7 ] , [ Q d4 ]  Also interesting Qg4. It's a boring fight for the pawn now...
 [ R f6 + ] , [ K e5 ]  and black resigns.
 [ B b5 ] , [ B c2 ]  Although trading bishops would take away Black's bishop pair I must avoid trading my active pieces if I want to swindle Black.
 [ b5 ]  [ N e7 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ R c1 ]  [ R c8 ]  [ a4 ] , [ c5 ]  Now I want to break open the position.
 [ N f5 ]  [ B x f5 ]  [ g x f5 ]  [ Q e7 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ N d7 ]  17. ........ [ N d7 ] - I complete my development but white has a clear advantage in space and a dangerous mating attack develops.
 [ a x b5 ] , [ e6 ]  Black tidies up his pawn formation and makes room for the Kside development. Note that Black has a better pawn structure and has gained a move (White has two pawns developed Black three).
 [ N d4 ]  [ Q f2 ] , [ N x b3 ]  goflb (1377) on 28-Feb-09: All fine except 15. [ Q x g3 ] (QxQ!) instead of 15. axb3??. ... Dangit! Too right! Black should have went [ R x f7 ] instead of to Nb3. Thanks. No wait that wouldn't work. Forgot about the bishop. ... ionadowman (2046) on 28-Feb-09: But after 13...[ N d4 ] 14.[ Q f2 ] [ Q g4 ] carries several threats: 15...[ N x b3 ] becomes a real threat (with ...[ R x f7 ] to follow) but also ...[ Q d1 ] and ...[ B b7 ] also require thought. How might White have responded to 14...[ Q g4 ] then? ... Yeah you're right [ Q g4 ] is better saving [ N b3 ] for later. My impatience again.
 [ B c6 ]  [ R a7 + ]  [ K f6 ]  [ a6 ]  [ g6 ]  [ f x g6 ]  [ K x g6 ]  [ R c7 ] , [ h5 ]  White is draining off Blacks' last tempi...
 [ B x d7 + ]  [ N b x d7 ] , [ N c3 ]  I do not know why he chose this candidate because he cannot play 8.[ N x d5 ] due to my [ e6 ] pawn. In addition he is not going to Fianchetto his DSB or castle queenside.
 [ N x e5 ]  [ b4 ] , [ N c6 ]  48. ... axb e.p. 49. [ R x b3 ] and then the other b-pawn falls as well
 [ O-O ] , [ d6 ]  I protect my king while black develops

 [ f4 ] , [ N e4 ]  Rats. He shut down the diagonal. Oh well at least my Knight ended up on a strong square.
 [ N x e5 ]  [ B x e5 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ B c3 ]  [ Q c6 ] , [ N d4 ]  Got him I am starting to feel the pressure relieve I know we will exchange some pieces here but I intend on removing the pressure on my king.
 [ K h1 ] , [ N b7 ]  Offering another trade.
 [ B c3 ] , [ N x d3 ]  forced.
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ e3 ] , [ d5 ]  A Stonewall attack by a transposition of moves. White's ideal setup is pawns on [ c3 ] [ d4 ] [ e3 ] f4. Knights on [ d2 ] and [ f3 ] and a bishop on d3.
 [ a6 ]  [ B a4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ b5 ]  [ B b3 ] , [ B e7 ]  all standard moves so far for the Morphy Defence. Black retains the option of playing the Marshall Gambit here.
 [ K d3 ] , [ N b4 + ]  a good move. white has only one option left...
 [ N g e7 ]  [ a3 ] , [ N g6 ]  Knight ... at its destination ... at right time.
 [ b5 ]  [ c x b5 ]  [ a x b5 ] , [ N c3 ]  31. [ N c3 ] - at least my queenside is a little less cramped but alas it does not help much.
 [ Q g6 + ]  [ K f8 ]  [ R h8 + ]  [ K e7 ] , [ Q x g5 + ]  RxQ KxR [ Q g8 + ] was not as much as deadly. Thank you for reading!
 [ B f4 ]  [ B x f4 ]  [ N x f4 ] , [ R x d4 ]  I could not resist the promiss of winning a pawn but perhaps it would have been better to continue the project of opening the h-file via 15...[ g5 ]  [ Q f5 + ]  [ Q d7 ]  [ Q x d7 + ]  [ R x d7 ]  [ R a d1 ] , [ R h d8 ]  Thoughtless. There wasn't really a good reason to give up a pawn at this point. [ g5 ] to poke away the knight before the moving the rook on [ h8 ] would probably have been better. If black would trade rooks at [ d7 ] he would momentarily gain control over the d-file which benefits him to some extent but this close to the endgame the extra pawn is probavly worth fighting for.
 [ R d5 ]  [ R c1 + ]  [ K h2 ]  [ d1 = Q ]  [ R x d1 ]  [ R x d1 ] , [ R x a5 ]  ...but now somehow I am up a pawn!
 [ f x g4 ] , [ N f4 ]  White takes my LB at [ g4 ] and this now means my knight is under attack at [ h5 ] so I move my knight away from the pawn's grasp to f4.
 [ R x h8 ] , [ R x c8 ]  Now trading a bishop and rook for the other rook
 [ Q x e4 + ]  [ f3 ]  [ Q e2 + ]  [ K g3 ]  [ Q e1 + ]  [ K g4 ]  [ Q b4 + ]  [ K g3 ]  [ Q f4 + ]  [ K f2 ]  [ Q x h2 + ]  [ K e3 ]  [ Q f4 + ]  [ K e2 ]  [ Q c4 + ]  [ K d1 ]  [ Q f1 + ] , [ K d2 ]  Here I examined what happens if black pushes the h passed pawn instead of checking the white king. White forces mate in less than ten moves deftly working around the black knight with a series of checks beginning with Qa5+.
 [ e5 ]  [ Q x c4 ] , [ N x d6 ]  The big problem of White was: Where begings the lunch?
 [ B c6 ]  [ e x d5 ] , [ B x d5 ]  [ N e6 ] is not possible because of B[ x N b7 ] N[ x B f4 ] B[ x R a8 ] and black cannot take the bishop because of d8=Q+.
 [ K f7 ] , [ R a c1 ]  This prevents ...[ Q c6 ] attacking [ g2 ] through my [ N f3 ] and attacks [ c7 ] virtually forcing Black's reply.
 [ Q x b6 ] , [ g5 ]  ?? Having had missed the opportunity to take his Rook on my last move I wasn't going to overlook it this time. Now I was threatening an eventual back rank mate. But it wasn't immediate as there was somethingelse which was. Joe: ?? Although this keeps the K safe the problem is that this move loses a R. Best was 23...[ R f8 ] as now the R is protected. And after that 24...[ g5 ] would be an option. Mike: I'm at the point that I'm not sure what to do? Not going to resign Joe: Although they do consider it a resignable position I think you're making the right choice. Yes by staying in there is more to learn. As Judit Polgar would say "Fight til the End." The reality is that I do think that black should resign soon but not quite yet. The idea being is that I told a different student the same thing about not resigning after losing material. Although Erika didn't lose her Q everything else was the same and point wise she was further behind. Yet after opponent made mistakes she pulled a swindle and won a hopelessly lost position. So I am trying to get this student in that habbit. And I was also worried that telling Mike to resign would make him feel rushed. The one thing I don't want to do is make my students feel rushed because taking your time to concentrate is very important.
 [ N g6 ] , [ h5 ]  Of course the knight is the last thing white wants on [ g6 ] hence pushes the pawn.
 [ e3 ] , [ e5 ]  The Old Indian is not a hypermodern like the other Indian Defenses. It is simple to play. The positions are easier to analyze and that is why I chose to use it. My friend Sunshine94558 (on gameknott) has played this against me when she played Black and I do not like to play against it.
 [ f4 ] , [ a5 ]  We both push on our Pawns.
 [ R h8 + ]  [ K g6 ] , [ g4 ]  restricts the king even more while threatening the B. black is gasping
 [ e x d5 ] , [ B d3 ]  Of course I don`t want to lose my bishop but now he has a fork.
 [ B x b4 ]  [ R x b4 + ]  [ K d3 ]  [ N x c3 ]  [ K x c3 ] , [ R x a4 ]  More Blake: 32. [ B x b4 ] [ R x b4 ] 33. [ K d3 ] [ N x c3 ] 34. [ K x c3 ] Rxa4. While this loses a little material it manages to leave black in an endgame where he is up by the exchange and four pawns. Better it exchanges off everything but white's knight leaving black essentially with King Rook 5 pawns against King Knight 2 pawns an easy endgame to win. I don't know if I would have played it but I would have given it a serious look. ... Not bad! ... White may as well resign here but here's how it would play out if white didn't.
 [ e x f5 ] , [ g x f5 ]  The normal recapture in the King's Indian even when the QB is available to recapture. The pawn front presents White with problems the immediate threat being a fork with ...e4.
 [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ B b4 ]  I don't see the point of the bishop here - it's not pinning anything and only threatening to take the knight on [ c3 ] which would limit my force on e4. But black exchanging another bishop for a knight would be a significant positional mistake as two bishops versus two knights in a relatively open position is deadly.
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ] , [ c4 ]  We both are liking that move
 [ b3 ]  [ B a6 ] , [ d6 + ]  This was clearly a huge blunder on their part.
 [ a6 ] , [ Q a4 ]  keeping the pin so I don't get double pawns
 [ Q f6 ] , [ Q a4 ]  The natural move 18.[ B d3 ] is not good because of [ B a6 ] the queen move prevents this and put pressure on c6.
 [ Q x g7 ] , [ R g8 ]  This has all known theory so far and the moves just come naturally.
 [ N b d7 ]  [ N b d2 ] , [ b6 ]  This fianchetto is good in my opinion. It creates for me the need to be extremely careful about the removing of the d pawn (needed for exchanges in [ e5 ] to come). I played on it in this game.
 [ c x b6 ]  [ a x b6 ]  [ R d b1 ] , [ B g2 ]  I didn't think throught this one
 [ e x d5 ] , [ c x d5 ]  Trying to keep the saced material is obviously doomed. Not only pawn to [ e7 ] and then to [ d7 ] but [ B c4 ] is coming to pin something and game over.
 [ B d8 ] , [ N x c6 ]  Black's lack of development makes White's breaking into Black's position easy.
 [ B x c4 ]  [ R x c4 ]  [ Q x a3 ]  [ R c8 + ]  [ K h7 ]  [ R b7 ]  [ K g6 ]  [ R c6 + ]  [ f6 ]  [ R a7 ]  [ a5 ]  [ R c c7 ]  [ Q a1 + ] , [ N f1 ]  I got my King safe enough with the excess Knight.
 [ Q x e1 ]  [ Q x e1 + ]  [ K g2 ]  [ Q d2 + ]  [ K h3 ] , [ R e3 + ]  final rook joins the attack
 [ N f4 + ]  [ K d1 ]  [ R c7 ]  [ Q a8 ]  [ Q h4 ] , [ Q b8 ]  This next move really makes me have a think
 [ N b3 ] , [ Q d5 ]  Threatening mate. I thought this was a little stronger than [ Q d5 ] because it adds some pressure to the queenside as well as the mate threat.
 [ N d6 ]  [ B c1 ]  [ N b5 ] , [ B b2 ]  Both bishops have maneuvered just in time to defend all three guardless pawns. Now I was all for keeping the black king away from my "tall pawns". An easy task after all.
 [ N g e7 ]  [ B e3 ] , [ B b6 ]  Prefering to not give me control over the [ d4 ] push after [ B x e3 ] [ f x e3 ] (with the semi open f file to boot). This is still found in databased GM games and is a common response to the logical Be3.
 [ a6 ] , [ g4 ]  The first serious concession by white which signals that is it is time to get it on. White has done absolutely everything they could to prepare and now is the time to push black off the board.
 [ K e7 ] , [ Q x h7 + ]  The first goal was easily obtained now we need to switch back to the g-file while keeping in contact with the black king.
 [ K e7 ] , [ O-O ]  Offering the knight as a sort of counter gambit. White will have excellent central control and room for his pieces to attack Black's exposed king
 [ Q d3 ] , [ N f6 ]  The Queen is still nice and centralised which mean it's controlling more squares. [ N f6 ] develops a piece and prepare to castle short.
 [ R a b8 ]  [ c3 ]  [ Q g5 + ]  [ K h2 ]  [ N e6 ]  [ R g1 ]  [ Q f4 + ]  [ R g3 ] , [ b6 ]  Weakening the light squares on the Queenside making the Bishop more powerful than either of Black's Rooks.
 [ e5 ]  [ e4 ]  [ b6 ] , [ d4 ]  We come into pawn action as I try to control the center
 [ O-O ]  [ B c5 ] , [ N e6 + ]  a complicated trade...
 [ h8 = Q ]  [ K b3 ]  [ g4 ]  [ a2 ]  [ g5 ]  [ K c2 ]  [ g6 ]  [ K b1 ] , [ Q c3 ]  He wanted me to push the pawn which would have earned him a queen but realizing that I would willingly take that pawn after his only possible move pawn to [ a1 ] he resigned.
 [ a x b4 ] , [ B x b4 ]  I can sometimes analyze tactical positions well as I did here but I must admit that when I get tired tactical analysis is one of the first parts of my game to fail.
 [ N d4 ] , [ Q d3 ]  threatening [ g6 ] but not too fast because of possible threat on [ e2 + ]  [ h5 ]  [ R a e1 ] , [ B f5 ]  here is my bishop pinning the knight -well unless the knight checks the king he cannot moves.
 [ h5 ] , [ g x h5 ]  I don't know why he wanted to attack so quickly at g6. I guess he was trying to destroy my protection on the king side if I were to castle early... I didn't like this move so I accepted the quick trade.
 [ R a1 + ]  [ K c2 ]  [ R x d1 ] , [ N d6 + ]  A terrible mistake???....... the rest is pretty straightforward...
 [ R e6 ]  [ B h4 ] , [ b5 ]  thinking i can afford the lose i decide to try and keep to my game plan to double rooks
 [ K g8 ] , [ c6 ]  figure nothing is keeping me from taking rook later... might as well push the pawn while I still can
 [ K f7 ] , [ R e g6 ]  ...before doubling up on the g-file.
 [ c x d5 ] , [ N x d5 ]  After 6...[ e x d5 ] I was planning 7. d4. O-O is also playable
 [ B b7 ] , [ N x c5 ]  Save a piece take a pawn.
 [ N g x e4 ] , [ B b6 ]  (!?)
 [ N h5 ] , [ B h6 ]  Exchange rooks and foorce the knight back. nothing can stop my pawns
 [ Q e7 ] , [ Q x g8 # ]  And the game is over. I believe these 14 moves were interesting enough to show you guys ! :-)
 [ R x c7 ] , [ b x c7 ]  And black resigned. Thankyou for reading please comment.
 [ N e5 ] , [ g4 ]  This is somewhat uncommon move propably played to prevent ...[ h5 ] at some stage. 12.[ h4 ] is in my opinion more to the point as the move [ g4 ] can turn out to be unnecessary. 12.[ K b1 ] is a possibility too.
 [ h7 ] , [ f6 ]  Again 46...[ R d1 ] would have been better. For the first time in the game White has the advantage courtesy of Computer Analysis @ Gameknot.
 [ R f e8 ]  [ R e4 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ R f4 ]  [ R e1 + ]  [ K g2 ] , [ K h7 ]  Protecting the f5-bishop by unpinning the g-pawn.
 [ N x e5 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ B x e5 ] , [ R e1 ]  This is the position I was referring. One piece developed and it is stuck for awhile
 [ e x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ] , [ Q x d5 ]  ...and that's to trade first the pawns then the knights forcing the queen out. I'm not too worried about her occupying the centre of the board where she potentially has the most square coverage...
 [ Q x b5 ]  [ R f1 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ Q g4 ]  [ R a e8 ] , [ b3 ]  Why? Maybe preparing for c4.
 [ B e3 ]  [ Q a5 + ]  [ Q d2 ] , [ N b4 ]  now i feal the fear : this is very risky. I play it to quickly whithout thinking just intution ... knight take [ c2 ] king has to go then i exchange queens and win the a rook...
 [ N c3 ] , [ R h6 ]  Other rook!
 [ b6 ] , [ Q e2 ]  This move limits Black's bishop to [ b7 ] by covering [ [ a6 ] ] a second time. (From [ [ a6 ] ] Black could exchange bishops and remove White's advantage of having both bishops vs. one. Additionally White's remaining bishop would be the currently limited one on c1.) Second although Black has now moved the b-pawn just one square 11. [ Q e2 ] prevents any shenanigans with White's queen and bishop on the c-file. Lastly it guards the Knight with a piece. However with Black's 10th move I thought I saw another intention of her ninth move and White must be careful. For example 11... B[ b7 ] 12. [ B d2 ] [ N g4 ] and now 13... [ B x f3 ] is a major threat that is hard for White to meet. For this reason I was already planning my next move in the event of the reply 11... B[ b7 ] (and it wasn't 12. Bd2).
 [ h3 ]  [ g6 ] , [ d3 ]  This move IMO was rather passive. Perhaps [ N c3 ] was better.
 [ g3 ]  [ f5 ]  [ K g2 ]  [ b6 ]  [ R h f1 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ N e1 ]  [ f x e4 ]  [ N x d3 ] , [ e3 + ]  Seemed more forcing than exd3. I'm not sure how good it really is. Though it was sufficient for this game.
 [ h4 ]  [ b4 ]  [ N a4 ] , [ d5 ]  The move 12...d5? opens up the black position where white is better developed with a safe king. Black's position is not yet developed and the king is still in the center.
 [ R f d8 ] , [ N d4 ]  and now the return of the knight my only clear soldier.
 [ B d3 ] , [ d5 ]  White's advantage is founded on Black's d-pawn taking two moves to reach d5.
 [ B x f3 ]  [ g x f3 ]  [ Q e1 + ]  [ K g2 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ Q f4 ]  [ R e2 + ]  [ K h3 ]  [ Q f1 + ]  [ K h4 ]  [ Q f2 + ]  [ Q g3 ] , [ Q c5 ]  White's King Queen perishes after 23.[ Q g5 ] (forced) [ R h2 ]  [ Q b3 ]  [ Q x d3 + ]  [ Q x d3 ] , [ N x d3 ]  
 [ N c5 ] , [ b3 ]  The best way to defend a Pawn is with another Pawn in most cases.
 [ R x e4 + ]  [ K f3 ]  [ R e7 ]  [ f1 = Q ]  [ R f7 + ]  [ K e2 ]  [ R x f1 ]  [ K x f1 ]  [ K x d6 ] , [ K e2 ]  White can't capture my pawns since moving to the 7th rank would allow my a-pawn to queen.
 [ g3 ] , [ Q e4 ]  White is almost forced into a queen exchange now.
 [ N h4 ]  [ R f g8 ]  [ N h x g6 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ N h4 ]  [ R d f8 ]  [ R f3 ] , [ B x e5 ]  The thing I have been watchful of is the two Bishops he has. I have been careful not to give them an open diagonal toward my King's side. Now he has traded one Bishop so I will be less worried about the other. I also may go after that pawn on d now that the dangerous Bishop is gone.
 [ N e5 ]  [ N f x e5 ] , [ f x e5 ]  This was a tough move for me to make. The alternative was to capture with the bishop which might have resulted in trading off his knight for the bishop and then my pawn recapture. This would remove both strong knights from the game and give me a strong center. I decided to go this route as I wanted to maintain the bishop on the king side and even though the knight on [ c4 ] is storng it doesn't have enough support to launch an immedate attack. The biggest drawback to this move is that I have cut off the queen from the bishop.
 [ N f3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ e4 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ B b5 + ]  [ c6 ]  [ B a4 ]  [ Q a5 + ] , [ B d2 ]  I had a few options here. I could capture either of his B's or retreat my Q. In the end I decided to capture the DSB and sac my N.
 [ e6 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ d5 ]  White would love it if Black chose to trade his d pawn for White's c pawn.
 [ Q e5 ]  [ Q x f1 + ]  [ K d2 ]  [ R f8 ]  [ N g3 ]  [ Q g2 + ]  [ N c e2 ]  [ d6 ] , [ Q g7 ]  Uh no the knight (e8) is covering that square.
 [ R b7 ] , [ Q a5 ]  Blunder. Now the game is lost. Not the first time I've lost a game by moving my Q out of the fray.
 [ N x f3 ]  [ K x f3 ]  [ N x h5 ] , [ d4 ]  I'm not sure why white played but it doesn't matter since he doesn't have any good moves left. Having said that I would resign here. Having said that I'm going to stop commenting on white's moves until later on.
 [ B x c4 ]  [ B a3 ]  [ Q x d5 ]  [ Q x d5 ]  [ B x d5 ]  [ B x f8 ]  [ R h x f8 ]  [ N h4 ]  [ a6 ]  [ R f d1 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ R d4 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ a3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ e x d6 ]  [ R x d6 ]  [ R a d1 ]  [ g5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ R f d8 ] , [ R d4 x d6 ]  Possibly a better move would have been [ N e5 ] for better position. It gets the knight involved in the attack.
 [ B g7 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N x b5 ]  [ N x b5 ] , [ a6 ]  Here my opponent breaks away from theory. Usually one waits to push the pawn reserving the option of moving it to [ a5 ] in one move. The rook usually moves to the b-file to push the b-pawn after that.
 [ N f6 ] , [ N f3 ]  13 moves to mate...
 [ R d1 + ]  [ K c7 ]  [ R d6 ] , [ Q e8 ]  Blunder. Probably as important as the sacrifice in the outcome - but that's less romantic.
 [ R c1 ]  [ Q a2 ]  [ R x c8 ]  [ Q x a3 ]  [ Q e5 + ]  [ K h6 ]  [ R g8 ]  [ Q x b4 ]  [ Q f4 + ]  [ K h5 ]  [ Q g4 + ]  [ K h6 ] , [ Q h4 # ]  
 [ B x g3 ]  [ f x g3 ]  [ R x g3 + ] , [ K h2 ]  begining of the end
 [ B c5 ] , [ b4 ]  This is the move for the Evans Gambit. You give away this pawn for a chance to develop faster.
 [ c4 ]  [ e6 ] , [ N c3 ]  White plays the main line to use against most "Indian" defences.
 [ R c c7 ] , [ R h5 ]  the other weakness I needed to address the rook defends [ h7 ] and the mate threat [ R x h7 + ] [ K g8 ] [ R g7 + ] [ K f8 ] [ R h8 + + ] also pust some presure over [ h2 ] so I expect [ K g1 ] or [ K g2 ] the rook is overcharged but white doesn't have any way of profiting from it we've reached a stand on situation it's a draw now I'm sure...
 [ K b1 ] , [ R c8 ]  with this move i am seeing a forced draw but opponent timed out then
 [ B x c5 ]  [ R x c5 ] , [ N d4 ]  No pawn no attack and if [ b6 ] instead Rb5.
 [ d4 ] , [ d5 ]  The usual position in the french defense. It generally leads to closed positions after 3. e5. However I had a different idea.
 [ f x e3 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ b3 ] , [ B x c4 ]  Trading off the other set of Bishops.
 [ a2 ]  [ R d1 ] , [ N a3 ]  Preparing to block the rook off with [ N b1 ]  [ R d2 + ] , [ N c2 ]  Only move to hold the draw
 [ B x f4 ] , [ a x b5 ]  Now the [ R a8 ] develops incidentally but very usefully creating an 'avenue-of-attack' on the a-file which soon becomes a highway. This eventuality is one reason why ...[ [ a6 ] ] was chosen over ...[ [ c6 ] ] on move 14. Other considerations would have been that ...[ [ c6 ] ] would have bolstered [ d5 ] but also weakened [ d6 ] & that dark diagonal thru b8; also that ...[ [ a6 ] ] left open an option to develop N[ [ c6 ] ] (rather than Nbd7) if desired which would have made ...[ e5 ] unveiling the [ B c8 ] attack upon WT's [ Q h3 ] a powerful immediate threat.
 [ N c2 ] , [ b5 ]  I felt this was pretty much forced is there anything better?
 [ R g5 ]  [ N e8 ]  [ R x g4 ]  [ N d6 ]  [ f6 + ]  [ K e6 ]  [ K a2 ]  [ N e8 ]  [ R f4 ]  [ N c7 ]  [ R x a4 ]  [ N d5 ] , [ R a6 + ]  St George prepares to call in the reinforcements
 [ e6 ] , [ d6 ]  I donot wanted to open the line on my undefended bishop.
 [ e x d4 ]  [ B f3 ] , [ R e8 ]  Taking control of the open file and threatening with a discovered check
 [ N h5 ] , [ B g3 ]  Against such a strong opponent I won't go for experiments like [ B [ g5 ] ] [ h6 ] [ B h4 ] [ f4 ] [ f3 ] [ g5 ] Bf2.
 [ d x e4 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ Q x e4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ Q c2 ]  [ O-O ] , [ B e2 ]  ?!
 [ e4 ]  [ Q e6 ]  [ N g6 ]  [ R f e8 ] , [ e5 ]  The black peices are being run out of squares.
 [ B c4 + ] , [ K d7 ]  [ e6 + ] looks very tempting. I can even sac [ f2 ] in order to play [ R d2 + ]  [ N g5 ] , [ a6 ]  ? Much more important was to cover...
 [ b4 ]  [ N d2 ] , [ B a6 ]  Seeing that my bishop won't be useful now in the center I put it to use and direct to the queenside.
 [ b4 ]  [ B d2 ]  [ a5 ]  [ b3 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ B x e4 ] , [ d x e4 ]  Think this exchange was a little bit favorable for me.
 [ d3 ] , [ N d6 ]  So she protects. And I will not hesitate to liquidate Queens. Not only do I exchange but this will lose castling rights for Mariann at once.
 [ Q d7 ] , [ Q x c5 ]  And Black resigned. I threaten [ Q c7 ] which can only be stopped by 25...Bd8. I wonder if he saw this defence. Probably he was fed up with this game and with chess altogether (it was the last round of a 6-round Swiss). I think this game showed very well how a weak backward pawn can be used as a target because it can only be defended by pieces. Thanks for reading. I hope you enjoyed the annotation.

 [ B b7 ] , [ B c2 ]  Adding a guard to the KP.
 [ Q e2 ] , [ N g f6 ]  Now black is well on top with better development and an extra pawn.
 [ B x d8 ]  [ N x f1 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ B x d6 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N b3 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ f3 ]  [ N e3 ] , [ R d3 ]  I will now be a bit up but awkward pawn Credit to minjas he now fights like a demon
 [ N g3 ]  [ K h7 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ R g8 ] , [ K f2 ]  White's monarch seeks safety behind his own attacking forces.
 [ N g5 ]  [ f x e4 ]  [ N e6 ]  [ B x e6 ]  [ d x e6 ]  [ Q e7 ] , [ g4 ]  18. I hardly considered this must be a critical position because soon black is in trouble but here I was still happily taking pawns on [ c5 ] thinking I could shore things up with [ c6 ] and be fine
 [ B a8 ] , [ Q g4 ]  The White Queen is aiming against the Black King!
 [ K g7 ] , [ K f1 ]  This move is a clear blunder and serves no purpose to White. White has put his king in the open file. And Black also has the opportunity to capture the Rank 2 and then white king is stuck in the very first file it is standing on. This move is the biggest mistake that cost white's game. Always avoid such position. Never let your opponent to restrict your king in the first rank!!!
 [ B e3 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ B x d4 ]  [ c x d4 ] , [ N b1 ]  I would think [ N d4 ] is obviously better but the computer doesn't agree. Hmmm....?
 [ R x g8 + ]  [ K x g8 ]  [ Q g4 + ]  [ K f7 ]  [ Q f5 + ] , [ R f6 ]  If Black plays 26.../[ K e7 ] White wins the queen by playing 27.[ R x b7 ]  [ Q x h7 + ] , [ K e8 ]  Now White wins some more material but Black had no sufficient alternative: 27.../[ K f8 ] 28.[ N g6 + ] (.../[ K e8 ] 29.Qg8+/[ K e7 ] 30.Nxe5+/[ Q x e5 ] 31.Rxb7+/[ N c7 ] 32.Bf4) -- 27.../[ K e6 ] 28.[ Q g8 + ] and then: a) 28.../[ Q f7 ] 29.Qc8+/[ Q d7 ] (29.../[ K e7 ] 30.Rxb7+) 30.Qxd7+/[ K x d7 ] 31.[ R x b7 + ] and [ R x a7 ] -- b) 28.../[ R f7 ] 29.Qg4+/[ K e7 ] (if the king enters the d-file [ R d1 + ] follows and 29.../[ K f6 ] loses the queen after Bg5+) 30.[ N g6 + ] and then [ Q e6 + ] or [ R d1 + ] winning decisive amount of material -- c) 28.../[ K e7 ] 29.[ B g5 ]  [ e4 ] , [ e5 ]  A very common opening I use it in many of my games
 [ K f4 ] , [ N x e5 ]  I wasn't worried just yet since I didn't realize he has a nasty check on [ f7 ] as well. I consider [ B e6 ] for a moment but it doesn't work.
 [ B c1 + ] , [ B f4 ]  White's DB moves to check king at [ c1 ] and black replies with DB at [ f4 ] which is protected by the 2 rooks which are now on the f file. This also allows black to take the bishop from the white king's clutches as it was at risk of being taken.
 [ R x f6 + ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ f4 ]  [ B e4 ]  [ B g4 ] , [ B f5 ]  [ B h5 ] doesn't give me anything...
 [ B c4 ] , [ d5 ]  That pawn chain however was of no concern because of my e pawn. With that being said I'll exchange before retreating again.
 [ B b4 ]  [ B d2 ]  [ O-O ]  [ e3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ] , [ B e2 ]  All very standard opening moves up to now. Hardly main line variations but no errors
 [ R e1 ]  [ N e7 ]  [ R b1 ] , [ O-O ]  In this situation White's pieces aim all towards the kings side but have no real means of causing any harm. Meanwhile black can start to apply pressure on the queens side with two half-open files
 [ Q f6 ]  [ B x d4 ]  [ c x d4 ] , [ R f1 ]  Original note "and again"
 [ N f5 ] , [ Q b6 ]  Finally moved the Queen out of danger but I should taken the pawn.
 [ R b8 ] , [ B e3 ]  The only logical move I think.
 [ B x f4 ] , [ Q x f4 ]  I even have a shadow of a check in e3! Oh! :-). To be truthful I was looking for [ R h7 ] and after the exchanges take the [ h6 ] pawn. But this leaves me against two joined pawns for an endgame so even if I survive the storm I'm doomed.
 [ c x d5 ]  [ B x d5 ]  [ b3 ] , [ O-O ]  16. ...... 0-0 - I finally decide that the kingside is the safer of the two locations - at least white does not have his dark squared bishop!
 [ d6 ]  [ N x g4 ] , [ R f4 ]  I didn't foresee before [ d4 ] will fall.
 [ d4 ] , [ N f6 ]  Team Match I'm playing black. My opponent opens with his queen's pawn so I go Indian.
 [ Q x c3 + ] , [ K e2 ]  I don't want to trade queens because I see a trap that I want to do later on
 [ R h1 ] , [ R f2 + ]  I don't remember why I decided to capture the bishop but like i just mentioned it's causing no trouble and should be left alone. Fortunately I remembered that before my next move. [ R f8 ] [ R h8 ] or [ h5 ] are all better.
 [ K h7 ] , [ B f8 ]  As planned.
 [ K x g7 ]  [ a4 ] , [ Q g2 # ]  
 [ R x d3 ]  [ R x d3 ]  [ K x d3 ] , [ K x e5 ]  I'm still a piece under but I have two pawns. Will they be enough to drawn?
 [ Q x d4 ]  [ Q h6 ] , [ c4 ]  At this point I look to exploit my well placed rooks on the queenside and hopefully create a passed pawn
 [ e x f4 ]  [ B x c8 ]  [ R x c8 ]  [ g x f4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ O-O-O ] , [ N g4 ]  Aiming at forking the white's king and rook. However if that fails can use it as a quick way to defend against a check from white's rook on the e-file by moving to the protected square [ e3 ]  [ B x a3 + ]  [ K b1 ] , [ N x a5 ]  Aiming at briging my knight into play at c4. The two knights will defend eachother and will confine the white king to [ a1 ] [ a2 ] and b1.
 [ Q a5 + ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ d5 ]  take over the center. good strategy.
 [ K h1 ]  [ R a d8 ]  [ Q g5 ]  [ N f5 ] , [ N e4 ]  this is where i formulated a plan for a checkmate i wanted him to take this knight so i could open the f file for my rook and queen to link up and couse real threats...
 [ h5 ]  [ Q d7 ] , [ h6 + ]  Now bringing the rook back into the game will be very difficult. Alternative variation: 20. [ N x e6 + ] [ f x e6 ] 21. [ h x g6 ] [ h x g6 ] 22. [ Q g5 ] [ Q c7 ] 23. [ N e2 ] [Black cannot try to capture the knight.] [ K f7 ] (23. ... [ Q c2 + ] 24. [ K a1 ] [ Q x e2 ] [And now mate comes.] 25. [ Q x e7 + ] [ K g8 ] 26. [ Q x e6 + ] [ K g7 ] 27. [ Q f6 + ] [ K g8 ] 28. [ R x h8 # ] ) 24. [ N d4 ] [ Q d7 ] 25. [ f4 ] [Perhaps a stronger line for White.]
 [ K x f7 ] , [ Q h5 + ]  So I tried one more thing with this move.
 [ B x f5 ] , [ Q x f5 ]  We exchange. Now that pawn on [ d5 ] really is looking vulnerable...
 [ K b8 ]  [ Q b6 + ] , [ K a8 ]  I hope you enjoyed the game as much as I did! Feel free to leave your comment. Thank you.
 [ N g4 + ] , [ K e1 ]  11. [ K e1 ] - on second thoughts would [ K g1 ] been an improvement here?
 [ d4 ] , [ B f2 ]  Safeway chooses to reinforce the corner-fort
 [ O-O ]  [ d4 ] , [ B g4 ]  White regains the pawn with superior development.
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ d6 ]  2. ........ [ d6 ] - the Philidor's Defence Freddy decides to back up his e pawn with a pawn. Freddy plays into a line where an early queen trade ensues.
 [ Q x b4 ] , [ B b3 ]  hmm opening up his rooks file. and preventing my queen from taking the b pawn. judicious choice over taking my [ d4 ] pawn immediately with one of his knights.
 [ Q x f3 ]  [ c x b4 ] , [ c4 ]  Presumably noticing the assault after 11. [ c x b4 ] [ f x b4 + ] that would deny the castle. My opponent made another mistake!
 [ R x f5 ] , [ R a d1 ]  Challenging black for control of the open d file.
 [ K c2 ]  [ N b4 + ]  [ K b2 ]  [ N d3 + ]  [ B x d3 ] , [ K x d3 ]  39. ........ Kxd3!! This move forces resignation from me on the grounds of ruinous loss of material. I can move the knight away to [ b1 ] for example but he will then play his king to [ e2 ] next move cleaning up all the pawns on the kingside. Moral here: If you can safely do so here is this principle:- In the endgame if in doubt - get king out!!
 [ O-O-O ]  [ Q d7 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ a6 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ O-O-O ] , [ K b1 ]  Simply consolidating the castling position. By the way here is a nice little tip about castling: "Castling Queenside on average is slightly better than castling on the kingside. The reason is that activity is the idea of a chess game. By castling long the rook is activated immediately since usually the d pawn is advanced. Most cases the f pawn is not advanced and it takes extra turn to move the rook to a central file. Many can say that [ K b1 ] takes a tempo too. However it is not always obligatory while moving the rook to central file is almost always obligatory.
 [ a4 ]  [ K d2 ]  [ N h5 ] , [ N d3 ]  37. [ N d3 ] - Either the [ g3 ] or the [ h3 ] white pawns is a gonner so I concentrate on liquidating Wolfgang's queenside pawns.
 [ K b3 ]  [ K f6 ]  [ K b4 ]  [ g5 ]  [ R d1 ]  [ h5 ]  [ K a5 ]  [ g4 ]  [ h x g4 ]  [ h x g4 ]  [ R b1 ] , [ N c5 ]  My plan seems to be proceeding well.
 [ Q d3 ]  [ N b d7 ]  [ Q d2 ] , [ N g4 ]  The pawn at [ h6 ] is in danger of 13. Bxh6. This knight move defends the pawn. The knight can be driven away by 13. [ h3 ] but then it simply captures with 13. ... [ N x e3 ] and without the DSB white has no attack on the black pawn at h6.
 [ b6 ] , [ b4 ]  There are few other choices.
 [ B x a2 ] , [ Q e2 ]  Even though material equality has been re-established White still has a winning position because of his central control. The center is always the most important area of the board whether you control it with your pawns (classical) or your pieces (hyper-modern) is your decision.
 [ f x e5 ] , [ d6 ]  ...nor this one but I never like to go pawn-hunting too early on - if you can't deal with the developmental advantage that your opponent gains you'll be in a lot of trouble!
 [ O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ b6 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ B b7 ] , [ N d f3 ]  The knights are poised to put pressure on the black position
 [ B d7 ] , [ B h5 + ]  this starts the real trouble for black. [ g6 ] creates problems [ N f7 ] is also trouble - so perhaps black did the best thing by moving the K
 [ g4 ] , [ Q x g4 ]  I initially thought that without taking the pawn black could escape but the queen is too short on squares. After 28. ... [ Q h3 ] 29. Re3! it's trapped and black doesn't even get the knight. (edit) but [ Q g6 ] is unclear
 [ N x e4 ]  [ d x e4 ] , [ B x e4 ]  a series of exchanges i would imagine that we both felt happy with things
 [ e6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ d5 ] , [ N c3 ]  3. [ N c3 ] - this is the Winawer develops a piece and contests e4.
 [ Q x e4 + ]  [ K d2 ]  [ Q e2 + ] , [ K c1 ]  at this time i realize that i was quite lost ...i was thining in puting my king in [ f8 ] to escape the mate but then : 22. ...-K[ f8 ] 23.[ Q h8 + ] - [ K e7 ] 24.[ R h1 ] [ e1 ] !! and i lose the queen ...So i found the way to exchange the queens lucky lucky lucky !
 [ B e7 ] , [ N f5 ]  Moved three times same knight before move 7. now that is a bad sign. if black now captures with bishop 6...[ B x f5 ] you will notice that you have spent 3 whole moves moving your knight yet black can capture it in one move.
 [ c5 ]  [ d5 ]  [ d6 ] , [ c4 ]  Im still thinking im ok in establishing control of the center
 [ B h6 + ]  [ K f7 ]  [ R g7 + ]  [ K f8 ] , [ R x e7 + ]  
 [ B x f2 + ]  [ N x f2 ]  [ Q g3 ]  [ R f1 ] , [ B d5 ]  no escape from the mate
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ] , [ f4 ]  Normally I play 2.[ N c3 ] but as I have trained this one so I wanted to give a try in this game.
 [ B d3 ]  [ c x d6 ]  [ c x d6 ] , [ R f4 ]  No matter what now black will go down in material. Plus with pawn majorities on both sides of the board white's triumph is assured.
 [ N x e5 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ N d7 ] , [ e4 ]  hoping for pawn trade here
 [ R h2 + ]  [ K c3 ]  [ R a2 ]  [ R d3 + ]  [ K c6 ]  [ R e3 ] , [ R a3 + ]  41. [ R a3 ] - hip hip hooray! A king and pawn ending! White cannot avoid this. I think that my 39th move with the rook to [ a2 ] attacking the a pawn set this up. I can pick off the white a pawn with my king if I wish but after analysing the board I find I can safely shepherd my passer on the f file home to queen and this is exactly what happens now.
 [ h5 ] , [ N d5 ]  Finally sensing the danger to his king Black decides to attack with the only two pieces he has at his disposal however this move leads to a forced mate.
 [ K f3 ]  [ Q e7 ]  [ N d3 ] , [ e5 ]  Opens the very dangerous diagonal for the light squared Bishop
 [ e x d5 ] , [ c x d5 ]  This leads to a very complicated game. [ N x d5 ] is probably better removing the [ N f6 ] from the defense: 14. [ N x d5 ] [ N x d5 ] 15. [ c x d5 ] [ N a5 ] 16. [ Q c2 ] [ g6 ] 17. [ R a d1 ] [ B f6 ] =
 [ g5 ]  [ N e8 ]  [ g x f6 ] , [ Q d8 ]  If 38... Q-[ Q3 ] 39 P-[ B7 ] N-[ N2 ] 40 R-[ B6 ] increases the pressure.
 [ Q c7 ] , [ Q e5 ]  and again!
 [ h5 ]  [ a4 ]  [ b x a4 ] , [ R x a4 ]  38. [ R x a4 ] - I now have two connected passed pawns on the b and c column but what will the BR and the BK do? I'm about to find out.
 [ Q g4 ] , [ B a7 ]  Preparing ...Rb4! Both sides have deadly force and are ready to rumble--the question now is who can bring the hammer down hardest.
 [ K h6 ]  [ K g2 ]  [ B d1 ] , [ K h3 ]  Absolutely necessary was here 50 [ N c6 ] [ B f4 ] 51 [ N e5 ] [ B x e5 ] 52 de [ B x g4 ] draw.
 [ a4 ]  [ b5 ] , [ a5 ]  The only good choice here.
 [ h x g5 ]  [ Q x g5 + ]  [ K f8 ] , [ R c1 ]  Keep the queen there for now and defend my weak pawns using my rook.
 [ N e2 ] , [ N c5 ]  Since as we're seeing frequently I don't see the point of this move. Since this keeps happening there's a lot that I'm missing which is another way of knowing that Joe is facing strong opposition.
 [ B g4 ] , [ h3 ]  12 moves to mate...
 [ O-O ]  [ B b7 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N d f3 ] , [ c4 ]  Black relieves the tension in the centre and moves the bishop away from attacking the [ h7 ] square
 [ d6 ]  [ d4 ] , [ B e6 ]  10. ........ [ B e6 ] - still in the database.
 [ B d7 ] , [ Q a6 ]  Can't see any purpose behind this move but it leaves his Queen off in a corner
 [ Q b4 + ]  [ Q d2 ] , [ Q b6 ]  Defeats the aggressive alternative 6...[ d x c4 ] beaten by 7. [ a3 ] [ Q b6 ] 8.Bxc4.
 [ c x d4 ] , [ Q f4 ]  Now I have to defend my knight queen unusable...
 [ K e2 ] , [ Q h4 ]  Ok at this point I am starting to get excited...I see a few Checkmates if I can just get the right move. I am actually hoping for my Rook bait to force the knight to jump....which will result in Checkmate with Qf2. [personal scared level is replaced with the [personal excitement level = HIGH]...maybe actually too high....I have to slow down and not let me blunder right back.
 [ K d8 ]  [ B e5 ]  [ Q f8 ]  [ d4 ] , [ c5 ]  This would be alright if it wasn't for...
 [ N x e5 ]  [ B x e5 ] , [ Q b7 ]  White's d-file pressure and dark square Q B battery make it difficult for Black to avoid slipping into a passive position.
 [ R d8 ]  [ Q g3 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ Q h4 ]  [ Q b6 ]  [ R e f1 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ R c d1 ]  [ B b8 ]  [ Q x h7 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ f4 ]  [ Q c6 ]  [ f5 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ Q g6 + ]  [ K g8 ]  [ g3 ]  [ B c6 + ]  [ K h2 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ R d e1 ]  [ R d8 ]  [ R f2 ]  [ Q b6 ]  [ R f e2 ]  [ Q b5 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ R d7 ] , [ h4 ]  perfect way to seal the deal by marching the pawn down... I'm completely tied up and helpless
 [ a4 ]  [ a6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ B g5 ]  [ h6 ]  [ B h4 ]  [ B a7 ] , [ N b d2 ]  Joining rooks and queen and developping.
 [ N c3 ] , [ b5 ]  Black chooses to expand early on the queenside without even developing a piece. This is the so-called minority attack: Black has a 3 vs. 2 minority on the queenside so if two pairs of pawns are exchanged white is left with an isolated pawn on that side of the board which can be attacked easily by the open lines that are created.
 [ f6 ]  [ e x f6 ] , [ N x f6 ]  well it works like this also but i weakened my king side a bit.
 [ e6 ] , [ O-O ]  White castles.
 [ Q f4 ]  [ a4 ]  [ h4 ]  [ a x b3 ]  [ a x b3 ]  [ R a3 ]  [ R e3 ] , [ R b8 ]  Black hasn't quite glimmered on to the fact that White doesn't care about the b-pawn because he's after Black's King.
 [ O-O ]  [ N x b3 ]  [ a x b3 ] , [ d6 ]  Not only developing a center pawn but preparing to get her LSB into play in such a way that she doesn't have to fianchetto it. In addition Joann has another solid pawn chain with this move.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ] , [ d4 ]  Offering to go into Danish lines that would probably transpose into Goring or Scotch Gambits after 2...ed 3.[ N f3 ] a white move order favored by a United States Champion GM Frank Marshall.
 [ d4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ e3 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ c3 ]  [ d5 ] , [ N f3 ]  ...and we reach a "normal" London setting.
 [ Q x d6 ]  [ B b4 ] , [ c5 ]  Now there is not a knight threat on the 5th row so no problem in breaking my fortress if I am winning tempo and occupying the center in the process.
 [ N d6 ] , [ B c6 ]  Only move but sufficient
 [ B d2 ]  [ R a8 ] , [ N g e2 ]  I wanted to keep [ f4 ] option open
 [ R x g6 + ]  [ K f8 ]  [ R f6 + ] , [ K e7 ]  ! Much better than Ke8. White has one more check and then lacks a good follow-up.
 [ B e7 ]  [ O-O ] , [ b5 ]  Starting the attack on the queen-side. Also probably looking at [ B b7 ] to put some nice pressure on the e pawn.
 [ B f4 ] , [ B x f4 ]  [ B d4 + ] would have kept the tempo up.
 [ g6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ B d7 ] , [ Q d2 ]  7. [ Q d2 ] - standard moves leading to a Yugoslav type attack.
 [ B x f5 + ] , [ g x f5 ]  Juicy pawns in front of two minor pieces... chuckle I have to be accurate exploiting them.
 [ B g5 ] , [ N d7 ]  Black needs to be careful not to fianchetto his bishop because his d-pawn is very weak especailly after I double my rooks on the d-file.
 [ Q x c3 + ] , [ K e2 ]  No castling now for white. Black should aim to get his king away from the centre quickly
 [ K c7 ] , [ N c4 ]  Nc4! Black's Bishop is already half dead.. A Perfect example of Good Knight Vs Bad Bishop
 [ d4 ]  [ Q f6 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ B b4 + ]  Looks dangerous but there is a defense
 [ h6 ] , [ B f4 ]  Directly threaten the black queen for the third and final time.
 [ h4 ]  [ Q c4 ]  [ h3 ] , [ g3 ]  In his place I would play [ Q c6 ] or Rxd4.
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N g5 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ B x f7 + ]  [ K e7 ]  [ B c4 ] , [ R f8 ]  6. ...... [ R f8 ] - this seems to be a fairly standard move in the Traxler and so are my next two moves.
 [ e6 ] , [ N c3 ]  3. [ N f3 ] is the other common move.
 [ Q c2 ] , [ a5 ]  prevent white pawn on [ a5 ] and consolidate the black bishop
 [ Q b7 ]  [ c4 ]  [ R d8 ] , [ Q c1 ]  Move queen to safety in case black advances the d pawn.
 [ e x f4 ] , [ B x f4 ]  Here c5-[ c4 ] was an option but with an open line for the rook and no mood for calculations... :) I decided to hide the king and give up a pawn...
 [ R b1 ]  [ R c7 ]  [ R b8 ]  [ R g7 ] , [ N x f6 ]  [ N f8 ] [ R g8 ] Nd7!? saves the knight for the time being but after ...[ R x b8 ] [ N x b8 ] it is confined passively in the other corner. White prefers an ending with four passed pawns against rook.
 [ R x b7 ]  [ B x c5 ]  [ R c7 ] , [ B b6 ]  Now my bishop and my a-pawn is untouchable.
 [ K e1 ]  [ g2 ]  [ K d1 ]  [ g1 = Q + ]  [ K c2 ] , [ K e4 ]  White's had enough. This has been my longest game on GameKnot so far. In fact it's 13 moves longer than my former longest. Well played by white.
 [ N a4 ] , [ b6 ]  White's knight is not threatening to me and allows me to free up my light squared bishop without losing tempo.
 [ d4 ]  [ N b1 ] , [ N c6 ]  Of course we should use the pieces not the pawns. if we have a choice.
 [ K g1 ] , [ N f5 ]  Stick a fork in him. He's done.
 [ a6 ] , [ N f3 ]  I had to prefer to develop but I really needed the knight to be guarding [ h4 ] and have a look on d4.
 [ B x c4 ]  [ B x c4 ]  [ R c8 ]  [ B d5 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ Q b3 ]  A lively move threatening the pawn on [ b7 ] but also putting pressure on f7.
 [ N g6 ] , [ e5 ]  More pressure on my knight... and a critical juncture in the game.
 [ N c4 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ N d6 ] , [ b6 ]  Now my position is safe. White still have a small advantage.
 [ b4 ] , [ e5 ]  Another Fast Ladder game. Strangely enough this is the second time in a week that I've faced the Sokolsky a.k.a. Orangutan a.k.a. Polish opening. Is this opening growing in popularity? If interested see my annotation http://gameknot.com/annotation.pl/swarming-the-uncastle?gm=25460 annotated on 7/28/2009. Black's response is the King's Pawn Variation.
 [ N f3 ] , [ h6 ]  Ignores the center and development so I develop.
 [ B f2 ]  [ g4 ] , [ N h2 ]  this really strikes one as an oversight. but is it? 12 [ N f d2 ] [ g3 ] 13 [ B g1 ] [ N x h4 ] may not be appealing for white.
 [ Q h6 ] , [ R e1 ]  When in doubt strike down the middle.
 [ B f5 ]  [ d3 ] , [ e6 ]  Black prepares a break in the center at d5.
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ N c6 ]  The four knights game. I was pretty sure what my opponent was going to do and I had a plan waiting for him.........my prediction was [ B g5 ] then he would take my knight.
 [ c x b2 ] , [ B x b2 ]  I recall seeing this for the first time as a schoolboy. The line seemed so fraught with possibilities the way those bishops raked down towards Black's undeveloped position. As it turns out Black's lack of development leaves him a position flexible in defence.
 [ b6 ] , [ e4 ]  White obliges by taking the classical center setup with pawns on [ d4 ] and [ e4 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ O-O ]  [ d6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ N d7 ]  Ok this is getting ridiculous...
 [ B x e5 ]  [ d x e5 ] , [ B x c2 ]  in panic already...
 [ d4 ] , [ K c7 ]  Black's King to C7 is good move! and good move for me is Knight to [ c3 ] in order to free my piece giving air but I
 [ B x c4 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ B x e6 ] , [ f x e6 ]  Bishop trade
 [ N c3 ]  [ d5 ] , [ e3 ]  Normally I would exchange [ c x d5 ] but the odd opening would have put ne in a bad position so [ e3 ] defends [ c4 ] with the B This precludes my fav Bremen variation - [ g3 ] [ B g2 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ a3 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ d x c4 ]  [ B x c4 ]  [ N b d7 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ Q c2 ]  [ c5 ]  [ R d1 ]  [ b6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ d x c5 ]  [ N x c5 ]  [ N b5 ]  [ N c e4 ]  [ B d2 ]  [ B c5 ] , [ B d3 ]  Up to here my use of general opening guidelines had served me well but now i moved the wrong B. Better was [ B c3 ] aligning Q & both Bs on the K defenses
 [ B e7 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ] , [ Q c4 + ]  Thus begins my forced checkmate.
 [ K f2 ]  [ K e6 ] , [ g x f5 + ]  ?
 [ N x f5 ]  [ N g5 ]  [ N e3 ]  [ R d3 ] , [ K g4 ]  [ R d1 ] had crossed my mind which the computer said was the best move.
 [ K d7 ] , [ B c1 ]  I did not want lose the bishop to the knight also I played this for any future back rank problems where the bishop already on [ c1 ] would make the difference. Again [ b a7 ] was the better move as it would have provided useful threats coming from a bishop on b8.
 [ R e3 e1 + ]  [ N x e1 ] , [ R x e1 # ]  And mate. Now I think that I'm ready to face the day. Better go get some breakfast...
 [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ g6 ]  The first time I deviate from the most-played moves in the database. Usually 5...[ a6 ] is played here which is called the Najdorf. 5...[ g6 ] as played in the game is the Dragon variation. This is a very sharp opening with chances for both sides. Black is planning to play ...[ B g7 ] ...O-O ...[ R c8 ] ...[ Q a5 ] and push the pawns on the queenside (in this game we don't see Black pushing his pawns) and his attack often involves a Rook sac on [ c3 ] after it has moved to c8. White has ideas of an attack on the position of the Black King (which will be on g8) for example with [ B e3 ] [ B c4 ] (or [ B e2 ] as in this game) [ Q d2 ] O-O-O and push the pawns on the kingside. I like to play this as both sides.
 [ B d2 ] , [ K f2 ]  Black's plan is to force White to expend moves defending the e-pawn and threaten to exploit the weak a-pawn. White's move was forced.
 [ R e1 ]  [ b5 ]  [ B b3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ c3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ h3 ]  [ N a5 ] , [ B c2 ]  Until this move is all coded the classical line in the closed Spanish. But here I introduced a very interesting move...
 [ Q e1 ] , [ B d2 ]  !! Now if [ Q x d2 ] then: [ Q x b1 + ] [ K f2 ] [ Q f1 ] [ K e3 ] [ e1 = Q + ]  [ Q x d2 ]  [ Q x b1 + ]  [ K f2 ] , [ Q f1 + ]  Here my opponent resigns. Thanks for reading. Hope you enjoyed!
 [ B e4 ]  [ Q d7 ] , [ Q h6 ]  More exact would be 47. Qxg check. Anyway black resigned at this point.
 [ Q b2 ]  [ Q x c2 ]  [ Q x c2 ]  [ R x c2 ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ R x c7 ]  [ B x c7 ]  [ f4 ]  [ R f e8 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d3 ]  [ K h2 ]  [ R e6 e2 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ R b2 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ R e e2 ]  Here is where I grabbed the second rank -- the seventh rank to me playing as black. Studentofkerry is now doomed to lose.
 [ N e7 ]  [ B x c8 ]  [ R x c8 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ a6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ Q e6 ] , [ d5 ]  My center is good
 [ N e5 ] , [ Q h6 ]  I felt the zoom was gonna consume me!! This strong move requires investigation!
 [ B x f6 ] , [ g x f6 ]  Now Black's K is somewhat exposed. With good play the material advantage should still decide but Black now has to be more careful.
 [ B x c6 + ]  [ Q x c6 ] , [ B g5 ]  ?! Not sure what White was aiming at ... maybe hoping for f6?
 [ B d5 ] , [ R a7 ]  Black's undeveloped knight prevents the Rook from going to its normal [ c8 ] square. However from [ a7 ] it is ready to double at the first opportunity.
 [ Q x c3 ] , [ c4 ]  ! The idea here was to open the c file and to give the opportunity to do [ Q x e3 + ] or to free my bishop.
 [ Q x b7 + ] , [ K a5 ]  He announced mate in three.
 [ f x e4 ] , [ Q g4 ]  Threatening mate....but black proves on the next move this was a mistake.
 [ B g3 ] , [ N e5 ]  i was expecting he took whit bishop [ g3 ] in order to threaten [ h2 ]  [ N x d3 ]  [ Q x d3 ] , [ R d7 ]  there is no plan just to save time and see what happens...
 [ O-O ]  [ Q c2 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N f8 ]  [ f3 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ R a d1 ]  [ R c8 ] , [ e4 ]  Some folks prefer to play 13.[ K h1 ] first here.
 [ O-O-O ] , [ Q a3 + ]  just a check to see if white will make things easier
 [ f4 ] , [ g5 ]  Black's pieces are placed strategically. White cannot check black's king and makes a pawn capture...
 [ K f2 ]  [ K f5 ]  [ g3 ]  [ g5 ] , [ R d3 ]  This rook is so very constricted........
 [ d4 ] , [ c4 ]  Lasker: White has nothing better as 47.[ c x d4 ] would be neutralized with 47...Rb5.
 [ B x f3 ]  [ B x f3 ] , [ N d4 ]  Ion stated here - After 10...[ N d4 ] I rather liked White's anticipation of the opening of the g-file. But sometimes it's worth looking at odd-ball moves. I would certainly look at 11.[ e5 ] here with the idea 11...dx[ e5 ] 12.[ B x g7 ] [ R b8 ] 13.Ba6... Yes this trades a centre pawn for a flank pawn - not usually a desirable bargain but here Black's Q-wing is broken up and White keeps the bishop-pair. Very hard to assess. Alternatively Black might play 11...[ N x f3 ] 12.[ e x f6 ] [ N x d2 ] 13.[ f x g7 ] [ R g8 ] 14.[ R x d2 ] [ R x g7 ] 15.g3... Black has the bishop for knight but there are plenty of pawns about and White's form the tidier set. Again not easy to assess. But one might consider either outcome at least as good as the game continuation...
 [ N c3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ B x c6 ]  ? Seems like a waste of time. Better was probably 6.d4.
 [ c x d4 ] , [ N b5 ]  A lot of white pieces in my area I don't really like that but my material advantage is much better with the rook in the bag.
 [ B d6 ] , [ f4 ]  This pawn move is of course the reasoning behind White's previous move. It strengthens his Bishop's diagonal and may open the f-file against Black's uncastled King.
 [ b5 ]  [ B b3 ] , [ B d7 ]  i think this is a strange place for the bishop after [ b5 ]  [ b4 ] , [ N d5 ]  the white think to be sufficiently developped to start his attack; however Black could refuse the knife
 [ O-O ]  [ B e7 ] , [ B e3 ]  Good development on both sides so far
 [ K d7 ] , [ N x f8 + ]  Black moves badly to escape the check and is met with the loss of a rook and a double check.
 [ R d1 ] , [ R h2 ]  Cutting off all of the king's escape squares.
 [ K c1 ] , [ R f c2 + ]  This forces Black's hand.
 [ Q x d7 ]  [ R x d7 ] , [ K h2 ]  again as I said before white is just waiting... (preying)
 [ h3 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ a4 ]  [ Q b4 ] , [ a5 ]  this move just loses a pawn. i didn't know what white was trying at this point.
 [ K b4 ] , [ R c2 ]  Playing with his pawns...
 [ Q x d3 ] , [ B x a1 ]  recapturing the rook with a knight up
 [ Q a1 + ]  [ K d2 ]  [ Q x b2 ] , [ N e5 ]  And now I'm down by a pawn with nothing to show for it.
 [ d x e4 ] , [ B e5 ]  Like I said instead of recapturing Goryachkina plays this instead. And this appears to be a dangerous K side attack since it's with the pawn right in front of the monarch. So then it really boils down to how dangerous. Well that remains to be seen.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ B c4 ]  theory dictates [ B c5 ] [ c3 ] [ N f6 ] [ d4 ] etcetera leading to some breed of the Italian party: this opening is usually - providing sound play from both players - not leading to very much; so I decided to go about this differently...
 [ B x e7 ]  [ R x e7 ]  [ f3 ]  [ N g5 ]  [ h4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N x d7 ]  [ Q x d7 ]  [ h x g5 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ Q e5 ]  [ R c8 ]  [ R a c1 ]  [ Q a4 ]  [ Q d6 ]  [ R c e8 ]  [ a3 ]  [ Q b5 ] , [ b4 ]  This is a massive blunder for White. Black now has the opportunity to move [ Q a4 ] which attacks both the c and a pawns. Given White's position he can only protect one of these two pieces and when Black captures one of these pawns that remaining pawns will soon fall.
 [ B x g7 + ] , [ K e7 ]  [ N f5 ] will keep the checks going. If I can't check the rook is endangered
 [ K h8 ] , [ N f5 ]  Threatening mate!
 [ g5 ]  [ K x b5 ]  [ g4 ]  [ c4 ] , [ g3 ]  
 [ R x b7 ]  [ R x a2 ]  [ R b6 + ]  [ K g7 ] , [ K e6 ]  The most important thing in endgames is to have active pieces. Black's king is inactively placed in the corner while my king and rook are actively directed toward Black's weak kingside pawns.
 [ R a b1 ]  [ Q f6 ]  [ N h2 ]  [ Q x f3 ]  [ N x f3 ] , [ B f6 ]  19. ......... [ B x [ f6 ] ] - Fou Lenoir retreats to [ f6 ] to dodge the enemy steed's attack but maintains pressure on the [ b2 ] square.
 [ B x e4 ] , [ f x e4 ]  Again beset with choosing between the f-pawn and the d-pawn. This time I decided to keep the passed pawn on the d-file and open a half-open f-file aimed at the pinned [ f2 ] pawn.
 [ c x d7 ]  [ N x c1 ]  [ B x c1 ] , [ R a d8 ]  24. ....... [ R a d8 ] - I decided to corrall that little footman at once.
 [ N c6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ] , [ h3 ]  I don't see the point of this move. It is barely a development. If [ B g4 ] then it is justified. But if my bishop does that move then take his knight i lose a tempo in opening. Would not be a good idea.
 [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ g3 ]  Okay at this point im getting a bit in a problem. Not that my positions suck but more that im not verry known with this lines. That doesnt say that SPCMN took it wrong but it tells me more that i need to analyze this opening better. In my answere u will be seeing why.
 [ B c2 ] , [ a5 ]  the plan is to undermine the queenside white pawns.
 [ b x c3 ] , [ R x c3 ]  Offering to drain more energy out of the game...
 [ K x f2 ] , [ N e5 ]  Shredder drives away the queen and covers the [ g6 ] square [Rybka's new threat was 32.[ Q e8 + ] [ K h7 ] Bg6#]
 [ N e4 ]  [ f3 ] , [ N d6 ]  Eyeing the [ c4 ] square
 [ R h3 ] , [ N g4 ]  Viewing this I decided to give back the pawn to regain more agressive game.
 [ K e7 ] , [ N d5 # ]  Checkmate and good game so I've learned 2 knights and a bishop can do a lot of damage.
 [ N h5 ] , [ d x c5 ]  5. Nh5? was inexact. It seems that white can immediately win this knight with 6. g4? but that would be a mistake. The pawn on [ g2 ] defends white's knight on [ f3 ] which in turn defends d4. If 6. g4? black simply plays 6. ... [ c x d4 ] and now white cannot recapture as his knight is pinned and his queen is the only piece defending that pinned knight. Sure white still has 7. gxa5? [ d x c3 ] which simply exchanges knights or much better 7. [ N b5 ] [ a6 ] 8. N[ b x d4 ] [ d6 ] 9. [ e6 ] [ N f6 ] and black's knight escapes. So much simpler is to simply eliminate the concern first with 6. dxc5; black's knight is still trapped on h5.
 [ B d1 ] , [ R a e8 ]  He's up a pawn so he wants to trade. Fair enough.
 [ f x g3 ]  [ B x d3 ]  [ Q f2 ]  [ B x f1 ]  [ g x h4 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ h3 ] , [ Q f5 ]  try to exchange...
 [ Q e7 ]  [ Q d2 ] , [ N f6 ]  Still fighting for the centre.
 [ B x a8 ] , [ R x a8 ]  the resulting position after the exchange is that black is better because he has a major lead in development and piece mobility
 [ R x d1 + ] , [ K x d1 ]  Now it's a simple matter of technique.
 [ Q x b4 ]  [ g x f2 + ]  [ K x f2 ] , [ B c8 ]  Black's rook is immune to capture as it would allow White's queen to be taken.
 [ B a3 ]  [ N x a2 ] , [ B x d6 ]  Well ok. So white managed to get his pawn back. BUT! NOW there are two beautiful isolated pawns on the edge of the board. In the worst case white can probably sacrifice a knight or a bishop and get both of them but who knows maybe black can work it into some other kind of advantage.
 [ b5 ]  [ a5 ]  [ Q d7 ]  [ b4 ] , [ N d5 ]  Now my opponent goes onto the offensive.
 [ N x d5 ]  [ N e x d5 ] , [ e x d5 ]  Black is now two pawns (center pawns) down. I was expecting [ N x d5 ] in an attempt to even up the material but...
 [ Q f2 ]  [ a6 ]  [ B a4 ]  [ b5 ]  [ B b3 ] , [ O-O ]  This seems to realize black's strategic goals for the initial part of the game. The position feels good especially the black rooks' access to the queenside. Black can claim strength in the center and a queenside space advantage. The worst thing is that knight on the h-file which is the most obvious thing to attack.
 [ Q f3 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ b3 ] , [ g6 ]  As White had addressed the threat on both pawns this move seemed to offer a good way to develop my King's Bishop and prepare for Kingside castling.
 [ N e5 ] , [ B e6 ]  8. ..... [ B e6 ] - at least I can prevent a nasty threat ([ N f7 + ] forking Henry and rook) with developing a piece. Trouble is what should I do with Fou Lenoir?
 [ c x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ e4 ]  [ N x c3 ] , [ b x c3 ]  White's centre is now a thing of great beauty but watch out! Black will pile on as much pressure as he can! However I must say that I am optimistic. In preparation for a team match in which I knew that I was going to meet my arch-rival A.B. (no not jelly939 my OTHER arch-rival!). A.B.'s favourite opening for Black against the queen pawn is the Gruenfeld so I carried out extensive research on the Gruenfeld Exchange Variation in order to beat him as it were at his own game! I was relying on A.B.'s laziness in researching openings to give me a win in that game. Thankfully laziness did its part and I won in about 16 moves. So the long and short of that long story is that now I am happy about playing the sharp Gruenfeld Exchange Variation as White.
 [ Q c5 ] , [ B x d1 ]  ? if black was going to exchange queens he should have taken the queen first. why? read the next comment
 [ R c8 ]  [ N b3 ]  [ N x b3 ]  [ Q x b3 ]  [ Q a5 ]  [ R c1 ]  [ g6 ]  [ g3 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ R d1 ]  [ Q g5 ]  [ h4 ] , [ Q d8 ]  Black although up two pawns is very passive. [ c7 ] has to be protected all the time. I could maneuver for another 40 moves to try to realize a slight advantage or I could just offer my opponent a draw.
 [ B x c7 ] , [ R x c3 ]  And another...
 [ f3 ] , [ c x d5 ]  Black is still focusing on the wrong side of the board
 [ B x d7 + ] , [ Q x d7 ]  Refusing to relinquish the tempo by recapturing with the B.
 [ R f3 ]  [ f1 = Q + ]  [ R x f1 ] , [ N x f1 ]  And white resigns. Feel free to comment because my comments and analyzes can be wrong.
 [ d5 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ B g4 ]  I think the simple [ N c6 ] is better or Bd6. Trading a bishop for knight usually benefits the player with the extra bishop so White can get an advantage with [ [ [ h3 ] ] ] forcing [ B x [ f3 ] ] since [ B h5 ] [ g4 ] [ B g6 ] [ N x e5 ] wins a pawn for White. After [ [ [ h3 ] ] ] [ B x [ f3 ] ] I wasn't comfortable with doubling my pawns or moving my queen early so I didn't play [ [ [ h3 ] ] ] but now I see that my queen would've been fine on [ f3 ] and I can take advantage of Black's light square weakness with [ c4 ] later but instead I played the passive Be2.
 [ c x d5 ] , [ B g5 ]  I reply in kind with a bad move of my own rather then play the logical a3. The intention of this move was to provoke a pawn weakening. I was hoping black overlooked the exchange [ B x f3 ] [ B x d8 ] [ B x d1 ] [ R x d1 ] f6. Which leaves black with a much better game oweing to whites poorly placed bishop
 [ e x f6 ]  [ h x g5 ]  [ f x g7 ]  [ B x g7 ]  [ e4 ]  [ d4 ]  [ N b5 ]  [ e5 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ c6 ] , [ Q f3 ]  I set another trap
 [ O-O ] , [ B g4 ]  This is going to force and exchange.
 [ a3 ] , [ B x c3 + ]  White blunders with 11. a3? - he can't even play 12. [ a x b4 ] because of black's reply 12. ... Qxa1. Worse he allows white to equalize material then gain a pawn on c4.
 [ N b4 ] , [ d x c5 ]  Here I just went ahead and played dxc since I didn't think the knight on [ b4 ] was going to be that great.
 [ K g8 ] , [ Q f8 # ]  I must say this was one of my most satisfying games. Apologies to my opponent for making it public like this but few mis-steps in the opening led to a demonstration of the power of the Stonewall Attack.
 [ B x d2 + ] , [ N x d2 ]  That was what we all expected
 [ Q h2 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ B h3 ] , [ B x h3 ]  I take the trade happily increasing my share of the board.
 [ N c x b5 ]  [ Q x d2 ] , [ R x d2 ]  The Gameknot computer puts white 0.69 ahead here.
 [ N b1 d2 ]  [ N g e7 ]  [ Q x g4 ] , [ e5 ]  Building on my central control and with a discovered attack on my opponent's queen.
 [ K h4 ] , [ N f5 # ]  
 [ h3 ] , [ R h f8 ]  After white closes the h file I turn my attention to the weak pawn on [ f3 ]  [ B x h3 ] , [ N g4 ]  Here I had a choice. I could have played 24...[ B x f1 ] 25.[ N x f6 ] Bxe2. I decided to keep things a little more interesting...
 [ K e2 ]  [ K f6 ]  [ K e3 ]  [ K g5 ] , [ g3 ]  39. [ g3 ] - to stop the BK moving any further but now Freddy rolls down his f pawn.
 [ N f2 ]  [ Q b6 ] , [ R e2 ]  20. [ R e2 ] - to help protect my queenside pawns.
 [ d5 ]  [ d x e5 ] , [ d4 ]  What do the masters think about this move ?
 [ g3 ] , [ N f6 ]  ? Black makes his first real error of the game. I see a way to remove his g and h pawns and to bring all of my forces to bear on his decimated kingside before he can get over to defend.
 [ f4 ]  [ Q b4 ]  [ Q x b4 ] , [ a x b4 ]  I wasn't expecting an exchange of Queens.
 [ R x d2 ] , [ N x e4 ]  Wasted. Not really. If I simply move my knight off I lose the tempo. Here I force him to move his rook once again
 [ R d7 ] , [ N a3 ]  Finally developing the knight.
 [ g6 ]  [ B x c3 ]  [ K x c3 ]  [ K e2 ] , [ b2 ]  Now it is getting more desperate for white. He may not be able to trade the knight for both pawns he may have to trade it for a single pawn.
 [ N f3 ] , [ Q e7 ]  Black looks to attack white's e-pawn but blocks the development of black's dark-squared bishop
 [ d4 ] , [ N e4 ]  Best was 27. [ N d5 ] [ B x d5 ] 28. [ R e d3 ] [ B e4 ] 29. R3[ d2 ] [ B x d2 + ] 30. Rx[ d2 ] [ R f8 ] 31. [ Q g3 ] [ B c6 ] 32. [ K b2 ] [ Q f4 ] 33. [ R d3 ] [ Q x g3 ] 34. hxg3. This is a very bad plan.
 [ Q b3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ a4 ]  14.[ R c1 ] is better. White would contest the open file and prepare for a future Nb5.
 [ K b3 ]  [ R a6 ]  [ K b2 ]  [ R b6 + ]  [ K c2 ]  [ R a6 ]  [ K b1 ]  [ R b6 + ]  [ K c2 ]  [ R a6 ]  [ K b2 ]  [ R b6 + ]  [ K c2 ]  [ R a6 ] , [ K b2 ]  Draw was agreed.
 [ f x g3 ] , [ Q a5 ]  Making a double attack on the [ h5 ] and [ a2 ] pawns though after a supposed Nx[ h5 ] black can easily counter with Bc3. A better move was probably castling or Rc8/Rd8.
 [ B e7 ]  [ R x e6 ]  [ B c5 + ]  [ K f1 ]  [ K f7 ]  [ R f6 + ]  [ K e7 ]  [ K g2 ] , [ B d4 ]  tries to win the e-pawn
 [ f x g5 ]  [ h x g5 ]  [ K g3 ] , [ b5 ]  to limit knight access to [ a4 ]  [ K h3 ] , [ g x h4 ]  isolating the h pawn to engage the king to it's defence
 [ K x f2 ]  [ b6 ]  [ Q a4 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ Q a3 ]  [ a5 ] , [ R a c1 ]  Grabbing the half open file.
 [ Q b6 + ] , [ K h1 ]  after [ c5 ] dx[ c5 ] [ K h1 ] ([ Q f4 ] [ c x b4 + ] [ K h1 ] f6!) [ c x b4 ] with roughly the same result...
 [ B c4 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ B e3 ] , [ e6 ]  Perhaps [ N x e3 ] was better getting rid of the Bishop pair and hoping to organize a strong blockade on the dark squares. The position after 28.[ R x e3 ] [ K f8 ] 29.[ R f3 ] [ B f6 ] 30.[ K e2 ] [ R x c4 ] 31.[ R x c4 ] [ R x a6 ] certainly looks tenable for Black.
 [ a5 ] , [ R h7 + ]  ...and check him one more time...
 [ c3 ] , [ N x e4 ]  Still book
 [ N x d4 ]  [ c x d4 ] , [ Q d7 ]  sacrificing the b pawn for a white square attack
 [ c x b5 ] , [ a6 ]  The natural continuation white wants a great square on [ a6 ] for his bishop and to use the a & b files.
 [ N g3 ] , [ R a3 ]  .
 [ N e7 ]  [ N d2 ]  [ N g6 ]  [ O-O ] , [ Q d6 ]  black wants 0-0-0 and to attack in the king side.
 [ N x c4 ] , [ N e6 ]  Threatening the pinning Bishop.
 [ Q b6 ]  [ Q c3 + ]  [ K b8 ] , [ B e3 ]  White spears [ a7 ] through the Black Queen. The focus has swiftly transferred from the kingside.
 [ e5 ] , [ B e3 ]  In a game back in 2005 Abitipower and I came to a similar position where I had played the much slower d4-d5(attempting to block out the DSB). Nowadays [ B e3 ] is arguable the move of choice. For one it sets up the favorable Macrozy bind. According to the comments on the form page my comrades were expecting 7. [ d5 ] with a good chance that ...[ N h5 ] and ...[ f5 ] are to follow.
 [ Q c5 ]  [ Q x c5 ]  [ B x c5 + ] , [ K h1 ]  11. [ K h1 ] - in hindsight this may have been a bad move as Henry is stuck in the corner for virtually the rest of the game and will get in the way of his army. Perhaps [ K f1 ] was preferable.
 [ Q c7 ] , [ R a e1 ]  Presumably aiming at [ e7 ] but white's rooks are now very cramped.
 [ K f8 ]  [ K g2 ] , [ K e7 ]  35....... [ K e7 ] - I centralise Henry as far as I dare.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ] , [ N c3 ]  The Vienna Opening an unusual offshoot of the double-KP game. White hopes to advance his KBP forward before moving his KN so as to quickly open the K-side.
 [ R x d2 ] , [ B x e6 + ]  Yessir I'm winning!
 [ R x d7 ] , [ R f8 ]  This passive placement of the rook now seems necessary to defend f7; I certainly don't want to move it and allow White to open up my king.
 [ B e7 ] , [ g3 ]  Computer gave a ?!. Well white still didn't develop bishop nor knight and both [ f3 ] and [ h3 ] are weaken. So N[ f3 ] [ B e2 ] 0-0 was better.
 [ Q e1 ] , [ B g7 ]  Oddly enough I had the exact same position against blitzkov on GK a few days back. I won't go into further detail because the game is still in progress but in the post-game analysis of this game with my computer it indicated 10.[ f5 ] as the best move which is what I also played against blitzkov.
 [ d x c6 ] , [ Q e3 + ]  trying to push the king back
 [ K x d7 ]  [ b3 ] , [ g6 ]  now my king is safe we are equal points i have strong pawn structure different color bishops but he have strong advanced central pawns the only threat
 [ Q g6 ] , [ N x c7 + ]  9. [ N x [ c7 ] + ] - black's last move threatened my g and e pawns. As it is check I can ignore the threat for just one move and grab the [ c7 ] pawn. Pretty violent stuff here eh?
 [ N b4 ] , [ R x b4 ]  Not the piece I wanted but oh well I need to try something else.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ B b5 ]  Nothing dispels opening-day jitters like starting off with the standard and familiar Ruy Lopez.
 [ e x d5 ]  [ R x d5 ] , [ N c4 ]  That change sure opened the position.
 [ Q e2 ] , [ Q e7 ]  This is black's best move.. obviously moving the knight fails to [ N c6 ] double check winning the black queen.
 [ e x d5 ] , [ Q h5 ]  Black is now in real trouble.
 [ Q e7 ]  [ Q x g8 + ]  [ N f8 ] , [ N x h7 ]  At this point my opponent triumphantly exclaimed "YOU'VE MADE A MISTAKE!!!". He then went on to explain that 23.[ N e6 ] would have clinched the game for me while the text allowed him to equalise. Would I like to take that back he asked? I said no straight off - I would never ever be able to claim a win in the game if I did and plus I had examined the "mistake" and I had my own opinion about that...
 [ Q d2 ] , [ a5 ]  okay he did the [ a5 ] I was expecting. So on a high level can I mount a king side attack or should I ooo first. ooo First will put the rook behind my Queen. Neither one of us has great development. Okay ooo it is. I love king side attacks so this should be fun.
 [ K d8 ] , [ N b5 ]  taking on [ a8 ] would just play in black's favour.
 [ c8 = Q ]  [ B x c8 ]  [ R x c8 ]  [ R b7 ] , [ R f f8 ]  My Rs dominate the open files.
 [ N x e4 ] , [ R h c8 ]  Knowing that it can't get worse I follow one rule of thumb. That it's generally a good idea to have the Rook behind the Queen. You'll note that things were crazy and this move happened very shortly after coming back from vacation.
 [ R e6 ]  [ R c b2 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ Q b3 ]  [ R d8 ] , [ h3 ]  Do not rush when your opponent has no counterplay.
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ] , [ N c3 ]  Queen's pawn Chigorin Variation.
 [ B f3 ]  [ e4 ]  [ B g2 ]  [ f4 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ N d2 ]  [ N x d2 + ]  [ Q x d2 ]  [ Q f5 ] , [ R x a6 ]  With this capture white achieves material parity temporarily.
 [ B b7 ]  [ B d3 ] , [ e6 ]  I did not understand the purpose for this move. I was expecting [ c x d4 ] followed by e5. Hit at my pawns!
 [ K e5 ] , [ K d1 ]  This move serves two purpose: It protects the [ c2 ] pawn while allowing my rook on the e file. My king cannot be checked for now as well.
 [ N g5 ] , [ d5 ]  [ B b7 ] is impossible since [ e6 ] would be taken.
 [ R h g8 ]  [ R f g1 ]  [ B h2 ]  [ N x d7 ] , [ B x g1 ]  Now if 23.[ N x f6 ] then 23....[ Q h2 # ]  [ R x g1 ]  [ Q x d7 ] , [ f3 ]  very big mistake. now it is mate in 5.
 [ R a3 ] , [ R f5 ]  Taking the rook is fatal due to [ g x f5 ] [ Q g7 # ]  [ R f3 ] , [ Q x f3 # ]  Thankyou for reading please feel free to leave constructive comments and criticism
 [ N x b3 + ]  [ a x b3 ]  [ R d7 + ] , [ B d4 ]  Not hard to find: There is no need for the White king to budge an inch.
 [ Q h6 ]  [ Q x h6 ]  [ R x h6 ]  [ K g7 ]  [ R x c6 ]  [ K h7 ]  [ R c7 + ] , [ K h6 ]  Come on get the pawns.
 [ N x e4 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ R x e4 ] , [ Q f3 ]  Terrible blunder I did!!!! I miscalculated!!!! I immediately thought I was going to lose. I had to decide if either [ Q d5 ] or [ Q f3 ] and I got off topic!!! [ Q d5 ] a total win. [ Q f3 ] a total loss.
 [ N f3 ] , [ f5 ]  f5? This seemed like a mistake right away. I've seen this move vs [ d4 ] and also vs [ f4 ] Bird's opening. It comes up in the Kings Gambit e4--[ e5 ] f4--[ f5 ] but here it isn't challenging anything and weakens the king-side.
 [ B b3 ] , [ R d7 x d1 ]  22. ... [ B c7 ] is supposed to be stronger according the GK analysis but is too messy for my liking. Here I get rid of the rooks and use my endgame technique.
 [ d6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d x e5 ] , [ N x e5 ]  4. ... [ d x e5 ] is the Larsen Variation and white follows the main line.
 [ c3 ]  [ O-O-O ]  [ N b d2 ] , [ N g5 ]  Building up pressure.
 [ N c x b2 ]  [ B x b2 ]  [ N x b2 ]  [ R x d8 ] , [ K x d8 ]  Great just great now I'm down two pawns
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ] , [ e x d5 ]  The French Exchange! But being played for a win by punishing Black if he plays over-ambitiously & trying to pose problems not necessarily seen in other lines. (Postscript: my opponent admits he dislikes playing against the Exchange variation as do a lot of French players!)
 [ d x e4 ] , [ N g5 ]  if [ h6 ] the knight takes back the pawn with a centralized knight
 [ R f7 ] , [ R a5 ]  this or g4... after my reply I think [ g4 ] is next in line
 [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ B c5 ] , [ b4 ]  Signifying the Evan's gambit. Black does not actually have to take this pawn but if they don't they do fall back into a passive position with white gaining space and often an attack as well.
 [ Q x d8 ] , [ R x d8 ]  Traded queens... He now has a well placed rook on the open d file. Unfortunately for black this position isn't so great when you're down a rook and your opponents rooks are connected.
 [ N g7 + ]  [ K f6 ]  [ N e8 + ]  [ K f5 ]  [ N g7 + ]  [ K g5 ]  [ N e6 + ]  [ K h6 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ R d7 ]  [ N f5 + ]  [ K g5 ]  [ N g3 ]  [ R d8 + ]  [ K g7 ]  [ R d7 + ]  [ K g8 ]  [ R a7 ]  [ K f8 ] , [ g7 + ]  I found that Halloween works much better playing blitz games.Sometimes I win against players with high ELO.But here...I understand that there are a lot of good moves for black but when I see all 4 knigts at the beginning of a game ...I can't make move excepting 4.Nxe5... :) I thankful to my opponent from Poland for this game.This is my first annotated game therefore I beg your pardon for mistakes or amateurity...if any...:-)... Sincerely Karolis
 [ B x f3 ]  [ R x f3 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ e5 ]  I had an "oh crud" moment here but lo! There was something in story! An attack perhaps?
 [ R b6 ]  [ K e7 ]  [ R b8 ]  [ K d7 ]  [ a4 ]  [ R x c7 ]  [ R c6 ]  [ b x a4 ]  [ R a8 ] , [ B b7 ]  It just gets worse and worse. I have mentally alrady lost so I am just making moves now waiting for the axe to fall.
 [ N f3 + ] , [ K e2 ]  The best square.
 [ Q x c3 ]  [ N x c3 ]  [ b x a6 ]  [ b x a6 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ f6 ]  [ K f3 ]  [ N b5 ]  [ B c5 ] , [ e5 ]  Black hastens to create a passed pawn. I knew I was heading for defeat now. It was just a question of playing for time and a lucky chance. I had about half an hour left my opponent a quarter: plenty yet to force a win.
 [ N x f6 + ] , [ Q x f6 ]  forced
 [ g3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ c3 ]  ...i think white needs to disrupt blacks activity.....maybe [ c4 ] [ R b1 ] and then b4...? Black wants [ B g2 ] to put the Queen on the same diagonal as [ B g4 ] ...
 [ K g8 ]  [ K e3 ]  [ K h7 ]  [ K f3 ]  [ K x h6 ]  [ K g4 ]  [ B c6 ] , [ B g2 ]  I cover my e-pawn...
 [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ B b5 ]  My preferred choice of move here is the Italian game 3. [ B c4 ] but I've been having a lot of trouble against 3... Bc5. For that reason I have decided to try the Ruy Lopez in recent times (as I have experience of playing against it).
 [ B d6 ]  [ B f7 ]  [ K h3 ]  [ R g8 ]  [ R d1 ]  [ R g c8 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ R g8 ]  [ R f1 ] , [ B e8 ]  47. ............. [ B e6 ] - things are drifting along rather aimlessly now. I think I may draw this but it is in the hands of my opponent.
 [ B c4 ] , [ K c2 ]  Preventing [ B d3 ] or [ B d2 ]  [ K f7 ]  [ B e4 ] , [ B g3 ]  Trying to foce a premature pawn advance.
 [ e4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ e6 ]  Here I recommend white Bb5+. I can play against it but it will be much easier for white.
 [ N d2 ]  [ B e5 ] , [ B x e5 ]  A mistake as it removes the bishop pressure too easily. Better is 11. Nf3.
 [ R b8 ] , [ Q d3 ]  I don't want to be exposed to a discovered attack.
 [ B d2 ]  [ Q c5 ] , [ e3 ]  It is black's moves which prove less trodden over-all but he seems better served by standard fares. Black rarely can attack without consideration of material and position unless white commits some misstep but he continues to press prod and poke sniffing at white's defenses.
 [ Q c1 ] , [ R e c8 ]  Now the c-pawn is threatened with capture. A file magically opens up for Black's major pieces and now he has something to play with!
 [ b6 ]  [ Q b8 ]  [ b x a7 ]  [ Q c7 ] , [ R b1 ]  Threatening [ B b6 ] winning the queen while developing.
 [ f5 ] , [ O-O-O ]  Brilliant or a flop?
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ B c4 ]  white looking for fried Liver attack
 [ f6 ]  [ R e3 ] , [ N c4 ]  [ Q e7 ] was the right move.
 [ B x f8 ]  [ K x f8 ]  [ f4 ]  [ R a c8 ]  [ f5 ] , [ N c5 ]  White has a pawn advantage on the Kingside but I never felt like it was in danger of causing serious trouble so I thought getting the Knight back into the game was the best move
 [ K g8 ] , [ R a d1 ]  Now the back rank threats are serious.
 [ B x c6 ]  [ b x c6 ] , [ Q d3 ]  Eyeing the center pawns and breaking the annoying pin.
 [ e x f5 ] , [ R f8 ]  another flaw. he could have saved the knight.
 [ h5 ] , [ N g5 ]  Attempting to remove Black's well-posted Knight.
 [ N x e6 ]  [ Q x e6 ]  [ B f4 ] , [ h5 ]  Cavalry charge! LOL
 [ K e5 ] , [ a7 ]  and he rightfully resigns. Good game richardevans. Please rate and comment mistakes or any observations. Thank you for viewing my game. Computer Analysis: http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=21430090&rnd=0.5218313708901405
 [ Q g1 + ]  [ K g3 ]  [ B f2 + ]  [ K f3 ] , [ B h4 ]  ! This is the move white missed when he played 14. Qxh5. Threatens a nice mate in 2 with 18...[ Q f2 + ] 19. [ K g4 ] Nf6(double checkmate!).
 [ K f6 ] , [ R c e1 ]  34. [ R c e1 ] - the e file will become a death trap for my rooks later on.
 [ b3 ]  [ B c1 ]  [ K d3 ]  [ h6 ] , [ K c2 ]  I knew he'd win the race to promote.
 [ e4 ] , [ c6 ]  Caro-Kann. A fairly conservative but solid defence by Black. Truth to tell my record against the Caro is not what you'd call stellar.
 [ B e3 ] , [ Q x b2 ]  best move was [ R x g7 ] followed [ B x d4 ] [ c x d4 ] or [ N x d7 + ] [ K e7 ] and sit this out... this will lead straight to mate...
 [ N c5 ]  [ a5 ] , [ N c x e4 ]  He didn't. He grabbed a central pawn. Very important. Still it doesn't threat much right now!
 [ N x d6 ]  [ c x d6 ]  [ B x a6 ] , [ b x a6 ]  ...I do the double-exchange capturing the bishop first then the knight. I think this was a very good exchange: look at the queenside pawn formations: my pawns are side by side all in their starting squares ([ a2 ] [ b2 ] c2) connected and strong and my opponent's are all over the place ([ a7 ] [ a6 ] d6) all isolated and weak including doubled pawns in front of the rook. They will now become easy targets for my pieces...
 [ a6 ]  [ N c2 ] , [ N g6 ]  I was suprise dby this move I took for granted the Knight would go to f5.
 [ d3 ] , [ Q e4 ]  Trade queens and then put rook on e file
 [ K g7 ]  [ R f1 ]  [ Q e5 ]  [ K c2 ]  [ R h2 ]  [ Q f3 ] , [ Q f4 ]  60. ... [ K g7 ] 61.Rf1! [ Q e5 ] 62.[ K c2 ] [ R h2 ] 63.[ Q f3 ] [ Q f4 ] I was hoping to win the [ g2 ] pawn. But this proves to be just a pipe-dream.
 [ B g7 ] , [ e3 ]  Cuts off my DSB but protects the pawn that's stopping the fianchettoed bishop and opens my LSB.
 [ R x c2 + ]  [ K d3 ]  [ B c4 + ]  [ K e3 ] , [ N f5 # ]  End of story. As I said an interesting position.
 [ B f4 ] , [ B x c3 ]  [ B x c3 ] Black messes up White's queenside pawn structure.
 [ f6 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ f7 ]  [ a4 ]  [ b x a4 ] , [ b x a4 ]  50. ........ [ B x a4 ] - now I have 2 passers of my own one on the d file and one on the a file.
 [ Q x h6 ] , [ R f d1 ]  After he takes I attempt to punish black by kicking his N. But he has an easy way around it and despite being behind in development the game is almost over for white. And I am almost ready to resign but I still have some fight in me. I feel that resignation is a little premature in this position.
 [ d3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ B e2 ] , [ g6 ]  I think this is called fianchetto perhaps those of superior chess knowledge will comment. Any's having the dark squared bishop here is threatening.
 [ Q e8 ]  [ N x h8 ] , [ B d6 ]  Quickly developing the Bishop while attacking the [ N h8 ] and pawn on [ f4 ] giving a materialistic White much to ponder.
 [ e x d5 ] , [ Q x d5 ]  The exchange brings his Queen out early
 [ N c5 ] , [ B c2 ]  White couldn't chase the knight with 12. [ [ b4 ] ] because 12. [ [ b4 ] ] [ N x d3 ] 13. [ Q x d3 ] Qx[ [ b4 ] ] 14. [ N x e5 ] [ N d7 ] leaves white with a weakness on the long diagonal. Trading the well placed knight for the LSB is something Black should not do though so I don't think white needed to retreat the bishop. ( Please let me know if I am wrong about this. )
 [ h5 ]  [ R a d1 ]  [ N e7 ]  [ B g5 ] , [ R b6 ]  um i dont understand this move. do you???
 [ f5 ]  [ g x f6 ]  [ e ]  [ p ]  [ N x f6 ]  [ B x d7 + ] , [ N x d7 ]  Looking the board we see a very good position for white with the passed pawn [ e4 ] and a strong pression on the d column.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ d4 ] , [ e x d4 ]  gambit accepted
 [ K c6 ]  [ a4 ]  [ b5 ] , [ R a1 ]  I think this is a mistake and after this I was winning. I couldn't see a way for you to stop my king from getting very active and making too many threats for you to handle. I think you had to play axb5. If I take back with the a pawn then you can keep your rook on the d-file and it's hard for me to get my king to a good spot. I probably would have tried moving my rook to the a-file and getting it active that way but I couldn't see exactly how it would turn out. If I take with my king then you can play [ R a1 ] and we are in a similar situation as the game but my pawns are much more weak. Again it would be hard to move my king without loosing the [ a6 ] pawn.
 [ K x d1 ] , [ Q f1 # ]  I let him play the mate by honor. I hope you had fun.
 [ B x c2 ]  [ Q x c2 ] , [ Q x a3 ]  ...so I won a pawn in the process. But my developement problems are not solved!
 [ K a2 ]  [ K d6 ] , [ R h2 ]  Not 39. Rc8? [ R d2 + ] and 40. Kb3? [ B d4 ] stops the Rook skewer from [ d8 ] and also puts the nails in White's King's coffin.
 [ g3 ] , [ Q d8 ]  Black probably thought he could play [ Q x h5 ] but then he loses his queen to [ Q e8 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ f6 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ e5 ] , [ f5 ]  He doesn't want the position to open up yet.
 [ N x c4 ] , [ B x c2 ]  And now black's bishop forks the two white rooks. Well OK not exactly but white's rook on [ b3 ] is directly threatened and black is also threatening 21. ... [ R d1 + ] which wins the other white rook on h1. One of these rooks must fall.
 [ N f3 ] , [ a6 ]  another useless move: White has no special plans on b5; just developing...
 [ c5 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ c3 ]  [ d x c3 ] , [ N x c3 ]  This is the opening position of the smith-morra gambit. While black has no weaknesses and white has only gotten one developing move he has VERY easy development (though white must choose the correct squares) and two nice files to use.
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ g6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B g7 ] , [ e4 ]  The King's Indian Defence. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King's_Indian_Defence
 [ K x b3 ]  [ R x c5 ] , [ e3 ]  and there we go...
 [ R f3 ]  [ N d7 ] , [ R h3 ]  White's attack is starting to take shape. Black has to defend well...
 [ Q c8 ]  [ B x f8 ]  [ Q x f8 ]  [ R f7 ]  [ Q g8 ] , [ Q h6 + ]  And black resigns next would of been 32... [ Q h7 ] 33 [ R x h7 + + ] check mate
 [ N b6 ] , [ R e1 ]  ?! it was better active the other rook.
 [ a3 ] , [ O-O ]  A bishop's storm is on sight. I cannot have my king exposed for what is to come...
 [ g5 ]  [ e5 ]  [ f x e5 ]  [ f x e5 ]  [ R d1 ]  [ d4 ]  [ B b4 ] , [ b6 ]  Nothing looks very good. Time to put the pawns on dark squares to slow down his bishop.
 [ N b3 ] , [ B e3 ]  And the pawn will hold at least for now.
 [ Q f6 + ] , [ K d2 ]  a losed tempo for white
 [ Q x g4 ]  [ K x d3 ]  [ R d8 + ]  [ K e2 ]  [ Q x g2 + ] , [ R f2 ]  Black resigns since his Bishop and Queen are attacked.Thanks for viewing and/or leaving comments.
 [ Q f4 ]  [ Q d6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ h6 ] , [ R a d1 ]  This was the moment when i thought I had a chance to equalise. 2 rooks are usually better than a queen and in this position I think the rooks win.
 [ Q h4 + ]  [ g3 ] , [ Q x g4 ]  Now Black has an easy win.
 [ K f7 ]  [ K e3 ]  [ K f6 ]  [ K e4 ]  [ h5 ] , [ h3 ]  Countering counterplay along from the h-pawn.
 [ N g5 ] , [ d5 ]  4. ... [ d5 ] a standard move I was expecting: 5. ex[ d5 ] [ N a5 ] 6. [ B b5 + ] [ c6 ] 7. dx[ c6 ] bx[ c6 ] to follow
 [ N e2 ] , [ d3 ]  Reestablishing my threat to fork Q and R.
 [ f6 ]  [ Q h5 ] , [ Q f4 ]  31......... [ Q f4 ] - this move saves the day I think the white dsb is en prise and he moves to [ e6 ] - the queen backs off to [ f5 ] - she can do this because although the bishop is pinned the queen is defended because if QXQ the pin is released. White does exchange queens but in a way which gains a tempo and puts the white rook on [ g4 ] preparing a deadly line up.
 [ e x f6 ]  [ e ]  [ p ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ N x g5 ]  [ h x g5 ]  [ B x g5 ]  [ B x g5 ] , [ Q x g5 + ]  It's a very tough position at this point.
 [ N c2 ] , [ B c4 + ]  White searches for a way to stave off disaster. While the white queen is now attacking the far flung knight he is also under the protective fold of the black queen.
 [ K x d6 ]  [ f4 ]  [ K e7 ]  [ f3 ]  [ K f7 ]  [ f2 ]  [ K x g6 ] , [ f1 = Q ]  Tough ending
 [ B e7 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ Q d2 ] , [ d4 ]  Everything is developed it is time to start the action! Whites pieces are only in each others way now I also open the diagonal of my light squred bishop; Whites [ g4 ] advance may come back to haunt him.
 [ N b d2 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ e3 ]  [ B x f4 ]  [ e x f4 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ N h4 ]  Here it goes. I don't care if he takes the [ d4 ] pawn.
 [ Q x c6 ] , [ R c8 ]  The other Rook joins the defence. Black's only advantage here is that all his pieces are involved whereas White's h-rook is a mere spectator.
 [ R d1 ] , [ Q x e4 ]  Threaten the knight capture.
 [ h4 ]  [ K d6 ]  [ h3 ] , [ R a2 ]  forced.
 [ B b6 ]  [ N d5 ] , [ Q e6 ]  (?!) Possibly 11...[ Q d8 ] is preferable as that potential for a family check at [ c7 ] could become dangerous...
 [ K e3 ] , [ N e7 ]  I want the free pawn (g2) but then my Q is pinned again. I make this move to add another layer in front of my K plus open up O-O
 [ e6 ]  [ e5 ] , [ N d5 ]  Good centrally-placed knight for Black. White has a decent pawn structure but Black's position is probably more solid right now (although the queen's effectiveness is rather limited and a move back to [ c7 ] or [ d8 ] might be best).
 [ Q x g4 ]  [ N x g4 ]  [ B x d8 ] , [ K x d8 ]  White chooses to trade queens and eliminate the bishop exploiting his better control of the center (especially the [ d5 ] square).
 [ B e3 ]  [ B b6 ] , [ N e2 ]  Gives me a way out of my bad move earlier as I capture with check.
 [ f x e4 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ B g5 ]  6.[ N c3 ] or 6.[ Q d3 ] are more usual. The positional features remain though: white has control of [ d5 ] in return for a half-open f-file with black having pressure against f2.
 [ a x b5 ]  [ B x b5 ] , [ R a5 ]  ? This doesn't look right but black is a very high rated master. Maybe he wants to switch to [ g5 ] or [ h5 ] later and the rook cannot be easily attacked on a5.
 [ e x f6 ] , [ g x f6 ]  Thinking the Bishop must retreat. But...
 [ g6 ]  [ g3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ B g2 ] , [ e6 ]  Both sides continue with their development. I was thinking of maybe playing N(g)-[ e7 ] and [ d5 ]  [ O-O ] , [ Q c7 ]  I wanted to play [ d5 ] without allowing white to play e4-e5. I later found out that this move is not in either of the Gameknot opening databases.
 [ B g4 ] , [ Q x c7 ]  trying to compensate for my pawn disadvantage.
 [ N x f8 ] , [ Q x f8 ]  Forced but I can feel the game heading my way.
 [ Q x f3 ]  [ Q e1 ] , [ Q f1 + ]  35. ........ [ Q f1 + ] - I thought I had it all covered but a fatal line up on the f file proves to be my downfall. I get that horrid familiar sinking feeling. I will be Freddied next move.
 [ h5 ] , [ R f8 ]  Again the passed pawn on e-file did not frighten me too much at this stage and I'm happy to continue to trade hoping my Knight will be able to snap up loose pawns as the game goes on
 [ N g5 + ] , [ K g6 ]  White had to calculate the likely consequences of 18...[ K g8 ] here: 19.[ Q x b4 ] [ N x b4 ] 20.Be7! [ B d7 ] 21.[ R x a8 ] Bxb5ch 22.[ K g1 ] [ g6 ] 23.Bxf8! etc.
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ B c4 ]  Of the many openings i could have chosen for I chose the Italian opening. The reason is simple. Every other opening I know of has too much theory behind it. For example: In the Ruy Lopez there's sidelines of sidelines of sidelines. Some superGM's probably even analysed this opening all the way up to move 30. Getting caught up in such an opening when I have no knowledge about it isn't advisable. The Italian does have some tricks behind it in terms of [ d4 ] pushes and [ N g5 ] moves but for the most part it's supposedly pretty straightforward.
 [ K x g5 ] , [ N x c6 + ]  I win back my second pawn. Now material is even.
 [ B e2 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ] , [ N d7 ]  Bringing the Knight back into the game to the best available square with the ability to jump to the important f6/e5/c5/[ b6 ] squares as required.
 [ B d2 ]  [ B x d2 + ]  [ N x d2 ]  [ O-O ] , [ c4 ]  ! Reti gets agressive. By mixing it up in this fashion Reti declares that he will be the one to control the flow of this game. Even Alekhine gave this move a "!".
 [ N x d4 ] , [ B d7 ]  The best move. [ N e7 ] here is rather passive.
 [ Q x a7 ] , [ g5 ]  an attack on the knight (I can aim to double the pawns on the h-file with 19...[ f x g5 ] 20.[ B x g5 + ] then...21.[ B x h6 ] gxh6)
 [ N x g4 ]  [ B x h7 + ]  [ K h8 ]  [ h4 ]  [ d x c4 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ N h6 ]  [ N h7 ]  [ R g8 ]  [ B x h6 ]  [ g x h6 ]  [ R e4 ]  [ R g7 ]  [ R a e1 ] , [ R x h7 ]  Ok I didn't play well I know.
 [ d x c5 ] , [ Q x c5 ]  9. ...... [ Q x c5 ] - pawn trade.
 [ h3 ] , [ K f5 ]  38. ..... [ K f5 ] - I now realise that if [ K d4 ] Henry will be able to have a couple of white p(r)awn crackers on the kingside and get a reunion with Glenda before Chris has had a chance to crown one of his queenside pawns.
 [ N b1 ]  [ Q d4 ]  [ N a3 ]  [ g4 ]  [ N b1 ]  [ g3 ]  [ N a3 ]  [ g2 ]  [ N b1 ]  [ g1 = Q ]  [ N a3 ] , [ Q g5 ]  Now putting these queens in place for the later capture. A non-promoted black pawn cannot move three files toward the queen side without taking three of white's pieces so a promotion had to occur.
 [ e x d4 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ B c2 ]  i will tr to kill this knight
 [ d3 ] , [ b5 ]  sometimes i like to move to [ b5 ] just to take that bishop off. the temptation to steal material and check at once is hard to resist. my bishop moves to [ [ d7 ] ] he takes it and my knight goes to [ [ d7 ] ] and it's his turn. in terms of development it doesn't do much for either side but that b file is open for my rook.
 [ R x f8 + ]  [ K x f8 ] , [ R f1 + ]  Forcing my King to a safer square.
 [ e4 ]  [ B x e4 ]  [ Q g3 + ]  [ B g2 ]  [ B x g2 ]  [ R x g2 ]  [ Q x h3 ] , [ Q f4 ]  What did I achieve from this manoeuvre ? Nothing except the realization that my extra-pawn advantage is a chimera. The exposure of [ K g1 ] plays it its own safety While the pawn setup surrounding my king meant that at most I can keep a rook at the 8-th rank and bring two heavy pieces against White's three. Furthermore My King position somehow meant that manyy scenarios that involve the exchange of pieces would lead to unfavorable ending game.
 [ c x b5 ] , [ B x b5 ]  According to Chess King [ c6 ] followed by [ B x b5 ] is better.
 [ K e7 ]  [ R x h8 ] , [ R d6 ]  and now the final mistake trading down. but i don't see how black can hold on much longer regardless.
 [ N e f6 ]  [ f x e5 ]  [ d x e5 ] , [ N x e5 ]  The position I saw a few moves ago white has a very strong position with one big flaw his king is rather airy.
 [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ g3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B g2 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ d3 ]  generally standard opening moves.
 [ R b6 ]  [ R c8 ] , [ N d3 ]  40. ...... [ N d3 ] and goodnight from me as I will be a knight and two pawns down (equivalent to a whole rook) and Ion has those lurvely black passers on the queenside to boot I feel it is time to draw the line so I wave the white flag. Ah now time for some prep - better have a go at doing some puzzles for Coach Ion. So what lessons have you learned from this game? Anyhow hope you have had a good read - bye for now - Joanne
 [ B x h7 + ]  [ K h8 ] , [ Q c2 ]  ? Only 20. [ Q b4 ] saves the position attacking the knight and rook after which white has a playable game. After 20. [ Q c2 ] the queen can be forced off the b1-[ h8 ] diagonal and the white bishop falls.
 [ R d b8 ]  [ h4 ]  [ R b2 ]  [ R a a1 ]  [ R x c2 ]  [ g4 ]  [ R b2 ]  [ R a c1 ]  [ c2 ] , [ R f6 ]  white should have left the Rook where it was to help defend the back rank
 [ B x d4 ] , [ R x d4 ]  Take and take with a surprise to follow
 [ b4 ] , [ B f7 ]  I see lots of ways for me to lose a pawn or more and no counterattacks yet. I'd like to swing my B to the other side of the pawns (though I'll have to look closer to see if there's any way it can be safe on [ e4 ] -- probably not because of [ B e2 ] and f3) If he plays [ B h3 ] I'm going to have to return to e6.
 [ c5 ] , [ B c4 ]  oh well ill settle for a silician
 [ R d8 ] , [ K f4 ]  With the rook about to attack I decide it is best to try to hide.
 [ B g5 ]  [ a6 ]  [ a3 ]  [ h6 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N a2 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ e5 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ B x e5 ] , [ b5 ]  Some exchanges go on but I have a slight hold in the center.
 [ Q x e5 ] , [ R d6 ]  A blunder that quickly ends the game at once.
 [ R h8 + ]  [ K g2 ]  [ R g8 + ] , [ K f3 ]  The next check I will hide on the e column and White will lose the R.
 [ K g1 ]  [ O-O ] , [ g3 ]  Now White is commencing to take the initiative.
 [ R f e1 ] , [ Q x b2 ]  Too early for Black to take the b Pawn. 15...[ Q x b2 ] 16.[ a3 ] [ g5 ] 17.[ R e b1 ] [ Q x a1 ] 18.[ R x a1 ] puts Black in a lost position. I think the best move was [ B d6 ] 15...[ B d6 ] 16.[ b3 ] [ B d7 ] 17.[ R a c1 ] Rad8.
 [ R d8 ] , [ Q x e5 ]  This has promise.
 [ K e3 ]  [ R e4 + ] , [ K d3 ]  41. [ R d4 ] 41. [ R e3 ] and 41. [ R c4 ] are the only options that prevent [ N c3 # ] and they all lose the rook ([ R c4 ] swaps it for the knight). White resigns as he is lost.
 [ b4 ]  [ Q x e3 + ]  [ K h1 ]  [ R x c3 ]  [ B g1 ]  [ Q x c1 ]  [ Q x c1 ]  [ R x c1 ]  [ R x c1 ]  [ R c8 ] , [ R x c8 + ]  Black is up two pawns: White is in a bind as he ought to keep the Rook but cannot give control of the only open file to Black. His only advantage now is the two Bishops which are insufficient.
 [ e6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ c4 ]  ..white is ahead on development but grabbing space..
 [ B x b4 ] , [ Q x b6 ]  With a material deficit against a much stronger player it was obvious I needed to start improving my play but what to do.
 [ N c6 ]  [ d x c5 ]  [ B x c5 ]  [ a3 ] , [ B b6 ]  I believe Black was either anticipating 10. [ b4 ] with this move or preparing to prompt the exchange of queens with 10...Qc5.
 [ K a5 ] , [ K g5 ]  Now we see the effect of Botvinnik's piece positioning. Black soon runs out of checks whilst the superbly placed white queen also controls the next square of the pawn g7.
 [ f3 ]  [ e x f3 ] , [ N x f3 ]  i'm behind a fair amount on development and white has a lot more active pieces than me but i'm up a pawn
 [ K h3 ]  [ Q e3 + ]  [ K h2 ]  [ Q f4 + ]  [ g3 ]  [ Q d2 + ]  [ K g1 ] , [ Q b4 ]  The white had to try as hard as he could to preserve the queen.
 [ K x d8 ] , [ B h5 ]  Attacking the weakness of my less-than-stellar pawn structure.
 [ R h1 ] , [ B g5 ]  ??
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B c4 ] , [ N f6 ]  A familiar first few moves
 [ B a4 ]  [ N e7 ]  [ c3 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ d4 ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ N e x d4 ] , [ N x e4 ]  There goes my e-pawn. Definitely not what I had hoped for.
 [ B c4 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ R e8 ]  Planing to clear out the pawn on [ e4 ] and advance.
 [ R a7 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ K e8 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ f4 ]  [ N g4 ]  [ Q x e6 ]  [ Q x e6 ]  [ R x e6 + ]  [ K d7 ]  [ R g6 ]  [ B d4 + ]  [ K g2 ]  [ h5 ]  [ R b1 ]  [ R f8 ]  [ h3 ]  [ N f2 ] , [ N e2 ]  I'd like to skewer Black's Rook on [ a7 ] but his DSB is covering [ g7 ] at the moment.
 [ B x c4 ]  [ R x c4 ]  [ g5 ] , [ N h5 ]  Although the knight isn't doing much on [ h5 ] it will later land the decisive blow.
 [ N x g2 ] , [ R g6 ]  There's no protection for the knight or the king since my queen pins the f pawn to the besieged monarch.
 [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ] , [ B b5 + ]  I have a book on the [ B b5 ] Sicilian by Richard Palliser. I've never read it though: maybe I should. This is the Moscow Variation.
 [ b5 ]  [ N c5 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ] , [ Q x d4 ]  Losing the f3-knight as expected.
 [ O-O-O ] , [ Q d7 ]  i imagine black has ideas to get the queen to a4.
 [ Q f1 + ] , [ K g3 ]  All forced to...
 [ N e x d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ B g5 ] , [ d5 ]  As I said I want my pieces active! so lets free the diagonal for my white bishop.
 [ R e5 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ R g5 + ]  [ K h1 ]  [ R d5 ]  [ R c8 + ]  [ K h7 ] , [ B c6 ]  Setting up the shield which will allow the b-pawn to Q
 [ K h2 ]  [ R c1 ]  [ R e3 ] , [ f5 ]  Not sure what my plan was here but white wisely exploits the opening to place me in check.
 [ R d7 ]  [ R f3 ]  [ N e7 ] , [ B x h6 ]  Black resigned under the pressure after 21. Ne4... Here is what might have followed... After 23. ... [ g x h6 ] Rf6...
 [ R x f6 ] , [ N d2 ]  white continues development. i'd give black a small plus here
 [ N h6 ] , [ Q h3 ]  Forcing the exchange but in fact White had no choice here. Black's ...[ N g4 ] threat had to be answered at once. Now the Queens come off.
 [ Q c8 + ]  [ K e7 ] , [ R x f7 # ]  And this shows once again that time and development are crucial in the KGA.
 [ N e7 ]  [ d6 ]  [ N g6 ] , [ B g4 ]  Preventing [ N f4 ] but black does it anways.
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ c4 ] , [ e6 ]  Queens gambit declined a solid popular opening against 1.[ d4 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ c6 ]  Now the game has transposed to a semi slav except both kings knights are still at home
 [ B x f4 ]  [ b5 ]  [ B b3 ] , [ Q e7 ]  (!?) This move set me back a little. I'm not sure why but I didn't want to develop my queen onto [ e2 ] at this stage. And if 7. [ N c3 ] [ b4 ] threatening the knight that is protecting e4.
 [ N e4 ] , [ Q f5 ]  Keeping the pressure and preventing [ N d6 ] because of [ Q b1 + ] and mate! Be aware of [ N d6 ] threatens Re8#! I can still lose and in an humilliating way!
 [ d5 ]  [ f6 ]  [ d x e6 ] , [ d x e6 ]  clearly mistaking on Whites' part: [ B g5 ] is still in trouble...
 [ h6 ] , [ R a d1 ]  At last! But I have to stop the attack on my poor kingside now.
 [ B a4 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ O-O ]  The only reply to try to retain the advantage as after [ N c3 ] Black will play [ B c5 ] with an easy game.
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e5 ]  [ c5 ] , [ N f3 ]  I think [ N e2 ] is the modern move.
 [ O-O ] , [ h4 ]  White's intention is clear and black should beware about white attack on the kingside
 [ N x f6 + ]  [ Q x f6 ]  [ d3 ] , [ f4 ]  Black releases the tension in the center in preparation for castling; he must close off the White Bishop's scope. This also foreshadows the massive kingside attack that is Black's signature in this opening.
 [ Q g3 ]  [ R a3 a1 ] , [ R b d1 ]  It doesn't matter - it still allows for the black to advance to the second row.
 [ f5 ]  [ R x h7 ] , [ N d4 ]  I move the knight because of the threats of [ R e7 + ]  [ R e7 + ]  [ K d3 ]  [ R x e2 ] , [ K x e2 ]  Now i loose the race with my next move.
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ d4 ]  attack in the middle + quick development
 [ B b5 + ] , [ c6 ]  White now keeps their pawn advantage without having to play c4. Even so this gambit has merits for black.
 [ Q x g1 ]  [ Q x c6 ] , [ Q x f2 + ]  But of course I wanna take some pieces!
 [ d3 ]  [ e5 ] , [ e4 ]  This move really is another positional inaccuracy. White turns his light squares bishop into a prisoner and does not have a justification for it. White should simply go 9.[ N d2 ] keeping his position in the center. However it is not so bad as it allows white to easily get away with having a worse development.
 [ c4 ]  [ B x e4 ]  [ f x e4 ]  [ Q x e4 + ]  [ Q x e4 ] , [ N x e4 ]  gained an important one pawn advantage in this series of exchanges while maintaining the threat of 12. [ N c2 ] for the rook. Additionally (on hindsight) it leaves his h-rook vulnerable to [ N f2 ] should my bishop be able to get to [ c5 ] to support it.
 [ N x e5 ]  [ R g2 ] , [ B x f6 ]  And now both of the very strong pawns fall
 [ e x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ] , [ d4 ]  So [ d4 ] is finally played and we have the beginning of a familiar/drawish French exchange setup.
 [ B x e3 + ]  [ K h1 ] , [ B x b6 ]  Material is equal and I have more pieces out I have to get them to central squares ASAP and activate my rooks. A key positional feature is my control of the a7-[ g1 ] diagonal.
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ c4 ]  [ d x c4 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ g6 ]  This was my second game verses jwpatzer. He won the first game. I noticed he played very sounds moves and advanced his army very thoughtfully.
 [ Q x b6 ] , [ B x b6 ]  And now white is up by a knight and two pawns.
 [ K x f7 ] , [ B c4 + ]  Now this move comes… two moves too late.
 [ f5 ] , [ R e5 ]  This Rook seals the King away from helping in the fight against the passed pawn.
 [ R x a2 + ]  [ K g1 ]  [ R d2 ] , [ R h2 ]  I'm pretty sure he regrets this decision to attack my rook.
 [ f x g3 ]  [ e ]  [ p ]  [ N h1 ]  [ Q d7 ] , [ B x g5 ]  21. [ K g2 ] is better because 21... [ h4 ] is met by Bg5.
 [ B g5 ] , [ B b4 + ]  After white's DB moved to [ g5 ] threatening my queen I moved to check king with Bb4.
 [ g4 ]  [ B x g4 ]  [ h x g4 ] , [ Q x g4 ]  now the king is looking exposed so...
 [ R d5 ] , [ h5 ]  after [ R h d1 ] Black needs counterplay: but this is not it...
 [ h5 ]  [ N f4 ]  [ B h7 ]  [ N x h5 ]  [ c x d4 ] , [ N b5 ]  10. [ N b5 ] - if [ Q x d4 ] then Bxc2.
 [ e5 ]  [ N b3 ]  [ B e7 ] , [ Q d2 ]  I suspect white will castle long this is going to get interesting
 [ O-O ]  [ e6 ] , [ c4 ]  Transforming the game into a type of hybrid Queen's Gambit - Catalan System. This doesn't necessarily gambit a pawn ...
 [ B d2 ] , [ N h6 ]  Just bringing the last minor piece into the game (probably not the most useful position - but it wasn't doing much where it was!) and connecting my rooks.
 [ B e2 ]  [ B e7 ] , [ O-O ]  Although [ N b5 ] looks fu**in tempting white decides on safety first. White has additional threats with 9 [ d4 ] x[ d4 ] 10 Nx[ d4 ] or [ N g5 ]  [ O-O ] , [ K h1 ]  Another safety first move. Of course this move does no harm imho it's perhaps a bit to early. The bishop can't check from [ c5 ] and it allows black to take the initative.
 [ B e3 ] , [ N h4 ]  The [ [ g2 ] ] bishop is currently the only piece defending the king. It cannot move due to [ Q f1 # ] so it will be exchanged. With the white king trapped in the corner I had the idea of taking on [ [ g2 ] ] and getting a deadly fianchettod on b7. My opponent responded combatively to this idea.
 [ N x e5 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ d x e6 ]  [ f x e6 ] , [ R e1 ]  Now the fun begins. The [ R e1 ] of course hits the undefended knight on [ e4 ] ( hence the trap that was laid ) and of course it looks like a damn Big Mac right in the center. This shows why jumping on a pawn and not getting your king to safety is a bad thing. I mean didn't we learn those rules back from Reinfeld?
 [ c x b4 ]  [ B x b4 ] , [ K d3 ]  Now the king can stop the d-pawn while also helping to stop the Black king entering into the camp.
 [ N a5 ]  [ e4 ] , [ d x e4 ]  I preferred to avoid this line: 15. e3-[ [ [ e4 ] ] ] d5-[ [ [ e4 ] ] ] 16. f3-[ [ h4 ] ] h7-[ h6 ] 17. g5-[ [ f6 ] ] d8-[ [ f6 ] ] 18. d2-[ [ [ e4 ] ] ] f6-[ [ h4 ] ] 19. e4-[ d6 ] b7-[ g2 ] 20. h1-[ g1 ] g2-[ h3 ] 21. d6-[ [ c8 ] ] f8-[ [ c8 ] ] 22. e1-[ c1 ]  [ Q x f6 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ B x e4 ] , [ Q x e4 ]  It seems a good position for white... or it is not?
 [ B x c6 ] , [ d x c6 ]  The correct recapture
 [ f3 ] , [ h5 ]  Black decides to attack the k-side as his position is not really suitable for castling anyway. Position may have been OK if he played well but he was at a disadvantage
 [ B x a6 ]  [ R x a6 ] , [ Q x a4 ]  Black's queenside thrust has been diffused.
 [ R x d6 ]  [ B x d6 ]  [ B x b2 ]  [ R b1 ] , [ B f6 ]  With the plan Bf6-d8-b6.
 [ B e3 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ O-O ] , [ f5 ]  9. [ f5 ] - black castles but is he castling into it?!
 [ K x h2 ]  [ Q c7 + ] , [ K g1 ]  So I can understand a reluctance to trade queens I suppose. There is after all something to be said for holding onto one's firepower. But here white's king still has ample protection for the time being despite the ponderous pressure heading that way. Meanwhile I practically jump at the chance to get back in the game...
 [ N f3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N b d2 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ h3 ]  The "oh i's a waste of tempo" move...
 [ b6 ]  [ b3 ]  [ g6 ] , [ B b2 ]  Good fianchetto - moving bishop toward the outside of the board.
 [ R x c7 ]  [ f x e5 ]  [ B g3 ] , [ B f1 ]  This move focuses black's attention fully on the king. Mate in four if white sacrifices the rook.
 [ R g5 + ]  [ K e4 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ R a8 ]  [ K c4 ] , [ R a4 + ]  but how hard it is
 [ c5 ] , [ B c4 ]  An unorthodox move for white. I did this to throw off my opponent since he probably knows the sicilian better than I do. As we'll see my suspicions were correct and once we leave the main-line sicilian this guy has no idea what to do. Classic sign of a guy who memorizes openings but doesn't actually know how to play them.
 [ Q x d7 ] , [ Q x d7 ]  ?? An outright blunder. The worst one in the entire. Once again a miscalculation as I thought that I had won something back and therefore did not have to liquidate. But what I overlooked was his R on d1. And with it I now lose my Q. Normally I would resign after his next move but I felt it'd be better to wait especially against perhaps the best player in the world. That's because the longer you hang around the more you learn. GAC agreed as he implied while on GK before getting booted that while we were playing I was making the right choice by not resigning. Instead it was better to let him mate me. The idea is the same as to why you don't resign in the Supplemental Talking the Talk game.
 [ Q e3 ] , [ Q x c4 ]  well theres me being mean again.
 [ a4 ]  [ B e8 ]  [ h4 ]  [ B c6 ] , [ N x a6 ]  this sacrifice doesn't work but white doesn't have anything.
 [ B c8 ]  [ B a4 ]  [ R d8 ]  [ B c6 ]  [ R b8 ] , [ R x a7 ]  23. [ R x [ a7 ] ] - the Bone in the throat then the pin on the [ d7 ] knight has finally reaped results - I have won a pawn on [ a7 ] and black's b pawn is very weak. Can I capitalise further?
 [ B e6 ] , [ B c4 ]  ...and I do the same thing here with my own bishop also eyeing up the pawn on f7. Black's bishop is pinned to that pawn as it is preventing the pawn in front of the king from being isolated.
 [ d5 ]  [ h4 ]  [ d x c4 ] , [ h5 ]  I was almost forced to attack a bit too soon.
 [ h4 ] , [ R c2 ]  I'm in big trouble now with his rook on my 2nd rank. I must try to drive it away...
 [ K h1 ] , [ R e7 ]  ? Overlooking white's 27th I think.
 [ N f6 ] , [ B g2 ]  Black's bishop still can't do anything.
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ d6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B e3 ] , [ g6 ]  Going into the Sicilain Dragon
 [ B x f5 ]  [ Q d2 ] , [ N f6 ]  I finally bring out last cowboy
 [ Q x d6 ]  [ b x c6 ] , [ R x c6 ]  He defends [ b6 ] but it will remain still a weakness.
 [ B f5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ e6 ] , [ a3 ]  Again not the best...
 [ Q x e5 + ]  [ B e7 ]  [ Q f4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ d3 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ h3 ]  [ B h5 ]  [ g4 ]  [ B g6 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ O-O ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f d7 ]  [ h4 ] , [ N c6 ]  P[ h5 ] traps black's white bishop. P[ h6 ] makes room for it.
 [ B x a6 ]  [ R x a6 ] , [ R d c1 ]  Admitting his twelth move was a mistake.This is a prophylaxis against c5.
 [ N c6 ] , [ a3 ]  ?! Somehow I thought this slowed down Black's queenside play and perhaps it does temporarily; but it makes it all the more stronger when it finally comes.
 [ f x g6 ]  [ B x g6 ]  [ Q x h4 ] , [ B g5 ]  An excellent and obvious move for white. Black has a better continuation with ...[ Q x g3 ] followed by 23. [ R x g3 ] [ R x g6 ] and black maintains a heavy material advantage.
 [ Q c6 ] , [ R f2 ]  Loses immediately. The queen had to come back to [ e2 ] so it could defend the king. Now it will be driven offsides and Black is essentially attacking with an extra queen.
 [ O-O ] , [ Q g4 ]  Sacrificing a pawn! What justifies this? Pressure against [ h7 ] and f7. Since next move my opponent will be forced to defend against my mating threat [ f7 ] will become even more vulnerable.
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ c4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ O-O ]  [ e3 ]  [ N b d7 ]  [ Q c2 ]  [ c6 ]  [ a3 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ R d1 ]  [ N f8 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ d x c4 ]  [ B x c4 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ B x e7 ]  [ Q x e7 ]  [ O-O ]  [ b6 ]  [ R d c1 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ R e c8 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ R c7 ]  [ b4 ]  [ g6 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ N e6 ]  [ Q b2 ]  [ R a c8 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ c5 ]  [ b x c5 ]  [ b x c5 ]  [ d x c5 ]  [ N x c5 ]  [ Q b4 ]  [ N e6 ]  [ Q x e7 ]  [ R x e7 ]  [ R x c8 + ]  [ B x c8 ]  [ R c1 ]  [ R c7 ]  [ R x c7 ]  [ N x c7 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ K f1 ]  [ K f8 ]  [ K e1 ]  [ K e7 ]  [ K d2 ]  [ K d6 ]  [ K c3 ]  [ f6 ]  [ K b4 ]  [ B e8 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ B f7 ]  [ a4 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ N b3 ]  [ B c8 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ h4 ]  [ N e6 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ e x d4 ] , [ B c8 ]  Yanofsky notes that the game was adjourned in this position and the other competitors in the tournament all thought it was drawn. However by very fine play Yanofsky proves otherwise. White has the advantage of the more active king and the better bishop principally because of the black pawn on [ d5 ] which blocks in his own prelate. Black also has two of his kingside pawns on white squares and Yanofsky hurries to capitalize on this. The first stage of his plan is to fix all three black kingside pawns on light squares ..
 [ B x f3 ]  [ Q x f3 ]  [ Q x d4 ] , [ a x b5 ]  Exploiting the two pins on the Rook. This is the whole point of White's sacrifice. The pawn will reach [ a6 ] and will need constant supervision by Black.
 [ N h5 ] , [ h3 ]  I'm really annoyed by this bishop
 [ B g7 ]  [ N f2 ] , [ N f6 ]  I'm almost done developing my pieces and white's queen side is still at the starting position. This cannot end well!
 [ R a6 ] , [ B f6 ]  and the Black King can advance under cover of the Bishop: it took a while but Black finally won this...
 [ R g8 ]  [ Q f4 + ] , [ e5 ]  I had the option here of playing [ Q f5 ] and then [ B c4 ] winning the rook back. Instead I wanted to bring my knights into play
 [ d x e4 ] , [ N e5 ]  putting pressure on the N and opening the d rank
 [ b4 ]  [ N b7 ]  [ B e3 ] , [ a5 ]  Black is attempting to break out and if succesful Whites King looks a little exposed
 [ Q x h4 ] , [ a4 ]  And if 37... [ Q x a4 ] 38. [ Q c3 + ] [ K g8 ] 39. [ B d5 + ] [ K f8 ] 40. [ Q h8 + ] [ K e7 ] 41. [ Q x h7 + ] [ K f6 ] Completely equal.
 [ B a4 ] , [ Q a5 + ]  ? This move is actually his first mistake and not just an inaccuracy. The real reason is that one should develop his or her minor pieces before bringing out the major pieces. In fact the Q should be the last thing that emerges. So in my opinion best was 9...Nd7. If not he also had the option of developing his DSB or LSB. Now if white finds the right move black will be in a lot of trouble.
 [ c x d5 ]  [ N d6 + ]  [ K c7 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ K b6 ]  [ a5 + ]  [ K c6 ]  [ Q a4 + ]  [ K c7 ]  [ N x b7 + ]  [ K x b7 ]  [ Q x d7 + ]  [ N c7 ]  [ Q x c7 + ]  [ K a6 ] , [ Q x e7 ]  
 [ N g3 ] , [ h4 ]  countering offering a trade of queens to quell a continued assult
 [ B x c3 ]  [ b x c3 ] , [ N x e4 ]  Here it is cool isn't it? If he takes the knight on [ d4 ] i can go [ Q h4 + ] and checkmate next move. If he takes the knight on [ e4 ] i take the pawn with Bx[ e4 ] and threaten on [ c2 ] and on h1.
 [ K f2 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ R d b1 ]  [ K c7 ]  [ R f e1 ] , [ c5 ]  29. .... [ c5 ] - I decided to support my knight which has a fine outpost on d4.
 [ R g8 ] , [ c5 ]  What I overlooked is that his c pawn is a passer. So he can still try for counterplay using Hope Chess. That is hoping that I won't see his plan which would enable him to promote. But I see his plan and am thinking about how to handle it. The idea is not to throw away your advantage or win by underestimating your opponent. Thus despite being way ahead I must be careful and I am. As right after this move I see what Ted is planning to do and have every intention to stop it. I start by taking his g pawn.
 [ c4 ] , [ N b d7 ]  I moved pawn to [ c4 ] attacking black's pawn at [ d5 ] and black developed his knight to Nd7.
 [ e6 ] , [ c4 ]  Issuing the first challenge against Black's centre. That White has allowed Black so far to build a big centre is in keeping with a general plan of counter-attacking and placing Black's centre under pressure. Let us see how that develops.
 [ R b7 ] , [ B c3 ]  The perfect square for the DS Bishop it holds the queenside together applies pressure to the kingside and is protected by Blacks [ c4 ] pawn!
 [ O-O ] , [ B e4 ]  Threatening to exchange the B but shattering white's pawns even more.
 [ N b d2 ]  [ O-O ] , [ c4 ]  strengthening the center further.. probably opponent wanted me to attack first
 [ Q e3 ] , [ b6 ]  (She didn't retreat far enough you'll see.) .............................................................................................. blake 84129 (again sigh): Actually she did. She's quite safe here. This opening by white is known as the Paulsen Attack (although I'm not quite sure what Paulsen would be attacking from here). While it doesn't seem to exemplify white's best options in the opening it's far from a foregone conclusion. .............................................................................................. It IS a foregone conclusion that patzers shouldn't pull their queens out early. Look on and you will see what Paulson is attacking/what I am attacking. If this guy was a chessmaster than maybe he could pull his queen out early but he ain't one and he can't. I am trying to help people here. (Keep in mind I wrote all these comments knowing how the game went. It's not like I am talking trash here.)
 [ Q d6 ] , [ N c3 ]  but quickly realizes they can't do anything
 [ K f2 ] , [ Q a7 + ]  Well case in point. Getting the K away from the hotseat seems the favoured course here and that pointless(?) check gives White a free move to sneak into [ g2 ] or [ f3 ] OR to once again face the Ladies off.
 [ Q b6 ] , [ B b3 ]  now she's safe
 [ d4 ] , [ N e4 ]  attacking his bishop
 [ Q h3 ] , [ f4 ]  ! strong defencive move both blocks out the darksquare bishop and opens the 2nd rank for the white queen
 [ h5 ] , [ R a f8 ]  25 h5? was a blunder that will cost white quite a bit of material. Black is ahead by a piece but has his bishop en prise on b2. Taking that bishop was possibly white's best move though as noted it leads to an endgame white cannot win nor likely even draw. The f-file is a huge cannon aimed at the white king and white ignores it entirely. The diagonal on which black's queen stands is a second huge cannon aimed at the white king and white ignores that entirely too. Instead white launches a counterattack at what is likely the worst possible time.
 [ Q e8 ] , [ f6 ]  I was expecting 18 [ R e1 ] - absolutely crushing my [ e7 ] pawn can't move and I have no decent reply. Sadly for white this plan is unsound..
 [ N b5 ]  [ O-O-O ] , [ c5 ]  Loses him another pawn.
 [ N e4 ]  [ Q d5 ]  [ R e d2 ]  [ Q x e4 ] , [ Q x c6 ]  With every pair of pieces that vanish White's Rook advantage gets that much bigger.
 [ R h3 ] , [ K h8 ]  Quite willing to hand the pawn back but didn't want the pin happening. Nearly cost me dearly.
 [ N c7 ]  [ d x c5 ] , [ N x c5 ]  Better move for Black might have been Qxc5...
 [ N f2 + ] , [ R x f2 ]  But it gives black a free queen for his LSB.
 [ Q d6 ]  [ B x h3 ]  [ g x h3 ] , [ Q f7 ]  taking out all checks...
 [ B g5 ]  [ Q e6 ] , [ N c7 ]  Calculating variations and thinking a little about what to do combined with memorizing some of the chess problems in her book about forks from "Tactics for Champions" I decide to fork Sue's [ Q e6 ] and Ra8. It ought to not be effective or work but I am interested in what happens since the first thing she'll notice is the Queen being attacked.
 [ K c3 ] , [ a4 ]  Baiting the white king further.
 [ N b d7 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ e5 ] , [ e4 ]  5. [ e4 ] - and more of the same here.
 [ R e2 e5 + ] , [ K a6 ]  Successfully reach the [ a6 ] square. Now he has no more check.
 [ N x f5 ] , [ Q x c5 ]  Lanzarote gone Guinevere decides to calm her urges with a foot soldier...
 [ R x f1 + ]  [ K x f1 ] , [ g6 ]  The Knight can't even move
 [ N e3 ] , [ B b4 ]  His bishop was running around...
 [ e6 ]  [ h3 ]  [ B d6 ] , [ N e5 ]  not really a defense...
 [ R a e8 ]  [ B d2 ] , [ R e6 ]  protecting the f-pawn
 [ g3 ]  [ R h b8 ]  [ N b4 ]  [ N x b4 ]  [ a x b4 ] , [ R b8 x b4 ]  Trading with a bonus pawn. Now black is up a clear bishop.
 [ Q f6 + ]  [ K e8 ]  [ Q x h8 ] , [ Q c6 ]  17. . [ Q g7 ] would have put pressure on the white queen
 [ R h7 ] , [ R x g6 ]  White is slowly taking black apart
 [ B x f2 ] , [ B x f7 + ]  Getting the Black king into the open without cost! An easily found zwichenzug.
 [ e4 ] , [ e5 ]  allows white the gambit fi he wants it.
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ c4 ] , [ c6 ]  This opening is a QGD Slav Defense.
 [ R e5 ] , [ K f8 ]  43. ...... [ K f8 ] - still non-committal but now dmaestro over-reaches himself.......
 [ a3 ] , [ N g8 ]  I was going to reposition this Knight but my kid bro on the defensive decided to play for a draw...
 [ h4 ]  [ B b7 ] , [ B f3 ]  Ok so I fianchetto the bishop and then when he blocks with his bishop I don't have the guts to take him. Being up by a bishop I definitely should have taken him at this point. How many blunders have I had in this game so far…don't answer that. I've lost count by this point.
 [ N c6 ]  [ h4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ h x g5 ]  [ h x g5 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ N x g5 ]  [ B x g5 ]  [ f4 ]  [ N f7 ]  [ f x g5 ]  [ Q x g5 ]  [ N b5 ]  [ Q e7 ] , [ B d5 ]  ! Pinning Black's knight frees [ h8 ] for a checkmate.
 [ R x g4 ]  [ N x g4 ]  [ Q x g4 ]  [ R x e5 ] , [ N f3 ]  ? Still trying to bring more ammo into the fight before I go nuts and try something crazy. And speaking of crazy I don't even SEE my f pawn falling like this. I feel physically ill.
 [ B x f3 + ]  [ K x f3 ]  [ B x e5 ] , [ N g6 + ]  Best for black was QxN but...
 [ Q f1 ] , [ Q x f1 + ]  Taking the pawn on [ h4 ] instead of the queen exchange was also tempting but it looked like the opponent could trap me with endless rook attacks between the g- and h-file then so I wanted to be on the safe side.
 [ g6 ]  [ N b c3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ] , [ N c6 ]  and now we will transpose to a more common dragon Sicilian
 [ R a b8 ]  [ a3 ] , [ R b6 ]  So your right it is a lost game and resigning normally is in order but because it is a tutoring game I would suggest playing games out as there may be something else I could have shown you later in the game. Thanks for the game though! God Bless Scott
 [ N c3 ] , [ c6 ]  Wanting to protect the pawn via b5.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B b5 ] , [ N d4 ]  Blackburne gambit!!
 [ R x b4 ] , [ Q a8 + ]  Black returns the favor blunder for blunder. The right recapture was 19. ... [ Q x b4 ] leaving black materially ahead a piece for two pawns. By capturing with 19. ... Rxb4?? black exposes his king and his rook on [ h8 ] to a back-rank attack and instead of gaining a material advantage he ends up losing more material than he gains.
 [ R x d1 + ]  [ R x d1 ]  [ Q h4 ]  [ h3 ]  [ Q g3 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ Q d6 ]  [ B x h3 ] , [ Q c7 ]  20. [ g x h3 ] is answered by 20. ----- Qxf3.
 [ N c3 ] , [ a6 ]  5....[ B f3 ] seems required.
 [ B b3 ]  [ R b8 ] , [ a3 ]  At the moment it looks like he is going to castle on the queenside. Also creates a outpost for the bishop if i ever try to trap it
 [ Q h3 + ]  [ K e2 ]  [ N x f2 ]  [ R g1 ]  [ Q f5 ]  [ R f1 ]  [ Q f3 + ]  [ K d2 ]  [ Q g2 ]  [ R x f2 ]  [ Q x f2 + ] , [ K c3 ]  My king will develop into my most valuable fighting piece. Believe it or not my king will end up back on the king side eventually.
 [ N f3 ] , [ e6 ]  also too slow...
 [ N x b4 ]  [ N a3 ]  [ N b c6 ]  [ N c4 ]  [ Q c7 ] , [ Q c1 ]  [ Q c1 ] ? Threating [ B h3 ] !
 [ g5 ] , [ N f d7 ]  The knight was destined for the queenside anyway more specifically c4.
 [ Q d6 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ Q c6 ]  [ B b5 + ] , [ Q e6 ]  At the very least he would win my Queen.
 [ K x g7 ] , [ Q g5 + ]  ...of the perpetual check!
 [ e4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B b4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ c5 ]  [ a3 ]  [ B x c3 + ] , [ b x c3 ]  A very common line of the French Defence which is an opening I really struggle with as white.
 [ K b1 ]  [ Q f5 ]  [ K a2 ] , [ R x b2 + ]  Now a lit bit of tactics!
 [ K f7 ]  [ K f2 ]  [ K f6 ]  [ h3 ]  [ K e5 ]  [ R e2 ]  [ K d4 ]  [ R d2 + ]  [ R d3 ]  [ R c2 ] , [ h5 ]  And white resigns. Black's passed pawns will soon prove too powerful while white's pieces have very little room to maneuver.
 [ c x b4 ]  [ N x b4 ]  [ Q b7 ]  [ R a1 ]  [ R a8 ]  [ R x a8 + ]  [ N c x a8 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ f6 ]  Creating an even more serious hole on [ e6 ] but there is nothing else. The maneuver ..Na4-[ c5 ] freeing [ b5 ] for the [ a8 ] knight (what an awful square for a knight!) is desirable but too slow. Alternative variation: 30... [ N a4 ] 31. [ Q h3 ] N8[ b6 ] 32. [ Q h4 ] [ f6 ] 33. [ B g4 ] N[ c5 ] 34. [ Q h6 ] [ Q c7 ] 35. [ h4 ]  [ N e6 ]  [ Q a7 ] , [ Q c1 ]  Threatening the blunt invasion Qh6-[ g7 # ]  [ h6 ]  [ h x g5 ]  [ h x g5 ] , [ Q c3 ]  Threatening h3-h6-[ g7 # ]  [ Q a2 ] , [ Q c6 ]  Now threatening e8. Black will be mated shortly.
 [ b x c4 ] , [ B x c4 ]  ???? Got greedy he should have left his bishop where it was then I couldn't move my rook to b7.
 [ N e7 ]  [ B c1 ]  [ R a c8 ] , [ B d2 ]  21. [ B d2 ] - now for Fou Lenoir. I feel there is more future for this prelate on this square than on [ a3 ] or b2.
 [ R x h3 ] , [ K g5 ]  The computer would have played the nice drawing trap here of 65. [ R a4 ] [ R x h4 + ] 66. [ K g5 ] Rxa4?? Stalemate. I didn't spot it.
 [ N b4 ] , [ B c4 ]  Trying not to let the bishop trade for his knight.
 [ K g7 ]  [ h3 ] , [ b5 ]  an attempt to create something.
 [ Q f6 ]  [ b4 ]  [ R x b5 ] , [ R a4 ]  !?! I'm glad he didn't see he could trade his Queen for 2 Rooks. (QxR PxQ RxR. I would have been tempted....)
 [ K h2 ]  [ Q g3 + ]  [ K h1 ]  [ Q x h3 + ]  [ R h2 ] , [ Q x f1 # ]  This was an exciting game in which I used the initiative to overcome a substantial material deficit.
 [ B x f5 ]  [ R e d8 ] , [ N d5 ]  Ok I exchange one more piece but something is getting into shape...
 [ Q d7 ]  [ N d4 ] , [ B x d4 ]  Black trades since his light-squared Bishop is better-placed than his dark-squared one--though neither is looking great at the moment.
 [ N x e4 ] , [ Q a5 ]  This hangs the [ c4 ] pawn.
 [ e x d6 ]  [ e x d6 ] , [ Q d8 ]  ? The losing blunder. This was a danger back at move 17 when black separated his rooks for a brief moment but it was the only moment required. Black's best bet may have been 21. ...Qc6!? giving up the exchange for the d-pawn i.e.: 22. [ N a5 ] [ Q x d6 ] 23. [ B f4 ] [ Q b6 ] 24. [ N x b7 ] [ Q x b7 ] where black could still put up resistance in the middlegame.
 [ Q x e3 + ]  [ K h2 ]  [ Q x h3 + ] , [ K x h3 ]  End of game. Got lucky with the lost N on [ e4 ] but I think the moral is that if you have developed your pieces adequately you end up having B- and C-plans even when things turn out bad.
 [ e4 ]  [ c6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ c4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ e6 ] , [ N f3 ]  Standard move so far but...
 [ R x f1 ] , [ N d e4 ]  The only one but...
 [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ a6 ]  The Najdorf variation is named after Polish-Argentinian GM Miguel Najdorf. It is one of the most deeply studied openings and a favourite weapon of many World champions like Mikhail Tal Tigran Petrosian Bobby Fischer Garry Kasparov and Viswanathan Anand. This is a thematic tournament.
 [ R h8 + ] , [ R g8 ]  ?? loses the king. 25....[ N g8 ] 26.[ Q x g6 ] [ N f6 ] and black is still breathing although whites positional and material dominance will easily secure the win. prehaps the black king wanted a quick death as opposed to a long drawn out one.
 [ R e1 ] , [ K c7 ]  .
 [ b4 ]  [ B x e3 ]  [ f x e3 ] , [ a5 ]  this is an attempt to break into the queenside.
 [ f x g6 ]  [ B x g6 ]  [ R f8 ]  [ B x h5 ]  [ N x h5 ]  [ Q x h5 ]  [ Q f6 ]  [ Q e2 ]  [ B e8 ]  [ f3 ]  [ B g6 ] , [ e4 ]  Mmpf. [ d4 ] and [ b4 ] are now easy pickings.
 [ g6 + ] , [ K g7 ]  (!?) A deliberate decision played in full knowledge of the immediate material consequences. I did hope there would be some relief from the pressure as a result though. There was none to be had from a line like 64....[ K e7 ] 65.e5! or 64...[ K f8 ] 65.e5! (65...[ d x e5 ] 66.[ B c5 ] etc).
 [ a4 ] , [ f6 ]  Like 14...[ h5 ] this is one small step leading to a fantastic finish. The point is that black now threatens to play ...[ g5 ] with strong initiative
 [ e5 ] , [ Q e7 ]  Thinks of pinning the pawn. But it is only temporary.
 [ B d7 ]  [ B d2 ]  [ B x a4 ]  [ b x a4 ] , [ Q x a5 ]  And now white resigns.
 [ e x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ] , [ N c5 ]  With pressure on [ e4 ] the point of the ...[ N a6 ] manouvre.
 [ Q c5 ]  [ Q x c5 ]  [ d x c5 ] , [ R f7 ]  Black found the move but now with queens off the board and his rooks trapped in the corners white's rooks become juggernauts.
 [ g5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B g4 ] , [ b3 ]  Not a good move. Better perhaps was the quiet 8. [ B d2 ] without gridlocking the WSB's retreat. I also missed the blistering 8. Bxf7+! [ K x f7 ] 9. [ N x g5 + ] [ B x g5 ] 10. [ Q x g4 ] Bxf4. In blitz normally with the Kings Gambit I do not fianchetto the DSB. But here for some reason -- probably since I had more time to think -- I went against my intuition. And I soon regretted it.
 [ Q c1 ] , [ R f c8 ]  The pressure on the c file is mounting
 [ b x c6 ] , [ Q a4 ]  Attacking the broken pawns and defending the [ e4 ] pawn that would be in danger after black plays 11. ... [ B x f3 ] 12. [ N x f3 ] (else the king's castle is ruined with 12. gxf3) Nxe4.
 [ Q f6 ] , [ Q d3 ]  decide no darme la ventaja de movimiento. He decides not give to me a time of advantage in the develop of the knight.
 [ N x a7 ]  [ b x a7 ]  [ Q x a7 ] , [ R x b8 ]  Avoiding disentanglement because of [ R x b1 ] [ Q x b1 ] [ Q x a4 ] ideas so now the knight can move. That said finding a meaningful outpost is something of a quest rather than a manoeuvre.
 [ B f1 ]  [ Q a5 ]  [ R g1 ] , [ h5 ]  ?! After I had played 14.Rg1?? Why not [ B x f3 ] go up by 6
 [ f x e5 ]  [ d x e5 ] , [ N f3 ]  
 [ B d3 ] , [ Q a3 ]  36...[ R f c8 ] seems to have its points though Black would have been no closer to hauling in those runaway pawns: 36...[ R f c8 ] 37.[ a5 ] [ R b3 ] 38.[ Q e2 ] [ Q a3 ] 39.[ R d1 ] etc.
 [ R e1 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ Q e3 ] , [ N e c6 ]  Black has so far rearranged his pieces in an orderly way without losing time and should be able to castle soon.
 [ K f1 ]  [ B d5 ] , [ R e1 ]  This seems to lose material and gives white little chance of recovering the game without a blunder. I think 25. [ b4 ] would have been better as it would have given two (admittedly doubled) passed pawns which at least creates some threats in the black camp. However now ...
 [ d x e5 ] , [ d x e5 ]  Black takes [ e5 ] as it is time to clarify (simplify) the centre and white takes back with the pawn. I think taking with the knight (8. Nxe5) had been an interesting and more aggressive alternative where white would have kept the strain in the centre and prevented the exchange of queens
 [ N c6 ] , [ f5 ]  blocking almost everything here for black side.
 [ R x c3 ]  [ K g8 ]  [ N f5 ]  [ K f7 ] , [ N d4 ]  Now I was thinking of a way to checkmate him. These rook/knight mates are always oh-so-hard to pull off.
 [ N g e4 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ B x e4 ]  [ d x e4 ] , [ c5 ]  Two active pieces was exchanged for my passivs and I pushed [ c5 ] with tempo.
 [ R b5 ] , [ B b4 ]  The bishop-pawn pair cannot be dislodged now
 [ R f e8 ]  [ g5 ]  [ Q g6 ]  [ N f1 ] , [ R d7 ]  I think about doubling up
 [ B x e5 ] , [ d x e5 ]  [%clk 0:03:51] The latent threat [ N x c3 ] saccing a N for two pawns is still possible but I sense my opponent is not going for it.
 [ a4 ] , [ N g6 ]  finally the knigt awakes (well I should have killed him a few moves ago but... ok)
 [ B x f6 ]  [ g x f6 ] , [ a3 ]  ? This move is meant to give an escape space to the LSB (on a2) and foreshadow a queenside attack but it really just doesn't get much done. Best was 10.[ N x d5 ] as I mentioned above.
 [ f x g3 ] , [ c6 ]  White: King_0_Nothing Black: Janheckman
 [ K e6 ]  [ K e4 ] , [ f5 + ]  ?! I'm not sure I would have done that... It makes his g pawn vulnerable to my rook.
 [ B x f5 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ Q x f3 ]  White resigns.
 [ O-O ]  [ B d3 ]  [ R e8 ] , [ f4 ]  Not sure what I was thinking here. F4 makes my e-pawn weak.
 [ B e3 ] , [ Q x e4 ]  An alternative is QxPb2+. This forces a queen trade but ultimately does not work out as well for black. The [ e4 ] pawn is the much tastier morsel.
 [ B x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ Q g5 + ] , [ N e3 ]  This doesn't seem to be my best option as Black can play 18... f4. [ K b1 ] seems better.
 [ d4 ]  [ f5 ]  [ c4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ g3 ] , [ e6 ]  Alekhine meets Bogoljuboff's QP opening with the Dutch defense.
 [ N x e4 ] , [ Q d5 ]  Really odd move bringng the queen out really early
 [ K f6 ] , [ K e3 ]  To late dear white king your c pawn is history. And somehow I sensed that the a pawn wouldn't have long to live either.
 [ R b x c4 ]  [ b x c4 ]  [ R x c4 ]  [ B x b7 ]  [ R x c2 ]  [ B x a6 ]  [ R c3 + ] , [ R e3 ]  Material is exchanged and white comes out with a material lead of a bishop for a pawn. Both sides have a passed pawn but while black's is obstructed by the white king and rook white's passed pawn has a clear path to promotion.
 [ Q d1 ]  [ B x f1 ]  [ Q x f1 ] , [ d4 ]  I go ahead and continue pushing as now I am getting antsy myself at times.
 [ f5 ]  [ K x e5 ]  [ f x g4 ] , [ N c3 ]  Keeping the white king in its dominating central position
 [ R a e8 ]  [ R b e1 ] , [ e4 ]  strong move ! white probably didn't see it coming the threat is clear exf and than checkmate the white king and the queen is under attack on the same time . how white is going to stop the attack without losing large material its seems that winning for black is now matter of simple technique
 [ K g2 ] , [ R f8 ]  The white king is trapped into a corner and I have three passed pawns things are looking up. At this point I was optimistic that I might win or at worst draw.
 [ N x c6 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ N x a7 + ]  [ K d8 ] , [ N b5 ]  White moves to protect pawn @ c3.
 [ Q d8 ]  [ B x h6 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ B g7 ]  Bg7! And now there is a lot of tactical chooses to make for black. Which is the best one for black? Unfortunately I have trouble finding any good ones. This is one suggested line; 21. [ B g7 ] [ f x e4 ] 22. [ B x h8 ] [ B x d5 ] 23. [ B x f6 ] [ Q d7 ] 24. [ R g8 ] [ B f8 ] 25. [ R e1 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ B x e4 ]  [ f x e4 ]  [ B x h8 ] , [ e x f3 ]  As far as I can see the black queen is lost whether black did take the time to fetch a knight or not
 [ K f7 ] , [ B d6 ]  preventing black from penatrating into the queenside.
 [ e6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ] , [ e x d5 ]  3. ...... [ e x d5 ] - as a result of this pawn trade we are in a spacious opening called The Exchange Variation of the French Defense which is slightly favourable to black in the World and the Gameknot Database but I think that white can still get a good game here.
 [ N f4 ]  [ R e3 ]  [ R c1 ]  [ h4 ]  [ R f1 + ]  [ K g3 ]  [ e1 = Q + ]  [ R x e1 ]  [ N h5 + ]  [ K g4 ]  [ N f6 + ]  [ K g5 ]  [ R x e1 ]  [ h5 ]  [ h6 + ]  [ K h4 ]  [ R g1 ]  [ f4 ]  [ K c6 ]  [ f5 ]  [ K d5 ]  [ K h3 ]  [ K e4 ]  [ K h2 ]  [ R g4 ]  [ K h3 ]  [ K f3 ]  [ K h2 ]  [ R g5 ]  [ K h3 ] , [ R x h5 # ]  
 [ Q x e2 ] , [ Q d5 ]  Trying to avoid liquidation but this allows me to grab his Q. Right before I moved Tom realized what he had done and wanted to take the move back. I did not do it but were this is a casual game I would've allowed to go back. However we more or less have to follow tournament rules in Jack's tournaments since it's practice for the real world.
 [ R g7 ] , [ Q x g7 # ]  This is what was played but it didn't matter. Even after 20. ...[ N f8 ] mate is guaranteed after 21. Nxg8. I thought this was an interesting game and wanted to share it. Comments are greatly appreciated!!
 [ N b3 + ]  [ K b4 ] , [ a3 + ]  In retrospect this seems to be a bad move. He can't take my knight because [ R c3 + ] would win his queen but my pawn will fall. I played this move quickly without thinking.
 [ K f8 ]  [ K f2 ] , [ K e8 ]  Probably a wasted move. I was waffling on the best way to try to limit Whites Rooks mobility and/or get my King in the action.
 [ Q e7 ] , [ N x c6 ]  (I should have played 28.[ c4 ] dx[ c4 ] (28...[ N x [ e5 ] ] 29.[ f x [ e5 ] ] [ R x f1 ] 30.[ R x f1 ] dx[ c4 ] 31.Bx[ c4 ] c5) (28...bxc3!? 29.[ Q x c3 ] [ N x [ e5 ] ] 30.[ d x [ e5 ] ] [ B b5 ] 31.[ R f d1 ] [ c6 ] 32.[ B c5 ] [ Q b7 ] 33.[ B x f8 ] [ R x f8 ] 34.Qe3) 29.Nx[ c6 ] Bx[ c6 ] 30.Bx[ c4 ] White can't place the knight on [ e5 ] now. Black has an edge here but this was still the best choice for White)
 [ K e8 ]  [ N c7 + ] , [ K f7 ]  Probably best. The d8-square has not been comfortable lodgings for the Black King!
 [ B x d5 ] , [ N f6 ]  ? As a result I attempt to chase his LSB away but it will not work because he will pin my [ f6 ] knight with 9.Bg5.
 [ e4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ B b4 ]  Winawer variation
 [ Q c7 ] , [ R b1 ]  Grabbing the open file and freeing the knight to move.
 [ K g1 ]  [ R x h4 ] , [ R d1 ]  Wanting to stop the promotion.
 [ Q g5 ] , [ f4 ]  And with that being said I attack yet again.
 [ e x d6 ] , [ R e8 ]  not good but what else can black do?
 [ c4 ] , [ g5 ]  this little pawn should be enought treath to postpone the queen side white attack
 [ B e2 ] , [ c5 ]  After this it becomes like a normal tarrasch.
 [ R x f7 ]  [ B x f7 + ]  [ K x f7 ] , [ Q f3 ]  With my Kingside badly weakened getting the Queen into the game seems sound although 8. [ B g5 ] pinning my Knight seems strong to me because I would be loathe to further weaken my already bad pawn structure on the Kingside.
 [ N x e5 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N x c6 ]  [ d x c6 ]  [ e5 ]  [ Q d5 ] , [ d4 ]  I think this was mistake. Maybe Q [ e2 ] was better?
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ] , [ f4 ]  my preferred way to tackle the Sicilian...
 [ Q b8 ]  [ d x c5 ]  [ Q c8 ] , [ Q c3 ]  The next few moves were in time rush so don't pay too much attention to the accuracy.
 [ R g5 ]  [ B g6 ]  [ N c4 ]  [ R a e8 ] , [ h4 ]  I see the pawn threat forcing my bishop back and block my only defender of [ g7 ]  [ K h2 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ B f2 ]  [ R h1 + ]  [ K g3 ] , [ R d8 ]  nice shot of [ R d3 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ Q x e5 ]  [ R d3 + ] , [ B e3 ]  to benefit from the pin on the bishop
 [ N x g3 + ]  [ B x g3 ]  [ B x g3 ] , [ h3 ]  28. [ h3 ] - forced to prevent mate on h2.
 [ g x f6 ]  [ Q d2 ] , [ h5 ]  I threaten the [ h6 ] pawn so he pushed.
 [ B g6 ] , [ N e5 ]  This is to 1) support [ g4 ] (I want to play h5) and 2) to prevent [ h6 ] (NxB fxN should follow weakening black's kingside).
 [ K e5 ]  [ R f1 ]  [ b4 ] , [ R e1 ]  I'm just preparing for my king to jump to [ f2 ] also preventing my opponent from advancing his passed pawn.
 [ f5 ]  [ N e5 ] , [ R x e5 ]  Now he cannot stop all 3 pawns from queening even without the kings help

 [ K f7 ]  [ R b7 + ]  [ K g6 ] , [ R e2 ]  The idea was to sac more pawns in order to get my Rs on the seventh.
 [ N x e7 + ]  [ N x e7 ] , [ Q x d6 ]  Score and more importantly I seize the now opened d-file! but a better move might be [ f x e5 ]  [ Q x d6 ]  [ R x d6 ] , [ a5 ]  [ N f5 ] would be better threatening both my rook and black squared bishop
 [ B d3 ] , [ g5 ]  ...[ g4 ] is a threat as the N has no squares. And it grabs space while my K is in the center but well protected for the time being.
 [ e4 ] , [ e6 ]  The French Defense is tough to crack.
 [ h x g3 ] , [ Q x g3 ]  This is the other move that takes a little looking to see. It's tempting to try to keep White in check but that would actually allow the King to escape through [ g2 ] and maybe find safety on the queenside. The text allows no such escape.
 [ R x d6 ] , [ R e8 ]  Going for that 7th rank..
 [ g x f6 ]  [ Q x f7 + ]  [ K d6 ]  [ N c4 + ]  [ K c6 ] , [ B e4 + ]  22. [ B e4 + ] - Henry is now lured up the board into white's camp. It is a very cold inhospitable place for a king especially in the middlegame. Poor Glenda has been given no time to help him on with those medieval stockings which she has been carefully darning for him over the last few weeks. All she can do is watch and wait for an opportunity to protect him from the Wicked Witch.
 [ g3 ] , [ f x g3 ]  I know it's not normally good to trade Pawns when materially ahead in the endgame but I don't see much choice. ...P-[ B6 ] would leave me with a Pawn in a difficult spot to defend.
 [ a6 ]  [ R f2 ]  [ a7 ]  [ B d4 ] , [ a8 = Q ]  39.[ R b3 + ] [ R f3 + ] . 40. [ K h1 ] R:b3. 41. [ a1 ] = Q [ R b1 ] #
 [ d x e6 ] , [ d x e6 ]  I am not really in a nice position but I was not so stupid as to play Qxe6. Besides I had to give the [ N b8 ] a square since I didn't want it to block my bishop's action on the white diagonal. His queen has to take care of BxN always. And if he jumps to [ d4 ] this is not a very dangerous position for me... not right now.
 [ c3 ]  [ c5 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ N e2 ]  This move may look strange but it is important. White doesn't develop his king's knight to [ f3 ] as he may wish to play [ f4 ] later on or have the need to protect his d-pawn again with the other knight going to f3.
 [ R x d5 ] , [ K e7 ]  Black has a bad pawn structure now. The bishop on [ g7 ] is blocked in by its own pawns.
 [ N d7 ] , [ N d2 ]  Clearing the path for the KBP and also preparing to swing the Knight to the Q side.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ d3 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ h3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B g5 ]  [ d6 ]  [ c3 ]  [ h6 ]  [ B d2 ]  [ R e8 ] , [ Q c1 ]  Already preparing the bishop sac on h6. 9. O-O would have been better.
 [ b6 ] , [ B e3 ]  i already renounced to my dark bishop hoping to exchange the knight. I know it can sound strange but I expected to valorize my own knights against the pawns.
 [ K x f1 ] , [ K g6 ]  Now all the pieces are gone and my extra Pawn is an enormous advantage. White's K has to defend both flanks.
 [ B d7 ]  [ R x c7 ]  [ B g4 ] , [ N e5 ]  pressuring the [ f7 ] pawn in an attempt to divert blacks attention from my newly passed pawn on d. The combination of pieces I have remaining should be enough to ensure promotion for this pawn if needed I have [ N c6 ] as an option if black tries to prevent promotion with his rook
 [ N x d5 ]  [ N x g6 ]  [ f x g6 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ O-O ]  [ Q x e4 ] , [ g5 ]  May be better 15 [ N c6 ] delivering Rook.This move makes possible all that followed.
 [ R x e7 ]  [ R x e7 ] , [ N f5 ]  ! And now for the REAL fight. White has a ton of ammo directed at black's king and at [ f7 ] in particular. Black plays 22...[ N f5 ] to attack the white [ R e7 ] but more importantly to clear the d file for his rook.
 [ g x f4 ] , [ g4 ]  White g pawn takes [ f4 ] pawn and black g pawn moves along to [ g4 ] square.
 [ B h6 ] , [ B x h6 ]  A surprising move by white. Didn't see any reason not to capitalize on it.
 [ Q a4 ]  [ g5 ] , [ f3 ]  !? This is a great defensive try making the game very complicated. This is why the queen went to [ a4 ] instead of [ b3 ] because if black wants to preserve the bishop he can't attack the queen by retreating to e6. Now black has many ways to win a pawn and chooses...
 [ R x c4 ] , [ d x e2 ]  A pawn sacrifice that readies the doubling of rooks.
 [ K x f2 ]  [ Q c5 + ]  [ R e3 ]  [ Q x c4 ] , [ b3 ]  ! Giving some accesses for my bishop.
 [ B g2 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ f4 ] , [ c6 ]  21. ..... [ c6 ] - my [ d5 ] pawn must be backed up.
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B b5 ] , [ N f6 ]  An unusual reply to the Spanish opening. Quite playable. Attacks the [ e4 ] pawn.
 [ d6 ] , [ B e2 ]  Not sure about this move. I wanted to castle but did not want to spend tempo protecting the Knights either.
 [ R b8 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ Q b2 ]  [ K d2 ] , [ N h5 ]  time to disrupt Blacks' illusions...
 [ Q e7 ] , [ R f1 f3 ]  Surely to be followed by tripling on the f-file...
 [ g3 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ c6 ]  This move gives Black pawn control of [ d5 ] and also prepares a later break in the center.
 [ f5 ] , [ e x d5 ]  12. [ e x d5 ] - I now offer up a pawn. Black accepts but this one is laced with poison.
 [ R f e1 ] , [ N f5 ]  White: King_0_Nothing Black: Janheckman
 [ N e c6 ] , [ B e3 ]  Otherwise black can play [ B c5 ] and castling is difficult
 [ N x e6 ]  [ R x d8 ] , [ N x d8 ]  They will sing songs of your bravery My Lady.
 [ N f6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ] , [ Q c2 ]  White can also play [ B f4 ] to prevent black from developing his queen to [ c7 ]  [ Q c7 ] , [ e5 ]  This allows my queen and bishop some room to move at the cost of allowing black to post a Knight at d5.
 [ B c5 + ] , [ K f1 ]  [ K h2 ] [ N d2 ] takes a while longer...
 [ c3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ B h6 ]  Getting the queen in danger
 [ R x e5 ]  [ B x e5 ]  [ c3 ]  [ b6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ B d6 ] , [ a4 ]  With dreams of trading off this isolated pawn while punching a hole in black's chain.
 [ N c6 ] , [ B c4 ]  Yup he's threatening mate in one
 [ N d5 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ R d2 ] , [ K c8 ]  keeping control of [ d8 ] in case Black plays [ N x e7 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ B d8 ]  [ b3 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ N e3 ]  [ B e7 ] , [ B h2 ]  A better move would be 29.[ c4 ] to prevent Black's next move.
 [ N x e5 ]  [ Q x e5 + ] , [ B e6 ]  Ouch this move allows a discovered attack that will win black's DSB
 [ Q x g2 + ]  [ K e1 ] , [ d5 ]  Now black has equalized material (which seems somewhat unimportant now) and he adds pressure to the e file.
 [ R e8 ]  [ N g3 ] , [ N x g3 ]  This is a mistake as it opens the KR file and lets my Rook have an avenue of attack.
 [ B d5 ] , [ a5 ]  the light - squared Bishop cannot capture the pawn on [ a5 ] or check the king on b4.
 [ a4 ]  [ a6 ]  [ a x b5 ]  [ c x b5 ] , [ c4 ]  Always obsessed by opening the queen-side.
 [ B d4 ] , [ R c6 ]  If 36.[ B x d6 ] Black can lose the Bishop
 [ B x e4 ] , [ B x e4 ]  Even without the extra pawn this would be very good for Black. The Bishop pair is much better than two Knights.
 [ Q f3 ] , [ Q d5 ]  This stopped 14. [ Q h3 + ] [ K g7 ] 15. [ d5 + ] [ K g8 ] 16. [ Q h7 # ]  [ K g7 ]  [ Q h7 + ]  [ K f6 ]  [ N e4 + ] , [ K f5 ]  15.[ Q e4 ] would have made it last longer
 [ B c6 ] , [ B x c6 ]  White got away with it. Better get rid of that bishop before black sees the blunder.
 [ Q g4 + ]  [ K h8 ] , [ Q x f4 ]  With White two pawns ahead a win is probable IF I can just survive Black's Kingside attack.
 [ R e d5 ] , [ Q f7 ]  It's up to you black.
 [ K f4 ]  [ g6 ]  [ K x f3 ]  [ g7 ]  [ e5 ] , [ g8 = Q ]  ...and so I get my queen. She could easily go d5-c5-[ b4 ] and guard the [ e1 ] square and if I do lose her I could get a replacement.
 [ Q h5 ]  [ K g2 ] , [ B g1 ]  "Sacrificing the bishop in order to continue the attack on White's king." - Garry Kasparov
 [ Q c4 ]  [ R a7 ]  [ Q b5 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ K h1 ] , [ K f8 ]  39. ..... [ K f8 ] - a lot of piece shuffling has been going on over the last few moves now the two kings get in the mood!
 [ B e2 ]  [ K c3 ] , [ B f3 ]  A valiant if pointless attack.
 [ d x c5 ]  [ b x c5 ] , [ B x c5 ]  trade offs.
 [ R b6 ]  [ K f7 ]  [ K g2 ]  [ R b3 ]  [ c6 ] , [ R c3 ]  Inviting White to exchange the last of the Q-side Pawns.
 [ d x e4 ]  [ d x e4 ] , [ N x e4 ]  Now I had an extra pawn
 [ O-O ] , [ O-O-O ]  I feel a little happier about sacrificing my bishop now that the white king has castled as the kings cover will be completely blown wide open....
 [ N x e3 ]  [ N x e3 ] , [ Q d4 ]  here if white plays [ Q x d4 ] black responds [ R x d4 ] and not [ e x d4 ]  [ Q a3 ] , [ B g5 ]  a tactical threat. if [ Q x a7 ] [ B x e3 ] [ f x e3 + ] [ R e2 ] Qxd3. This leaves black in command of the d file. A trade of 1 pawn for 2 and white's pawns on [ c4 ] and [ e4 ] would become new targets.
 [ B b3 ]  [ d4 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ N x e4 ] , [ d x e4 ]  14. [ d x e4 ] - after this trade of knights Ken has a very strong pawn centre. That [ d4 ] pawn was to very nearly win the game for Ken later on.
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B b4 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ c5 ]  [ d x c5 ] , [ B x c3 + ]  5...[ N a6 ] has yielded good results.
 [ K c7 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ e6 ]  [ e6 ] stops the fork for the moment but has a down side of giving white a passed pawn. [ K d8 ] or [ Q a6 ] are other options to look into but I kinda liked this one because it gave me some time. Though probably not the best choice because that pawn will be very hard to stop.
 [ b3 + ]  [ K d3 ] , [ B f1 + ]  It seems coverable but...
 [ K c2 ] , [ B e1 ]  I believe the advantage may be swinging towards black.
 [ R e1 ] , [ R h6 ]  Moving rook to [ h6 ] to provide support as defence against rook at [ e1 ] moving along the file to support queen.
 [ R b d8 ] , [ R d1 ]  logical since it's protected by the knight... 25. [ R d2 ] would've tied his queen down...
 [ b x c6 ] , [ c4 ]  The Bind is set. Black can attempt to immediately break it with pushing [ d5 ] (resulting in a dull game where white retains a pawn advantage for the endgame). [ c5 ] to push the knight is ineffective due to [ N c2 ] where white still retains excellent piece activity (or later [ N f5 ] to trade off).
 [ Q x f7 + ]  [ K x f7 ] , [ B x c7 ]  The bishop can escape with a somewhat uneasy position but he can't trap it. Not a great advantage but better than nothing.
 [ K x c5 ] , [ d3 + ]  Discovered Check!
 [ B d2 ]  [ B x d2 + ]  [ K x d2 ] , [ O-O ]  Escaping the pin.
 [ c3 ] , [ Q b6 ]  Frees the knight from his tiresome defense of f6.
 [ a4 ] , [ R x c2 ]  ...White doesn't respond to. I was expecting 22 R-[ Q B1 ] to preserve material equality.
 [ B f5 ]  [ Q g3 ] , [ B x e4 ]  Black elects to trade down further which is probably fine. Black will have to be careful that white does not mount too much pressure on his king-side however.
 [ R f3 ]  [ R a d8 ]  [ a4 ] , [ R d8 d3 ]  Forces the rook exchange. White has nowhere to retreat. This eliminates the last of white's pieces leaving an impossible endgame for white.
 [ N f6 ]  [ B x a6 ] , [ B x a6 ]  This is why I had my Queen placed behind my Bishop.
 [ N x g6 ] , [ R e5 ]  If Black plays ...[ N x h1 ] he gets mated.
 [ N d6 ]  [ R c7 ]  [ N b5 ] , [ R d7 ]  right back at you...
 [ Q b7 ]  [ R a e1 ]  [ B x f3 + ]  [ R x f3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ R d3 ]  [ R f d8 ]  [ Q e2 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ] , [ Q f3 ]  ? A better move was 24. [ N x d5 ]  [ R d e8 ] , [ R d d1 ]  White is more and more in a bad situation. The pawn center is destroyed and the black d pawn can break through.
 [ B x c3 ]  [ f6 ] , [ N x g6 ]  !
 [ B x h2 + ]  [ K h1 ]  [ Q e7 ]  [ Q g6 ]  [ B e5 ]  [ Q x g4 ] , [ Q x f7 ]  Glad to be rid of the Knight on f7!
 [ K h8 ]  [ h x g6 ] , [ f x g6 ]  the true was that the mate was there and i didnt see it first i was planing to take the [ g6 ] pawn with the qeen then mate. But [ R h7 ] was mate right now ! nice isnt it ?
 [ B x d5 ] , [ R x e5 ]  White has gained a pawn and now forks the black queen at [ e7 ] and the black bishop at d5. Black is already doomed to losing some material.
 [ B e3 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N g e2 ]  [ c6 ]  [ Q b3 ]  [ e x d4 ] , [ N x d4 ]  9. [ N x [ d4 ] ] - when looking at the World Database there seemed to be a better percentage in exchanging pawns on [ d4 ] but was this a case of do not trust database when it is thin?
 [ e5 ]  [ N d5 ] , [ d4 ]  Taking even more central territory. White's advantage right now is decisive.
 [ R a d1 ]  [ a5 ]  [ b5 ] , [ R g6 ]  GN has the advantage at -0.49 (for Black) while Fritz has the game equal.
 [ K d2 ]  [ R d5 + ]  [ K e2 ] , [ R x d1 ]  Clearing the Dance Floor
 [ K b7 ] , [ R e8 ]  
 [ R b5 ] , [ K g8 ]  
 [ K h2 ]  [ h6 ]  [ b5 ]  [ R e4 ]  [ b x a6 ]  [ b x a6 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ R c4 ]  [ N e7 + ]  [ K f8 ]  [ N x g6 + ] , [ f x g6 ]  Black's pawn structure is a little fractured but there is a two-pawn edge.
 [ d5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ N x e4 ] , [ N d7 ]  This is the Karpov varation or smlyov varation. Black plays n[ [ d7 ] ] in order to play [ N f6 ] without having to mess up the kingside pawns. It also prepares the eventually counterattacking ...[ d5 ] or ...e5. Also this avoids the classical mainline which has traditionally give white a superior edge. The main line continues 4. ...[ B f5 ] 8. Ng3...[ B g6 ] 6. H4 [ h6 ] 7. [ N f3 ] [ N f6 ] The positional basis of 7. ...[ N f6 ] is that black tempts white into playing [ N [ [ [ [ e5 ] ] ] ] ] and then after the retreat 8. ...[ B h7 ] black tries to prove that the well placed Knight on [ [ [ [ e5 ] ] ] ] is a target. Traditional plans for black to undermine the [ [ [ [ e5 ] ] ] ] knight are c6-[ c5 ] or attacking it directly with moves like [ b d6 ] Nb-[ [ d7 ] ] and Qc7. This follows the general chess principle that a peice does not control the square it is sitting on. So by going to [ [ [ [ e5 ] ] ] ] the knight has given up control of [ [ [ [ e5 ] ] ] ] and d4.
 [ Q a5 + ]  [ c3 ]  [ B x e5 ] , [ N c4 ]  Nice - but not good enough black exchange pieces and come out with even more material due to the un-developed white pieces.
 [ R d5 ] , [ R h8 ]  Mate is now forced unless White gives up his Rook with 26 R-Q2.
 [ Q e1 ] , [ Q c6 + ]  Check! White will lose his Rook in the next move because of this fork!
 [ Q x g6 ] , [ R e g8 ]  Cleverly pinning the queen and king. Sadly for him he doesn't have the time to take advantage of the pin.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ O-O ]  [ c6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ d3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ] , [ N x d5 ]  All the games begin here.
 [ d6 ]  [ d4 ] , [ g6 ]  2. ..... [ g6 ] - this opening has become the Pirc/Robatsch Defense after both the d and g pawns have been advanced one square in response to my [ e4 ] and d5. Afro is gonna allow me to develop a strong pawn centre and then undermine it.
 [ R h d8 ] , [ B e6 ]  Be5! - I believe this wins for White. Either black loses the queen for a bishop or it's mate in 5.
 [ Q d4 + ]  [ K h1 ] , [ f5 ]  The knight on [ e5 ] is pinned! 25. [ Q f2 ] would hold everything together but...
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ B c4 ]  A standard Italian Game up until now; this is the point at which Black must decide whether he is actually going to use the Blackburne or go for something a lot more main line: 3...[ B c5 ] (Giuoco Piano although I'm not a fan) or [ N f6 ] (Two Knights defence) for example.
 [ R c2 x c6 ]  [ Q x b2 ] , [ B x d5 ]  27. [ B x d5 ] - so I lose a pawn after all but I am in no mood to throw in the sponge. Time to shake off this passivitis - Joanne and get a few threats in to keep your opponent busy at the least!
 [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ] , [ Q x d4 ]  wow... thanks for the queen
 [ Q e3 ] , [ h4 ]  White has a small window to defend. [ R f1 ] would probably have been the best move.
 [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ a6 ]  And here is the typical Najdorf variation of the Sicilian defence. I have only recently grown the stones to start playing the Sicilian. I am 36 years old and have been playing chess for about 25 years. Trust me when I tell you that I have played 10's of thousands of games in my life (including the ridiculous 6500 something here on GK). Of all of those games I would guess that only in a few hundred have I played 1...[ c5 ] vs. 1. e4. For those that know me I'm a Scandanavian player. I have realized (finally!) that I am entirely too predictable so I have put a few of my fears to rest and have started branching out some. To me the Sicilian has always represented some of the most scary (yet oddly thrilling) aspects of playing with the black pieces. There are just too many variations that can arise and I have always tried to steer towards more simple straight-forward opening lines. In doing some reading (and also going through some great annotations right here on GK) I have decided to tackle the Najdorf. Hopefully with some practice I can safely add it to my repitoire and not feel suicidal in doing so.......
 [ K b8 ]  [ B g5 ] , [ R d6 ]  All of a sudden the iniative is back the other way and I cannot easily prevent Nc2. My only option is to play 20. [ R b1 ] and hope that black plays 20... [ K a8 ] with 21. [ B d5 ] to follow.
 [ R e8 ] , [ K f1 ]  Moving the [ g4 ] pawn would have also been appropriate. I guess we can now say we're in the endgame since most of the threats will come to or from pawns. I'm up a bishop and two kingside pawns- victory I thought was assured. Credit my uneven playing and my opponents excellent tactical play particularly with the knight to turning this into a drawn game.
 [ B g6 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N x c6 ] , [ b x c6 ]  Trade of knights Giving the bishop little to no life but its still a good bishop and the endgame should we reach it could be quite good for white.
 [ g x f5 ]  [ N x h1 ] , [ N x f7 ]  ! Now if I move the R [ g7 ] and I'll lose it for the pawn!!!!
 [ Q x g5 ] , [ f x g5 ]  Q's are off the board...
 [ R b1 ] , [ N b d7 ]  I decide to try and activate my remaining pieces. So far it's been a fairly tame game..
 [ B d3 ]  [ N e7 ]  [ Q c2 ] , [ N g6 ]  [ N g6 ] is the 7th move of this N. more than the 3rd of blaks'move.
 [ Q d3 ] , [ h6 ]  not comfortable with that threatening bishop there...chase it away
 [ Q d7 ]  [ Q x c4 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ d4 ]  [ R f8 ] , [ R g1 ]  Oh I think I would have traded rooks. Black could still castle on the queen's side even though those pawns are obliterated.
 [ e6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ B b4 ]  these were the imposed moves. I must admit I would never play this as black. Neither as white as I never play e4...
 [ R x d4 ] , [ Q c3 ]  29. Qc3?? - This move allows #2 but gameknot's best move suggests I am busted anyhow. This is far more painless! Blunder: -Mate(2) » 29. [ Q c3 ] [ R d1 + ] 30. [ K f2 ] [ Q f3 # ] Best: -18.61 » 29. [ h3 ] [ R d1 + ] 30. [ Q x d1 ] [ Q x e3 + ] 31. [ K f1 ] [ B x d1 ] 32. [ R g2 ] [ B b3 ] 33. [ R c2 ] [ B x c2 ] 34. [ g4 ] [ Q x h3 + ] 35. [ K f2 ] Qx[ g4 ] 36. [ e6 ] fx[ e6 ] 37. [ K e3 ] [ Q e4 + ] 38. [ K f2 ]  [ R d1 + ]  [ K f2 ] , [ Q f3 # ]  30. ..... [ Q f3 # ] - here I get Freddied again. Now I have two goals I wish to achieve. Goal no.1 - Get to 2000 (Expertdom) and Goal No.2 - Nail The Master Mater. With every checkmate he has put on me the more I have wanted to nail him. My strategy is to watch how you other Knights of Honour guys get on against him and try and glean something from it and hopefully give myself the building blocks and necessary formula to beat him! Watch this space ...... Joanne
 [ N f6 ]  [ K f5 ] , [ N h7 ]  Otherwise we just repeat moves. 76. g6? [ B x f6 ] is no help of course.
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ g6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ e4 ]  [ d6 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ O-O ]  A relatively common way to start a chess game. When you look in the chess database on GK(which I use bery much) it is always the first or the second move people use. Most of the time white answers with Be2(4101 times) but I answered with Bg5(203 times) I give relatively often one of my bishops for a knight. And evermore I have something hearth that you in this way get a better standing of the pawns.
 [ e x d5 ] , [ B g4 ]  ?? Now he gives me the knight????
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ d4 ]  I hate the scotch. I have played many games over the board against strong players who have played the scotch and it is by far the hardest white system for me to play against.
 [ K d1 ] , [ N g4 ]  Aiming for [ f2 ] to trap the rook
 [ a x b5 ]  [ a x b5 ]  [ R x a1 ]  [ Q x a1 ] , [ Q e6 ]  18... cxb5?. 19. [ N x d5 ] and black's b-pawn will also go.
 [ B c4 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ B e3 ] , [ N c6 ]  Both sides are developing as quickly as possible at this stage. There are of course many options at each move but I think this is a main line.
 [ a3 ] , [ K d6 ]  I decided to move up my king just enough to support ....[ N e5 ] and then see if I could force something more. He could not play 32. [ R [ e8 ] ] to move 39. [ R d8 + ] and take my rook since the knight guarded my [ e8 ] square.
 [ e4 ] , [ e5 ]  Nothing special yet
 [ R h3 ] , [ K d4 ]  ?? Allowing a fork to happen.
 [ N g x e7 ] , [ N d2 ]  Continuing to develop.
 [ R b2 ] , [ Q x a3 ]  31. [ Q x a3 ] - reducing it to zero - again should have been plus 4.
 [ K x h7 ]  [ Q x b4 ] , [ b6 ]  Here Black is thinking of developing his remaining bishop to [ b7 ] and planning on exchanging it with White's knight in order to blow the g file open.
 [ B g7 ] , [ N c3 ]  Now I can develop my Knight *behind* the Pawn.
 [ Q c5 ] , [ R b f8 ]  As when he protect I attack [ [ f2 ] ] a second time knowing how critical the [ [ f2 ] ] and [ f7 ] squares are. It doesn't matter as much here as during the opening. But taking would place white in check after which I could protect [ e7 ] once and for all which would leave me a pawn up. That's what I'm keeping in mind here.
 [ N x c6 ] , [ b x c6 ]  An automatic response you might think but in fact much more frequently played is 5...[ Q f6 ] threatening a mate on f2. White usually responds with 6.[ Q f3 ] whereat Black takes 6...bxc6.
 [ B b2 ] , [ R d2 ]  Forking the Bishops and forcing Corzo's hand.
 [ O-O ] , [ N c3 ]  Fritz likes 18 [ R d2 ] here followed by Rhd1.
 [ B x f6 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ Q d2 ] , [ g5 ]  White's h-pawn now has something to attack...
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ f4 ] , [ e x f4 ]  A true gentleman always accepts a gambit! Especially when it's offered by an amateur to a master.
 [ Q b2 ]  [ R x a4 ]  [ R f e8 ]  [ R d2 ]  [ Q c3 ]  [ Q d3 ] , [ Q b2 ]  32. .... [ Q b2 ] - black continues to decline my offer to trade queens. Will he regret this? Read on.
 [ B g6 ] , [ N g e2 ]  The usual deployment aiming for f4.
 [ K d3 ]  [ N x f5 ]  [ B x f5 ]  [ b x c3 ] , [ K x c3 ]  The dust clears and Black is a whole rook up. Now he just has to avoid blunders ...
 [ Q x f6 ]  [ N x f6 ] , [ B f3 ]  After he took my LSB was attacked so I had no choice but to retreat it.
 [ R x g7 ]  [ h6 ]  [ K f2 ] , [ R e6 ]  26.[ R x g7 ] [ h6 ] 27.[ K f2 ] Re6! Black has an extra pawn and very well placed pieces and king. His only problem is the fractured pawn structure. 9K plays to steadily improve the position of his king and rook while keeping an eye on stopping White's counter-play. White’s knight is totally dominated by Black’s bishop here which pretty much kills all thoughts of meaningful counter-play.
 [ B e2 ] , [ B d6 ]  d6! My boy rJacobs loves this move!
 [ Q x d4 ]  [ h x g4 ] , [ R g8 ]  Here's the big difference between 24...f5! and 24...Bd4? -- Black no longer has the initiative in this line and is forced to try to stave off White's attacks instead of making his own.
 [ N a4 ] , [ R e d1 ]  Last piece of strategic tweaking....
 [ e x f6 ]  [ Q x f6 ] , [ N g5 ]  Increasing pressure on [ e6 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ e4 ]  I could have just traded Queens I guess but I felt this gave my opponent more opportunity to make mistakes.
 [ g6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B g7 ]  [ c3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ h3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N b d2 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N c4 ] , [ b5 ]  Is this a gain of tempo for black forcing his knight back?
 [ K h5 ]  [ B f3 + ]  [ K h6 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ B x g4 ] , [ K x g4 ]  We exchange bishops leaving another pawn ending.
 [ e5 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ B c5 ] , [ Q h5 ]  Basicly a good move.
 [ N c6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ d3 ]  [ N g e7 ] , [ O-O ]  This move is certainly playable; but as I recall the text departs from the pawnstorming strategy of the Grand Prix which is to castle long and begin a direct often sacrificial attack against Black's castled King.
 [ N f3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ c4 ] , [ d4 ]  playing for pawn position instead of taking the pawn. if i take it it moves my pawn out of the central corridor and allows him the oppurtunity to move his e pawn forward and attack my pawn with his bishop.
 [ R h f1 ] , [ c5 ]  White pins the f2N and black cannot do anything about it and so black advances some of his pawns. Now you will see Black continue to advance his King into the attack gaining temp in the open file in the center along the way with threats and checks.
 [ N f3 ]  [ Q x f2 ] , [ Q e5 ]  White has ample compensation for the pawns.
 [ Q x d5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ b6 ]  [ O-O ] , [ B b7 ]  the possible mate on [ g2 ] creates some nice tactical possibilities for black.
 [ g3 ] , [ R d1 ]  A little pressure on the runaway pawn.
 [ c4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ c x d5 ] , [ e5 ]  What! Stupid computer. I wen exd5!
 [ O-O ]  [ N x e3 ]  [ f x e3 ] , [ Q b6 ]  there you go. Black has only one piece developed but it is just completely overwhelming white.
 [ c x d3 ]  [ B x g5 ]  [ N e x g5 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ O-O ]  With the queens out this castle is probably not timely any longer.
 [ Q g3 + ] , [ N f3 + ]  White relieves the check on his king while checking the enemy king. Black's king is in a precarious position smothered by it's own pieces.
 [ R b e1 ]  [ Q h7 ]  [ B f2 ]  [ B g6 ] , [ B x h4 ]  Wins another pawn!
 [ R g6 ] , [ d5 ]  36. [ d5 ] - I now take a look at the board and I notice that all the squares up to [ d7 ] are covered by pieces. I think I will exert a little pressure on Andy by moving my pawn up to d7.
 [ B x e4 ]  [ R x e4 ] , [ e5 ]  clever move. if [ d x e5 ] Rxd3! and if [ R x e5 ] Qxd3!
 [ N f3 ] , [ N c6 ]  Both sides develop their knights.
 [ Q x e5 ]  [ R x e5 ] , [ B c6 ]  Actually it is more important to protect the [ e6 ] pawn to play [ f6 ] so [ B d7 ] woulda have been better.
 [ O-O ]  [ Q e2 ] , [ a6 ]  I think [ a6 ] may also be unnecessary. Black is now lagging behind in development.
 [ B x f3 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ O-O ]  My only advantage is my bishop pair while Black has control of the centre which cramps my position and makes it hard to find a plan. It's still only the opening so I'll have to wait and see what Black does before I can find a plan.
 [ R x c2 + ]  [ K b1 ] , [ R x c3 ]  Threats are multiple and if White goes [ Q x e6 + ] after the exchanges black is clearly winning.
 [ R f d8 ] , [ Q g7 # ]  23. [ Q g7 ] MATE!! - He does deliver it now. This is a salutary lesson on how to exploit a weak castled position.
 [ d5 ] , [ R b4 + ]  Driving the king back and securing the [ e5 ] pawn.
 [ b5 ] , [ N x f4 ]  Recovering the pawn and coming again to the active post near the White Knight. But without the Queens it's far less troublesome. However the Knight is still the trickiest piece on the chessboard as my opponent was about to discover.
 [ K d4 ] , [ Q x e3 # ]  43. ......... Qxe3#. An ignominious and undignified end for me pore Ole 'Enry. But I will be back Freddy never fear! Joanne
 [ R h8 + ] , [ N h2 ]  If 35. [ N h3 ] then we have a nice checkmate 35... Qxh3+; 36.[ K g1 ] Qh1+; 36. [ B x h1 ] Rxh1#;
 [ O-O ]  [ N x c3 ]  [ Q f3 ] , [ Q h4 ]  I'm chancing it.
 [ B c3 ]  [ K f7 ] , [ B b7 ]  The Bishops swarm and the rook is caught like a deer in headlights
 [ B x d4 ]  [ N g4 ]  [ R f2 ] , [ N x f2 ]  24. ..... [ N x f2 ] - can't see anything much better but now Henry is doomed.
 [ Q x d4 ]  [ Q x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ] , [ B b4 ]  An interesting move which I probably don't respond to very accurately. In hindsight [ d x e6 ] is by fr and away the best move where it isn't too relevant that Black can give White an isolated pawn on [ c3 ] as he will have his own weakling on e6. Sadly the aesthetics of having a passed pawn on [ d5 ] and the c pawn potentially supporting this caused me to play the following.
 [ B h6 ]  [ R a e1 ]  [ R g4 ] , [ e6 ]  Now im ready to trade queens.
 [ R e b8 ]  [ Q x a7 ]  [ R x b2 ] , [ N e3 ]  Raz's knight blocks e-pawns advance but his king is now in a potentially dangerous position. If I can get my other rook to [ h1 ] mate!
 [ B x a6 ]  [ R b6 ] , [ B e2 ]  Caring for [ g4 ] in case of e5.
 [ c3 ] , [ O-O ]  I don't know why he castled king side (although I do sometimes)
 [ f6 ]  [ e x f6 ] , [ e x f6 ]  Now my Kingside has two gaping holes.
 [ O-O ]  [ O-O ] , [ f5 ]  White continuing with his plan of pushing pwans
 [ K b3 ] , [ K f3 ]  From this point on the notation is only approximate. I was running low on time.
 [ K g6 ] , [ K g4 ]  All roads lead to Rome. I probably would have played here 46.[ c4 ] [ K g7 ] 47.[ R f5 ] [ K g6 ] 48.[ K g4 ] [ h3 ] 49.Rxg5ch [ K f6 ] 50.[ R h5 ] etc.
 [ R e3 + ]  [ K f6 ]  [ R f3 + ]  [ K g6 ] , [ R f4 ]  blocking Rc4+: but this move will backfire...
 [ K f5 ]  [ K g8 ]  [ g7 ]  [ B f7 ]  [ K e5 ]  [ B g6 ]  [ K d6 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ K x c6 ]  [ K f7 ]  [ K d6 ] , [ B f5 ]  If the bishop stays on the a6-[ f1 ] diagonal to prevent White's next then after 79 ...[ B c4 ] White wins by 80. g8Q+! [ K x g8 ] 81. Ke7.
 [ K x g7 ]  [ g4 ]  [ R h h2 ]  [ R e1 ] , [ R h g2 + ]  A finesse to gain a tempo to attack and win the f-pawn. Much better than the immediate ...Rhf2.
 [ R d8 ] , [ g3 ]  Preparing my king to go into battle.
 [ Q d7 ] , [ N f4 ]  Controlling the blockade of the e-pawn and closing the f-file so I can castle.
 [ N f6 ] , [ N x f6 ]  Inaccuracy (Better is 24.[ B a4 ] and something along the lines of 24...[ K g8 ] 25.[ f5 ] [ N x g4 ] 26.[ N x g4 ] [ B f6 ] 27.[ B f4 ] [ Q d8 ] 28.[ B x c6 ] [ B x c6 ] 29.[ N x f6 + ] [ Q x f6 ] 30.[ B x c7 ] [ R b e8 ] 31.[ B e5 ] [ R x e5 ] 32.[ d x e5 ] [ Q x e5 ] 33.[ Q g4 ] [ Q x b2 ] 34.[ R a b1 ] [ Q f6 ] Black has a good compensation for the exchange)
 [ Q c7 ]  [ B d4 ] , [ O-O ]  all is well on the Western Frontier...
 [ K d8 ] , [ R x e6 ]  i could of checkmated him in one move but i guess i didn't see it but there's nothing he can really do to stop the checkmate
 [ R x b7 ]  [ R x c2 + ]  [ K b1 ]  [ R x e2 ] , [ R x b4 ]  White is now up the equivalent of a piece and has better play. Rook and knight don't work well together and the rooks have plenty of open files and ranks to play round with.
 [ R f e1 ]  [ N e3 ]  [ Q b3 ] , [ g4 ]  White now has to choose whether to give up a piece or completely cramp its pieces with [ d5 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ N x e5 ] , [ B x e5 ]  and here's why I like the earlier B move - white is in trouble with its bishops and Q now blocked by its own pawns
 [ h4 ]  [ Q f6 ]  [ K b3 ]  [ Q e7 ]  [ N g1 ]  [ Q f6 ]  [ N h3 ]  [ K g8 ]  [ N x f4 ] , [ e x f4 ]  31. ........ [ e x f4 ] - white now forces an exchange of knights opening up the position.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N g f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ c6 ]  [ d x c6 ] , [ b x c6 ]  Unusual line for white black is fully defended.
 [ N x c5 ]  [ N x c7 ] , [ R a7 ]  ? This is another mistake. My only goal is to attack his Knight because he took my Rook. The only thing is that I forgot that it was already with his LSB. Therefore we could have exchanged Knights and that would have benefited as he is ahead. However he is not going to do that. Instead he is going to retreat but I am going to do the same with my Knight. Afterall I am not giving him gifts. In other words that Knight is not free.
 [ B e2 ] , [ Q b6 ]  threatening [ N c2 + ] with the queen being lost
 [ c5 ]  [ N g6 ] , [ R c1 ]  Immediate attacking is not always the best answer. See how each side tries to improve their position before continuing their attacks. You want your pieces on their best squares. It makes the attack much stronger.
 [ R d1 ] , [ R d8 ]  Putting pressure on [ d5 ] but the pawn is still safe.
 [ b3 ]  [ R f7 ]  [ a4 ] , [ N a8 ]  There we go. Finally time for central action. White is playing with at least 2 extra Knights in the central push.
 [ B a3 ]  [ N x e3 ]  [ R f e1 ] , [ N d5 ]  Having won a Pawn the Knight returns to its post. However the gain comes at the cost of opening an avenue of attack against the weak backward KP.
 [ Q d4 + ]  [ K g3 ]  [ Q e3 + ]  [ K h4 ]  [ Q f2 + ] , [ g3 ]  first step
 [ N e2 ] , [ e5 ]  Opening [ e6 ] for his Bishop.
 [ N x d4 ] , [ d5 ]  After 4...[ [ e5 ] ] 5.[ N d b5 ] [ d5 ] White wins a pawn after 6.Nx[ d5 ] Nx[ d5 ] 7.Qx[ d5 ] Qx[ d5 ] 8.[ N c7 ] recovering the queen. So if I wanted to play [ [ e5 ] ] then I'd have to play [ d6 ] after [ N d b5 ] since White's threatening N[ d6 ] and then [ e4 ] would transpose into the Sveshnikov Variation of the Sicilian an opening I played for three years but now consider to be good for White.
 [ N f e5 ]  [ g x f4 ] , [ R x f4 ]  Taking with the pawn would be better for White with the aim of openning the central files for attack on my king.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ a6 ]  [ B a4 ]  [ N g e7 ]  [ O-O ]  [ g6 ]  [ c3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ d4 ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ c x d4 ] , [ O-O ]  Out of opening. Possible continuation would be 8...[ b5 ] 9.[ B b3 ] 0–0 10.[ N c3 ] [ d6 ] 11.[ h3 ] [ N a5 ] 12.[ B c2 ] [ b4 ]  [ d5 ] , [ N e5 ]  slightly better was 9...[ N a5 ] 10.[ N c3 ] [ [ d6 ] ] 11.[ B c2 ] (or 11.[ R b1 ] [ b5 ] Haba P-Varga Z/St Poelten 2002/CBM) 11...[ B g4 ] 12.[ h3 ] [ B x f3 ] 13.[ Q x f3 ] [ N c4 ] 14.[ Q e2 ] [ N e5 ] 15.[ B d2 ] [ f5 ] 16.[ f4 ] [ N d7 ] 17.[ R a e1 ] [ f x e4 ] 18.[ N x e4 ] [ R e8 ] 19.[ Q d3 ] N[ f5 ] 20.[ B c3 ] [ N c5 ] 21.[ N x c5 ] [ d x c5 ] 22.[ B x g7 ] [ N x g7 ] 23.[ R x e8 + ] [ Q x e8 ] 24.[ [ d6 ] ] Fogarasi T-Varga Z/Gyula 1998/CBM
 [ h x g4 ] , [ B x g4 + ]  the rook "sacrifice" is coming i didnt need my d file rook.
 [ R h2 + ]  [ N h3 ]  [ R x h3 + ]  [ K g5 ]  [ R x g3 + ]  [ K h5 ] , [ Q h3 # ]  A wild game. Thanks for the future comments!
 [ B c5 ] , [ N x c6 ]  I broke the rule here. I decided that crippling his queen side pawn structure was crucial to my game and position. This move pretty much forces [ b x c6 ] as my knight is sitting pretty if left unbounded.
 [ f6 ] , [ K f3 ]  and as he was winning the other game mrloca suggested we called a halt at this point and shared the points so I resigned the other game and he resigned this. I was quite glad as there was still some hard work to be done here.
 [ R x f6 ] , [ B g5 ]  Now the rook or the knight are doomed
 [ K h7 ] , [ Q x a4 ]  Now I have yet another passed Pawn.
 [ d x c3 ]  [ Q x c3 ] , [ f6 ]  Black had to cover the mate threat at [ g7 ] whereat White now picks up the c-pawn...
 [ B c5 ] , [ R x e4 ]  Glory be! White snags the "free" bishop. Black rejoices white overlooked [ N c6 + ] (and a cheap rook--white's choice of [ h8 ] or d8) and removes the knight fork threat with NxN.
 [ N c d2 ]  [ O-O ] , [ b3 ]  now [ c3 ] is a great hole.
 [ h5 ]  [ K d2 ] , [ a5 ]  Yeah! Free pawn!
 [ N x e5 ] , [ Q f6 ]  White's [ f3 ] knight takes pawn at e5. Black queen comes out to defend at f6.
 [ B d6 ]  [ f4 ] , [ h5 ]  A cramping move to limit white's options.
 [ N b4 ] , [ B c4 ]  14. [ B c4 ] - pin and another piece attacks f7.
 [ R e1 ] , [ B c4 ]  Another wasted move
 [ Q c7 + ] , [ N d7 ]  ? Queen trade would probably giving black better survival chances.
 [ B e3 ] , [ Q c6 ]  The queen runs back to a safe spot.
 [ g x h5 ]  [ B f6 ] , [ c3 ]  I thought this was best because I feared [ Q x f4 ] [ Q x f4 ] [ B x f4 ] Nxd5. The GK computer prefers that line but seems to overlook that the Q exchange is good for Black.
 [ R a d1 ] , [ Q f6 ]  I was worried about a discovered attack on my queen and made my first major mistake in the game. I also thought that my bishop on [ b7 ] gave me some attacking chances so moving the queen to the kingside seemed logical. White's best move is [ N e4 ] giving me several problems.
 [ b6 ]  [ R a1 + ]  [ K g2 ]  [ R a2 + ]  [ K h3 ] , [ g4 + ]  41....[ B g1 ] is mate in a few moves.
 [ B x d1 ]  [ R e1 + ]  [ K h2 ] , [ R d x d1 ]  The attack is brilliantly conducted.
 [ B e7 ]  [ h4 ]  [ N d f6 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ O-O ] , [ N d f3 ]  I just don't want to castle kinside. That will kill the game.
 [ N e7 ] , [ Q b3 ]  Post game analysis again tells me that I should have castled. But then his position is already cramped and this was the perfect time for me to launch an attack
 [ c3 ]  [ b7 ]  [ c2 + ]  [ K a2 ]  [ c1 = Q ]  [ b8 = Q ]  [ N c3 + ]  [ K b3 ]  [ Q b1 + ]  [ K a3 ] , [ Q x b8 ]  White resigned. His king will be mated in a few moves. He should've placed his pieces more actively in the endgame. My king and knight were more active than his so I could promote my pawn faster.
 [ B x d5 ]  [ a4 ] , [ B x f3 ]  Black breaks white's castle doubling pawns.
 [ R d3 ]  [ d7 ]  [ K e7 ] , [ N b6 ]  44. [ N b6 ] - to give added protection to the [ d7 ] pawn.
 [ K x f3 ] , [ Q d7 ]  also here [ B x e5 ] can wait: White has work to do on defending; Black is threatening Qc6+: best for now is [ K g2 ] [ Q c6 + ] [ K g1 ] [ B x e5 ] [ Q g2 ] [ Q x g2 + ] [ K x g2 ] [ N x b2 ] [ R c1 ] [ N d3 ] Rc2...
 [ B h8 ]  [ Q h4 ]  [ R b8 ]  [ K h2 ]  [ b3 ] , [ a3 ]  Far better than inviting pressure against my centre and queenside with the capture.
 [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ a3 ]  White does not fall for [ N x e4 ] [ N x e4 ] [ d4 ] Bb5+; instead setting to trap the B via [ b4 ] & c5.
 [ N f3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ a3 ] , [ d6 ]  Black has pretty much played five the first six moves of the Dragon Variation of the Sicilian Defense (except [ c x d4 ] which never materialized as an option). White however has wandered far afield of any opening reference I have to work with. He seems to have lost a little tempo but he does have an imposing center.
 [ c3 ]  [ g4 ]  [ N d4 ] , [ Q h4 + ]  6. ....... [ Q [ h4 ] + ] - and Glenda is at it again well she came out to [ h4 ] in my previous annotated game and wreaked havoc can that gal do it again? Read on.
 [ K b4 ] , [ R b8 + ]  This is a little easier than 36... [ a5 + ] 37. [ K x c4 ] Rb8. Now if 37. [ K x c4 ] Qd4#.
 [ b8 = Q ]  [ K g7 ]  [ Q h2 ]  [ R d7 ]  [ Q h5 ]  [ R d6 ]  [ Q g6 + ]  [ K f8 ]  [ Q h7 ]  [ K e8 ]  [ Q g8 + ]  [ K e7 ]  [ Q c8 ]  [ R d3 + ]  [ K f2 ]  [ R d2 + ]  [ K e3 ]  [ R d6 ]  [ Q b7 + ]  [ K e8 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ R d7 ]  [ Q c8 + ]  [ K e7 ]  [ Q g8 ]  [ R d6 ]  [ Q g7 + ]  [ K e8 ]  [ K e4 ]  [ K d8 ]  [ Q f8 + ]  [ K d7 ]  [ Q f7 + ]  [ K d8 ]  [ Q a7 ]  [ K e8 ]  [ Q c7 ] , [ R d7 ]  That was one mistake too many.
 [ B g2 ] , [ O-O ]  Natural and so is his reply
 [ N c3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d5 ] , [ h3 ]  The last few moves were main line. However [ c x d5 ] [ N x d5 ] [ [ g3 ] ] is more common than h3. Play would continue: 4:[ c x d5 ] [ N x d5 ] 5:[ [ g3 ] ] [ N c7 ] with black building up a big centre with [ f6 ] and [ e5 ] and white trying to exert pressure with his bishop on [ g2 ] and knights.
 [ N e8 + ] , [ K e7 ]  Here on [ N c7 ] I would have answered with [ N f6 ] and I can progres further... There is nothing more White can do to impeach my further advance: King will be confined to protect [ g4 ] -or lose it- and knight will be pursued by my king until this arrives to [ c4 ] or d4. white resigns
 [ K f5 ]  [ a4 ] , [ B c4 ]  Making my bishop a bit more active.
 [ N e5 ]  [ Q d5 ]  [ Q f6 ] , [ B e2 ]  I play [ B e2 ] hoping to castle on my next turn to avoid any [ f2 ] attacks. I also want to play [ B b5 ] to pin the pawn and trap the black bishop and thus also trap the queenside rook.
 [ N x e5 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ B x e5 ] , [ Q b6 ]  The pawn has been regained. And now my slight lead in development is making his King uncomfortable.
 [ R e8 ]  [ Q d2 ] , [ R b8 ]  Black wants to unpin the pawn
 [ O-O ]  [ B g2 ] , [ c5 ]  Black claims more space in the center and advances the c-pawn before developing the knight to c6.
 [ K f7 ]  [ R x e4 ]  [ N f5 ]  [ K g2 ]  [ N d6 ]  [ K f3 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ K x e4 ]  [ K e6 ]  [ B e5 ]  [ h5 ]  [ h4 ]  [ K e7 ]  [ K d5 ]  [ K d7 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ a5 ]  [ B e5 ]  [ K e7 ]  [ B c7 ]  [ K d7 ]  [ B x b6 ]  [ K c8 ]  [ K x c5 ]  [ K b8 ]  [ K d6 ]  [ K a8 ]  [ c5 ]  [ K b7 ]  [ c6 + ]  [ K x b6 ]  [ c7 ]  [ K b7 ]  [ K d7 ]  [ K a7 ] , [ c8 = Q ]  
 [ b5 ]  [ K e2 ] , [ c4 ]  only helping White...
 [ K g7 ]  [ N a3 ] , [ R x f7 ]  My bishop is pinned
 [ e3 ] , [ b5 ]  The black sealed it's destination in trying to keep the pawn obtained
 [ f x g6 ]  [ e ] , [ p ]  Luckily for me I can take the pawn en passant. It is now my turn to have a dangerous pawn on the kingside!
 [ B x h5 ]  [ g x h4 ] , [ B g4 ]  ?! I think a better try for white is to open the g-file with 28.[ g x h4 ] [ B x h4 ] and now 29.[ B g4 ] intending [ R g1 ] and [ B f5 ] before black can untangle his pieces.
 [ N d5 + ] , [ K d7 ]  [ Q f5 ] wouldn't hurt me hopoefully.
 [ O-O ] , [ d4 ]  ???
 [ N b3 ] , [ d3 ]  When 29. [ N x c5 ] Nxc5. 30. [ R x c5 ] [ R d8 ] Black will win.
 [ B e3 ] , [ e6 ]  Now I'm trying to get my pieces out and make an active game for myself
 [ f4 ] , [ N f6 ]  Team Match I'm playing black and my oponent gives me the Bird. Bird's Opening that is. Black reponds with 1. ... [ N f6 ] the Positional Variation.
 [ N x d1 ]  [ R x d1 ]  [ b3 ]  [ c x b3 ]  [ N x b3 ]  [ Q c4 ]  [ Q x c4 ] , [ B x c4 ]  40. [ Q x c4 ] - after the queen trade white is the exchange for a pawn down. This could prove decisive in black's favour but white fights on.
 [ Q x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ] , [ b5 ]  My bishop should be strong on the long diagonal since White can no longer block it with f3.
 [ b5 ] , [ R f1 + ]  forcing the exchange of rooks.
 [ N d1 ]  [ N x d1 ]  [ R x d1 + ]  [ K e7 ] , [ K f2 ]  I decide to chase away his rook
 [ B g7 ] , [ d4 ]  Switching back to the main line. The most aggressive 4th move here for White is [ f4 ] which leads to double-edged play.
 [ K g4 ]  [ K g2 ]  [ R d2 + ]  [ K f1 ] , [ R e8 ]  His pieces swarm for a mating attack.
 [ R a d8 ] , [ N e2 ]  ?? Which is this move. But it's the decisive blunder which I overlook. I felt that this was the only mistake in the whole game but against an opponent especially a runner one mistake is all that it takes. As now he is going to get my Queen one way or another without compensation. Just about anything was better then this as the N prevented his next move from coming.
 [ e6 ] , [ c4 ]  protecting my advanced pawn
 [ B h1 ]  [ Q x h3 + ]  [ K g1 ] , [ R f6 ]  I think [ B f5 ] would have been a better choice. White would be scrambling to defend against checkmate had black not offered this rook trade. 35. [ R g6 ] [ B d6 ]  [ R x f6 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ Q f4 ]  [ d3 ] , [ R d1 ]  White moves the rook out of harm's way.
 [ B x c6 + ] , [ b x c6 ]  As predicted she couldn't resist taking. Black has a frightening center now and ideas arise along the lines of [ R b1 ] -> [ R b4 ] and then bringing it over to the king side. That idea of course isn't useful just yet but it's definitely there. I think black is better here and if black develops normally from this point onwards he'll have a very good game.
 [ B c4 ] , [ R x c4 + ]  Obviously not 34. [ Q c4 ] giving White the chance to continue limping through the endgame. So White resigns.
 [ Q c6 ] , [ d x c5 ]  As this was one of the plans behind attacking the Q. The immediate effect of course is that Dan recaptures to avoid giving away a pawn after having had handed back a minor piece. However...
 [ e x f6 ]  [ R x f6 ]  [ Q d8 + ]  [ R f8 ] , [ Q d3 ]  Moved queen back into line with bishop.
 [ Q x b8 ] , [ R x c4 ]  black got a free paw on the C file. it should be enough for a victory...
 [ c x b7 ]  [ R x c1 + ]  [ R x c1 ] , [ Q x b7 ]  I believed my postion to be okay as I had the Bishop pair. According to Fritz 9 my postion was losing.
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ c3 ]  [ a6 ]  [ a3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ d5 ]  Swithcing pawns is good choise
 [ g x f6 ]  [ R x f6 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ e7 + ]  [ R x e7 ]  [ R x c6 ]  [ R x e4 ]  [ R x a6 ]  [ R e2 ]  [ R h6 ]  [ N x g2 ]  [ R x h7 ] , [ R x c2 ]  noway for White 27.[ h4 ] [ R x a2 ] 28.[ h5 ] [ b4 ] 29.[ h6 ] [ b3 ] 30.[ R f7 ] [ b2 ] 31.[ h7 ] [ b1 = Q + ]  [ e4 ] , [ e6 ]  Ah the French Defence! That most reprehensible of opening systems. If Wilhelm Steinitz one of the most solid world champions ever was moved to say "I have never in my life played the French Defence which is he dullest of openings" then it must indeed be tedious!
 [ h x g6 ] , [ Q g4 ]  Yeah I knew he saw this before he played Ng6+. Time to move on to the next game.
 [ N e2 + ]  [ K h1 ]  [ Q d6 ] , [ Q x a7 ]  26. [ Q x a7 ] - another pawn falls.
 [ O-O ]  [ Q d3 ]  [ N e7 ] , [ R a e1 ]  I now have managed to gain the upper hand in the fight for e4.
 [ B x e6 ]  [ Q a5 + ]  [ K c6 ]  [ Q c7 + ]  [ K d5 ] , [ Q b7 # ]  
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ B b5 ]  3. [ B b5 ] - as with Coach Ion and Brigadecommander (Janet) I decided to test Dave with the Ruy Lopez. Both Ion and Janet got the better of me so I was even more chuffed with that 14th Expert Draw! Dave responds with a lesser known defense called The Cordel Defense.
 [ N c4 ]  [ R e2 ]  [ N e5 + ]  [ K g2 ]  [ R x g3 + ] , [ K f1 ]  [ R f3 + ] trades rooks. Fair trades now favor black up six points.
 [ Q x g7 + ]  [ Q e7 ]  [ Q x e7 + ] , [ N x e7 ]  Black is now down three pawns without any compensation.
 [ R b6 + ] , [ K a2 ]  Black resigned. After 55...[ Q x f5 ] 56. [ N d7 + ] wins a full Rook. A remarkable game by Petrosian.
 [ K e1 ]  [ N e6 ]  [ N e2 c3 ]  [ N d4 ] , [ K d2 ]  The black c pawn is ready to drop.
 [ e x d6 ] , [ e x d6 ]  Right now [ c6 ] and [ d6 ] and [ f6 ] are relatively weak while Whites [ b2 ] [ f2 ] and [ g2 ] are weak. But White has a devastating advantage in development.
 [ K g7 ] , [ h4 ]  I am trying desperately for a swindling attempt.
 [ R c7 ]  [ Q e6 + ]  [ K h7 ] , [ h5 ]  I see why you chose [ h5 ] but [ R d1 ] is SO much better. Again you would have had a won position. Remember when attacking try and get all of your pieces involved. Your rook is doing nothing on f1.
 [ K g2 ] , [ N x d4 + ]  Success. White resigns.
 [ N x f7 + ] , [ K g8 ]  [ R x f7 ] wont help because after r[ x f7 ] its a mate in two
 [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ a6 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ e6 ]  [ f4 ]  [ h6 ]  [ B h4 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ f5 ]  [ e x f5 ] , [ e x f5 ]  Although I have an isolated pawn I still liked this position. (We were here many times.)
 [ Q c5 ] , [ N f d4 ]  The knights defend each other.
 [ h4 ] , [ B e6 ]  Computer agrees with both these moves and Black only slightly better.
 [ f x e3 ]  [ Q x e3 + ] , [ K h1 ]  White has much advantage due to material gain and positional aspects active pieces and is almost completely winning.
 [ B e2 ]  [ c6 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ B x f3 ]  [ B x f3 ] , [ d x e5 ]  I open the Queen file allowing the exchange of Queens and preventing myself from castling. But the game doesn't get any simpler.
 [ c4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ d4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ e4 ] , [ d6 ]  my favorite opening i think
 [ g4 ] , [ K e7 ]  ?
 [ Q d8 ]  [ N x h4 ]  [ Q x h4 ]  [ c3 ]  [ Q d8 ]  [ Q f3 ]  [ N g e7 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ f6 ]  [ e x f6 ]  [ R f8 ]  [ f7 + ] , [ R x f7 ]  My opponent looked so happy when he made this move. Mate in three though
 [ N e7 + ]  [ R x e7 ]  [ B x e7 ] , [ N x b5 ]  This is what Black wanted and now material is even. I shouldn't have been too confident and thinking that any move I made was winning. I made about six or seven moves in less than ten seconds and now I'm not winning anymore. Black is also threatening [ N d4 ] getting my pinned bishop
 [ R x h1 ] , [ g x h1 = Q + ]  The mating combo would be
 [ R g1 ] , [ N c e7 ]  Maybe getting ready to defend?
 [ N b d2 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ h3 ]  A loss of time but I want to provide a square for my bishop on h2.
 [ K c2 ]  [ c4 ]  [ K c3 ]  [ b4 + ]  [ K b2 ]  [ c3 + ] , [ K b3 ]  Ok and we are at another standpoint. How can I make some progress?
 [ B d2 ]  [ B x d2 + ] , [ Q x d2 ]  5. [ Q x d2 ] - bishop trade.
 [ B x e4 ] , [ N f6 ]  Still no double pawn.
 [ K c1 ] , [ R x d6 ]  White abandoned the bishop to its fate so I took it.
 [ B e3 ] , [ N g4 ]  6. [ N g4 ] - this unusual move leads to an undevelopment of the white dsb.
 [ B c4 ] , [ R b6 ]  My opponent rook must stay and protect the pawn
 [ N x d3 ]  [ N x d3 ] , [ R a d1 ]  The knight is trapped.
 [ Q x g6 ]  [ R h e1 ] , [ e6 ]  Open a route for my bishop
 [ R a d1 ]  [ Q e7 ]  [ R x d8 + ]  [ Q x d8 ] , [ R d1 ]  This is a massive blunder that costs white the game. White overlooked the fact that [ Q x d1 ] results in a check for the mateing opportunity never arrises. White would have been better served by [ Q a8 ] forcing the queen trade and then working his piece advantage to finish the game. After: 30. [ Q a8 ] [ Q x a8 ] 31. [ B x a8 ] [ R x a2 ] 32. [ B d5 ] With the bishop move there isn't much left that black.
 [ f4 ] , [ N d2 ]  Threatening [ N f3 ] forking king and queen...
 [ g5 ]  [ B x a6 ]  [ g x f4 ]  [ g x f4 ]  [ R h6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ R g6 + ]  [ K f2 ]  [ h5 ] , [ a6 ]  
 [ O-O ] , [ B e7 ]  I wanna castle now.
 [ a x b6 ]  [ a5 ]  [ b5 ]  [ c x b5 ]  [ c x b5 ] , [ b4 ]  Not so great. Now this pawn is in the way. P[ d4 ] releases the fury of [ B e2 ] upon Pb5. Plus what prevents NxPb4? It's like throwing the pawn's life away for naught.
 [ f7 ]  [ R f8 ]  [ e6 ]  [ R b7 ] , [ Q x a3 ]  I had looked at 53. [ Q f6 ] [ Q g7 ] 54. [ e7 ] Rx[ e7 ] 55. Qx[ e7 ] [ Q x f7 ] as the best white can do but still black wins there.
 [ K c4 ] , [ K c2 ]  Once again Black must retreat or advance the pawn.
 [ d6 ]  [ h3 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ e3 ]  [ N b d7 ]  [ Q c2 ] , [ O-O ]  Anyway due to the passive play from black the position have been reached. Now more aggressive for white is [ g4 ] but sooner or later [ Q c2 ] must be played in order to give some threat to the kingside so it's ok.
 [ N e5 ] , [ R x f6 ]  The Rook is taboo [14...PxR? 15 BxB!]
 [ K c3 ]  [ a5 ] , [ N e2 ]  42. [ N e2 ] - momentarily taking pressure off the [ h5 ] pawn but it will be back on next turn.
 [ R a d1 ] , [ f6 ]  It says I'm up by two pawns but it's hard to see it. My bishop on [ d2 ] can't go anywhere and he has all of the threats along the b7-[ h1 ] diagonal. He's got the most credible threat which is [ Q d5 ] threatening [ Q g2 # ] and Qh1#. About all I see for now is f3. I think I'd like to get my knight over to [ e4 ] to block that bishop.
 [ N e g5 ] , [ g6 ]  Preventing checkmate of course.
 [ K e3 ]  [ R d1 ]  [ b4 ] , [ K x h4 ]  I gain one Pawn back.
 [ B c4 ] , [ B f8 ]  16. .... [ B f8 ] - sneaky retreat by Fou Lenoir attacks [ b5 ] pawn.
 [ R f6 ]  [ N g5 ]  [ N f8 ] , [ Q g3 ]  19. Qg3? - and according to GA this is where I over-reach myself it looks as though I have a nasty double check planned but Mike foils this with …...
 [ Q x d4 ] , [ N e2 ]  Forgetting of course that sometimes my opponent is giving me the pawn for a reason.
 [ c3 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ N b d2 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ e4 ]  [ Q e7 ]  [ h3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N h5 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ f6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ f x e5 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ N f4 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N x e2 + ]  [ Q x e2 ]  [ B a4 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ Q d7 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ Q h5 + ]  [ Q f7 ] , [ N x e6 ]  he caught me by surprise here anticipating he could regain the queen with a knight fork
 [ K f1 ]  [ N x c1 ]  [ R x c1 ]  [ B x e3 ]  [ R c2 ]  [ K e6 ]  [ K g1 ]  [ R x f2 ]  [ R x f2 ]  [ K d5 ]  [ K f1 ] , [ B x f2 ]  The king comes to [ c4 ] and it's all over. White had enough and resigned.
 [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ d4 ]  !? I personally wouldn't play this move I would play Bg5. But since black has just covered the [ e5 ] square [ d4 ] stops Nx[ e5 ] after e5. So I agree with both sides and think this is just a normal move.
 [ Q e5 ] , [ R g6 ]  still down 2 pawns but i attack 1
 [ N g f3 ] , [ c4 ]  I decide to push white's bishop back.
 [ c3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ d3 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ h3 ]  [ B x f3 ]  [ Q x f3 ]  [ b4 ]  [ B d2 ]  [ a5 ]  [ R d1 ]  [ h6 ]  [ a3 ]  [ b x c3 ]  [ B x c3 ]  [ Q c8 ] , [ N d2 ]  It took a while but development is finally complete and the game starts taking shape.
 [ Q b4 + ]  [ Q d6 ]  [ R x g8 ]  [ R x g8 ] , [ Q x c3 ]  29. Qxc3?? - this allows a combo that drops the white queen wait for it ............
 [ d4 ] , [ B g4 ]  defending the [ e5 ] pawn by pinning the knight
 [ e x f6 ]  [ Q x f6 ] , [ N e4 ]  ?? Now this is where I really start to go wrong. I decide to kick her Queen but I overlooked an important detail. What was it? In this position I left my DSB hanging and she is now going to win it with the same piece that is attacked (her Queen). Why did I miss so much? At this point Hurricane Sandy has devastated the Carribean Island and is now working on the Bahaman Islands. There have already been fatalities in Haiti as well as other areas. If you think this is bad it's not the other half. After the Bahama's the Hurricane is directly going to the Northeast and this storm is already several hundred miles wide.
 [ b6 ] , [ d4 ]  The Queen's Fianchetto Defense. I haven't seen this one before.
 [ K e7 ] , [ N x f7 ]  Moving the rook would have been dangerous. [ R f8 ] [ R e1 + ] then he has to block and loses a bishop.
 [ N e7 ]  [ g3 ]  [ N f5 ]  [ B g2 ] , [ g6 ]  Both black towers are thretned
 [ B x e5 ] , [ d x e5 ]  Again he wasn't sure what to do so he instinctively took my knight so I took his bishop with my pawn.
 [ g x h6 ] , [ Q x h6 ]  White doesn't have the material to successfully checkmate me. It gets really crazy from here
 [ K g2 ]  [ R b1 ]  [ g4 ]  [ R x b3 ]  [ R x b3 ] , [ N x b3 ]  Two pawns ahead. I need to get N to [ c3 ] and keep him from putting B on c4.
 [ B f7 ] , [ Q e2 ]  25. [ Q e2 ] - now Glenda defends (not a pawn this time surprise surprise!) the rook on g2. Actually better take that back. She is defending several pawns the d e f and g pawns as well. Still you never know she may end up on that g or h file one day doing something other than defending.
 [ N c3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ] , [ e4 ]  Here Rubinstein should play 5... NxN 6 NPxN P-KN3! transposing into a very solid variation of the Gruenfeld Defense.
 [ O-O ] , [ R d1 ]  Centralizing his Rook behind the Queen.
 [ R x a4 ]  [ K b1 ] , [ R a c4 ]  Now Black has 4 pieces attacking the pawn on [ c3 ] which is only defended by 2 and the path is clear for the a-pawn to advance as well. I could see that it was only a matter of time now.
 [ f3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ b4 ]  [ c x b4 ]  [ c x b4 ]  [ Q x c2 ]  [ N x c2 ] , [ R a c8 ]  17. ....... [ R a c8 ] - after another plethora of exchanges I decide to stick a rook on c8. Rooks just lurve those open files!
 [ K f2 ]  [ R f3 + ]  [ K e1 ] , [ R e3 + ]  Here he timed out. Who do you think would have won?
 [ O-O ]  [ B d3 ] , [ f5 ]  Still a common position. White rather takes en passant giving black a half-open file while trying to expose the black king.
 [ B e3 ]  [ N b6 ] , [ B f2 ]  Obviously White favored [ B f2 ] over [ [ b3 ] ] after the expected Nc4. Pushing [ [ b3 ] ] increases Black's queen side play (Be7=>[ b4 ] attacks Nc3) : it could be forced by Blacks if [ N c4 ] was chosen but instead of that I chose to develop pieces.
 [ c x b4 ] , [ Q a4 ]  ...now i can give my Bishop a bit of space......with
 [ N d5 ] , [ R g8 ]  I had to claim the g file or else I was really stuffed by allowing white to claim it.
 [ O-O-O ] , [ B g5 ]  Bg5! And now Black is in serious difficulty. F7 must remain protected but there is only one place the black queen can go to do that and it still results in a losing position.
 [ K f2 ] , [ a5 ]  Black position is collapsing now attempting for a counter attack on the other side. Posisi Hitam sekarang udah jatuh serangan balasan di sayap lain mulai di coba.
 [ K b6 ]  [ R b3 + ] , [ K c7 ]  with tempo
 [ R c c2 ] , [ a6 ]  (!) Onward ! There's nothing to stop the pawn reaching a7. Can Black withstand the pressure? In fact Black seemed to me so close to pulling off a miracle save but was deterred from trebling the major pieces on the 7th rank by 43...[ Q b2 ] 44.e4! White's bishops sure believe in good works!
 [ B x b2 ] , [ Q e3 ]  !?! Wow... let's see how white intends to attack. 16...[ B x a1 ] and then A) 17.[ [ h5 ] ] [ [ [ [ d6 ] ] ] ] 18.[ h x g6 ] [ h x g6 ] 19.[ Q g5 ] [ B f6 ] - B) 17.[ R x a1 ] [ [ [ e5 ] ] ] 18.[ N x c5 ] [ [ [ [ d6 ] ] ] ] 19.[ N [ e4 ] ] [ Q e7 ] 20.[ B g5 ] [ Q f8 ] 21.[ N f6 ] no very bad - B1) 17...[ [ [ [ d6 ] ] ] ] 18.[ [ h5 ] ] [ [ [ e5 ] ] ] 19. [ Q g5 ] (19.[ d x e6 ] e.p. [ R x e6 ] 20.[ Q g5 ] [ Q e7 ] and most of black's problems are solved; 19.[ B g5 ] [ N d7 ] 20.[ h6 ] [ [ [ f5 ] ] ] and then?) [ Q e7 ] 20.[ Q g3 ] [ e4 ] 21.[ B e2 ] B[ [ [ f5 ] ] ] and slowly black develoops his pieces building a fortress around his king. C) 17.[ N x a1 ] [ [ [ [ d6 ] ] ] ] 18.[ [ f4 ] ] [ B [ g4 ] ] (18...[ [ [ f5 ] ] ] 19.[ g4 ] not so good) 19.[ [ [ f5 ] ] ] [ Q d7 ] 20.[ f x g6 ] [ f x g6 ] 21.[ B x g6 ] [ h x g6 ] 22.[ Q c3 ] [ [ [ e5 ] ] ] 23.[ d x e6 ] e.p.

[ Q g5 ] (19.[ d x e6 ] e.p. [ R x e6 ] 20.[ Q g5 ] [ Q e7 ] and most of black's problems are solved; 19.[ B g5 ] [ N d7 ] 20.[ h6 ] [ f5 ] and?) [ Q e7 ] 20.[ Q g3 ] [ e4 ] 21.[ B e2 ] B[ f5 ] and slowly black develoops his pieces building a fortress around his king.
 [ N b d2 ] , [ c6 ]  going in to some kind of a semi-slav. I dunno maybe this is one of the main lines i don't have any clue how Bogo-indian goes.
 [ O-O-O ] , [ b5 ]  Black's position is already pretty desperate so wanting to launch a quick attack on White is understandable but the problem is White's own threats are more immediate! Instead 11...[ h6 ] 12.[ B x f6 + ] [ K x f6 ] prevents the following assault from White though he still gets to claim [ b6 ] with his knight after [ N d5 + ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N d5 + ] , [ K f8 ]  Forced; [ K e6 ] or [ K e8 ] loses out to [ N c7 + ] winning the [ a8 ] rook whilst material is also lost with 13...[ K d8 ] 14.[ N x f6 ] [ g x f6 ] 15.[ B x f6 + ] [ K c6 ] loses a piece thanks to the discovered attack from the rook (Nxf6+)
 [ K d2 ]  [ d4 ] , [ N e4 ]  22. [ N e4 ] (my knight was en prise last move I move it towards the kingside)
 [ g x h4 ] , [ Q h6 ]  Black responded correctly to white's mistake but white makes another one. (here black could pick up a pawn putting him at +3.27 through Bg5)
 [ f3 ]  [ O-O ] , [ g4 ]  White begins the flank pawn storm - the best counter is most often to fight back through a strong center which is supported by superior development.
 [ B h2 ] , [ N e7 ]  Accomplishes a couple things for Black. It supports the pivotal d pawn. Creates potential for Nf5. And unblocks my c pawn. I'd like to clean that up so as to free my queen.
 [ c4 ]  [ b4 ]  [ c x b3 ]  [ e ]  [ p ]  [ c x b3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ d4 ]  [ b5 ]  [ b4 ]  [ Q c7 ] , [ R e1 ]  I almost didn't make this final preparatory move to support squares [ e4 ] and e5. Ultimately all encounters that I could think of needed one more attacker on those squares so I spent the time to do this. I'm glad I did. White has points for the advanced phalanx superior development and the bishop pair (since black has a bad LSB). Black has an outpost at [ c4 ] and that's about it putting White ahead by 2 (Point Count).
 [ B g5 ]  [ Q f3 ] , [ f6 ]  Black has a way of trapping his bishops. He no doubt hopes for 13. [ e x f6 ] [ Q x f6 ] protecting the f-pawn.
 [ B b2 ] , [ N c6 ]  I think 2...[ N f6 ] is probably better but this is fine. I just prefer to maintain the option of playing ...[ c5 ] at some point in the near future.
 [ N f3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ c5 ]  The semi-tarrasch isn't an opening that I am particularly booked up on. I very rarely get it due to the [ N f3 ] move order and as a general rule active play is normally enough to at least maintain the balance (apologies to any semi-tarrasch players)
 [ N c3 ]  [ B f5 ] , [ Q e5 ]  Gross loss of tempo for black but probably forced... After 12. ... [ B g6 ] 13. N[ g x e4 ] 0-0 14. [ d3 ] [ R e8 ] 15. [ Q g3 ] matters are bad enough as it is... After 15. ... [ N x e4 ] 16. [ N x e4 ] [ N c4 ] 17. 0-0 [ N d6 ] 18. [ B f3 ] white wins the opening...
 [ B e2 ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ N f8 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N e4 ] , [ B g3 ]  This felt pretty much forced. If 15.[ B x e7 ] [ Q x e7 ] Black has the immediate threat of 16...[ N x c3 ] winning a piece.
 [ N b d2 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ h3 ]  [ B d6 ] , [ N e5 ]  Black of course can still play successfully against this but he has to be careful.
 [ e3 ] , [ B e6 ]  Putting an attacker of [ c4 ] onto the field
 [ e4 ] , [ g6 ]  He played this opening both times. The first time I did some sort of classical response with pawns on [ d4 ] and e4. This time I decided to try something a little more hypermodern.
 [ B g7 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ] , [ Q e2 ]  Look I'm just saying I think this wastes the move. The alternative 8. [ d4 ] attack opens up the middle nicely for White who has movement with his rooks.
 [ N x d4 ] , [ B b4 + ]  Developing with a little tempo seems like a good idea.
 [ Q c1 ] , [ Q c7 ]  Preparing a little trap that White went for.
 [ R x f3 ]  [ N x f3 ] , [ K e7 ]  Now that we're in an endgame it makes sense for black to bring his K out. However I'm not ready to do that quite yet.
 [ g x h3 ] , [ K d3 ]  ?? White should have immediately moved his rook to [ h4 ] and taken control over the file so the pawn can be captured. He is instead concerned about protecting his own passed pawn from black's rook.
 [ R a d8 ]  [ N f1 ]  [ e4 ]  [ R x d8 ]  [ R x d8 ] , [ N e1 ]  19. [ N e1 ] - more evasive action. Jim now starts a kingside pawn roll with f5.
 [ R e7 ]  [ B x b2 ] , [ B e4 ]  ? A bad move. I wanted to play [ d6 ] with tempo at some point but now Black has a good move to get back into the game. I should have played 24.c4. Black can't allow [ c5 ] because that would give me two connected passed pawns and I'm also threatening to win the b-pawn (the bishop is still on d3). So probably exchanging is the best option for Black. Now the c-pawn remains rather weak.
 [ b x c3 ] , [ B x e4 ]  Black wins a pawn. I start to get nervous about the exposure of my king!
 [ B d6 ]  [ d3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ h3 ]  [ b5 ]  [ R c1 ] , [ N e7 ]  Repositioning the knight for kingside defense and to start a queen-side pawn storm.
 [ B e7 ] , [ B e5 ]  ... [ N x d5 ] loses to [ Q f7 + ] followed by [ Q x e8 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ R x f6 ] , [ Q h5 ]  Threatening [ Q e8 + ] followed by [ e7 ]  [ R h6 ]  [ Q f7 + ]  [ K h8 ] , [ R f1 ]  Removing the sting from ... [ R f6 ]  [ R h5 ]  [ Q x f7 ]  [ R x h6 + ]  [ g x h6 ]  [ e x f7 ]  [ K g7 ]  [ B d5 ] , [ K f6 ]  Black offered a draw but White declined of course.
 [ g x h4 ] , [ g5 ]  This I'm not as confident about. White's [ [ h4 ] ] pawn is pretty easy pickings. No need to break up your own pawns doing something [ K f5 ] [ K g4 ] KxP[ [ h4 ] ] could eventually accomplish.
 [ K e5 ]  [ g5 ]  [ K f5 ]  [ g6 ]  [ K g5 ] , [ g7 ]  ...so I push it all the way.
 [ B e7 ] , [ N x g7 ]  White wins another pawn .
 [ N a5 ] , [ R c7 ]  When in doubt grab material. Taking the rook away from the action is risky but it does put a psychological burden on Black in that he now has to prove himself otherwise he is simply down a pawn.
 [ R x e8 + ] , [ Q x e8 ]  That was part of white's idea but after 13. [ a3 ] white cannot take the d pawn. Black is doing well and plays solidly.
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ d4 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ c3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ] , [ Q e2 + ]  [ B b5 ] or [ B b3 ] is better for white.
 [ d5 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c6 ]  [ c4 ] , [ d x c4 ]  3. ...... [ d x c4 ] - this is transposing into a QGA - Queen's Gambit Accepted.
 [ a3 ] , [ N d5 ]  23...... Nd5? - this move is a mistake - please see Gameknot Analysis in my intro note. I can see even before glancing at Gameknot Analysis that this move is a massive blunder because black is gonna drop his queen to a pawn fork ouch and double ouch!
 [ f4 ] , [ B c1 ]  [ B d2 ] was playable as well but the bishop will anyway end on the a1-[ h8 ] diagonal and it would prevent the rook to control the open c file (which is white's next intention).
 [ h3 ]  [ B e4 ]  [ R c e1 ]  [ R x g2 + ]  [ K h1 ] , [ R d d2 ]  
 [ B f1 ] , [ B d6 ]  With the aim of changing to the more active diagonal a7-g1.
 [ Q d3 ] , [ N f4 ]  Can you believe it? Not even now changing the diag color!
 [ d x e5 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ f6 ]  [ R f e1 ]  [ f x e5 ]  [ N x e5 ] , [ Q d8 ]  because of the large advantage for the white in the center black wishes to exchange the queens and trays to control the D-line by [ R d8 ] in the future .
 [ e4 ] , [ g6 ]  While I know 1. [ [ e4 ] ] [ c5 ] is statistically the best response for black I've been studying the Kings Indian and various King side fianchetto openings lately and they're I'm finding much better suited for my style of play. Discovered attacks on my opponents queenside rook are becoming much more common. (I do want to note that as White I've been opening with [ g3 ] almost exclusively but after studying a lot of games I've now gone back to [ [ e4 ] ] though my hope most of the time is to develop into a Kings Indian or variation there of.)
 [ Q x f6 ]  [ Q d7 ]  [ Q x e5 ]  [ B x f2 ]  [ Q x f4 ]  [ B d4 ]  [ e5 ] , [ c5 ]  At this point I notice that black is in his ideal position. He has mighty few moves.
 [ B x d7 ]  [ N x b6 ]  [ Q x b6 ] , [ R x d7 ]  and now the events turned I have the upper hand my rook is on the 7th rank and black has one pawn less also his bishops is a bad bishop considering the [ e5 ] and [ f4 ] pawns that block it
 [ B b7 ] , [ N c4 ]  As now I'm threatening to win a piece which is part of playing the man. But when I looked back at his time this when I figured out just how much there was. And btw how much time's left isn't based on 40 moves. As ION asked me if it was that or for the entire game. How much time you have is for the whole game which is why I posted all in all with the time control.
 [ K x h7 ]  [ d4 ] , [ g5 ]  forced to push
 [ B x f3 ]  [ g x f3 ]  [ f6 ]  [ R d2 ]  [ f x e5 ] , [ d x e5 ]  Attacking the centrelines and a free pawn is coming...
 [ R h8 + ]  [ R f8 ]  [ R x f8 + ]  [ K x f8 ] , [ K d2 ]  Note not [ K d3 ] as this would allow [ N b4 + ] freeing the Ns to join the fight.
 [ B e7 ] , [ N g x e4 ]  Maybe not the best but I couldn't find anything better. I'm not threatening anything though.
 [ h3 ]  [ N g6 ]  [ B g3 ] , [ B f5 ]  Trying to provoke a weakness with c2-c3.
 [ R b3 ] , [ R e4 ]  In this position Black wants to play [ K g6 ] with a quick [ R e8 ] mate in mind. The bishop is excellent in stopping rook checks and White's king is still cornered despite the rook's absence on the g-file.
 [ K h2 ] , [ R f6 f2 ]  Right after forcing white's K to [ h2 ] black takes advantage by once again attacking white Q. That's because right after white retreats Joe will push his passer one rank forward. And with that white is going to lose very soon. In fact it is almost lights out for white.
 [ B h3 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ N g7 ]  [ B x g7 ]  [ B x e6 + ]  [ K x e6 ]  [ B x g7 ]  [ R g8 ] , [ Q h3 + ]  24. [ Q h3 ] - the black king is badly exposed and even though a lot of wood has disappeared from the board white still has plenty enough firepower for a devastating mating attack.
 [ Q d3 ] , [ c4 ]  With that being said I reattack his Queen. And as noted before he must protect.
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ a6 ]  [ B a4 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ O-O ]  5. 0-0 - I end up tucking Henry away on the kingside. This is a pretty standard main line Lopez.
 [ h5 ]  [ N d7 f6 ]  [ N x f6 ] , [ B x f6 ]  19. ....... [ B x f6 ] - Knight trade.
 [ Q c1 + ]  [ Q x c1 ]  [ R x c1 + ]  [ K g2 ]  [ a6 ] , [ a4 ]  (!?) White has preserved a small material edge (B 3P ~ R) and this move looks the logical one to create a second passed pawn on the Q-side. But it will cost the passer already in existence at d3. Could White have improved here with 37.[ K f3 ] instead? E.g. 37.[ K f3 ] [ R c2 ] 38.[ a4 ] [ R d2 ] 39.[ K e4 ] [ R x f2 ] 40.[ b5 ] ax[ b5 ] 41.ax[ b5 ] or 37...[ R d1 ] 38.[ K e2 ] are by no means definitive sample lines. The main idea is to steal a march on Black's King in the race for the centre and subsequently the Q-side.
 [ R e2 ]  [ B d6 ] , [ B e6 ]  ? [ B c2 ] (with the threat of 37. ... [ R x h7 ] 38. [ B x h7 ] [ B e4 ] 39. [ K g1 ] Qg2#) was a stronger move
 [ a4 ] , [ a5 ]  symmetrical
 [ R a7 + ]  [ K h6 ]  [ N f7 + ]  [ K h5 ] , [ N e5 ]  I spent a weekend here making a spreadsheet where I plotted out about three dozen lines looking at [ h6 ] r[ c1 + ] [ R x b4 ] and Bd3. Most lines led to draws some led to positions where I win (if he doesn't make the right move) and a couple led to losses. So I knew that I could force a draw if I needed to -- but I couldn't force a win.
 [ e4 ] , [ e5 ]  allowing me the gambit
 [ B f5 ] , [ R d4 ]  ! This is a very powerful move that enables mate in one providing no distractions are encountered.
 [ a6 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ Q d6 ] , [ O-O ]  10. 0-0 - which side shall I castle on kingside or queenside. Black's queenside looks a little draughty so I think he will choose the kingside. Freddy proves me wrong. Like the game "Henry seemed as Safe as Houses" he keeps his king in the middle! He now moves his knight to [ h5 ] and I play a double edged move which I will discuss after the bishop for knight trade.
 [ e x d5 ] , [ N e7 ]  I think I wanted more mobility with this move. [ N b4 ] kinda blocks up the queen for no strong reasons.
 [ B h4 ]  [ N b d7 ]  [ Q f3 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ O-O-O ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ b5 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ N x f6 ] , [ e5 ]  breaking through the center. black has lots of pressure.
 [ N c6 ]  [ a4 ]  [ a3 ]  [ h3 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ b4 ]  [ a x b4 ] , [ h2 ]  47. ...... [ h2 ] and resigns - after taking my pawn as near to the queening square as possible I decide enough is enough I am a piece for pawn down and will be piece for 2 pawns down when Freddy plays [ N f5 + ] next turn picking up the [ d6 ] pawn. Look at those white passers waiting to crown take your pick Freddy. So ends Game No 20. and I pause to reflect on the grim stats. Master Freddy 20 - Joanne Stevens NIL!
 [ e4 ]  [ h5 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ d3 ]  [ d x e6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ R h7 ]  [ d5 ]  [ R b8 ]  [ d6 ]  [ b6 ]  [ d7 + ]  [ Q x d7 ]  [ Q d6 ]  [ a6 ]  [ B h6 ]  [ N d8 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ R a8 ]  [ c4 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N b4 ]  [ c6 ]  [ R b8 ]  [ h4 ]  [ f6 ]  [ g4 ]  [ N f7 ]  [ g5 ]  [ R b7 ]  [ g6 ]  [ Q x c6 ]  [ b3 ]  [ f5 ]  [ a4 ]  [ a x b5 ]  [ a5 ]  [ b x a5 ]  [ R a4 ]  [ N c2 + ]  [ K e2 ]  [ R b8 ]  [ b4 ]  [ Q x h1 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ Q f3 + ]  [ K d2 ]  [ N g5 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ N e3 ]  [ N f6 + ]  [ e x f6 ]  [ N h3 ]  [ a x b4 ]  [ N f4 ]  [ R b6 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ N g4 ]  [ N e7 ]  [ Q d5 + ]  [ K e2 ]  [ Q d3 + ]  [ K e1 ]  [ Q c2 ]  [ f4 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ R a8 ]  [ N c4 ]  [ Q d8 + ] , [ K x d8 ]  It's going to stay like this for awhile.
 [ K x f7 ] , [ Q x d8 ]  Having lost his queen Black chose to resign. I didn't realize that I would be able to launch such a powerful attack that quickly until Black's final fatal blunder.
 [ Q x c8 ] , [ e5 ]  The assault gains momentum and starts to get dangerous. I plan to remove the knight from protection and free up the f file.
 [ c6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ B b5 + ]  [ N f d7 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ a6 ]  [ B a4 ]  [ b5 ] , [ B c2 ]  Black is now somewhat cramped or at least has poor piece coordination.
 [ Q a5 ] , [ N x h8 ]  21 [ N x h8 ] I thought about this move for awhile as I hated to give up a developed piece for an undeveloped piece but I reasoned that I had to make up the material.
 [ N d4 ] , [ R x c3 ]  The rook sacrifice is barely even a sacrifice since black will win back all the material with interest. Suddenly the knight on [ d5 ] must be feeling all alone with no defender and paralyzed where he stands.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ B b5 ]  Here playing black on a ruy lopez game.
 [ Q d6 ] , [ h3 ]  Pretty much forces the bishop exchange.
 [ c x b5 ]  [ Q b6 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ R f8 ]  [ Q g2 ]  [ B x b5 ]  [ B x b5 ] , [ Q x b5 ]  More trades but not to anyone's advantage.
 [ Q d8 ]  [ N x f5 ]  [ N x f5 ] , [ Q g4 ]  Black's queen retreated and white exchanged black's good bishop for one of his knights and now white's queen forks black's knight on [ f5 ] and pawn on e4.
 [ e4 ] , [ a6 ]  The St. George. Famously Tony Miles beat Karpov at the peak of his considerable powers with this (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCW0TXH6e0g) but it's a bit much for a mere mortal like me to use as anything other than a surprise weapon.
 [ R d7 ]  [ R x d7 ]  [ Q x d7 ]  [ Q e7 ] , [ Q c8 + ]  White should have played 39.[ N f6 ] instead.
 [ N x f6 + ]  [ g x f6 ] , [ B b1 ]  This move made no sense to me. He wanted to save his Bishop for a potential King side attack along with the Queen. I knew that I had time to get the pawns in front of my King into position where my Queen could cover the H pawn.
 [ a4 ]  [ h6 ]  [ a x b5 ]  [ g5 ] , [ B e5 ]  since [ B f6 ] is locked in this is a trade of Bishops...
 [ K g6 ] , [ a4 ]  35. [ a4 ] - the pawn trade that will follow will result in my b pawn becoming isolated but passed and with the enemy king on the kingside black may well have to give up his knight for it making me a rook for pawn up.
 [ R x e8 ]  [ R e1 ] , [ R x e1 + ]  Avoiding this exchange would favour white.
 [ Q h5 + ]  [ g6 ]  [ Q x e5 + ]  [ Q e7 ] , [ Q x h8 ]  the board- after a string of conditional moves from the opponent.
 [ B x h5 ] , [ Q c4 ]  At this point my imagination...well it just ran wild. I suddenly saw a very neat and also crazy sacrificial attack which I hoped would lead to a checkmate. I saw that I could pin Black's e7-bishop add more pressure bring in both rooks...get a checkmate!!!!! My only reservation was that I did not particularly want to risk my rating with a speculative sacrificial attack against a lower-rated player. However the adventurous part of my nature won.
 [ N c6 ] , [ B g4 ]  Knight moved away and now I can protect the [ f5 ] pawn.
 [ g x f3 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ R e d1 ]  [ Q g5 + ] , [ Q g3 ]  usually its a good rule of thumb that if your being attacked to try to trade off some of the attackers.
 [ Q x h7 ] , [ g x h7 + ]  34.[ g x h7 + ] is better that Rxh7. Now the King must move to [ h8 ] or White will Promote.
 [ B f1 ] , [ R b2 ]  Another pawn will fall. White is resourceless.
 [ O-O ] , [ B c6 ]  Black threatens the [ e4 ] square. So what now defend it with Nd2. No I say I refuse to be passive.
 [ K d1 ]  [ Q x g2 ]  [ R e1 ] , [ e5 ]  I played this move after some consideration and I think it is a very classy move from black. Black finally playes [ e5 ] with threats of [ e4 ] or exd or the menacing bg4+.
 [ R e2 ] , [ Q c7 ]  !
 [ f4 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ N f3 ]  This is close to a stonewall position. After the tournament I studied this opening because It can work quite effectively
 [ g5 ]  [ f5 ]  [ R a e8 ]  [ Q e3 ]  [ R e7 ] , [ N e2 ]  the idea is to move 27.Nd4! which blockade [ d5 ] pawn and defends the bishop on [ e6 ] its the best position for white now because knights in position like those are strong as rook ( see ''my system'' by Aron Nimzovich) it explains the importance of blockades .
 [ B x b5 ]  [ a x b4 ]  [ a x b4 ]  [ R x a1 ]  [ R x a1 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ Q d3 ] , [ N f6 ]  This is your first bad move. 17...[ d5 ] was the obvious move but 17...[ N x b4 ] may also be playable.
 [ h3 ] , [ B x f3 ]  This makes it even easier for me. Had the bishop still be pinning the knight harvesting the d4-pawn would have required more effort.
 [ N f3 ]  [ B b4 ]  [ B d2 ] , [ c5 ]  hmmm maybe a little gambit here?
 [ e x d6 ]  [ e ]  [ p ] , [ Q x d6 ]  Again Black chooses the most aggressive response.
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ c4 ]  I've taken lady Trompowsky to the ball more than once but the tailored black TNs in the 2. ...[ N e4 ] and 3. ...[ c5 ] lines have left me gnashing my teeth and hissing at rats on my ruined dark squares. So I revert to a maiden of classical pedigree.
 [ R f4 ] , [ B f5 ]  18. ...... [ B f5 ] - more pile on.
 [ e6 ] , [ N e5 ]  threatening 9.[ N x f7 ] forking the king and rock.
 [ N x e5 ] , [ Q x e5 + ]  ...but anyway a pawn is lost.
 [ a4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ h4 ] , [ B c5 ]  [ d5 ] is more natural. First knights then bishops.
 [ N f6 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ a5 ]  [ h3 ] , [ N a6 ]  beginning of baidarkas interesting attempt to play queen side... the knight has a good niche at [ b4 ] but cant really go any further
 [ B c4 ]  [ N d3 + ]  [ K e2 ]  [ N x c1 + ] , [ R x c1 ]  Takacs now has four pieces developed to Rubinstein's zero! This will prove fatal to Rubinstein as Takacs will surge forward before Rubinstein can set his defenses in palce.
 [ Q d1 ] , [ h5 ]  This move shows how helpless white is although [ B g7 ] would have been sharper
 [ N f3 ]  [ B g7 ] , [ Q b3 ]  trying to build up some pressure on f7.
 [ N g f6 ] , [ N x e7 ]  Exchanging pieces to leverage the material advantage and to disrupt black's castle.
 [ N f6 ] , [ c4 ]  Out of the book already.
 [ c x d4 ]  [ R x d4 ]  [ f6 ]  [ h4 ]  [ f x g5 ]  [ Q x e4 ]  [ N e f6 ]  [ Q g2 ]  [ g x h4 ]  [ R h x h4 ]  [ N e5 ] , [ R d f4 ]  this was my first mistake...
 [ K f1 ]  [ Q x e7 ] , [ N x d7 ]  White takes my knight but this helped me to get my queen in checking line
 [ K g5 ] , [ K f2 ]  
 [ d x c3 ]  [ K h2 ]  [ c x d2 ] , [ B a3 ]  I think [ B x d2 ] would probably better giving up material but handing back the initiative to white.
 [ K e1 ]  [ K x h3 ]  [ K f2 ] , [ K g4 ]  With two passed King-side Pawns the ending is now a technical win. I just have to not screw it up.
 [ N x b5 ] , [ c6 ]  I fight the knight away becacuse I don't want to give it any advanced support squares esp. in the area where I plan to do battle.
 [ Q c3 ] , [ N g4 ]  adequate defense. [ f3 ] fails to Nxe3. [ h3 ] follows [ N x e3 ] [ f x e3 ] Bg5.
 [ N b3 ] , [ Q c7 ]  Queen retreats as she must. b pawn advance is still quite attractive to black. Knight on [ c3 ] not very effective. Knight to [ e1 ] then to [ f4 ] appears to leave queen side relatively well defended. Black will be looking to castle and then to open up the centre with d pawn advance possibly.
 [ K d8 ]  [ B h3 ]  [ N e7 ]  [ f5 ]  [ N d5 ] , [ K c4 ]  in the end game kings belong in the center so do not be afraid to let your king go for a walk up the board.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B b5 ] , [ B d6 ]  This is a dubious defense but I can't find an immedite refutation.
 [ K g1 ]  [ N g6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ N h4 ]  [ R f2 ] , [ R g3 ]  I moved the rook forward so that I can push the f-pawn.
 [ K h8 ]  [ d4 ] , [ R a f8 ]  white is not out of danger yet. (not by a long way!)
 [ a4 ]  [ R g8 + ]  [ K x b7 ]  [ f8 = Q ]  [ R x f8 ] , [ R x f8 ]  and my opponent resigned
 [ R x d1 ]  [ N x d1 ] , [ N f5 ]  White resigns. So I made it 7 more moves after the exchange sacrifice instead of 10. Close enough!
 [ Q f4 ]  [ Q c3 ] , [ Q f2 ]  I decided I could try to provoke exchanges with this but I was not in danger. Can you tell? But in the meanwhile my queen is po(i)sitioned...
 [ B d7 ]  [ f3 ]  [ K f6 ] , [ K f2 ]  I need the K for attack
 [ R a3 a2 ]  [ Q b1 ] , [ R a8 a7 ]  black defends [ f7 ] pawn...besides black is waiting..its queen will wait on the h6-[ c1 ] diagonal to land on the square e3.the double rooks are in a great position too
 [ B e3 ]  [ Q f5 ]  [ Q g4 ]  [ Q x g4 ]  [ R x g4 ] , [ b5 ]  34. .......... [ b5 ] - I am thinking of putting a rook on my second rank to defend my broken castled position so I create a haven square by moving up my b pawn where the rook should be shielded from white's lsb. It also falls in with a maxim - passed pawns should be pushed (if safe to do so)
 [ R x g2 ]  [ R x f4 ]  [ R g3 ] , [ K d4 ]  Probably I should have advanced my king to the other side (b4).
 [ g3 ] , [ N x e3 + ]  I think i will use that discovered check now. Thanks.
 [ a6 ] , [ Q a5 ]  ...but I have this resource. It is disastrous since after a[ x N b5 ] Q[ x N b6 ] [ R x a2 ] causing serious damage to my queenside.
 [ e x f3 ] , [ Q x f3 ]  Bringing the queen to the battle.
 [ R c2 ] , [ N d7 ]  The Knight wasn't doing anything on b8.
 [ N x d8 ]  [ R g6 ] , [ N x c6 ]  I wasn't sure here whether to try to extract my knight or to simply go for an exchange. I decided on the latter as I can double black's pawns on c which not only hampers him but means his [ a8 ] rook can be tied down to defending his a pawn while his other rook is hemmed in.
 [ B x g5 ]  [ f6 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ g x h2 ]  [ N x h2 ]  [ N e7 ]  [ Q h5 + ] , [ N g6 ]  10. ......... [ N g6 ] - forced to move the same piece twice to block a nasty queen check on h5.
 [ K x f3 ] , [ h1 = Q + ]  Only (-1.62) After [ R x h1 ] Rxh1. But after doubling the rooks on the h-file it should be easy to convert.
 [ a3 ] , [ K a8 ]  Black has nothing.
 [ K c6 ]  [ Q d6 + ]  [ K b5 ]  [ Q d7 + ] , [ K a5 ]  [ B f6 ] could have resisted a little longer as explained since [ a4 + ] is not the best move: [ K x a4 ] if Q[ x B f6 + ] [ K a5 ] [ B b4 + ] [ K a6 ] Q[ a4 + ] Kb7. And if [ K x a4 ] [ Q x a7 + ] Kb5. White should win with [ B f6 ] Qxa7! but it is a little harder to see. The text move unfortunately loses at once since the escape square [ b7 ] is blocked by the bishop.
 [ Q c7 ]  [ f x e5 ] , [ Q x e5 ]  I think [ N x e5 ] is better and doesn't lose a tempo.
 [ Q c2 ]  [ N e7 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ O-O ]  [ b5 ] , [ e4 ]  I felt the push to [ e4 ] was early here....
 [ B b5 ]  [ B d7 ] , [ B g5 ]  !
 [ a4 ]  [ N c4 ]  [ K f6 ]  [ K f1 ]  [ K e6 ] , [ K e2 ]  Desperate of the pawn and black resigning giving me the victory!!!!
 [ Q x b7 ] , [ B f4 ]  my opponent is likely wanting to do [ B d6 ] in hopes of grabbing my [ c5 ] pawn or forking my king and queen if I take his bishop
 [ B d3 ] , [ B f6 ]  I would've had a hard time figuring out what to do. But I would've played 18...[ R d8 ] to centralize one of the R's for center control. However I like the move that Ken played since the B now covers more squares and therefore has more mobility then earlier.
 [ K e5 ] , [ B x f4 + ]  ...which he does I can force the sacrifice.
 [ K e4 ]  [ B x g3 ]  [ K d3 ]  [ K e6 ]  [ B d4 ]  [ a6 ]  [ K c2 ]  [ a4 ]  [ K b1 ]  [ B e5 ]  [ B f2 ]  [ K d6 ]  [ K a2 ]  [ B c3 ]  [ K a3 ]  [ K e5 ]  [ K x a4 ]  [ K f4 ]  [ B b6 ]  [ K x g4 ]  [ B a5 ]  [ B x a5 ]  [ K x a5 ]  [ K f4 ]  [ K b6 ] , [ a5 ]  
 [ Q x b7 ] , [ R a8 ]  Putting the R back to bed? Stronger was [ R c6 ] defending [ a6 ] and threatening [ R b6 ] trapping the Q.
 [ K x h8 ] , [ N f7 + ]  1-0. Black has had enough. I hope you found something constructive about development and awareness to take from this game--more will be forthcoming! Thanks to chicoboy for the game and thank you for reading!
 [ f x g4 ] , [ Q h4 ]  My queen moves into position to mate the king. I just need to get my rook in the right spot.
 [ B x d7 ] , [ N x d7 ]  (Edit thanks) In the hindisght [ Q x d7 ] was much better but I was happy with this trying to find a way out. The problem with the lsb's outcome is that now [ N b5 ] can't be played anymore due to the R...
 [ R e1 ]  [ B x h3 ] , [ d4 ]  This move opens diagonal c1-[ h6 ] for White bishop and disables ...[ Q g5 ] but loses pawn.
 [ N x d5 ] , [ c4 ]  Black is now equal again however he loses a tempo now.
 [ d4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ g3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ B g2 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ N b d2 ]  [ c5 ]  [ e3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ c3 ] , [ c4 ]  the pawn push temporarily gains black additional space.
 [ K e8 ] , [ B x g4 ]  It is obvious that white should take the g knight.
 [ N x e4 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ Q d2 ] , [ B e7 ]  hmm... Still book?
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B c4 ] , [ B c5 ]  nothing fancy: Giuoco Piano...
 [ h6 ]  [ B h4 ] , [ B e7 ]  The more aggressive 6...[ g5 ] has yielded good results.
 [ R f7 f5 ]  [ N x d7 ]  [ R d8 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ g5 ]  [ d7 ]  [ K f8 ] , [ N c6 ]  Black is going to lose significant material trying to deal with the passed pawn.
 [ R f1 ]  [ c5 ]  [ R d2 ]  [ R e b8 ]  [ R c2 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ e x d4 ] , [ N f5 ]  Black needs three to mate and the knight is on it's way.
 [ R b7 ]  [ b4 + ]  [ K b3 ] , [ R a8 ]  Now my objective is to get my rook over to the white g and h pawns. If I can get a passed pawn on either side of the board it's pretty much over.
 [ b5 ]  [ g4 ]  [ b4 ] , [ N a4 ]  15. [ N a4 ] - black does not like this move - here are his comments:- 15.[ N a4 ] was a mistake on your part as that N is now out of play and in fact allows [ B x a4 ] displacing the pawn on [ [ b3 ] ] with one move and giving me counter-play. Better would have been retreating to [ e2 ] where it supports the one on [ d4 ] and can swing in to [ f4 ] or [ g3 ] to help with the attack and also forcing me to use two moves (a5/a4) to dislodge the [ [ b3 ] ] pawn if I want to press my attack. When each side is attacking on an opposite wing like this tempo is very important." - but it seems to be book.
 [ Q d2 ]  [ Q c5 ]  [ Q e3 ]  [ Q b4 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ Q e7 ]  [ h3 ]  [ Q h4 ]  [ Q e3 ]  [ R f6 ]  [ R f2 ]  [ R g6 + ]  [ K f1 ]  [ R g3 ]  [ Q a7 ]  [ Q x h3 + ]  [ K e2 ]  [ K h7 ]  [ Q f7 ] , [ R e3 + ]  
 [ e x d4 ] , [ Q b3 ]  I think this may be the main line. [ f7 ] is under threat. Black however could at some stage take on [ c3 ] with discovered check threats.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ f5 ] , [ N c3 ]  Good up to this point.
 [ B x f7 + ]  [ Q x f7 ] , [ O-O ]  Now having won a significant material plus I have to spend time consolidating my position before developing a winning attack.
 [ N g4 ] , [ N d7 ]  The much-travelled knight prepares to help with the defence.
 [ N f3 ] , [ B g4 ]  ?! He could have moved there in one turn.
 [ b x a4 ]  [ b x a4 ] , [ Q c6 ]  I don't think he can take that pawn I think [ N f6 + ] wins but I did not see that so...
 [ B x g3 ]  [ N x g3 ]  [ N x a4 ]  [ Q x a4 ] , [ Q b6 ]  The a pawn is a bit of a problem for black now his queen gets somewhat out of play.
 [ b5 ] , [ a3 ]  Taking a move off to try to prevent [ b4 ] with tempo and queenside pressure.
 [ R x h3 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ R c h1 ] , [ K f8 ]  White to play.
 [ O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ d4 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ e3 ]  [ B c7 ]  [ N d2 ]  [ d5 ] , [ b3 ]  White is content to develop and maintain the integrity of his center pawns.
 [ Q d7 ] , [ N c5 ]  ? Well played too quickly here and forgot about the bishop. [ R c1 ] would have been better I think.
 [ b5 ] , [ a3 ]  wrong. 11.[ e5 ] is necessary. forces the N away from the center.
 [ R f3 ] , [ K f7 ]  By covering squares on the e-file this frees the minor pieces to move.
 [ B x c4 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ B g4 ]  Pretty standard development from here. White protects its pawns black moves to attack whites knights because the game from here looks to be closed. I.E. strategy is to attack the opponents closed pieces with your open pieces to create an imbalance between your pieces that are stronger when closed and his pieces which are stronger when open. The line that usually follows is 7. Nc3..e6. Which gives the d knight a post and makes it harder for white to open up the center of the board when black decides to trade his bishop for a knight forcing the imbalance. That never happens.
 [ Q f2 ] , [ N c5 ]  At least he is able to dispatch one of the knights.
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ g3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ B g2 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ N g e2 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ h3 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ K h2 ]  [ R b8 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ h6 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ K h7 ]  [ N d1 ]  [ b5 ]  [ f4 ]  [ N g8 ]  [ e5 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ e x d6 ]  [ Q x d6 ]  [ N e c3 ]  [ f5 ]  [ a4 ]  [ a6 ]  [ a x b5 ]  [ a x b5 ]  [ R a6 ]  [ e6 ]  [ Q f2 ]  [ B d4 ]  [ B x d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N e2 ]  [ N g e7 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ Q x d4 ]  [ Q x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ R d6 ]  [ N x c2 ]  [ R x d7 ]  [ R f e8 ]  [ R f2 ]  [ N b4 ]  [ R e2 ]  [ R b d8 ]  [ R x d8 ]  [ R x d8 ]  [ R x e6 ]  [ N g8 ]  [ R e2 ]  [ R x d3 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N x b5 ]  [ h5 ]  [ B f1 ]  [ K h6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ h4 ]  [ R g2 ]  [ h x g3 + ]  [ R x g3 ]  [ R d4 ]  [ N e2 ]  [ R d2 ]  [ R b3 ]  [ N d3 ]  [ K g3 ]  [ N e4 + ]  [ K f3 ]  [ N e1 + ]  [ K e3 ]  [ N c2 + ]  [ K f3 ]  [ R x e2 ]  [ K x e2 ]  [ N d4 + ]  [ K d3 ]  [ N x b3 ]  [ K c2 ]  [ N d4 + ]  [ K d3 ]  [ N e6 ]  [ K e3 ]  [ K g7 ]  [ b4 ]  [ K f6 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ N d6 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ N c8 ]  [ h4 ]  [ N b6 ]  [ B f3 ]  [ K e7 ]  [ h5 ]  [ g x h5 ]  [ B x h5 ]  [ N d5 + ]  [ K f3 ]  [ N d4 + ]  [ K g3 ]  [ N x b4 ]  [ B g6 ]  [ K e6 ]  [ K f2 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ K e1 ]  [ N f3 + ]  [ K d1 ]  [ N h4 ]  [ B x f5 + ] , [ N x f5 ]  This ending is one of the most technically fascinating in chess although it occurs rarely in practice. As is well known two knights cannot force mate against a bare king because at the crucial moment the defender's king will be stalemated. However if the defender has a pawn the stalemate does not arise so it is possible to force mate. Almost all of the research on this endgame was carried out by the legendary Russian analyst and study composer Alexey Troitzky in the early years of the 20th century. Troitzky's achievement is remarkable as he analysed the endgame single-handedly with no prior published theory or practice on which to build and of course no computer help. He identified the basic plan the techniques for corralling the defender's king and he even worked out precisely where the defender's pawn needs to be on each file in order for the position to be a win. A few later analysts tidied up some loose ends but almost all of the credit for solving this ending goes to Troitzky. The biggest compliment to the quality of his work came in 1995 when John Nunn published Secrets of Minor Piece Endings. This was part of a series of books in which Nunn updated and corrected established endgame theory for new discoveries thrown up by the early This ending is one of the most tech-generations of computer endgame tablebases. When it came to two knights versus pawn Nunn decided to omit this ending from his book "after discovering that the pre-database work of Troitzky and other analysts was astonishingly accurate". Effectively the tablebase added nothing of real significance to the earlier analysis! The basic technique for winning the endgame is always the same and consists of three stages: 1. The stronger side blockades the enemy pawn with one of his knights. 2. He then drives the defender's king into a corner using his own king and the other knight. 3. Having cornered the king in the corner he brings over the blockading knight to effect mate. Obviously when he commences stage 3 he has to release the blockade on the pawn which will then advance. It is important that the pawn cannot promote before the knights are ready to give mate and this in turn means that the pawn needs to be blockaded far enough back to ensure that this is the case. For various reasons the line behind which the pawn must stand is not uniform and it varies depending on which file the pawn stands. Troitzky identified the full line which is as follows (the diagram assumes that White is the stronger side and that we therefore have a black pawn): Despite Troitzky's analysis the end­ing is extremely complicated and far from easy to handle well even for top grandmasters. In practice when this ending arises it tends to be drawn rather more often than it is won. A few years after the present game for ex­ample the leading grandmaster Andor Lilienthal reached the endgame but was unable to win it (see Norman­Lilienthal Hastings 1934-5). He obviously did no
 [ Q d4 + ]  [ Q x d4 ]  [ R x d4 ] , [ K f6 ]  In the endgame activate your King as fast as possible! In this case it is particularly good because [ R e d2 ] or [ R b d2 ] would have led to a draw after [ R x d2 ] [ R x d2 ] [ R e1 ] [ R x d5 ] [ g3 ] and the endgame 4v3 is a draw.
 [ R x f5 ]  [ N x f5 ]  [ N g6 + ]  [ K g8 ] , [ R e7 ]  A beautiful move. If 45... NxQ 46 R-[ N7 ] mate. If 45... PxN 46 Q-[ R7 ] mate. If 45 ... NxR 46 PxN Q-[ K1 ] 47 PxR (Q) ch wins easily.
 [ B h3 ]  [ N e2 ] , [ B x e3 ]  I need to focus on my position rather than easily defended attacks
 [ N e7 ] , [ B f7 ]  66 min. remaining. White's Bishop is running out of moves.
 [ R a e1 ] , [ R f e8 ]  Preparing to advance the 3-pawn. It's going to want support from a pawn on [ f6 ] first.
 [ e5 ] , [ Q f3 ]  If you are going to bring the queen out early (which isn't advised) I prefer [ h5 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ B c4 ]  Fair enough develops the bishop
 [ N g8 ] , [ h4 ]  Continuing the attack. Any alternatives?
 [ d x e2 ] , [ Q x e2 ]  Not much choice but to take.
 [ N f6 ] , [ N b d2 ]  Supporting his KP.
 [ Q x c3 ]  [ N g6 + ] , [ f x g6 ]  Bad move really but 22 ... [ K g8 ] 23 Nxg8. Now black can not recapture if 23... [ N x g8 ] 24 [ B x f7 + + ] else 23... [ K x g8 ] 24 Qxf7++.
 [ R x d6 ]  [ Q f4 ] , [ Q e5 ]  Having the advantage of a castle against a bishop towards the end of a party you will gain by exchanging queens; because his queen is troublesome to you in her present situation and to avoid the check-mate he finds himself under the necessity of taking her.
 [ K d8 ] , [ Q f7 ]  Now I'm attacking both the knight and the bishop. Both captures would come with check. When I played with this in the analysis window looking at responses to Nf6. I realised that the most natural looking defence is a horrible blunder...
 [ g x h5 ] , [ B e4 ]  Lining up the bishop with my queen hey whadda ya know a double threat
 [ d x e4 ]  [ B x e4 ] , [ N d4 ]  Blow for blow. Not only does this stop the discovered attacks on Black's queen; but it leaves the c-file half open and even sets up possibilities arising out of ...[ N e2 + ] and ...[ N c3 + ] - splitting the pawn shell in front of the White king. Not bad for a single move.
 [ N c6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ B c5 ] , [ N x c6 ]  this gives black three pawn islands which might be losing in the endgame... let's see still too much to be played until then...
 [ R x e1 ]  [ Q x e1 + ]  [ R f1 ]  [ Q e3 + ] , [ K h1 ]  [ R f2 ] falls to ...[ Q x f2 ] [ K h1 ] [ Q f1 ] mate.
 [ B g5 ] , [ a6 ]  it took me the longest to figure out why he didn't take a pawn. Then I realized that they were both defended. I wanted to be able to move my queen so that's why I bumped up this pawn.
 [ g3 ]  [ R a b8 ]  [ B b2 ] , [ R h g8 ]  Neither of these rook moves I felt desirable.
 [ N d7 ] , [ N x c7 ]  Oops! It's also possible to throw away pieces...
 [ Q c5 + ] , [ Q c4 ]  Gives white an easy win.
 [ N x f6 ]  [ Q x d8 ]  [ N x d8 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ g x f5 ]  [ R x f5 ]  [ R e3 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ R x e2 ]  [ R g5 + ]  [ K f8 ]  [ R x g3 ] , [ N e6 ]  the rest is academic.
 [ f x g3 ]  [ R x g3 + ] , [ K f2 ]  [ K f2 ] is forced
 [ N f6 ]  [ d3 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ B x e3 ] , [ f x e3 ]  after that bishop exchange i was very afraid of white getting a very strong centre
 [ e x f6 ]  [ g x f6 ] , [ B d2 ]  However he is forced to retreat his LSB because it was chased during the exchange. Therefore exchanging material might not have been so bad but I am still behind as I had mentioned earlier. Afterall I do not like exchanges when I am "down material".
 [ K c6 ] , [ B x g4 ]  White recovers material for his queen.
 [ R h x g1 ] , [ R x f3 ]  Hoping to take advantage of the discovered check which I ended up doing.
 [ Q x g2 ]  [ B x g2 ]  [ N x e7 + ]  [ K h8 ]  [ K x g2 ]  [ R f e8 ] , [ B d2 ]  To threaten a mate in 2 and connect my rooks to free the knight from it's pin. Perhaps [ B f4 ] was better or seemed better attacking the [ b8 ] rook but I just wanted to get the game over with. I probably would have played [ B f4 ] in a real tournament.
 [ R f8 ] , [ Q x f8 ]  33.[ Q h7 ] [ Q x c4 + ] 34.[ K d1 ] [ Q a4 + ] 35.[ b3 ] Nx[ b3 ] is no better.
 [ R a b8 ]  [ R a b1 ] , [ R b7 ]  Now the a pawn is hanging.
 [ N e5 ] , [ B b3 ]  almost certainly his bishop will come to [ c8 ] so I withdraw i plan to--
 [ e4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d3 ]  [ b5 ]  [ B b3 ]  [ e5 ]  [ B d5 ]  [ c6 ] , [ B b3 ]  Although I have no pieces developed I feel my rapid queen side pawn development stops his knight from advancing and temporarily makes it difficult to attack.
 [ K e5 ] , [ K f2 ]  No choice
 [ d4 ] , [ N f6 ]  Expecting a KID or Tango here nice and easy to get things going.
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ B b5 ]  The Ruy Lopez again.
 [ b4 ] , [ B c7 ]  Ah I see. A double attack on my [ e5 ] pawn. He was thinking ahead but he wasn't looking from both sides of the board
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ] , [ N c3 ]  Closed sicilian my favourite.
 [ R d5 ]  [ K c1 ] , [ R f6 ]  Threatening to win another pawn.
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ] , [ B d3 ]  Standard is [ N c3 ] but I wanted to try an idea using the Bishop.
 [ K d5 ]  [ R b e1 ]  [ R b3 ]  [ R e1 e3 ]  [ R x e3 ]  [ R x e3 ]  [ R x e5 ] , [ R x e5 + ]  I was expecting 55... KxR to which the response would be 56 K-[ N5 ] eliminating the last Black Pawn.
 [ h3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ g4 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ R f3 ]  [ B x c4 ]  [ R e3 ] , [ B x a2 ]  The white R still can't penetrate there is nothing to fight for.
 [ e4 ] , [ f x e4 ]  After this exchange...
 [ N x e4 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ B x e4 ] , [ Q x e4 ]  And now the main part of Black's Brick Wall has vanished but there is still some concrete left over...
 [ B x b7 ] , [ N x b7 ]  I wanted the knight to [ c5 ] so i took a risk and played Qa6.
 [ R f d8 ]  [ R f d1 ]  [ R c6 ]  [ R d2 ] , [ b6 ]  [ b6 ] is played to solidify the [ c5 ] pawn
 [ Q e2 ]  [ N g5 ]  [ N b d2 ] , [ R f5 ]  My plan was to play [ Q f6 ] and Ra-[ f1 ] to put lots of pressure down the f-file.
 [ K b2 ] , [ Q x f4 ]  I add to it.
 [ N d6 + ]  [ K g4 ]  [ K x g6 ] , [ K x h4 ]  Draw agreed. "But why did you agree a draw daddy?" "Because dearest daughter with only knight and rook against rook and king I cannot win even if I win his a pawn. I have run out of pawns to queen!" And with that Paula was quickly put back in her box and the lid was firmly shut before she could ask any more annoying questions.
 [ Q x d4 ] , [ N d7 ]  retreat with my cowboy to regroup
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ g6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ d6 ]  Black could have made a more aggressive with a more common move of d5. Although [ d6 ] is not bad.
 [ R g h6 ]  [ N f4 ]  [ R g5 ] , [ R b2 x b7 ]  Since White has defended everything it's time to get the attack under way.
 [ a3 ]  [ N x d3 ]  [ c x d3 ] , [ B a6 ]  Pinning the pawn. If [ Q c2 ] then [ N x a5 ] and I don't think it advantage my position.
 [ N f4 ]  [ B x f4 ] , [ g x f4 ]  ?? Mary thought that she won back a piece. But this however is the move I kept in mind because by playing this...
 [ R a e8 ] , [ K f1 ]  This is a conditional move because it's the only way for Jack to prevent further loss of material.
 [ K b6 ]  [ K c3 ]  [ K x a6 ] , [ K d4 ]  64. [ K d4 ] - onward goes Henry towards those black footmen as planned.
 [ g x h3 ]  [ Q x h3 ] , [ N h2 ]  !! Until this move White had been cramped with no hope of defense or counterplay. Now White's Bishop and Queen are released and spell trouble for Black.
 [ R h7 ]  [ Q e2 ]  [ R f5 ] , [ g4 ]  !? my heart in my mouth because of the potential exposure of my King but it brings immediate reward.
 [ Q f5 + ]  [ N d7 ]  [ Q x d7 + ]  [ K b8 ]  [ Q d8 + ]  [ R x d8 ] , [ R x d8 # ]  
 [ Q f3 ]  [ a5 ] , [ B c4 ]  Luckily I see this one coming
 [ R f6 ]  [ h5 ]  [ R f8 ]  [ R f2 ]  [ K e4 ]  [ R e2 + ]  [ K d5 ]  [ R e3 ] , [ e6 ]  !?
 [ B c4 ]  [ h6 ] , [ d4 ]  If he's going to play a bit defensive I'll attack.
 [ d6 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ f6 ]  [ B h4 ]  [ g5 ]  [ B g3 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ a6 ]  [ B c6 ]  [ B x c6 ]  [ d x c6 ]  [ N c5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N e7 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N x c6 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ N x e4 ] , [ N d2 ]  Here did I opened for chance to check by [ Q h5 + ]  [ N x g3 ] , [ f x g3 ]  And here does opening for the Rook comes
 [ Q f7 ]  [ N b3 ]  [ B h4 ]  [ N c5 ]  [ B f2 ] , [ N x a6 + ]  now I am winning.
 [ N x d2 ]  [ B x b7 ]  [ N x f1 ] , [ Q x f1 ]  no need to take the rook it is trapped right now!
 [ R c1 + ] , [ K d8 ]  Cant play 25. ... [ K b8 ] 26. [ Q c2 ] [ B b7 ] (to save B) 27. [ Q c7 + ] [ K a7 ] 28. [ B f3 ] [ R b8 ] and white has a very comfortable position.
 [ N c3 ] , [ R f7 ]  Black tries to build a protective force around the king.
 [ N c6 ]  [ b3 ]  [ h5 ]  [ B b2 ] , [ B f8 ]  An attempt to spare the dsb but White eyes the long diagonal.
 [ K f1 ]  [ N d6 ]  [ K e2 ]  [ f6 ]  [ N e1 ]  [ b5 ] , [ b4 ]  Marco's first mistake. Now the White QRP is weak and backwards.
 [ B b5 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ B x d7 ] , [ K x d7 ]  White can't lose now. Black's pawns are frozen. White already has two passed pawns on the Kingside and can create a third by force on the Queenside. Black's lone K will not be able to stop them all.
 [ d6 ] , [ d4 ]  Black chooses the Old Steinitz Defense good if you like cramped games. While it's mostly sound it's not the most dynamic of black's options. I play the main line.
 [ K x h4 ]  [ K x g2 ]  [ g x f3 + ] , [ K x f3 ]  Try as Black might this position is always always always a draw. Either White's king sits in front of the pawn unstoppably or Black's king gets trapped in front of the pawn.
 [ N f3 ] , [ d5 ]  Another natural move which although it creates TONS of tactical possibilities is very comfortable for black.
 [ Q f3 ] , [ B d7 ]  Black's bishops have found themselves closed in and ineffectual.
 [ f4 ]  [ Q e7 ] , [ h3 ]  Another basic English opening tactic is to tuck away your king on H2.
 [ B x e5 ]  [ b x c6 ] , [ B x c7 ]  ...and prevents the rook from check on d8. Black must have checked a move before.
 [ B x b5 ]  [ a x b5 ]  [ N x c2 ] , [ Q x c2 ]  17. [ Q x c2 ] - it seems as though these exchanges have relieved my position. However things are just about to take a sinister turn. Starting with Terence's next move.
 [ h6 ] , [ B f4 ]  My bishop must retreat...
 [ N c3 ]  [ e6 ] , [ d4 ]  Striking the centre first.
 [ d5 ] , [ e4 ]  according to the database this is the "blackmar gambit"
 [ c6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ a5 ]  Instead of [ a5 ] try thinking about [ Q e2 ] or [ h3 ] or b4.
 [ e4 ] , [ c5 ]  My typical response to [ [ e4 ] ] players. My coach tell me it most popular as well. My goal is to gain advantage over the [ d4 ] square with the sacrifice of white aggressive development. Also I don't tend to like to play copycat game (1. [ [ e4 ] ] [ e5 ] ...) but rather pick my own style of play.
 [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ B x d4 ] , [ Q x d4 ]  X[ b2 ] possible mate in the future from an open king this works on so many levels. not to mention that if all else fails I get free [ c5 ]  [ Q x b2 ]  [ c x b7 ] , [ R d8 ]  as long as the rook is trapped at [ a1 ] I might as well not mess with it
 [ Q x d2 ]  [ R a c8 ] , [ f x g6 ]  claiming the bishop.
 [ N d2 ] , [ N x e4 ]  A mistake because with best play white can equalize in material by [ B x g7 ] followed by 12. ... [ N x f2 ] 13. [ R x f2 ] Kxg7. 12. [ B x g7 ] [ N x d2 ] 13. [ B x f8 ] [ N x f1 ] 14. Bh6. Now black's knight is trapped and white has turned the game around.
 [ d6 ]  [ N b d2 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ c3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ B g4 ]  [ b4 ]  [ B b6 ]  [ B b2 ]  [ a6 ] , [ Q c2 ]  10. [ Q c2 ] - unpins [ f3 ] knight.
 [ O-O ] , [ B e7 ]  5. ..... 0-0 - This starts off the Closed Ruy Lopez. Funnily enough in another game against an Expert I decided to try the Open Lopez which is Nxe4. That game is in progress so I may annotate that one at its conclusion but here I choose the conservative Be7.
 [ N x c5 ]  [ R b1 ]  [ N b7 ]  [ Q b4 ]  [ B x b5 ]  [ Q x b5 ]  [ N c5 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ N b a6 ]  [ Q c6 ]  [ R a b8 ]  [ B x c5 ]  [ N x c5 ]  [ N d2 ]  [ R b6 ]  [ R x b6 ] , [ a x b6 ]  I'm not sure taking with the a pawn was best. It's easier to liquidate pawns and create a passer by taking [ c x b6 ] maybe.
 [ K g7 ] , [ f5 ]  f5! and after this have [ h4 ] [ h5 ] and pown attack
 [ Q c7 ] , [ Q b2 ]  Obviously my plan is to get my queen to [ a3 ] and rook to [ e7 ] for the ultimate fork. But who doesn't know what I'm trying to do?
 [ Q d8 ]  [ R e1 ] , [ N g6 ]  ?? Allows a discovered attack that will win...A pawn...that's not really worth the trouble so I play something else.
 [ Q x a4 ] , [ R x f5 ]  43...Qxd1+?? I believe the word for this is "blunder."
 [ K x e1 ]  [ Q x c7 ]  [ B d4 + ]  [ K h7 ] , [ B e5 ]  Now my rook is protected :)
 [ Q e2 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ B x d4 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ B x c5 ] , [ N x c5 ]  After these exchanges I think Black is ok here.
 [ N g5 + ]  [ K h6 ]  [ N x e6 ]  [ N e3 ]  [ g5 + ]  [ K h7 ] , [ N x d8 ]  probably the wrong Rook...
 [ c5 ] , [ B e5 ]  I want to exchange my bad bishop for a defender piece on the kingside.
 [ e4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ d3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ f4 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ B e2 ] , [ Q d7 ]  Setting up to be an aggressive game - White staking out the center while Black is getting his pieces moving early.
 [ N e f3 ]  [ Q c7 ] , [ N h2 ]  better is 24.[ h5 ] ...white lost time with this move which black failed to capitalize on.
 [ R h6 ]  [ B d3 ] , [ R h5 ]  So more piece exchanges are in sight. I cannot allow myself to lose plainly a pawn.
 [ N f3 ]  [ N c7 ]  [ N h2 ] , [ b5 ]  No trouble here for white as far as keeps calm
 [ Q b6 + ]  [ K h2 ] , [ h5 ]  36. ...... [ h5 ] - I now decide to start a pawn storm. This will result in an opening of the g file.
 [ c6 ]  [ B d2 ]  [ Q c7 ] , [ R a c1 ]  i will win the [ d5 ] knight if black exchange dsb with my [ e5 ] knight...
 [ b x c4 ] , [ N x c4 ]  and white resigns for the reason that now black simply threats 21...[ Q x b2 # ] and [ N a2 # ] there for 22.Rd4-Qxb2+.23.Kd1-[ Q x d4 + ] and white without a piece and lose the game if.22. Rde1-Qxb2+.23.Kd1-[ Q x c2 # ] or if 22.Rdg1-Qxb2+.23.Kd1-Qxc2+.24.Ke1-Nd3+.25.Kf1-[ Q f2 # ] . its hopeless position for white thank you and hope you enjoyed the game .
 [ Q e5 ]  [ Q a3 ]  [ Q e4 ] , [ Q f3 ]  Has Black bundered away the game? I thought so for a moment my finger hovering over a resignation. Then I saw that while White gets a check one is all he gets. So reason to play on.
 [ c x d4 ]  [ R a c8 ]  [ Q d3 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ R d c1 ] , [ Q b7 ]  Taing the Queen out of sight of that white rook and creating some dangerous tactical tricks by aiming whites kingside

 [ N g6 ] , [ Q x g6 + ]  The rest is cleanup.
 [ d3 ] , [ B c5 ]  As you may be able to tell I love sacks on f7/f2!
 [ N h6 ] , [ d4 ]  I believe this is an exchange combination that could have been handled by Nc6...
 [ e4 ] , [ c5 ]  This is an interesting draw with moments of drama! Anyway he opens [ e4 ] and I play my usual Sicilian
 [ N c3 ]  [ c6 ] , [ e5 ]  I can't resist shoving my unimpeded central pawns into my opponent's territory squeezing him as far back as possible and trying to use this to recapture my pawn.
 [ g3 ]  [ R a d8 ]  [ R f2 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ g4 ]  [ B g6 ] , [ f4 ]  threatening f5.
 [ N f3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ c4 ]  [ c6 ]  [ g3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B g2 ] , [ B d7 ]  A funny move. [ B g4 ] [ d x c4 ] and [ e6 ] are the normal moves in this position. I don't really understand what the bishop is supposed to be doing on d7.
 [ Q x e8 + ]  [ R x e8 ]  [ N f7 + ]  [ K g7 ]  [ N x h6 ] , [ K x h6 ]  remember those pawns i lost to set this up yeh now i regret it.
 [ R b1 ]  [ e5 ] , [ b5 ]  Now I start to see but in my haste I miss the move that helps hold the position together.
 [ N c3 ] , [ d4 ]  Understandable but careless in view of White's reply.
 [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ Q e7 ]  Now I suspected a longside castle is coming which I think might be a mistake as my queenside development is already fairly advanced
 [ c6 ] , [ B a4 ]  like that...leaving me more developed
 [ R x f7 ]  [ R a f8 ] , [ R h5 # ]  The final blow
 [ N e8 ] , [ B g5 ]  continuing to develop with tempo
 [ Q x e7 + ] , [ B x e7 ]  And now I am two pawns ahead and I think we can agree that my formation is much better.
 [ B x d2 ]  [ N x d2 ] , [ N x d4 ]  Coming out of the exchange a pawn up. Also I now have a passed pawn.
 [ g x f5 ]  [ N x f5 ] , [ K x a5 ]  And here the analysis prefers [ R c4 + ] to preserve my last pawn. The idea being of course that I divide the board for his K and lock him under the 5th rank. I however didn't do that.
 [ B h7 ] , [ K g5 ]  Among other things threatening f5.
 [ B x f3 ]  [ Q x f3 ]  [ Q x g5 ]  [ d x e5 ] , [ B e7 ]  Black should have castled to the Queenside.
 [ Q x g4 ] , [ Q f6 ]  Now I'm losing in material but white has tripled pawns.
 [ B d7 ]  [ K b1 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ e x d4 ] , [ b5 ]  Or Rc8. Now 15. [ B x b5 ] [ N b4 ] 16. [ c x b4 ] [ B x b5 ] 17. [ a3 ] [ a5 ] 18. [ a4 ] [ R c8 ] 19. [ Q b3 ] [ B c4 ] 20. [ N x c4 ] [ d x c4 ] 21. [ Q c2 ] [ a x b4 ] and black has plenty of compensation for the pawn.
 [ K d6 ]  [ N b5 + ]  [ K c6 ] , [ K e2 ]  Waste of time but no damage done.
 [ Q x f7 + ]  [ R x f7 ]  [ B x f7 + ]  [ K h8 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ N g6 ]  [ N f7 + ]  [ K g8 ] , [ N d6 + ]  White can now draw by repetition. The better move to play for a win was probably [ N g5 ] check.
 [ R d1 ] , [ N g6 ]  looking for [ N f4 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ N e7 ]  [ B d7 ] , [ R b8 ]  At this point I finally realised that I needed my rook in action though I am expecting [ B b5 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ B c6 ]  [ B x c6 ]  [ N x c6 ]  [ a6 ] , [ R b3 ]  terrible move [ R b2 ] is much better
 [ B d7 ] , [ g4 ]  Again white should be developing.
 [ Q f3 ] , [ h6 ]  [This move is relatively rare compared to the main line 8...[ Q c7 ] 9.0–0–0 [ N b d7 ] 10.[ g4 ] [ b5 ] etc.]
 [ O-O ]  [ e4 ]  [ N x c3 ] , [ b x c3 ]  I was happy enough to have the extra support of my pawn center once I achieve a solid center I'll have better chances of conducting a successful attack on the wings
 [ Q b3 ]  [ K g2 ] , [ Q a2 ]  I liked this better then 37. ... [ f6 ] 38. [ h3 ] Kf7... We threaten deadly a3...
 [ B x h6 ]  [ g x h5 ]  [ B x f8 ] , [ Q x f8 ]  There was no way to save the pawn on [ h5 ] so the queen capture may be better but being able to take the pawn with the queen and maintain an attack is good for white.
 [ d4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ f4 ]  [ c5 ] , [ e3 ]  And I never seen this move before but his rating is 1660 so I tought its dangeraus
 [ N x e5 ]  [ B x e5 ]  [ f4 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ Q g4 ] , [ R g8 ]  12...O-O 13. [ N f6 + ] just seems terrible for Black so he avoids castling. But he is many moves from being able to castle queenside--four at the very least. This should give White time to build up even more of an attack.
 [ d x c5 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N b3 ] , [ B x c5 ]  A small combination that regains his pawn but at the cost of trading his dark squared bishop. 9...[ Q c7 ] would doubtless transpose but this is more forcing.
 [ R x b7 ]  [ R d b8 ] , [ R b3 ]  If Black want's some relief by exchanging a pair of Rooks I will be happy to recapture with the [ a2 ] pawn and keep a material and positional plus due to the weakness down the c-file.
 [ Q b3 ]  [ a5 ]  [ a3 ]  [ R x h2 ]  [ a x b4 ] , [ Q b7 ]  I was desperately short of time through this part of the game but I'm still at a loss to suggest better for Black.
 [ B e7 ]  [ N b d2 ] , [ O-O ]  In an ironic twist despite White's initial gain of time it is *Black* whose King reaches safety. White never does get his King out of the danger zone!
 [ Q d3 ]  [ Q b3 ]  [ h5 ]  [ K h2 ]  [ Q d6 + ]  [ g3 ]  [ Q c5 ]  [ Q c2 + ]  [ g6 ]  [ a4 ] , [ Q b4 ]  threatening Qb3.
 [ O-O ]  [ O-O ] , [ B d2 ]  Completing his development.
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ g6 ] , [ f4 ]  this variation is known as Levenfish attack in the sicilian dragon this variation is un usual generally in the other variations In Yugoslavian attack Classical kings side casteling variation black plays [ B g7 ] and he makes hard contra play on the queen side while white attacks on the kings side howevere this vriation is very tricky for someone which doesnt know this variation we shuall see in the follow of the game .
 [ B e7 ] , [ N c2 ]  This move supports the [ d4 ] square.
 [ B c4 ]  [ R d1 ]  [ R a d8 ]  [ N a3 ] , [ B b3 ]  I'm not happy with this move if I take a pawn I still leave my queen side pawns opened to rook attacks. There is also pin not allowing me to play b6.
 [ e x d5 ]  [ Q x d5 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ Q e6 + ]  I'm not surprised to see the computer place me in check like this. I decide to break it with my [ B f1 ] as that will subsequently bring me one step closer to castling.
 [ Q c2 ] , [ R d6 ]  Even if White moved his C pawn I would have both of my Rooks on this file first. I still controlled the center which turned out to be a long term plus.
 [ g x h6 ] , [ Q g6 + ]  can't afford to give him a move... hoping he makes some kind of mistake.
 [ e4 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ Q a4 ]  White defends with his queen. It's best not to move the queen this early in the game because developing pieces can attack it and force it to move.
 [ d4 ] , [ e5 ]  I decided that I would experiment with the Englund Gambit but my opponent did not play along.
 [ R e1 ] , [ f5 ]  this is black objective to open king-side.
 [ K g7 ] , [ h3 ]  Really unsure about this move. I simply don't understand the purpose apart from protecting against a back rank mate?
 [ B e2 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ B d1 ]  [ B d3 + ]  [ K b3 ]  [ B c4 + ] , [ K c2 ]  Now I might as well have conceded the draw by repetition but I wanted to exploit my considerable time advantage: I had about an extra 30 minutes on the clock by this stage.
 [ c4 ] , [ c6 ]  A little bit strange. 1. ... [ c5 ] is better.
 [ K b7 ] , [ Q x g3 ]  Restoring the status quo as it existed at White's 30th move: a -2 material deficit.
 [ N x e5 ] , [ B e6 ]  White has a won game but can he exploit the position of the king and win quickly?
 [ R e x h2 + ] , [ K g1 ]  The challenge is to find the mate...
 [ N x e5 ]  [ g x h3 ]  [ Q x h3 ]  [ B e2 ] , [ N f g4 ]  Things are looking very poorly for white. As far as I can tell the only way to prevent [ Q h2 # ] is to trade out both his white bishop and queen.
 [ R x c2 ] , [ Q f3 + ]  Oooohhhh. CHECK!!
 [ B b3 ] , [ d5 ]  ...which I do.
 [ N x a5 ]  [ R a3 ]  [ R c4 ] , [ R a2 ]  Retaining the king on the 1st row.
 [ N d2 ]  [ K f7 ] , [ R c5 ]  ! Prepare to double the rooks on c file.
 [ Q h1 + ] , [ N g2 ]  Deprived of the perpetual check draw.
 [ a3 ]  [ K d7 ] , [ N c4 ]  I move my knight as a touch of defiance being a pawn and piece behind...
 [ R x d4 ]  [ R h g1 + ]  [ K h8 ]  [ N x f5 ]  [ R x c4 ]  [ R x b7 ]  [ R x a4 ]  [ N h6 ]  [ R a3 + ]  [ K f4 ]  [ R a4 + ]  [ K e5 ]  [ f6 + ]  [ K f5 ]  [ R b4 ]  [ N f7 + ]  [ R x f7 ]  [ R x f7 ]  [ R b8 ]  [ R g g7 ]  [ a4 ]  [ R g x h7 + ]  [ K g8 ]  [ K x f6 ]  [ a3 ]  [ R f g7 + ]  [ K f8 ] , [ R h8 # ]  
 [ Q g8 + ]  [ K b7 ]  [ Q d5 + ]  [ K a7 ] , [ e6 ]  pushing a pawn and defending two others plus promotion minus two... this reminds me of Federer-Wawrinka in the las Masters...
 [ N f3 ]  [ d5 ] , [ c4 ]  Standard starting moves in Reti's opening
 [ R a c8 ]  [ e4 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ R x e4 ] , [ Q g5 ]  I liked this better then 15. ... [ Q f6 ] 16. [ R e3 ] [ d5 ] 17. a5!...
 [ O-O ]  [ a6 ]  [ B a4 ] , [ h6 ]  wastes a tempo
 [ g x f4 ]  [ B h3 + ] , [ K g3 ]  24. [ K g1 ] [ g x f4 ] and white is in a lost position.
 [ d x e5 ]  [ f x e5 ] , [ N f d7 ]  That's how far the book line goes according to gameknot analyzer.
 [ R a1 + ]  [ K b4 ]  [ Q f8 + ]  [ K c3 ] , [ B e1 + ]  With this bishop now in the game and controlling dark squares white is seriously on the ropes.
 [ K f1 ] , [ B g3 ]  NOw I'm threatening [ g2 ] and he can't play [ R e2 ] or Qh1#.
 [ f3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ B e4 ]  10. [ B e4 ] is again the perfect move for my strategy. Taking on [ h7 ] or [ B h6 ] is still strong but I wanted to play plausible moves which didn't win but didn't lose but seemed reasonable.
 [ e3 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ B x d6 ] , [ c x d6 ]  This gives us 2 Queens pawns... Háh!...
 [ R x g8 ] , [ c x d5 + ]  Ah but now he cannot take exd because of Rh6+...
 [ g4 ]  [ a4 ]  [ g5 ] , [ a3 ]  If i foolishly play 39... PxP? I lose a tempo in the race.
 [ R x g7 ] , [ N f3 ]  
 [ g4 ] , [ Q c7 ]  Forcing the exchange of Qs.
 [ b5 ] , [ B e2 ]  I hesitated long but if black takes [ a4 ] I'll have one pawn late but the a black pawn will block the file as good as mine and anyway I'll attack within two or three moves so that it won't have time to be a queen. If I fail my attack the game will be lost anyway but with queen knight two bishop and one rook on e file my attack should succeed.
 [ c x d4 ] , [ c3 ]  That's because he gives another pawn. I think that the idea is that if you take Nathan will get an advantage as he'll get a piece developed right then and there. That's due to how he recaptures which you'll see on his next move.
 [ e4 ] , [ c5 ]  Started off with my normal opening as black with the [ c5 ] pawn.
 [ Q h5 ] , [ B g6 ]  Alternative variation: 34... [ B x h3 ] 35. [ Q x h3 ] [ K g8 ] 36. [ a3 ] $19
 [ N f6 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ N c6 ]  And now it is the four knights. Usually it is rather boring but not in this game!
 [ a6 ]  [ b3 ]  [ d6 ] , [ e3 ]  10. e3?! (in hindsight I think this is an inaccuracy which leads to a lot of trouble later on)
 [ N c3 ] , [ d4 ]  I knew that it was a matter of time before Ken would play this.
 [ g4 ]  [ N g1 ]  [ R b d8 ] , [ e x f5 ]  Again an unhealthy obsession with pawns. rxp I nab a free pawn with the queen. Thinking is a luxury I must indulge in at some point.....
 [ N g5 ] , [ O-O ]  Into mate. But he was still lost after 17...[ Q d7 ] 18. e6! or 17...[ Q e7 ] 18. Bh4.
 [ c5 ] , [ e3 ]  Not surprisingly Nathan isn't willing to let me do that which is why he attacks again. This is what I thought that Nathan would do on his previous move as I mentioned. And my response would've still been the same. As I generally protect by going back to the original square where I developed it.
 [ K f2 ]  [ B c3 + ]  [ K g1 ]  [ B d4 + ]  [ K h1 ]  [ R f2 ]  [ R x f2 ]  [ B x f2 ] , [ K g2 ]  ...but manage to survive.
 [ B b4 + ] , [ B c3 ]  Forcing the bishop away from my back line.
 [ h6 ]  [ B x f6 ] , [ Q x f6 ]  Know my pawn trap begins
 [ c x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ] , [ e4 ]  5.[ c x d5 ] [ N x d5 ] 6.e4! ... With this advance white seizes control of the center with gain of time.
 [ e5 ] , [ d6 ]  I believe this is the best response to White's slightly uncommon 2nd move.
 [ c x b3 ]  [ B x h6 ]  [ B x c3 ] , [ b x c3 ]  The passed pawn is a nuisance even dangerous if black had more pieces. Now however it is easy to deal with. Black can create difficulties if he can get the king to c4. Maybe black has a chance to promote if he can reinforce the push with the rook. Although I admit I have no idea how he'd get the rook into play.
 [ c x d5 ] , [ c x d5 ]  QxQ is not bad for me. My bishop would be better on [ c7 ] in fact.
 [ c3 ]  [ N g e7 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ d6 ]  [ O-O ] , [ N e5 ]  white has not exploited the vulnerable Q or the obvious weaknesses to any great extent. Now black has space and options that looked unlikely 3 moves back
 [ K c2 ] , [ e5 ]  The pawn literally accomplishes little where it stands but...
 [ Q e7 ]  [ R a c8 ] , [ Q b7 ]  33. [ Q b7 ] - this loses spectacularly - the plan was to try and shepherd that remote passer to [ a8 ] to become Glenda 2 but now comes my doom!
 [ Q x h4 + ]  [ R h6 ] , [ Q f2 ]  The only square for the queen.(Interestingly enough this was exactly the line that Gameknot gave when it labelled [ Q g7 ] as an inaccuracy)
 [ N b d7 ]  [ N d2 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ R a c1 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ B x d5 ]  [ B x d5 ]  [ c4 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ R c3 ] , [ h6 ]  I thought this was a weak response on my part but the board is completely even at this point...interesting.
 [ b4 ]  [ d4 ] , [ e x d4 ]  You would say white "saw" everyting that is about to happen and decided he could survive the storm.
 [ R x c5 ] , [ d x c5 ]  Also aiming for mirroring pawn structures increase your chances of a draw.
 [ B g4 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ e6 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f d7 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ B x f3 ] , [ Q x f3 ]  Bring my queen into play instead of doubling up of pawns.
 [ e6 ] , [ B b3 ]  White feels [ [ b5 ] ] coming and moves his bishop out of the way. A common played move at this point. The bischop also remains it's aim at the kings side for a later attack. Trying to prevent [ [ b5 ] ] by playing [ a4 ] is not a good option I'd say. It would result in: 7.a4-[ N x e4 ] 8.Nxe4-[ d5 ] 9.bxd5-Qxd5. White has now 2 knights in the centre but no pawns and those knights can be easily chased by playing [ f5 ] somewhere down the line. Black also has an incredible amount of space to move around.
 [ B x e2 ]  [ B x e2 ]  [ Q f6 ]  [ Q d3 ] , [ R x e2 ]  The coup-de-grace utterly isolating the King from my remaining pieces.
 [ Q a4 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ O-O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ d4 ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ B x d4 ]  [ Q h6 + ]  [ K b1 ] , [ N c5 ]  Another attack !
 [ Q c1 ] , [ N g4 + ]  White queen retreats. Black moves Ng4. Now a much better position and checking the King
 [ K g2 ] , [ B h2 ]  and on
 [ b5 ]  [ B b3 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ B e5 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ B f4 ] , [ Q f5 ]  Forcing a transition into the endgame so quickly.
 [ f4 ]  [ B h4 ] , [ B f6 ]  this allows black to protect the pawn on e6. also the bishop won't run away.
 [ B b5 + ]  [ Q x b5 ]  [ R e1 + ] , [ N e7 ]  White should follow up with 17 RxNch.
 [ R b6 + ]  [ K f7 ]  [ K g3 ]  [ R d2 ]  [ R b4 ]  [ R c2 ]  [ R x a4 ]  [ R x b2 ]  [ R a7 + ] , [ K g6 ]  42. ........ [ K g6 ] - and here is the sandwich and Henry is the filling!!!
 [ h x g3 ]  [ h x g3 ] , [ R a2 ]  54.[ h x g3 ] [ h x g3 ] 55.[ R a2 ] ... The only alternative was 55 [ R f3 ] when I had in mind 55…[ R h5 ] 56 [ K g1 ] [ R h2 ] 57 [ K f1 ] [ Q h5 ] 58 [ R d2 ] [ R h1 ] 59 [ K e2 ] [ R g1 ] and White is in serious difficulties.
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ B b4 + ]  This is the Bogo Indian defense.
 [ R x h7 ]  [ K x h7 ]  [ K g5 ] , [ K g7 ]  I just need to get one Pawn through. If I can get my King on the 7th rank I can guard the Queening square of a Pawn.
 [ K d7 ] , [ N x a8 ]  Black resigned. Apparently black concluded that he could capture the knight at [ a8 ] but then lose his knight at [ e5 ] leaving him down by a rook and bishop (and then the pawn at [ f5 ] will certainly fall too) or he could save his own knight but then he his only defense against 27. B[ f5 ] and 28. [ Q x h8 ] is to play 26. ... [ N g3 ] which still loses: 27. [ R a d1 ] [ K c6 ] 28. [ Q b5 # ] or 27. [ Q d5 ] [ K e7 ] (or Ke8) 28. [ R a e1 ] and black's queen falls or 27. [ Q d5 ] [ K c8 ] 28. [ Q x f7 ] [ N e7 ] 29. [ R a e1 ] [ Q c5 ] 30. [ R x e7 ] with too many checkmate threats for black to counter.
 [ N g6 ]  [ e5 ] , [ N g8 ]  [ N e4 ] was impossible due to 6. f5! Then if ...[ N x e5 ] or [ N g4 ] [ Q d4 ] or [ Q g4 ] respectively wins a knight.
 [ Q d2 ]  [ R c8 ]  [ f4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ Q x d4 ] , [ Q a5 ]  This has all been seen before. Normally white will play 0-0-0 here. What Joanne played has been seen before but is probably not as good as the more standard 0-0-0
 [ K h8 ] , [ N g5 ]  Attack starts no plan right now supporting my lsb
 [ N c3 ] , [ N c6 ]  One thing you must been alert on is that nearly every single e-mail chess site has it´s own specific rules for example time controls and allowing/ not allowing external help as game databases computer analysis can be much different from site to site. This site E4EC are not allowing any help at all not even Opening Explorer!
 [ K h8 ]  [ B g6 + ]  [ K g8 ] , [ R h8 + ]  Would you mind coming back to h8?
 [ g4 + ]  [ R x g4 + ] , [ h x g4 + ]  One good fork deserves another.
 [ a x b4 ] , [ R x b4 ]  Both way attack for black.Castle also attack [ Q d8 ] and also threat [ b2 ] pawn for attacking.
 [ N g e7 ] , [ N e2 ]  Just waiting to see what will the other do...
 [ B e2 ] , [ a6 ]  This doesn't accomplish anything at the moment but it was designed as a waiting move I still didnt know what I wanted to do with my LSB and even my knight the a1-[ h8 ] diagonal looks very nice so I wasn't too sure if I wanted to cover it by developing my knight to f6. As well as that I figured blacks going to aim for queenside expansion and this prepares that.
 [ O-O ] , [ a6 ]  This is a typical pawn formation for Black in the Slav Defence. After [ a6 ] comes to protect [ b5 ] the [ c6 ] pawn is ready for the central break move c5.
 [ B x f3 ] , [ N x f3 ]  Attacks my undefended knight
 [ g x f5 ]  [ B x f5 ]  [ N b d2 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ N h4 ]  Luckily I found that the symmetric move for him [ N h5 ] wouldn't be as good for him as for me. He apparently didn't thought the same and played it.
 [ R e f1 ] , [ R h3 + ]  If [ K x g4 ] [ B f4 + + ] followed with stormy checks ending into a mate or loses the bishop.
 [ e5 ] , [ d5 ]  Attacking the knight.
 [ N f3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ] , [ N e4 ]  I didn't like the way that bishop controls so many squares and threatens a check anytime. Since my knight was useless anyway I decided to make his bishop useless too.
 [ K d8 ]  [ R a7 ]  [ R f8 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ B c6 ]  [ N b8 ]  [ B x b6 + ]  [ K c8 ]  [ R c7 + ]  [ K d8 ] , [ B a4 ]  The mate is unpreventable and black is forced to resign.
 [ B x d4 + ] , [ K h1 ]  ? [ K h2 ] is much better since it prevents the eventual checkmate that was inevitable with Kh1.
 [ N x b5 ] , [ Q x e7 ]  Take the Bishop on e7...
 [ O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ d6 ] , [ b4 ]  White had plenty of other good alternatives such as [ N b d2 ] or Bb3. With [ b4 ] white plans a pawn storm on the queen-side to try and create some weaknesses there.
 [ Q d7 ] , [ Q x d7 + ]  He finally goes for a fair trade.
 [ e5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ B b4 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ h6 ]  [ B h4 ] , [ B x c3 + ]  We are still in theory at this stage of the game. My plan is to settle 9K with weak isolated doubled c-pawns. 9k's plan should be to utilize his bishop pair and space advantage to put pressure on my position. With correct play by both sides I think the game should be about equal.
 [ B a2 ] , [ N a4 ]  White's dsb is powerful.
 [ K f1 ] , [ R c8 ]  This was the first move that was new to me. I had previously seen Alternative variation: 19... [ g6 ] [this practically forces the exchange of bishop for knight as otherwise the knight will go to [ h5 ] and then possibly to [ f4 ] from where it will be very well placed. So now] 20. [ B x [ f6 ] ] [ Q a6 + ] $1 [an imporotant intermezzo this allowing black to capture on [ f6 ] with the queen and thereby retain control of the [ h8 ] square.] 21. [ K g2 ] Qx[ f6 ] 22. [ Q a4 ] $1 [and white avoids an endgame that will not be pleasant for him. The game remains in the balance as white will now aim to get his rooks on the open c-file and his queen to d7.]
 [ f x g5 ]  [ R x g5 ]  [ Q h4 ]  [ Q d5 ]  [ R c3 ] , [ K g7 ]  Alternative variation: 35... [ R x h5 ] 36. [ Q g3 + ] [ K h7 ] 37. [ Q b8 ] $11
 [ Q x e4 + ]  [ Q e2 ]  [ Q x e2 + ] , [ N x e2 ]  With an extra pawn I was happy to exchange queens and remove any chance of quick counterplay. After this mass of action both sides will look to develop as quickly as possible.
 [ Q a2 ]  [ B x b7 ]  [ R b8 ]  [ B c3 ] , [ B f8 ]  When I found the necessity to play this (a couple of moves ago) I started to feel really worried. What an ugly position to be up a piece!
 [ N c6 ] , [ Q d3 ]  Too early for the Queen. 8. [ N c3 ] would have been better and PGA liked h3.
 [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ g6 ]  I choose the dragon when my opponent obliges.
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e3 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ B d3 ]  Stonewall attack
 [ K h2 ] , [ R e2 + ]  and now the computer announces Mate in 12.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ N d4 ] , [ N x e5 ]  the initial position in the mini tournament
 [ Q x f3 + ]  [ K g1 ] , [ Q g3 # ]  I liked the pressure I was able to develop after I blundered the pawn. This led to my opponent making some mistakes.
 [ c5 ]  [ B c4 ] , [ e6 ]  Usually a good idea to give the bishop a pawn chain to bite on. Thus white should wait for [ e5 ] to be played prior to [ B c4 ] or till moving the e pawn for black is not a good option in the game.
 [ N d1 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ c3 ]  [ B e5 ] , [ f4 ]  15. [ f4 ] - screens off the enemy dsb's line to [ h2 ] and it retreats to g7.
 [ Q e6 ]  [ K b1 ]  [ N x c3 + ]  [ Q x c3 ] , [ O-O-O ]  In this position however I feel that Gerhard made the right choice by castling Q side. The structure is what you'd typically see if one castled K side. The idea being is that black structure meaning his material is surrounding and protecting his K whereas on the K side there is already a weakness as the pawns providing a lot of coverage for the K. With that I feel that black is now much safer and despite material even black already has an advantage.
 [ b6 ] , [ R a8 ]  I know this pawn is lost.
 [ B b2 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ c x d4 ] , [ B x d4 ]  I would have taken with the knight GK Computer calls it an inaccuracy.
 [ R d8 ]  [ R x e5 ]  [ B x h7 + ]  [ K x h7 ]  [ R x e5 ] , [ K g8 ]  26. ...... [ K g8 ] - well here is the material imbalance I talked about earlier. The game ought to be drawn but strange things can happen.
 [ B f6 ] , [ O-O-O ]  Finally I castle
 [ K f3 ]  [ K f1 ]  [ K e3 ]  [ K g2 ]  [ K f4 ] , [ K g1 ]  I need to keep backing away straight.
 [ N f6 ] , [ B d3 ]  obviously to protect my pawn and to leave opportunity for castling
 [ B c4 ]  [ K b6 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ B c6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ a5 ]  [ b x a5 + ] , [ K x a5 ]  50. ….. [ K x a5 ] - however after getting nowhere we have a pawn trade. I do at least get a passer on the e column but will I be able to push it? We shall see.
 [ N x g3 ] , [ h x g3 ]  Now the [ h4 ] pawn has a target to march on. White cannot stop the black pawn the way black did with a5.
 [ B x e5 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ K x e5 ]  [ R c7 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B c3 + ]  [ K e6 ] , [ B x f6 ]  [ R c6 ] luckily doesn't work because of 40...[ K d5 ] [ R x f6 ] 41. [ R x c6 ]  [ K x f6 ]  [ R x h7 ] , [ K g5 ]  With white's king cut off from the third row he can't really progress any more now.
 [ N f3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ a3 ]  [ h6 ]  [ e3 ]  [ a6 ] , [ Q c2 ]  avoiding the exchange of queen in case the centre gets open while adding a defender to [ c4 ] pawn and to the [ e4 ] square
 [ K x d7 ]  [ R x d1 ]  [ B e7 ] , [ N d5 ]  I am now up a knight. I know i have the game in the bag so i grind him down
 [ c4 ]  [ Q e7 ]  [ Q c3 ] , [ b6 ]  cutting his pawns off
 [ e4 ] , [ N c6 ]  First two moves resembles the Dunst opening.
 [ f x e5 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ d4 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ e5 ]  Knight trapped!
 [ B x e4 ] , [ N x e4 ]  ...all the same.
 [ a3 ] , [ h6 ]  A waiting move on my part. Also allowing myself an escape square. I have lost too many won games by having a Rook mate my King on the back row.... [ a6 ] is a good move here as well but I was curious to see what Jo was about to try. So setup my defense ahead of time.
 [ c6 ] , [ B c8 ]  Black's LSB seem to be blocked (and blocks the a rook as well)
 [ Q f6 ]  [ R f1 ] , [ N g6 ]  Not sure about this plan however I really don't see a way for Black to break through. This will get rid of the bishop pair after the obligatory [ B x f4 ] however my pieces are getting active while that dark-squared bishop looks offsides.
 [ N x c6 ]  [ b x c6 ] , [ Q d4 ]  It seems that black must defend against major threats already.
 [ c6 ]  [ K d2 ] , [ c5 ]  If he captures then I'll recapture and start thinking about pinning again.
 [ Q e1 + ]  [ B e6 ]  [ B x e6 ] , [ N x e6 ]  Traded Bishops
 [ N f3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ d x c4 ]  I think this transposes into Queen's Gambit Accepted territory. Much more comfortable for me.
 [ R x a1 ]  [ Q d4 + ]  [ K h2 ] , [ Q x a1 ]  Now. Now! The game is not won. In order to win I have to be sure to get rid of all white's pawn and I have a B for doing it. How? White has to be sure about his pawn's march will keep black busy and with luck try to snatch some of the black's extra pawn in the process... very hard.
 [ K e2 ] , [ K g2 ]  54. ............... [ K g2 ] - there is no way white can prevent f1/Q. He now throws in the sponge. Although this was an unrated game it was only my third victory against 1600 opposition.
 [ B x g5 ]  [ N e x g5 ] , [ N d8 ]  Ujtumen's forces are in retreat now.
 [ R h g1 ]  [ Q c6 ]  [ h5 ] , [ B e8 ]  24. ..... [ B e8 ] - Fou Leblanc bolsters my [ g6 ] pawn x-ray style but this does not work.
 [ R h8 ] , [ R f h1 ]  no other way for defence
 [ K f8 ]  [ R f1 ]  [ N x c2 ]  [ Q d1 ]  [ N x a1 ] , [ b3 ]  Black can stay ahead with either 12... [ N x b3 ] o 12... Bxc3.
 [ B b7 + ] , [ K g3 ]  To the least interest for me his pieces are still well guarded.
 [ R x c2 ]  [ R x c2 ] , [ K x d6 ]  34. .... [ K x d6 ] - hmm he takes with the king and then retreats it by doing so. But he has an idea up his sleeve and I do not see it until it is too late.
 [ R x d4 ] , [ N c3 ]  With an attack with check on [ e2 ] and an attack on my rook black does not seem to be so bad. For a while I was considering the complications after [ B x b7 ] which was interesting. But I concluded that I wanted to get checkmate if possible as I had a decent plan on the kingside with all those pieces more or less hanging out there. Therefore I chose to focus on the kingside and see what black would do about it.
 [ d x e5 ] , [ d6 ]  0-0-0 was good here as it guards the d pawn or a simple Rd1. Don't think the pawn has a chance by advancing. Best to open up the file by letting black take pxp at [ d5 ] and then taking back with the rook.
 [ K h6 ] , [ Q c1 + ]  Getting the queen into play
 [ Q f5 ] , [ B e2 ]  better might be [ d3 ] to pin my knight to my queen
 [ g x h3 ] , [ Q b6 ]  Twenty moves later the BQ prepares to enter the game for real. The situation is still complex with lots of pieces crammed into the center but now it seems Black has a clear advantage.
 [ c4 ] , [ R d8 ]  Black activates the rook to center.
 [ e5 ] , [ N f3 ]  More of my standard proceedings
 [ b x c3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ R e1 ] , [ B e6 ]  Both side have now finished their development. Although we are fairly equal on points/position in general I like his setup better than mine but there is still a lot of game left to play.
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ a6 ] , [ B a4 ]  Spoiler Alert: 4.Bxc6. Fear not players of the Black pieces as you can spice this variation up too. No risk no reward.
 [ N c6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B f5 ] , [ B d3 ]  Fairly normal development through this point except 5. ... [ B f5 ] which comes into play momentarily
 [ K d6 ] , [ N c4 + ]  This is just stupid. White has Black's knight trapped and useless and he just throws away his own knight.
 [ K x g4 ] , [ R e6 ]  and now I remove my rook from danger and have [ f5 ] free for my knight
 [ e x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ] , [ d x c5 ]  Now my move discovers an attack and wins a pawn.
 [ N f3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ e4 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ B e2 ] , [ B x f3 ]  I don't know why black exchanged because after white play BxB and then [ e5 ] he has good central control and is better developed. Also black gives up his most useful piece. He wasted a tempo playing [ B g4 ] and also his queen at the moment is more of a nuance than a help because it blocks the development of his DSB. Black needs to hit the center with [ f5 ] after Something like [ Q c7 ] [ B b4 ] [ N e7 ] and then [ f5 ]  [ B x f3 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B b4 ] , [ f5 ]  Black's pawn break is taken away from him
 [ N b d7 ]  [ h3 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N g f3 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ d x c5 ]  [ N x c5 ]  [ B c2 ]  [ e5 ]  [ O-O ]  [ b6 ]  [ N b3 ]  [ N x b3 ]  [ B x b3 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ B c2 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ b4 ] , [ R a d8 ]  both missed 15....Ne4! wins the c pawn and unleashes Black's bishops.
 [ Q x a2 ]  [ b5 ] , [ R c2 ]  blunder: [ Q e2 ] was best. Black is sure he can win attacking [ f2 ] but miss to protect his king: white can mate in 11
 [ O-O ]  [ N d2 ]  [ a6 ]  [ b3 ]  [ b6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ d4 ]  [ e4 ]  [ B b4 ] , [ N b1 ]  No use to my night here so i will move it to n[ e7 ]  [ N e7 ]  [ a3 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ b4 ]  [ N g6 ] , [ N h1 ]  I will move my bishop to D7 so i can get rid of his Pawns
 [ K e6 ]  [ R e4 e3 ]  [ h4 ] , [ K c2 ]  at this point it would seem pretty drawish. white has a clear advantage but it is by no means easy to win from this position
 [ Q g2 + ] , [ K e3 ]  only move to stave off mate for one additional move
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ] , [ c4 ]  This is a queens gambit position. If black chooses to defend against it they could pay [ N f6 ] C6 or if they wanted to E6
 [ R x f8 ]  [ c6 ]  [ R x e8 + ]  [ K c7 ] , [ R c8 + ]  And black resigns due to the massive material advantage which white will have after he queens the pawn on e7.
 [ e x f6 ]  [ g x f6 ]  [ R h e1 ]  [ N c7 ]  [ g3 ] , [ O-O-O ]  [ K d7 ] would've have suffice as well :)
 [ K h7 ]  [ Q h5 ] , [ B g5 ]  ! good move. I foolishly dismissed the possibility of this move when playing. Now my position is in danger as he is now threatening g6.
 [ h5 ] , [ R x f7 ]  !!! How is it justified?
 [ d6 ] , [ h3 ]  I do not know why he moved there but 3.[ N f3 ] or 3.[ N c3 ] was best as it develops his Knight.
 [ N c3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ R e1 ]  [ c5 ]  [ b3 ] , [ d5 ]  black's last 2 moves gains him space on the board while simultaneously offering better movement options for his Q and Ns.
 [ N e4 ] , [ B e2 ]  Desperately looking for "something" to warm up the game. I think in sac f2.
 [ h5 ]  [ Q g3 ] , [ B x c3 + ]  Alternatively I might have also played 9.....Nc6; 10. Qc7...[ N a5 ] with advantage to White. As this was early in the exhibition Bobby was taking about three minutes to circle the room.
 [ R h d8 ] , [ O-O-O ]  It's a matter of time now. How would you break into the position?
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ] , [ N d2 ]  Tarrach variation which I like to play.
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ c4 ]  One of my favourite openings. I play it often when I am white.
 [ Q d8 ] , [ R h1 ]  thats why
 [ K d4 ]  [ K g2 ]  [ K x c4 ]  [ b6 ]  [ K d3 ]  [ K f1 ]  [ K d2 ]  [ K f2 ]  [ c4 ]  [ K f3 ]  [ c3 ]  [ K e4 ]  [ c2 ]  [ K d5 ]  [ c1 = Q ] , [ K e5 ]  White Resigns
 [ R c b1 + ] , [ K c3 ]  ! White is cramped and [ b6 ] is just not enough compensation.
 [ B x b8 ]  [ Q c8 ] , [ B g3 ]  [ B d6 ] might have saved things
 [ c x d6 ] , [ h3 ]  And without my bishop this move is safe as it allows the king to flee to [ h2 ] instead of [ f1 ] if i check it.
 [ b4 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ Q g7 ]  [ B f6 ]  [ Q h6 ]  [ N f7 ]  [ Q h3 ]  [ f4 ] , [ g4 ]  much analysis was done here. It came down to a choice between 21 ... [ [ h5 ] ] and 21 ... Ng5. ... [ [ h5 ] ] while possibly not bad is murky. the main analysis involving ... [ N g5 ] is as follows: 22 Qh4?? [ N [ f3 ] + ] wins. On the 22 [ Q h6 ] and 22 [ Q g2 ] lines 22 ... [ f3 ] leads to material gain for black. the main things which had to be worked out were the correct way of recapturing on f3. In terms of tactical details the possibility of [ b x c5 ] for white and [ B x a1 ] for black had to be figured out. In some lines white winds up a rook down. In the line he chose in the game (which was best) he wound up down a piece for two pawns.
 [ B d3 ] , [ B e2 ]  Whit resighned black won and I let go of my breathe. Unrated so the rating did not change but this was all over and I still did not beat sologub.
 [ R d8 ]  [ Q b3 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ Q b5 + ]  Now it's my turn! Take that!
 [ K x d4 ] , [ K f6 ]  (!?) Possibly already Black ought to have been looking to counterattck on the K-side - advancing his pawns...
 [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ d x c5 ]  Not common to accept on [ c5 ] it opens that flank for black to attack and also releases the Bbishop freely
 [ N c6 ] , [ Q h5 ]  Might try and get scholars mate if not I'll take his pawn
 [ B b2 ]  [ R a d8 ]  [ Q c1 ]  [ Q e7 ]  [ Q c2 ]  [ R d c8 ] , [ Q b3 ]  19. [ Q b3 ] - Glenda moves onto the b file putting pressure on b3. Black prepares to double rooks on the c file and I now challenge the c file.
 [ B f2 ]  [ R e d1 ] , [ B d4 ]  Were I playing black I would have moved [ B f5 ] to drop two points instead of three. White's king also wants to advance further into the field. However [ B d4 ] was motivated by black's desire to block open files. White has nothing to move this bishop or advance the c pawn. P[ b4 ] would be answered with b6. So the bishop is slain.
 [ B b7 ]  [ B a3 ] , [ R e8 ]  This move is clearly forced.
 [ O-O ] , [ Q e7 ]  Protects the e pawn to allow the knight to move and post at c5.
 [ O-O ] , [ N b6 ]  I sure didn't like this move. However I was fully committed to the "feature" developed. Note that I have [ B g7 ] poised to support the b-pawn advancement. Furthermore the [ R f8 ] was also ready to connect with the [ R a8 ] as soon [ B c8 ] moves away. Meanwhile I had to deal with Nb6. After a long time thinking I decided to go for a sacrifice and the next 7 moves were calculated in advance. I surprised even myself with this sequence. (I am usually not this creative but this idea of taking advantage of a feature developed tends to open all sorts of secret doors).
 [ B d7 ]  [ N a3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ f3 ]  [ e6 ] , [ N e2 ]  8. [ N e2 ] - we concentrate on getting our pieces out and I combine that with some prophylactic pawn moves.
 [ N g1 ] , [ e5 ]  Advancing his other center pawn whilst achieving a pawn chain.
 [ K d2 ]  [ K f8 ] , [ K e3 ]  24. [ K e3 ] - time Henry took a bit of exercise. As the BR is tied down to [ c8 ] then Henry is free to walk up the board where there are a lot of juicy p(r)awns on display.
 [ O-O ]  [ f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N g e2 ]  [ a5 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ a4 ]  [ h4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N b4 ]  [ O-O-O ]  [ a3 ]  [ b3 ]  [ c5 ]  [ d x c6 ]  [ e ]  [ p ]  [ b x c6 ] , [ B c5 ]  Much stronger then the obvious Qxd6. Its always good to complicate against an opponent with a lower ELO.
 [ Q e7 ]  [ B d4 ] , [ B d6 ]  Oh dear... set himself for a fork here.
 [ R x h1 ]  [ Q x h1 + ]  [ N d1 ] , [ Q x d1 # ]  
 [ R e1 ] , [ R h3 ]  decided the only way to deal with the threatened back file checkmate was to remove material from the board.
 [ O-O-O ] , [ N c4 ]  Takes an aggressive outpost and threatens a fork. Black is getting back in the game.
 [ R x e4 ] , [ c4 ]  So he is putting all his hopes on his passed pawn and measures tempo over material. Alas this doesn't work here.
 [ N x d4 ]  [ h4 ]  [ Q a3 + ]  [ K g8 ] , [ N e8 ]  That move leads to material advantage at last. Now I attack the rook on [ g7 ] and treat to play [ N f6 + ] at the same time.
 [ Q e2 ]  [ f4 ]  [ B h2 ] , [ c5 ]  BxK blocks the center or proposes a pawn exchange ([ e3 ] - d5) that didn't convinced me much... [ c4 ] is a thematic move here. It weakens black's king fortress but opens the black diagonal to the queen or bishop in the future.
 [ N e8 ]  [ R c1 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ B x e5 ]  [ B x e5 ] , [ d x e5 ]  15. ...... [ d x e5 ] - over the last few moves there has been a plethora of exchanges - now black's dark squared bishop is absent Glenda has a sudden deep desire to leap on her broomstick and get there asap.
 [ N d5 ]  [ g3 ] , [ a5 ]  ! Black forces the win.
 [ b6 ]  [ a x b6 ]  [ a6 ]  [ b5 ]  [ a7 ]  [ B x a7 ]  [ K x f6 ]  [ Q e4 ]  [ K g5 ] , [ Q f3 ]  I resign here. All comments welcome
 [ d x e5 ]  [ a4 ]  [ Q d7 ] , [ R e1 ]  Once again trivial moves to try to improve my position before attacking. All these trivial moves pay off at the end.
 [ e4 ] , [ e6 ]  The French.
 [ B e2 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ O-O ] , [ O-O ]  both kings are safe (for now)
 [ K c4 ] , [ N f3 ]  It was only at this point (when I was forced to move the knight away to pursue my original plan) did I realize the knight allowed the queen much better opportunities to corner the king.
 [ Q e4 + ] , [ K d7 ]  Better [ K f6 ] but who can blame him?
 [ B f4 ]  [ d x c4 ]  [ e4 ]  [ b5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B e2 ] , [ B b7 ]  I debated for a long time about this move... I thought about being aggressive with [ Q a5 ] but wasn't sure I liked the way the power would balance after 8. [ N d2 ] Bb4.
 [ B f8 ]  [ R c1 ]  [ Q f6 ] , [ R c d1 ]  Although Black could carry on it would be difficult to even draw this game down so much material.
 [ B f4 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ O-O-O ] , [ a6 ]  ?! Does not do anything to help protect the [ b5 ] square do to the pin on the pawn. But it does create tactics that white has to be careful of. Mainly the unpinning of the pawn and the idea of b5.
 [ K c7 ] , [ d5 ]  If 40.[ Q f8 ] [ R a a8 ] would have held everything for Black.
 [ R b8 ] , [ O-O ]  12. 0-0 - not sure I like the black line-up on the queenside though. It looks as though black intends to go kingside and I now think that Henry will be safer there too.
 [ N e5 ]  [ B x g7 ]  [ K x g7 ] , [ N e3 ]  Controlling the d5-square.
 [ B g7 ]  [ c3 ]  [ O-O ] , [ B e3 ]  I dont know a good place for the Bishop . But played thios so that I can play [ N b d2 ] without blocking the Bishop
 [ h5 ]  [ R b3 ]  [ g5 ]  [ a3 ]  [ h4 ]  [ B b6 ]  [ R a6 ] , [ B d4 ]  Inviting trades which Black must not take of course. This Bishop is headed for [ c1 ] from which to defend [ a3 ] and attack g5.
 [ B x d2 ] , [ Q f6 ]  will he contunue to simplify & make it easier on me?
 [ b3 ] , [ d4 ]  He waltz's right passed.....
 [ h3 ]  [ R x f1 + ]  [ K h2 ]  [ Q x c2 ]  [ Q e7 ]  [ R h1 + ]  [ K g3 ]  [ R d3 + ]  [ f3 ]  [ R x f3 + ]  [ g x f3 ]  [ Q h2 + ]  [ K g4 ]  [ R g1 + ]  [ K h4 ] , [ Q g3 # ]  
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ N c6 ]  The most popular set of opening moves ever played. This opening usually leads to an open game -- or at least has a better chance than 1 P-[ Q4 ] P-Q4.
 [ N x d3 ] , [ B x a1 ]  He chooses to save the pawn and now black is up by a rook. Black's attack has at this point pretty much run out of steam. Time to settle in for the transition to a +rook endgame.
 [ K d2 ] , [ R d e8 ]  Cutting off the White King's route.
 [ N g4 ] , [ B x g4 ]  see right there I already broke that trade policy thing. whatever. move on I'm up a pawn.
 [ N c3 ] , [ B e6 ]  Not my favorite move because bishops like space and are usually best suited to later in the game early on its the knights that you should maneuver.
 [ R d7 ] , [ R f6 ]  After this move however I realize that "To take is a mistake." For if I do that he will mate immediately. In fact I asked myself what I could do and only saw one move which sadly loses. Believe it or not Fred said that I should mark down 25 moves here since it would take at least 9 moves before things would change. But with my next move however it's lights out at once.
 [ Q x d4 ]  [ B x c4 ] , [ Q e4 ]  And it is all over. Black is going to capture on [ c4 ] and with an extra piece coupled with a weak White king the result is not in doubt. 0-1
 [ R e1 ]  [ b5 ]  [ N d2 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ b3 ] , [ N h6 ]  time to bring in more material...
 [ h6 ] , [ B e3 ]  11. [ B e3 ] is consistent with the blockade of the [ d5 ] pawn. White is tightening his grip on [ d4 ] square.
 [ B h3 ]  [ N e1 ]  [ R e2 ] , [ R x c6 ]  Alternative variation: 36. [ B x c5 ] [no es de mucha ayuda] [ R x e1 + ] 37. [ K f2 ] [ R h1 ] 38. [ R x c6 ] [ b3 ] (38... [ R x h2 + ] 39. [ K e3 ] $19) 39. [ R x f6 ] [ b2 ] (39... [ R x h2 + ] $6 [ es mucho peor] 40. [ K e3 ] $19) 40. [ R f8 + ] [ K g7 ] $19
 [ B x c6 ]  [ d x c6 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ B x e7 ]  [ Q x e7 ]  [ d x e4 ] , [ Q x e5 ]  This set of sacrifices does isolate each sides pawns
 [ a4 ]  [ f5 ]  [ e x f6 ]  [ e ] , [ p ]  a good opportunity to expose the Black King...
 [ c3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ h4 ]  [ f5 ]  [ e5 ]  [ h6 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ g5 ]  [ h x g5 ]  [ h x g5 ]  [ g3 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ c4 ]  [ N d b4 ]  [ a3 ]  [ N a6 ]  [ O-O-O ]  [ N c5 ]  [ Q c2 ]  [ d5 ] , [ b4 ]  Alot better was 22. [ c x d5 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ c x d5 ] , [ e x d5 ]  23... Nxg3? is alot worse as he would give up both Knights for a Rook.
 [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ N c3 ]  Standard moves. I was considering the 3 main options ( [ g6 ] [ a6 ] and e6) I didn't want to play the Dragon because I don't play it frequently.
 [ R b8 ]  [ a3 ] , [ d6 ]  Inaccuracy: +1.92 » … [ d6 ] 16.O-O-O [ N a5 ] 17.[ K c2 ] [ e5 ] 18.[ B g5 ] [ f6 ] 19.[ N x c8 ] [ R x c8 ] 20.[ B e3 ] [ f5 ] 21.[ Q [ d5 ] + ] [ K h8 ] 22.cx[ d6 ] [ f x e4 ] 23.[ f x e4 ] Best: +1.09 » … [ d5 ] 16.ex[ d5 ] [ B x c3 ] 17.[ Q x c3 ] ex[ d5 ] 18.O-O-O N[ f6 ] 19.[ B h6 ] [ d4 ] 20.[ B x f8 ] [ d x c3 ] 21.[ R x d8 ] [ c x b2 + ] 22.[ K x b2 ] [ N x d8 ]  [ f5 ] , [ R d1 ]  17.[ B h6 ] not sure...chose [ R d1 ] which I had wanted anyway
 [ d5 ] , [ B d3 ]  3. Bd3?! - blocking in the [ [ d3 ] ] pawn - although it develops a piece it indirectly blocks in the other bishop. I think [ [ d3 ] ] was better here.
 [ N d6 ] , [ Q e3 ]  My plan was to trade out queens.
 [ e x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ] , [ N x d5 ]  Notice That Black Cannot Take Because his Knight Is Pinned!!!!
 [ B e7 ] , [ B x e7 ]  I don't like this choice by White to trade off his only active piece. Perhaps 10.[ B e3 ] would be better threatening 11.d5.
 [ B x d4 ]  [ B x d4 ] , [ Q x d4 ]  Deciding to switch gears at this point I determine to control the long diagonal. The best way to acomplish this is to force my opponent to respond to MY moves and plant my Q on c6. I plan to use the Q to control this diagonal due to her flexibility. White's K-side pawn structure is the ideal environment for black's remaining B.
 [ K g3 ] , [ h4 + ]  One Pawn advances further.
 [ B b5 ]  [ R x d4 ]  [ B x f1 ]  [ R x f1 ]  [ B x c5 ]  [ b x c5 ]  [ Q x c5 ]  [ R f d1 ] , [ R d8 ]  I've now got a simple path to victory. Force a rook tradeoff and get my queen to [ c2 ] where white can't adequately deal with the checkmate threat on g2.
 [ e6 ] , [ f5 ]  "Chess for cavemen" as Julian Hodgson would say. Quite discredited in opening theory (unfairly I feel). Wischess20 plays the book refutation (..[ N g e7 ] ..d5)
 [ N f3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ g3 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ B g2 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ R e8 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ Q c8 ]  [ Q c2 ]  [ B h3 ]  [ R a d1 ]  [ B x g2 ]  [ K x g2 ]  [ e5 ]  [ e4 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N b4 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ N x a2 ]  [ N x a2 ] , [ N x e4 ]  The sacrifice didn't look anywhere near sound but it did look interesting.
 [ N x e4 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ N c4 ]  [ h6 ]  [ d3 ] , [ K b8 ]  Black's King has "castled."
 [ e5 ]  [ c3 ] , [ f6 ]  25. ..... f6? This loses a pawn due to the pin on the [ d4 ] pawn.
 [ N e2 ]  [ b5 ] , [ K g1 ]  repositioning my pieces
 [ N x e5 ] , [ B x e5 ]  a rook fer a knight bt i still hve a 2 pawn advantage-:)
 [ Q x b6 ]  [ N x b6 ] , [ B g5 ]  In this position I threaten to force an exchange by capturing his rook with my bishop ([ B x e8 ] followed by Rxe8.) I was trying to fix my mistakes but was not successful in doing so.
 [ b5 ]  [ c x b5 ] , [ c x b5 ]  White wants to stay close to [ b5 ] so I must force him to leave
 [ R e1 ]  [ R x e1 + ] , [ Q x e1 ]  30. [ Q x e1 ] - after this queen trade I offer a draw which Xeno declines. Over the next few moves he gives me the reason why he declined.
 [ Q x a4 ] , [ B x a4 ]  Now the black knight on [ e8 ] is threatened so black cannot capture on b2.
 [ N d f6 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ d x e4 ] , [ B x e4 ]  giving up the bishop pair for a pawn and a strong pawn majority on the centre of the board
 [ R b8 ] , [ B f4 ]  12. n[ c5 ] was also a contender of course. I thought the best response would be [ e6 ] whereupon I have a number of options. I considered n[ c d7 ] rook somewhere then n[ x f8 ] to take away black's castling rights...but decided that black might be safer with the king in the centre (I have no pawn break really whereas he has [ h5 ] to release his rook). I wasn't sure how best to exploit the positional advantage I have so decided upon Bf5. It makes the rook uncomfortable (although I'm not sure whether it's forced to move immediately or not) develops an important piece while [ b2 ] is still protected and gives me another defender on the kingside which could open up at any time with h5.
 [ N x f2 ] , [ Q e2 ]  Now that he played the fork I had to play [ Q e2 ] in order to avoid loosing my queen.
 [ h x g3 ]  [ R x h8 ]  [ R x h8 ] , [ N a2 ]  I have no idea of the purpose of this move but I'm happy to take the queen
 [ N c3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ B x d3 ]  [ Q x d3 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ B d2 ]  [ O-O ] , [ O-O-O ]  This unbalanced position could become dangerous for either castled K.
 [ N c5 ] , [ R d c1 ]  white sets up trade of rooks. White is up 8 this is a good move by white!
 [ e5 ] , [ B e3 ]  there is no doubt that [ B g5 ] [ N f6 ] [ B c4 ] (threatening [ B x f7 ] followed by [ Q d5 ] at some point) [ Q a5 + ] [ N d2 ] is much stronger but Morphy is weaving an intricate trap involving Nb1-c3-[ N d5 ] to break open c7; so he needs [ N b1 ] for another exhibition...
 [ d x c4 ] , [ Q x c4 ]  White has 2 connected passed pawns for the piece but the a-pawn is isolated and I have superior piece placement and the bishop pair.
 [ N g4 ] , [ B x f4 ]  There is some danger here to black. The knight can move and give check and the [ g7 ] pawn will be pinned and unable to capture. But black's bishops and queen cover all the danger areas and white cannot press the attack through to a checkmate. So black gains a pawn while simultaneously bringing his second bishop into the defense in case it becomes necessary or at least making sure white cannot bring his bishop into the attack.
 [ Q c7 ]  [ a4 ] , [ R a6 ]  Well he's begging for it...
 [ f x g5 ]  [ f x g5 ]  [ K a5 ]  [ K e5 ]  [ K x a6 ]  [ K x e4 ]  [ K b5 ]  [ K f4 ]  [ K c4 ]  [ K x g4 ]  [ K d3 ]  [ K f3 ]  [ K d2 ] , [ K f2 ]  
 [ g4 ]  [ Q g3 + ]  [ N f2 ]  [ N f4 ]  [ e3 ]  [ N g2 + ]  [ B x g2 ]  [ Q x g2 ]  [ Q e2 ]  [ Q g3 ]  [ N d2 ] , [ c5 ]  Since I know where White's King is going it makes sense to begin opening lines on the Q-side. The position of Black's Q of course may become precarious but for the moment there's no danger. For example 15. [ d c5 ] [ N c6 ] 16. [ f4 ] [ d4 ] will clear an escape route before White can trap the Lady.
 [ d4 + ] , [ c x d4 + ]  40. ... [ e x d4 + ] 41. [ K e4 ] and white loses the Rook and the game.
 [ B d1 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ R f2 ] , [ R e7 e6 ]  Considering [ R g6 ] and starting to pressure the kingside.
 [ N x d8 ] , [ R x d8 ]  I'm down the exchange but my pieces are a little more active. I'll have to make very good use of my mobility to force White to make more threats than White can respond to.
 [ R f2 + ]  [ K g6 ]  [ R f3 ]  [ Q d6 ]  [ N b3 ] , [ Q x a3 ]  victory is close...
 [ Q e5 ] , [ R a6 ]  White had to move but had nothing constructive. This move retains the control of the a-pawn and cedes nothing else.
 [ Q c7 ] , [ N d6 ]  also [ d6 ] is a great place for the knight.
 [ B e6 ]  [ g5 + ] , [ K f7 ]  44. ...... [ K f7 ] - the only way to immediately avoid losing her knight.
 [ Q c7 ] , [ a5 ]  I then do [ a5 ] a move too late but black already has such an advantage. I only give myself a half question mark here (?!) as that move was still not the best of moves.
 [ N c3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ B e3 ] , [ a6 ]  Blocking both the horses from [ b5 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N e5 ] , [ h3 ]  Hey the game looks pretty symmetrical
 [ a6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ h4 ]  [ e4 ]  [ B x g7 ]  [ K x g7 ]  [ h5 ]  [ N f5 ]  [ h x g6 ] , [ f x g6 ]  White is getting no grip on the Black position...
 [ Q d6 + ]  [ Q x d6 ]  [ R x d6 ]  [ f2 ]  [ R d1 ]  [ K g2 ]  [ g x f5 ]  [ f1 = Q ]  [ R x f1 ]  [ K x f1 ] , [ K d2 ]  It won't help. Black's cleric is on the perfect diagonal: it holds *everything.*
 [ R x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ K f5 ] , [ K e3 ]  At this point we ran into time trouble and were not able to keep proper notation. The next phase of the game consisted of pawn pushes that left ended up with White promoting on [ b8 ] at the same time that black promoted on [ g1 ] with a white pawns remaining on [ [ h4 ] ] and [ d5 ] and black pawns on [ d6 ] and h5. Black was in better position with his queen so he forced a queen trade then captured the white pawn on [ [ h4 ] ] and was able to promote his [ h5 ] pawn and then ended with a White resignation. This was a difficult endgame position.
 [ h x g4 ] , [ h x g4 ]  The white king no longer has any defense.
 [ h6 ]  [ B x f6 ] , [ B x f6 ]  two Bishops vs. two Knights. almost always a great advantage.
 [ d5 ] , [ e4 ]  Contesting for the center from the very start.
 [ K h8 ] , [ B x h6 ]  2nd Kablam! Now the bishop is joining the attack. If black takes one of the pieces with the pawn checkmate will follow. Victory is close!
 [ N e5 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ f6 ] , [ B d5 ]  Threatening [ R g8 + ]  [ h5 ] , [ c4 ]  I start my own pawn advance
 [ b x c3 ] , [ N x c3 ]  now if the white knight was on [ e5 ] (like at move 24) he could take on [ c6 ] with the queen
 [ h4 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ g5 ]  And this is a blunder! I did not see it but I'm sure you will find out.
 [ K h8 ] , [ N f5 ]  Threatening [ B x g7 + ]  [ N x d4 ] , [ R d2 ]  Double Rooks will lead to mate... but alas
 [ K c6 ] , [ R a1 ]  I indirectly protect the [ g6 ] pawn. If 52. Rxg6?? [ R a6 + ] wins.
 [ Q e6 ] , [ f4 ]  now 2 pawns very strong are going to treasure land...
 [ K e3 ]  [ R g1 ]  [ B h3 ]  [ R e1 + ]  [ K f4 ] , [ B d1 ]  Fischer attempts to squeeze out a win that isn't there.
 [ B x d4 ]  [ R x d4 ]  [ N e4 ] , [ R x d3 ]  Despite the error a few moves back Black still has a bit of a chance thanks to his powerful Rooks.
 [ a4 ] , [ d4 ]  i decide to protect my d pawn in anticipation to his [ b5 ] in case i decide to swap out rooks
 [ K b7 ]  [ R a5 ]  [ R d a8 ]  [ R g a1 ]  [ R x a5 ] , [ R x a5 ]  All these were forced movies
 [ B x c4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ O-O ] , [ N f6 ]  Developing and challenging the center.
 [ N b5 ]  [ K d8 ]  [ N b d4 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ Q x e5 + ]  [ Q x e5 ] , [ d x e5 ]  Long trading sequence after which black is better (in this situation a bishop is better than a knight and black is one pawn ahead)
 [ R x f7 + ]  [ K g8 ] , [ Q x g7 # ]  
 [ e5 ] , [ c3 ]  With the idea of keeping the queen safe from the rook after the capture.
 [ N c3 ]  [ B g7 ] , [ e4 ]  White has chosen a very aggressive opening. Black can now play [ d6 ] but I decided to delay showing my hand as long as possible.
 [ N f3 ] , [ N c6 ]  3. ….. [ N c6 ] - development first!
 [ N x d4 ] , [ B b4 + ]  Not the best choice.
 [ N e5 + ] , [ K f5 ]  Again the wrong square for the king. 15...[ K h5 ] (16. [ g4 + ] Kh6) was the only move that survives for any length of time. If 15...[ K h6 ] then 16. N[ g4 + ] and if 15...[ K g5 ] then 16. [ h4 + ] [ K h5 ] 17. [ g4 + ] [ K h6 ] 18. g5+. As it is Black is now fresh out of chances.
 [ B e7 ]  [ R a7 ] , [ R b8 ]  the best move as 20....[ B a8 ] loses to 21.[ N c7 ] and bishop dies.
 [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ g6 ] , [ f4 ]  4. [ f4 ] - Austrian attack.
 [ K a3 ]  [ N c5 ]  [ K a2 ]  [ K d3 ]  [ K b2 ] , [ K d2 ]  Cornering with a knight takes time and practice to do effectively and maneuvering must be precise. Opposition is the main idea of pushing the enemy king back (being two horizontal or vertical squares away from the defending king is the strongest)
 [ c4 ] , [ Q x f5 ]  Yes... He has to.. as the only way to avoid mate.. Sacrifice his QUEEN...
 [ h4 ]  [ h3 ]  [ K d7 ]  [ f4 ]  [ g4 ] , [ h x g4 ]  My plan was ...[ f x g4 ] and White has three connected passed pawns against Blacks two. White have then the possibility to block Blacks two passed pawns with his King!
 [ K e2 ]  [ Q x g4 + ]  [ N f3 ]  [ Q e4 + ]  [ K f2 ] , [ N x b4 ]  I've regained material equality I looked at [ B c5 + ] but he can defend with d4.
 [ R b1 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ c7 ] , [ N x c7 ]  46. ...... [ N x [ c7 ] ] - now Paul's [ c7 ] passer disappears!
 [ B d2 ]  [ Q d7 ]  [ R e1 ] , [ N g6 ]  My opponent missed the combination and next move my queen miraculously covers the bishop on g4! Ideas that should have been running around in my opponents head are [ b4 ] and [ h3 ] to push those nice bishops back to their own battle lines.
 [ N d7 ] , [ a3 ]  not necessary at all.
 [ g x f4 ]  [ e x f4 + ]  [ R e6 ] , [ R h1 ]  
 [ c5 ]  [ N c4 ]  [ Q c1 ]  [ d x c5 ] , [ f3 ]  white is in no hurry to capture back on [ c5 ] which would create doubled isolated pawns on the c file. It's more important to attack the pawn on e4.
 [ R x h2 ] , [ R d6 ]  But before advancing my [ a4 ] further I decide to pin his [ f6 ] first.
 [ R a7 ] , [ a4 ]  There was nothing better?
 [ R e6 ] , [ R d1 ]  Threatening mate once the bishop moves
 [ N d7 ] , [ f4 ]  Trying to block in the B.
 [ R f d1 ] , [ c5 ]  Still taking advantage from the pin (white underestimated the dangers of his Q's position) threatening to transform a strong mobile center in an isolated pawn or... a closed center.
 [ O-O ] , [ N c6 ]  Black is trying hard to catch up with development now.
 [ N f4 ] , [ B c4 ]  There is no time for this. [ K h7 ] was the only proper move
 [ e6 ] , [ h3 ]  Attempts to drive the bishop off of g4.
 [ f x g4 ] , [ f4 ]  I feel this is a really good move. It prepares my counterattack in the middle. I am not worried about the passed pawn that is about to form on the right because of my control over the a7-[ g1 ] diagonal.
 [ N c3 ]  [ N g f6 ]  [ B f4 ] , [ d x c4 ]  Here Stockfish 8 gives 6. [ e3 ] [ a6 ] 7. [ B x c4 ] [ b5 ] 8. [ B b3 ] [ B d6 ] 9. [ N e5 ] [ B b7 ] 10. O-O O-O 11. [ R c1 ] with a slight advantage.
 [ K c2 ]  [ R d5 ] , [ b3 ]  Unfortunateli my opponent lost because of the timer... Are black winning here?
 [ b x a5 ] , [ B a6 ]  Just gets WHite's rook where it should have been anyway.
 [ R x c8 ]  [ B d5 + ]  [ K f8 ]  [ h x g4 ] , [ Q x g4 ]  White still has some nice game though....
 [ N f3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ d4 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ e6 ] , [ h3 ]  Everything up to here has been fairly standard. I attack the bishop to relieve the pin.
 [ Q d2 ] , [ R h1 ]  Alternative variation: 57. [ g7 ] [ Q x d7 ] 58. [ K e2 ] $19
 [ R c1 ] , [ R a d8 ]  Making final preparations...
 [ Q g4 ] , [ b5 ]  and he finally starts his counter play. Again I looked at the sacrifices on [ g6 ] and h7. At the time I didn't think they worked and then a move or two later when it was too late I realised they did! See http://gameknot.com/chess-puzzle.pl?pz=33318
 [ Q x b7 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ Q x c7 ]  [ R a c8 ]  [ Q x a7 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ B b3 ] , [ B g6 ]  Before attacking the white King I must protect my fragile [ f7 ] square.
 [ N b4 ] , [ d x e6 ]  He did not have much choice
 [ N a6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B e2 ]  [ d6 ] , [ O-O ]  same side castleing if i were white i would have tried to castle queen case if his attack fails my defense can over power him.
 [ K h8 ]  [ Q b1 ] , [ g6 ]  Trapping the bishop. The gameknot analysis prefers this over the meek concession of the h-pawn.
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ g6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ d5 ]  Entering the Grunfeld Defense. More suiting my style of late is 3.[ N f3 ] making sure Black gets in the King's Indian Defense.
 [ K g8 ] , [ Q h7 # ]  Black's king moves over to [ g8 ] his only square and white finishes the job with checkmate on h7.
 [ N g6 ]  [ R g8 ]  [ N x f8 ]  [ R x f8 ] , [ B c4 ]  [ e6 ] is weak. So white develops. This lets white get his king out of the center of the board when black cannot set up batteries and generally exploit the fact that three of blacks pieces are doing almost nothing.
 [ B x e7 ]  [ Q x e7 ] , [ O-O-O ]  white can also try [ h3 ] or Bd3.
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ] , [ c4 ]  Accept gambit pawn or not against a stronger player? Accept to resist a blocked position.
 [ Q x g4 ] , [ g6 ]  What is it's purpose?
 [ b x c3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B d6 ] , [ h3 ]  This looks like a wasted move. "Every tempi counts!" Jack Peters would say. Black had no threat to occupy g4.
 [ B x a6 ]  [ R x a6 ]  [ Q d3 ]  [ b5 ]  [ N b d2 ]  [ N g6 ] , [ h4 ]  giving Black not an inch to move...
 [ a x b3 ]  [ B x b3 ] , [ N x e4 ]  18. ...... [ N x [ e4 ] ] - in fact I net a whole piece because I noticed that the [ e4 ] pawn was en prise as a result of that bishop move to e3.
 [ K f3 ]  [ K f8 ]  [ K e4 ]  [ K e7 ] , [ R f2 ]  Here we played it out...But moves 39 are wrong I believe. White developed a passer on the c-file and h-files but they were both guarded. We exchange rooks somewhere. And I had a pawn dual Pawn-[ e5 ] & Pawn-[ f5 ] that I kept intact and didn't dare move them. I won his Pawn-[ f4 ] somehow. I offered a draw but white refused. And we played 'til White and I calculated he couldn't promote his passers on [ c7 ] and h4/[ h5 ] not sure which square it was on. opposite colored bishops. The pawn dual acted as buffer and prevented White from infiltrating. To me it reduced a lot of calculating.
 [ b6 ] , [ R c1 ]  An immediate Nxe6!! is good but that can wait...
 [ B x e5 ] , [ O-O ]  0-0-0 seems more dangerous because the Q-side pawns can easily be exchanged. But my king is almost alone.
 [ Q f8 ] , [ f4 ]  And white thinks he has shut down my attack. Well... we'll see here in a bit. I have an idea but don't know if I have time to do it. And white can easily force my rook from f5...
 [ K h2 ] , [ f5 ]  Desperately seeking for an attack.
 [ B d3 ]  [ B g7 ] , [ B e3 ]  The natural developing move [ N f3 ] is slightly better.
 [ N c b4 ] , [ d4 ]  another sacrifice allowing black the choice between the c and d pawns or the rook. Black jumps into the trap.
 [ N d4 + ]  [ K d3 ] , [ Q x g4 ]  and now the game is firmly in black's pocket.
 [ a3 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N e2 ]  [ b6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B b7 ] , [ B b2 ]  Finally my development is complete. I got all my pieces where I want them to be. At this point of the game I knew there should be no reason why I can't win this game. The knight on [ a6 ] does not belong there at all. Knights belong in the middle of the board. By the time he gets it into action I would've been looking for checkmate
 [ c6 ]  [ Q b3 ]  [ b6 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ d x c6 ]  [ B e6 ] , [ Q b5 ]  Sets up for a discovered check. I'm in a bit of a bind here.
 [ c x b5 ]  [ a x b5 ]  [ B x b5 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B b4 ] , [ B d3 ]  It seems that 7.[ f3 ] or 7.[ Q e2 ] have been preferred here with reasonable success.
 [ R d8 ]  [ B f6 ]  [ R d6 ]  [ B e5 ] , [ R d7 ]  But this is where it all happens. Of course Tom prevents future attacks against his R for now. However he can no longer delay the amount of time it'll take to win his [ d5 ] pawn at once.
 [ Q c2 ] , [ B e4 ]  24. ...... [ B e4 ] - Steve has seen the threat and moves his queen. I now decide to improve the position of Fou Leblanc.
 [ N f6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ Q x d4 ] , [ N c6 ]  4. ....... [ N c6 ] - and this becomes like the Centre Game but with the e pawn on [ e2 ] and not e4. I decide to develop a piece. Freddy chooses to tuck his queen that Wicked Witch of the West onto f2. You will see why as the game develops.
 [ e4 ] , [ c5 ]  Apparently 1.[ e4 ] results in the most wins for white but the Sicilian Defence result in most games being won by black. For black it asserts control over the d4-square and begins the fight for the centre of the board.
 [ Q b6 ]  [ b3 ] , [ B b4 ]  Pins my knight.
 [ R f7 ]  [ R c5 ]  [ Q d6 ] , [ N e5 ]  Looking to exchange off another piece.
 [ N x d4 ] , [ O-O ]  A very good move that tucks the king away to a safer location.
 [ N g5 + ]  [ K g6 ] , [ N d e4 ]  [ N c4 ] was needed here to preserve e-pawn
 [ d4 ] , [ N f6 ]  Symmetrical position
 [ g6 ] , [ g4 ]  To attack the knight but I don't really understand this.
 [ B f4 ]  [ R c6 ] , [ R d3 ]  White switches from attacking the Pawn to attacking the King.
 [ c6 ]  [ N g e2 ]  [ N b8 d7 ]  [ d5 ] , [ c x d5 ]  10. ....... [ c x d5 ] - this trade and the following trades give a clear advantage to white sigh.
 [ N a3 ] , [ Q b4 + ]  Black offers a chance for White to win yet more material but at terrific cost: 15.[ c3 ] Nxc3! 16.[ Q h8 + ] [ K f7 ] 17.[ Q x a8 ] N[ c x e2 + ] 18.[ K f1 ] [ B d3 ] or else give up his material edge in the hopes of diffusing Black's attack: 16.bx[ c3 ] [ Q x c3 + ] 17.[ K d1 ] (17.Qf1?? is mate in three) ...[ Q x a1 + ] 18.[ K d2 ] [ Q x a2 + ] etc.
 [ B f5 ] , [ R e3 ]  Offering the rook exchange.
 [ f5 ]  [ B f3 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ R f d1 ]  Now if Black's bishop moves I still have the tactical threat of [ R x d7 ] [ N x d7 ] Bxb7.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ f4 ]  [ e x f4 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ g5 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ g4 ]  [ O-O ]  [ g x f3 ]  [ Q x f3 ] , [ Q f6 ]  This is the start-posistion of the crazy mini-turnament called Muzio-Championship I.
 [ B a3 ] , [ N x a3 + ]  White's move (18. Ba3?) wasn't the defense I had expected. The bishop is guarded by a pinned pawn so it isn't really guarded at all. Now white loses his bishop and the [ b2 ] pawn is soon to follow. White has had enough.
 [ K x g4 ] , [ Q h5 # ]  Mate. I've always liked piece-sac mates. I admit this wasn't much of a game though... but interesting to analyze as I am not so great at fast attacks.
 [ R e8 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ R x e5 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ R h5 ]  This odd-looking rook maneuver eventually leads to White's demise.
 [ Q x e4 ]  [ B d5 ] , [ Q g4 ]  Better [ Q f5 ] after which [ e4 ] is not correct becasue of Nc3.
 [ B x f7 ] , [ K x f7 ]  I needed to trade bishops to avoid his two move mate he tried to set up earlier.
 [ e5 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ N e4 + ]  [ K d4 ] , [ e6 ]  Perhaps the white shouldn't have rushed into advancing his pawn with the rest and his king staying in the back...
 [ R x g6 + ]  [ K h2 ]  [ R e g8 ]  [ f4 ]  [ Q a7 ] , [ b x a5 ]  This move is foolish and is the result of not calculating (laziness). Simpler is [ b5 ] trapping the Queen in the corner and freeing my queen to move around and maybe pick up a rook or two.
 [ c x b3 ]  [ a x b3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B a3 ]  [ Q b6 ]  [ N c4 ] , [ B x c4 ]  8. ... [ c x b3 ] 9.[ a x b3 ] [ N f6 ] 10.[ B a3 ] [ Q b6 ] 11.[ N c4 ] Bxc4?! This move gives me some hope. 9K should retreat with 11…[ Q c7 ] planning on finishing development with …[ B d5 ] followed by …e6.
 [ B x d7 ]  [ B g5 ] , [ Q c2 ]  threatening mate on h2. The game is over now.
 [ B e4 ]  [ R d8 ] , [ Q e2 ]  Wisely removing the Queen from my Rook's vision.
 [ Q g2 ]  [ Q d6 ] , [ K h1 ]  21. [ K h1 ] - to make room for a rook to come to [ g1 ] and I will then have to pay attention as Old Matey will be eyeing up g7.
 [ N x f6 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ c x d4 ] , [ N x d4 ]  centralising knight
 [ Q g3 ]  [ N e7 ]  [ B c1 ]  [ Q x g3 + ]  [ h x g3 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ c x d5 ] , [ R f d8 ]  And now we're up three pawns
 [ R e3 ]  [ B x d1 ]  [ Q x d1 ]  [ B x c3 ]  [ R e2 ] , [ R c d8 ]  Alternative variation: [Better was] 27... [ R e d8 ]  [ Q x g3 + ]  [ B g2 ]  [ B b6 ]  [ K f1 ]  [ Q f4 ] , [ Q d1 ]  I missed a mate in two and played but anyway it was over (mate in another 6-7 moves)
 [ d x e5 ] , [ N c6 ]  At first I was going to tell her that this is a mistake. But I looked and realized that she can take back. And as noted until it can be proven to be an error I won't say anything because the idea is still the same of making sure that the student gets the correct information. The only problem is that she did get the wrong info here because I forgot to count who's ahead behind the point value. Had this been calculated more carefully I would've realized that she lost a pawn. When she takes back it appears even but 5.[ e x d6 ] is +2 as opposed to +1. This is where the calculation was faulty.
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ B b5 ]  I opened the game with my favorite Ruy Lopez opening...
 [ Q h3 ]  [ B c8 ]  [ Q f3 ] , [ B g4 ]  ..or be threatened I suppose. This was a well-executed re-positioning of the Bishop by Black but I don't think it needed to be done. The Bishop was strong on b7.
 [ Q a1 + ]  [ K g2 ]  [ Q x a2 ]  [ Q x b7 ] , [ Q d2 ]  I allow Carl to take here. As I thought that after 30.[ Q x a7 ] [ d5 ] the only way for Carl to protect his B was by moving it in a passive square. So with 30...Bf1. I also thought about trying to promote my d pawn after retreating to f1. Then I looked at the time of how much we had. I was down to about 20 at that point but he had 44 minutes. And I was down to 20 minutes at that point. First even if I wasn't low on time promoting might in general lead to stalemate with what I had. Second I'd probably lose on time if I focused on that since it takes me about 15-20 minutes to force a win afterwards.
 [ R f d2 ]  [ B b7 ] , [ b3 ]  White plays too slowly and allows black to get a slightly worse position.
 [ N f4 ] , [ N x f2 ]  A risky sacrifice. It does expose my King but I don't think Black has a good enough development to exploit this.
 [ e4 ] , [ c5 ]  I am playing with Black against a stronger player. As usual I play the Sicilian Defence.
 [ e6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ Q e2 + ]  [ B e6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ f4 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N f3 ] , [ B b4 ]  All fairly standard no fireworks so far.
 [ B g7 ]  [ N g e2 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ N b d7 ] , [ h3 ]  I was a little surprised at this move [ N g4 ] isn't really a threat and [ h3 ] just seems to be a pawn weakening move.
 [ B d7 ]  [ Q x h7 + ]  [ K f7 ] , [ B h5 + ]  Now Black resigns.
 [ B b4 ]  [ B d3 ] , [ c5 ]  Part of the Nimzo Attack on White Queen Open is to park the black bishop with a pawn even though it opposes [ d4 ] white pawn; but after examination of the board you can see why the Nimzo Attack is much better than a simple fiancheto in the corner. I hate fiancheto's and rarely resort to them unless I feel so threatened I have to open with one in some corner of the center of the board.
 [ N x f5 ] , [ B c5 ]  I capture [ f5 ] pawn with my knight and black moves his DBfrom [ d4 ] to c5. Also the DB is now attacking my rook at a3.
 [ R d8 ]  [ R f6 ]  [ K c7 ] , [ K d4 ]  ?? This doesn't lose but the question marks are for bad form. When you've got your man (or woman) in a noose you don't go take a walk around the block. You end it cleanly and put him/her out of his misery. White should just play the crushing move [ R x h6 ] ( or [ R f7 + ] -> Kc6) promote the h-pawn and checkmate already. Should take 10 moves tops. This is a waste of time which can be fatal in a blitz game and is just clumsy and rude in general.
 [ N e5 ] , [ B d6 ]  Moving the bishop out of the way and adds a third attacker on the knight.
 [ Q c2 ] , [ R e4 ]  I'm planning [ R h4 ] then Qh3...
 [ f4 ] , [ N x g3 ]  ?? The computer attempts to swindle and tries a cheap tactic. If [ Q x g3 ] ?? then ...[ B h4 ] ! wins for black.
 [ e5 ] , [ b5 ]  Black has won the opening...
 [ K x d1 ]  [ N c8 ]  [ K e2 ]  [ N d6 ]  [ K e3 ]  [ N c4 + ]  [ B x c4 ]  [ b x c4 ]  [ N g7 ]  [ R h8 ]  [ N e6 ]  [ K c6 ]  [ K d4 ]  [ K d6 ]  [ N c5 ]  [ K x c7 ] , [ N x a6 + ]  At this point I'd decided to try and force her pawns off and see what she could do with rook vs knight and pawns.
 [ R a7 ]  [ R h8 + ]  [ K e7 ]  [ R h7 + ] , [ K f6 ]  White's out of options now.
 [ Q e4 + ] , [ K g1 ]  This the luck I wanted -- I really thought he would go to h3. ([ K f1 ] allows Qh1#.)
 [ Q g8 ] , [ Q x g8 ]  I will have two connected pawns on open files.
 [ K x d6 ]  [ K e3 ]  [ B d4 + ]  [ K f3 ]  [ K e5 ]  [ B c6 ]  [ R a3 + ]  [ K g2 ]  [ K f4 ] , [ e5 ]  Nothing is protecting P[ e5 ] now.
 [ B f4 ]  [ B g6 ] , [ b4 ]  With my pieces in position the time has come to storm the queen side.
 [ h5 ] , [ B g4 ]  respond in kind or actually with a much more forcing move
 [ b3 ]  [ a5 ] , [ f5 ]  It is time to break through.
 [ g6 ] , [ N c3 ]  I threaten [ e4 ] but I found out later that this move actually scores very badly in practice.
 [ d x c5 ]  [ Q x e5 + ]  [ Q e7 ]  [ Q x e7 + ]  [ B x e7 ]  [ B b5 + ]  [ B d7 ]  [ B x d7 + ] , [ K x d7 ]  I enjoy playing the Scotch because it reduces the pieces on the board and I end up playing games like this. Ending the middle game and going into the endgame with only 14 moves!
 [ d x e5 ] , [ d x e5 ]  Hey lookie there. The fianchettoed bishop on [ g7 ] protects the pawn on e4. That's handy.
 [ B b4 ] , [ B d2 ]  As he moves his bishop to pin my knight down I can instantly break the pin with my own bishop. Also if he captures my knight I can recapture and maintain a good pawn structure.
 [ K d1 ] , [ R f7 ]  Removing the fork and threatening the pawn at e5.
 [ Q c4 ]  [ b5 ]  [ Q d3 ] , [ O-O ]  no sweat in the Black camp...
 [ N f1 ]  [ B h4 ] , [ e6 ]  maybe i should have played b to e-3 what do you think
 [ K g6 ]  [ g4 ]  [ b5 ] , [ K f4 ]  Deciding to force my way through with the King
 [ K d2 ] , [ R d8 ]  Open file on the white king + pin on the bishop. I've given up a knight for three pawns; however you can clearly see I have a much better position. White's king is engulfed in a sea of black pieces.
 [ B f4 ]  [ b5 ] , [ B b3 ]  Black still wanting the bishop on the Queen's side to move while ignoring the knight right in front of the King's defences. So I withdraw keeping up the threat that is imagined by my opponent.
 [ b x a3 ]  [ N x d4 ] , [ R b1 ]  10.[ N x d5 ] was better i guess
 [ c3 ]  [ Q a4 + ]  [ K e1 ] , [ f4 ]  And thus Black is deprived of the last hope to get a position of "the Rook against the Queen" that demands a certain accuracy from the strongest side if playing a computer. And still as practice has proved a weaker side in the battle of two chess players is not able to resist as it is nearly impossible to make a "computer move" that would take the Rook away from the King. However it is not necessary to know all these nuances. White keeps a lot of pawns so that Black could hope to win them sometime.
 [ Q a6 ] , [ h6 ]  Back rank threats avoided. Maybe [ g6 ] was more precise since his lsb is on the board.
 [ K f7 ] , [ K e3 ]  We both decide to get our kings involved.
 [ B e7 ]  [ B g2 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ O-O ]  [ b6 ]  [ Q c2 ]  [ B b7 ] , [ N e5 ]  slightly sharper would have been 9. [ N x e4 ] [ f x e4 ] 10. [ N e5 ] but both giants are taking this easy... (note: whites' KN just went on a formidable journey across the board; move count = 2)
 [ B d6 ]  [ B d2 ]  [ O-O ] , [ O-O ]  9. 0-0 (moves 8 and 9 were geared to development)
 [ Q b3 ]  [ Q x b3 ]  [ N x b3 ] , [ h5 ]  Creating an outpost on f5.
 [ R g e2 + ]  [ K f6 ]  [ R d6 + ] , [ K g7 ]  Here is the King on g7. Egold hasn't made many mistakes so far. His plan to pressure on [ a6 ] is good.
 [ Q x d8 + ]  [ K x d8 ]  [ O-O ] , [ K c7 ]  I get my King away from the open Queen file.
 [ Q x g2 ] , [ R f1 ]  obviously since White has trapped Black's rook you'd get your rook to safety first
 [ K f8 ] , [ N a4 ]  ...and I now move my knight to cover the pawn on [ b2 ] forking the queen and bishop also saving the pawn on f2...
 [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ Q x d4 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ Q a4 ]  [ Q b6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ a6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ N x d4 ] , [ B x a4 ]  Alternative variation: 9...[ Q x d4 ] 10.[ B e3 ] [ Q x b2 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ Q x b2 ]  [ N d2 ]  [ e5 ]  [ R a b1 ]  [ Q a3 ]  [ R x b7 ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ B x d4 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ R d8 ]  [ e5 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ e x d6 ]  [ Q x d6 ]  [ B c3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B a5 ]  [ R b8 ]  [ B c7 ]  [ Q x d2 ]  [ R x b8 + ]  [ B c8 ]  [ R x c8 + ]  [ K d7 ]  [ R x e7 + ]  [ K x c8 ] , [ B x a6 # ]  
 [ e3 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ B e2 ] , [ B b4 + ]  Normal I think is 5...Be7. This move doesn't seem as strong as if White had already played [ N c3 ] but I could be wrong...
 [ h6 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ e4 ]  White's pieces are chased around while Black can develop their game. This is still the main line of the 4.[ N g5 ] variation all moves ffrom 4.[ N g5 ] on are the most frequently played ones.
 [ e4 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ b4 ]  [ N b5 ]  [ R h7 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ g4 ]  [ N e2 + ]  [ K f2 ]  [ N f4 ]  [ b5 ]  [ K g8 ]  [ R d7 ]  [ N e6 ]  [ b6 ]  [ N c5 ]  [ R a7 ]  [ K f8 ] , [ b7 ]  After much manuevering the Knight must capture
 [ B x d5 ]  [ Q d8 ]  [ B x f7 + ]  [ R x f7 ] , [ Q x f7 + ]  mate next move!! he resigned please rate and commit!! thank you!!!!!!!!
 [ N e7 ] , [ Q b8 ]  hit the other bishop
 [ B f2 + ]  [ K h3 ]  [ R d8 ] , [ R c7 ]  The plan is to pick off some pawns and free up the 6th Rank.
 [ N b d2 ] , [ N f5 ]  i still did saw the attack....so i go on developing
 [ B f6 ]  [ Q h5 ] , [ R f8 ]  Black tries to consolidate his defenses but White has a brilliant attacking resource.
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N e5 ] , [ f4 ]  This isn't dangerous as black's e-pawn hasn't moved yet.
 [ B b4 + ] , [ N b d2 ]  blunder I missed Black's tactic and now I lose a pawn. I should've played [ B d2 ]  [ R b1 ] , [ B x d4 ]  My position isn't losing yet since I'm only down a pawn and I might have some compensation since I gain tempo chasing Black's bishop.
 [ h4 ]  [ Q b8 ] , [ Q d3 ]  !! The key move! This position is very reminiscent of Carlsen-Caruana game from the Zurich chess tournament two months ago which Carlsen won in a very nice style after sacrificing the exchange in a similar fashion. Maybe Komodo was inspired by that game? :)] [Stockfish was undoubtedly expecting 43.[ h x [ g5 ] ] [ h x [ g5 ] ] 44.[ Q x [ g5 ] ] when 44...[ Q g8 ] 45.[ Q f4 ] [ a5 ] 46.[ g5 ] [ a4 ] should give him enough counterplay.]
 [ e4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e5 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ O-O ] , [ f6 ]  Up to this point the game has been progressing along the lines of the French advance position (C02). Black deviates from the main lines with this attack on the e pawn.
 [ Q f3 ] , [ N x d3 + ]  Another attack. This time white king was the target.
 [ c x d5 ]  [ Q x d5 ] , [ N f3 ]  Forced.
 [ N f6 ] , [ f3 ]  now [ f3 ] which has weakened my kingside
 [ h x g6 ]  [ Q x g6 ] , [ Q h4 ]  White has no intentions of swapping Queens. This retreats with tempo hitting the Rd8.
 [ R f5 f7 ] , [ R f2 ]  [ a4 ] was necessary here - what I can do after 25. ... b5?
 [ Q x c6 ]  [ R x c6 ]  [ R d1 ] , [ R c2 ]  We're down to skin and bones and with a piece up Prokofiev just has to not blunder away the game.
 [ N b d7 ]  [ c4 ]  [ d x c4 ]  [ B x c4 ]  [ N b6 ] , [ N b d2 ]  I really liked this move! My knight just seemed so valuable in this spot.
 [ f3 ] , [ g3 ]  24. [ g3 ] - keeping my kingside pawn structure together.
 [ B a4 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ c3 ]  This is not a bad move but out of sequence. Anyone who plays Ruy Lopez regularly will spot this and have a proper look at the position now. Your [ e4 ] is vulnerable and black can consider some other positional options. I expected you to play 0-0 first as that discourages Nx[ e4 ] and prepares for Re1.
 [ a4 ] , [ h5 ]  The doubled pawns on c file mean there is no future for my N on that side of the board. 18...h5! will lead to a permanent homes for my N on [ f4 ] and [ h5 ] in particular and some fixed white pawns as targets.
 [ Q x e5 ] , [ Q a6 ]  Wham!! A shocking move by black which threatens mate-in-one but ALSO threatens the isolated pawn on the side of the board. What will white do about this?
 [ R x c1 ] , [ d5 ]  ? And a Blunder provides the way. I was struggling through ideas on how to pivot the knight to the square I want it on when he releases control of a key square on the path. Up until now black was winning or the game was even. Now the game is at least even or in white's hands.
 [ B x c4 ]  [ N x c4 ]  [ Q x c4 ]  [ R c8 ] , [ Q e2 ]  Now it is Black who attacks. I like how you didn't get stuck in defensive mode and seized your chance to end it quickly.
 [ B b5 + ] , [ N d7 ]  Reason bhind white bishops on [ b5 ] and [ g5 ] was also to make black move [ f6 ] and [ c6 ] as then black knights will not find good squars.
 [ f5 ]  [ B x d4 ] , [ R x e4 ]  With 2 ways to capture theyank's rook I chose utilizing pawn so it immediately places pressure on white's Queen.
 [ B a8 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ B h8 ]  [ B c8 ] , [ K e4 ]  preparing 67. f5+!
 [ e x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ] , [ N x d4 ]  7. [ Q x d4 ] leads to disaster here after Bxb5! Black has almost equalised here.
 [ K d2 ]  [ K d7 ]  [ K e3 ] , [ K e6 ]  27. ............. [ K e6 ] - the kings come in closer towards the centre.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ f4 ] , [ e x f4 ]  The KGA is brought to you by Crush soda. Remember when you are in a rush you need a Crush (soda).
 [ R g7 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ Q f8 ]  [ Q x e6 + ]  [ Q f7 ]  [ N g5 ]  [ Q x e6 ]  [ N x e6 ] , [ R f7 ]  not quiet what White had hoped for...
 [ e6 ] , [ N e5 ]  This prevents the destruction of my Kingside defenses and places the Knight in a strong position one which is not as easily dislodged as might be imagined as 10. ... [ N x e5 ] 11. [ d x e5 ] [ N d7 ] 12. [ Q x b7 ]  [ b x c6 ]  [ O-O ] , [ R b8 ]  This move seems to lock my Bishop to the [ c1 ] square to defend the b pawn for the foreseeable future
 [ R f3 ]  [ K e4 ]  [ R h3 ]  [ R x d3 ] , [ R h8 ]  i capture the pawn and the game goes on.
 [ N d e5 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ Q e6 ] , [ Q d6 ]  offering the queen exchange
 [ B h4 ] , [ d x c4 ]  before playing ...[ g5 ] I release tension in the centre
 [ g3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ f5 ]  [ B g2 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ e3 ]  This seems a bit passive but it was to give my [ g1 ] knight somewhere to go to I didn't like the idea of [ N f3 ] [ e4 ] and from [ e2 ] it could support [ e4 ]  [ g6 ]  [ N g e2 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ d4 ]  [ d6 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ B x d5 + ]  [ K h8 ]  [ R b1 ] , [ N e7 ]  Chasing away the bishop which could get annoying if allowed to stay there.
 [ d3 ] , [ d6 ]  4. ........ [ d6 ] (this is now the Pianissimo - the very quiet game)
 [ N f3 ] , [ B f5 ]  I can't stop [ c4 ] so I develop. This bishop is going to be exchanged for the [ f3 ] knight sooner or later. A key point of the game is to choose where and when.
 [ O-O ]  [ O-O ] , [ b6 ]  Again another move i don't think was all that productive maybe [ N g4 ] would have been better..
 [ N f6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ d5 ] , [ g3 ]  Now my plan becomes apparant to my opponent; I want to transpose into a Catalan.
 [ e4 ] , [ d6 ]  This move allows Black to develop both his Knights (by vacating [ d7 ] and defending e5). Both players have so far badly neglected their development but White has a significant advantage in space and very solid center control.
 [ R x e6 ]  [ Q g4 ]  [ R h e8 ] , [ c3 ]  I wouldn't have taken the pawn: white correctly spotted [ B c5 ] my next move attacking f2. In this way he prevents it.
 [ N d1 ] , [ R b6 ]  25. - [ R b4 ] would have been more stubborn. With Whites next tactical move it becomes clear how strong Pawns can be when they reach the 7th rank.
 [ f3 ] , [ c4 ]  
 [ K c7 ]  [ R c5 + ] , [ K b7 ]  The white king wanted to protect his pawn.
 [ K b3 ]  [ N f2 ]  [ K c2 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ K d1 ]  [ B c3 ]  [ N e2 ]  [ B e5 ]  [ K c2 ] , [ N g3 ]  White can't afford to exchange his last piece.
 [ Q e3 ]  [ R c8 ] , [ R e c1 ]  If you have a chance use all of your pieces! White should have played Rac1. Who cares about the pawn on [ a2 ] when you have the Cap in your cross hairs.
 [ e5 ]  [ e4 ] , [ c6 ]  This was made with the intention to challenge the center as soon as possible and stop any N jump ideas. I know that I will suffer for e5.
 [ e x d3 ]  [ c x d3 ]  [ N x d3 ] , [ Q d4 ]  The only satisfactory answer to the threat of mate.
 [ N x g3 ]  [ h x g3 ] , [ g6 ]  I am used to play [ c3 ] against the fianchetto.
 [ K g4 ]  [ h5 + ]  [ K g5 ] , [ R f5 # ]  Checkmate!
 [ N c1 ]  [ R g8 ] , [ N d3 ]  ? white needed to move either the rook or the king to avoid the tactics that follow
 [ h4 ] , [ N d5 ]  35. ...... [ N d5 ] - setting white a trap. If [ N x d5 ] then Glenda will return in all her splendour on a1. He does not fall for it and blocks my pawn with 36. Na2.
 [ R b8 ]  [ R b4 ]  [ K g2 ] , [ K f5 ]  I want to take the h pawn now. but want my knight to defend [ d5 ] and g8.
 [ K a7 ]  [ Q b6 + ]  [ K a8 ]  [ Q x a6 + ]  [ K b8 ]  [ R b3 + ]  [ N b4 ] , [ Q a8 # ]  Checkmate
 [ B a2 ] , [ B d7 ]  Preparing to advance the a-pawn.
 [ N c3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ B b4 ]  5. ..... [ B [ b4 ] ] - Fou Lenoir moves to [ b4 ] to pave the way for castling. If the d pawn moves then the knight on [ c3 ] will be pinned.
 [ K x e4 ]  [ a4 ]  [ K d4 ] , [ h5 ]  Desperation but he is lost anyway. After the more natural 36. ... [ K e7 ] play continues 37. [ K c4 ] [ b3 ] 38. ax[ b3 ] [ a3 ] 39. [ K c3 ] [ f5 ] (the only remaining try setting up a passed pawn on the kingside but White's pawns are faster) 40. gx[ f5 ] [ h5 ] 41. [ b4 ] [ g4 ] 42. [ b5 ] [ h4 ] 43.[ b6 ] [ g3 ] 44 d6+! and White will queen first with check.
 [ B d6 ]  [ Q f3 ] , [ Q c7 ]  7. ...... [ Q [ c7 ] ] - after developing Fou Lenoir to [ d6 ] to dispute the control of the h2-[ b8 ] diagonal I decide to reinforce this control by moving Glenda to [ c7 ] and therefore a trade of dsbs will be forced.
 [ R x d5 ] , [ N e5 ]  I now capture the [ d5 ] knight with my [ d1 ] rook and black moves his other knight to [ e5 ] now attacking my [ d7 ] pawn.
 [ N e7 ] , [ Q c4 ]  threatening [ B x b6 ] and he will have to really do something about this. This also sets a little trap which black can blunder into if he over reacts
 [ g3 ] , [ Q c2 ]  [ Q c2 ] trying to cancel some threats.
 [ Q x d3 ] , [ N c4 ]  Threatens checkmate on b2. I am expecting [ R b1 ] to prevent the mate after which one continuation might be 18. ... [ R f d8 ] 19. [ Q e4 ] [ R d2 ] 20. [ K c1 ] [ R x b2 ] 21. [ R x b2 ] [ Q x b2 ] 22. [ K d1 ] [ Q d2 # ] (not forced but I don't think white has much in the way of squirming out of it that doesn't cost him more material or leave him with multiple exchanges toward a losing endgame down by at least 2 pawns).
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ] , [ N f3 ]  Threatens the pawn with the knight.
 [ O-O ]  [ Q c2 ] , [ Q c7 ]  And black has a very comfortable position out of the opening.
 [ e6 ]  [ B d2 ]  [ B x f3 ]  [ B x f3 ]  [ f x e5 ]  [ f5 ] , [ e x f5 ]  Black willingly weakens his own pawn formation better would have been to give up the pawn to weaken white's initiative
 [ B e6 ] , [ R x f6 ]  Snatching a hanging pawn. This also allows the possibility to double heavy pieces on the f file. Black's K is now fairly vulnerable.
 [ N g4 ]  [ Q e4 ] , [ d6 ]  Threatening to win tempo with ...Bf5.
 [ B x e5 ]  [ B x e5 ] , [ Q x e5 + ]  this was a mistake of me it should be mat whith the queen in [ f7 ] so black resign and get disconnected Most of the time oponents get digusted when loose against grob. I'm not so proud of this game because there was a lot of mistake from the black but it's a good exemple of how grob attack disturb the minds !
 [ K b5 ] , [ R c b6 + ]  and the bishop.
 [ R f4 ] , [ R c3 ]  This was the final mistake that allowed me to seal up the win. Better would have been Ke3.
 [ N e4 ] , [ h4 ]  Necessary to free the [ N f3 ] from the duty of guarding [ h4 ] from a BQ's incursion.
 [ K f2 ]  [ R e g8 ]  [ a4 ] , [ R g4 ]  Adding second attacker for [ h4 ] squre and creating a possibility of doubling the rooks
 [ N x e5 ]  [ d4 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ B x e5 ]  [ f4 ]  [ B d6 ] , [ e5 ]  Luckily I could apply some pressure on his king and save both my knight and my bishop!
 [ B d2 ] , [ N h4 ]  Attacking rook in order to save pawn.
 [ Q x c2 ] , [ R f3 ]  going for a sneak attack
 [ Q x c4 ] , [ B x h2 + ]  Well freeish knight. I liked that one. I so often get caught but rarely manage to do it myself.
 [ B e2 ] , [ c4 ]  The first phase of black's plan is complete. Free the [ c5 ] square for his knight. This involves the loss of the c pawn (the knight cannot expect to live on [ e5 ] for long) but the counterplay he gets is worth it
 [ a6 ]  [ B x c6 + ]  [ b x c6 ]  [ N b d2 ] , [ N f6 ]  clearly not what Fischer had in mind; he wanted Ne7...
 [ B a3 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ R a c1 ] , [ K f7 ]  Getting my king off the diagonal is all there is to do.
 [ O-O ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N b3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N b x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ] , [ a6 ]  I think this is still theory I dont normally play 1.[ e4 ] and I'm no French expert so I'm not sure exactly what point we leave the theoretical mainlines most of my prep work was done working out the deviations from my opponents past game around move 13
 [ a5 ] , [ N d2 ]  Going for a ride.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ] , [ N c3 ]  I decided to try the Vienna Game.
 [ K c5 ] , [ R x d4 ]  ...and deem it worth removing the pawn as removing the rook gives my b-pawn a clear run while removing the pawn would allow my rook to get back or bring my king up to it.
 [ K e7 ]  [ R x b6 ] , [ B b4 ]  Another bad move.Black now gives away another pawn.
 [ b5 ]  [ K x h5 ]  [ a4 ]  [ K g4 ] , [ K h2 ]  White realized the mate net he was falling into.
 [ h6 ] , [ B x f6 ]  Guess I'll make the first move.
 [ R e8 ]  [ B h6 + ]  [ K g8 ] , [ Q g4 + ]  and black resigned . how great kasparov relay is making this game look so easy vs the Israel international master Jacob Morey . thank you and i hope you enjoy this game .
 [ B c5 ]  [ Q b8 ] , [ R a2 ]  An idle threat dealt with now black continues to dally around to get rid of the bishop.
 [ R h2 ]  [ R b8 ]  [ K f2 ] , [ B g7 ]  and easy19 offered a draw saying "it's an impossible position we cant break thru" so i agreed to a draw. hope that you liked it? please leave a comment or 2 and rate it on the star system thanks.
 [ R a c1 ] , [ N c5 ]  I'm resigned to losing the knight but maybe can pick off a pawn to salve the pain.
 [ g4 ] , [ h x g4 ]  (????) In an instant White loses. What he failed to realise is that now the h-file is open and the queen at [ f4 ] cuts off the runaway for the king. If 51. [ R b2 ] [ g x h3 ] Black has a small advantage but White can actually fight for a draw. Now Black mates.
 [ B e5 ]  [ Q e3 ]  [ B x f4 ] , [ Q x f4 ]  Maintaining pressure forcing black to respond to threats.
 [ N x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ] , [ N b4 ]  Now it is the [ d5 ] pawn's turn to come under attack.
 [ b6 ]  [ e3 ]  [ B b7 ] , [ B d3 ]  Carrying on developping
 [ B x f4 ]  [ O-O ] , [ Q d2 ]  With such a lovely development I feel I can try to prove that Black's routine castling was unsound. Analysing later I found that 7. [ Q c1 ] might have been even stronger as in some lines Black's Knight goes to [ f6 ] by way of [ g4 ] and then if I pin it with [ B g5 ] Black can play ...[ N x e4 ] because White's Queen is attacked as well as Black's.
 [ R x b2 ] , [ R f d1 ]  I looks here like i protect my knight however I need it here in front of his pawn.
 [ g x f6 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ K f8 ] , [ B h6 + ]  ?! Forcing the King to either block in the Rook or come back into the open. I'm not sure this was such a great idea; it simply allows the BK to head for cover without losing time.
 [ e4 ] , [ c2 ]  I almost played e5+?? here before realizing that after [ f x e5 + ] I'd be in BIG trouble.
 [ e4 ] , [ c5 ]  Team match I'm playing black and opt for the Sicilian.
 [ Q f6 ]  [ R b c1 ] , [ Q g5 ]  Time wasting move number two.
 [ a4 ] , [ b6 ]  9. ....... [ b6 ] - freeing up a square for Fou Leblanc.
 [ B b5 ]  [ N b2 ] , [ Q d5 ]  black on attack now
 [ K g3 ] , [ B e2 ]  I don't really know what I'm doing. I can force White to an edge... but what then?
 [ O-O ] , [ N x f7 ]  Oooh my opponent made a tactical mistake as a bishop and a knight is stronger than a rook and a pawn- but that can be argued.
 [ B h2 ] , [ Q x c3 ]  Material unpinning my queen and attack his bishop all at once. I am smiling.
 [ R c e1 ] , [ R d6 d1 + ]  now i have my forced mate coming ! i feel so HAPPY !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
 [ a x b3 ]  [ K d2 ]  [ K d6 ]  [ K c1 ]  [ K c5 ] , [ K b2 ]  As early commented after the exchange of rooks the white king took 3 tempi to reach black's pawn...
 [ Q b4 ]  [ Q e4 ] , [ R x d5 ]  this say good bye to everyone else of his officials..
 [ Q x f7 ] , [ Q x d6 ]  Black was not lost but his cramped K decides. A possible try for black was the following:
 [ O-O ]  [ B g4 ]  [ d3 ]  [ N b d7 ]  [ N b d2 ]  [ e5 ]  [ e4 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ d x e4 ] , [ B c5 ]  A good position for the bishop. Any other position would be too passive or precarious.
 [ N x f3 + ]  [ g x f3 ]  [ B d7 ] , [ N e d4 ]  ? Although it parries the immediate threat the Knight at [ d4 ] is neither secure nor does it solve the problem at c7. Pieces in the center normally need to be attacking or one risks being overloaded. [ a4 ] seems like a safer bet since Black now has an arsenal of potent responses - [ c5 ] [ e5 ] [ B c4 ] O-O-O.
 [ a x b4 ] , [ N x b4 ]  If 16... [ B x b4 ] the [ d4 ] pawn is lost
 [ O-O ] , [ N b d2 ]  ptitroque: interresting position 9... [ [ [ [ [ e5 ] ] ] ] ] Not sure about it it's getting complicated. 9th move ...maybe it's worth a discussion we shouldn't decide to quickly. (discussions are interresting in this kind of games because it's how to learn...) bluenoser: 9....[ [ [ [ [ e5 ] ] ] ] ] I too was looking at this move...Like you I think it is worth some discussion could be a key move in the game. I was also looking at [ Q c7 ] then e5...but that might be too slow as they may push d4. ptitroque: Qc7? seems ok but if they play a further [ R c1 ] we might be in trouble. roneshet: [ Q e7 ] - Why trouble? Can you explain a little bit why are we going to be in trouble if the do Rc1? I think [ [ [ [ [ e5 ] ] ] ] ] is a very good move. I thought of [ h6 ] also. opening up for the king. ptitroque: @roneshet If 1. ... [ Q c7 ] 2. [ R c1 ] Let's suppose 2... [ b6 ] (or anything else) 3. [ c x d5 ] [ e x d5 ] 4. [ N d4 ] * But you suggested [ Q e7 ] which is another matter. I'll have a look. ptitroque: @ roneshed (about Qe7) 9... [ Q e7 ] seems safe for me but we'll be heading to a close game and be less active. It's more chances to end with a draw. Now it's a question of general strategy. a_random_guy: 9...[ R e8 ] To free [ f8 ] for our knight if needed and to prepare the [ [ [ [ [ e5 ] ] ] ] ] pawn push. ptitroque: 9...[ R e8 ] I checked again to see if 9...[ [ [ [ [ e5 ] ] ] ] ] was possible and it's indeed dangerous to play it right now. With [ R e8 ] it'll be safer.
 [ e x f5 ] , [ N c7 ]  I played this move for two reasons one I expose the f pawn to the bishop's attack and two I prepare for the possibility that he finds a way to snake out of the pin with tempo. The opponents style of play so far suggested to me that he would not take rook and knight for queen.
 [ R g8 + ] , [ K h4 ]  The best way to keep my pieces mobile.
 [ Q e1 + ] , [ d2 ]  White can't even check. White resigned but I am not sure I could win.
 [ c3 ] , [ B c5 ]  I develop with a mate threat
 [ B x g6 ] , [ R a e8 ]  Another mistake.
 [ R b c7 ] , [ R e7 ]  43. ……. [ R e7 ] - the defensive shuffles carry on. Now Mike releases the bind and gives me a pawn deficit. Here it comes!
 [ B g4 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ N x e4 ] , [ B x f7 + ]  Sac the bishop to get my queen into the game and eliminate the knight posted in a good position.
 [ R f8 ] , [ R d x g7 ]  One Pawn falls.
 [ a4 ]  [ b4 ] , [ N a2 ]  7. [ N [ a2 ] ] - this knight retreats to [ a2 ] and twice attacks my [ b4 ] pawn. My [ c4 ] pawn is also under fire so Steve regains his pawn next move with 8. Bxc4.
 [ K f8 ] , [ B f5 ]  If 21... BxB 22 RxQ CHECK forces Black's hand. 22... RxR or 22... KxR is followed by 23 QxB with a winning advantage of a Q for a R and a Pawn ahead to boot.
 [ K b7 ]  [ c x b5 ]  [ a x b5 ] , [ B x f6 ]  A small trick to eliminate a defender of [ R e8 ] when [ Q x b5 ] comes.
 [ N x c3 ] , [ R c8 ]  Giving up the knight temporarily
 [ f3 ]  [ K f8 ]  [ a4 ]  [ R b2 ]  [ K g3 ]  [ f5 ] , [ a5 ]  30. [ a5 ] - white looks as though he is winning hands down but he will be on the losing side. It will be interesting to see just how he loses from here.
 [ Q x g3 + ] , [ K f1 ]  If [ K h1 ] [ Q h3 + ] [ K g1 ] [ R g8 + ] and white is lost. Anyway...
 [ B x h4 ] , [ Q g4 ]  so I had to move [ Q g4 ] to stop the away taking of defending pawns forward the King now was I in piece-underdog for a while of 13 moves
 [ K x b3 ]  [ g5 ]  [ h x g5 ]  [ h x g5 ] , [ g6 ]  After [ B f5 ] it will be easy for black to take the [ g5 ] pawn..
 [ K c8 ] , [ Q x b8 # ]  Black chose the quick way out so white obliges.
 [ N x e7 + ]  [ K h8 ] , [ f6 ]  ! A sacrifice that threatens to trap Black's Queen.
 [ N h4 ] , [ R g5 ]  Hoping to gain some compensation. The only thing I was worried about was the [ f5 ] pawn falling to the ls bishop - the light squared weaknesses in black's camp would then be horribly apparent.
 [ N x e5 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ N h5 ]  [ B h2 ]  [ g6 ] , [ Q c2 ]  Am considering a bishop sac but it isn't really on yet
 [ R x e8 + ]  [ Q x e8 ] , [ N b d2 ]  White defends the Knight on [ f3 ] at the cost of blocking in his Bishop when there was a nice outpost on [ c5 ] going spare.
 [ B x b4 ]  [ c3 ] , [ B c5 ]  White continues to waste time with his Pawns chasing after Black's Bishop.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ d4 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ Q d5 ]  [ f6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ c6 ]  [ Q b3 ]  [ h6 ]  [ N x e5 ] , [ f x e5 ]  I thought I'd do a knight-for-knight exchange here...
 [ e x d5 ]  [ f6 + ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ c3 ] , [ N d e6 ]  this was a big mistake if he put knight on c(six) i couldt check on f(five) and i would lose probably
 [ Q d6 + ] , [ K b7 ]  This is almost the position of one of my puzzles.
 [ R e2 ] , [ f5 ]  I didn't consider Rh3: the pawn [ h2 ] has played its role and cannot be dangerous anymore. The central pawn on the other side...
 [ R x c2 ]  [ N x d3 ]  [ R x c8 + ]  [ R x c8 ] , [ B x d3 ]  The best option for white I think!
 [ Q g6 ] , [ R d7 ]  The glass is creaking...
 [ N c6 ]  [ f x g5 + ]  [ h x g5 ] , [ R d6 d7 ]  (!) Threats that Black cannot meet...
 [ c6 ]  [ B h4 ] , [ b5 ]  Gaining space in the Q-side. I had to try something in the K-side but with my B on [ c5 ] that is dificult (because I have to do Nc5-e6)
 [ h4 + ]  [ K f5 ]  [ K f2 ] , [ K e5 ]  Just a bit more rope. If white carelessly plays 43. Kg3??? a move that seems natural then black wins with something like this: 43. ... 44. [ K f2 ] [ K d3 ] 45. [ K e1 ] [ [ h5 ] ] 46. [ [ g3 ] ] [ e3 ] 47. [ K d1 ] [ e2 + ] 48. [ K e1 ] K[ e3 ] 49. [ g4 ] hx[ g4 ] 50. [ [ h5 ] ] [ [ g3 ] ] 51. [ h6 ] [ g2 ] 52. [ h7 ] [ g1 = Q # ]  [ d4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ f5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ Q c2 ]  [ b6 ]  [ g3 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ B g2 ] , [ a5 ]  probably unnecessary. maybe even bad.
 [ O-O ] , [ B e6 ]  This move is somwhat hindering the development of black's rook. 11...[ R e8 ] would have been better.
 [ B b5 ] , [ N d4 ]  I usually don't see this but likewise I'm not surprised as Jack has on or two occassions played this against me. So I know what to do. As usual I exchange but for a different reason. Going by what C++ said it isn't exchange early and often as what used to. But here that N is powerful and I consider to be a bit overwhelming because of how dangerous they're known to be. To prevent the Fight or Flight Syndrome which isn't supposed to happen or getting overwhelmed I decide that the best thing to do is exchange. That way I'm taking care of something before it can become a problem. It is worth noting that confidence is very important to prevent you from getting anxious because as Jack says which I emphasize to my students "Don't get nervous." Plus I'm already planning something with the in between which is strategy as I learned from GM Susan Polgar. The strategy being the exchange to enable castling right after.
 [ B g2 ]  [ Q d7 ]  [ B x h3 ] , [ Q x h3 ]  Now that my queen is where I want it I am looking for [ N g4 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ B d8 ]  [ Q b3 ] , [ R b8 ]  protecting the pawn so that I can get my dsb active on the queens side
 [ d x c5 ] , [ Q a5 + ]  trying to get back my pawn
 [ Q x d2 + ] , [ K g1 ]  Ha ha ha here I said to cue the clown/carnival music for my death march...
 [ B e2 ] , [ N a5 ]  ? Invites me to [ b4 ] with tempo!
 [ c3 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ b4 ]  [ R e h8 ]  [ b3 ] , [ R c b8 ]  schemed my way into assuring myself one of these pawns will get there.
 [ N f6 ]  [ B x f4 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ O-O ]  I like the white position. Now White has objetives in the kingside and can cramp the queenside whit 9 [ a4 ] and later a5. Black has alternatives; black can play [ N a6 ] and [ B d7 ] for example or open the center with [ N e8 ] and f5. I choice attack the kingside ([ h6 ] specifically) with [ Q d2 ] but [ Q e1 ] and [ Q g3 ] is another idea.
 [ B c3 ]  [ a6 ]  [ N d4 ] , [ R e6 ]  Not sure why white does this.
 [ Q x g3 + ] , [ K h1 ]  On this move however I did become a little greedy. Thinking that I had gotten some counterplay I played 20.[ f x g3 ] which was taken. That's because Jack and Tom accurately pointed out that taking would be an illegal move. What I overlooked is that in addition to the g pawn my f pawn was also pinned so that I could not capture there. With that being said this is forced.
 [ Q x g2 ] , [ B h6 ]  what about [ B e7 ] to strengten the defence first as well as to protect f6.
 [ B d6 ]  [ N b d2 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ B h5 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ B x e2 ]  [ Q x e2 ]  [ N d7 ] , [ f4 ]  This was probably a mistake. I think [ N x c6 ] was better here giving Black an isolated a-pawn. I could have followed with [ f4 ] if desired or also Nf3.
 [ B x c6 + ]  [ Q x c6 ] , [ O-O ]  Black spent a lot of tempo on that one...
 [ Q d7 ] , [ B f1 ]  Prevents [ Q h3 ]  [ h5 ]  [ a4 ]  [ h4 ]  [ a5 ]  [ h x g3 ] , [ h x g3 ]  Opening the h-file but currently neither side can capitalize on the opening.
 [ R h c8 ] , [ Q g4 ]  !! Steinitz now has MULTIPLE threats including winning the black queen with a discovered check!
 [ a3 ]  [ B a5 ] , [ N g e2 ]  Already inaccurate? I noticed in de GK database that [ b4 ] is the conventional move here after which black takes either pawn and white can gain it back at some point after playing 7. Nb5. The played move quickly leads to some trouble with my centre.
 [ B f6 ]  [ g5 ]  [ B x b2 + ]  [ K d1 ] , [ Q a5 ]  Game note "21...[ Q a5 ] similar move in a similar game except here I'm facing K-side pressure ...[ [ e5 ] ] would also threaten ...[ e4 ] fork of his Q and LSB". Computer prefers 21...[ [ e5 ] ] by quite a bit (-5.83 vs -2.98).
 [ K g2 ] , [ e4 ]  Opening up lines for the bishop to join the attack
 [ B d4 ]  [ K e7 ]  [ B e5 ]  [ R d8 ]  [ c4 ]  [ c5 ] , [ R a6 ]  Here I had a moment of exultation. Finally nothing could stop me from gaining more of a lead...
 [ B x d7 + ]  [ Q x d7 ] , [ N h3 ]  ??? why h3? why not Ne2?
 [ N x e5 ] , [ Q d5 ]  Black has now two pawns less but four pieces out and the initiative. The mistake was maybe not so serious.
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ] , [ d4 ]  Starts out as the Scisillian.. Lets see what happens
 [ c x b5 ]  [ B x b5 ] , [ Q e6 ]  the quuen is walking awfully slow
 [ K e7 ]  [ Q b7 + ]  [ R d7 ]  [ Q b4 + ]  [ K e8 ] , [ Q d1 ]  This is Black's chance. He has to do something that will let him stay in the game.
 [ B d8 ]  [ g4 ]  [ R c7 ] , [ B g8 ]  I didn't get Bg8. The black bishop was in no danger. Why not push the a file pawn?
 [ B x e6 + ]  [ K f8 ] , [ B x g7 + ]  I feel it would have been more correct to have resigned several moves earlier or to play 32...[ K e8 ] and let White have the pretty 'aerial' mate 33.[ B f7 ] Shortly after these notes were written the chess world heard with regret of the death of the great chess artist Rashid Nezhmetdinov. Players die tournaments are forgotten but the works of great artists are left behind them to live on for ever in memory of their creators. Let this game and notes remain as my modest tribute to the memory of a fine player. Dedicated by M. Tal 20th June 1974
 [ B d3 ] , [ B b5 ]  ! 5 moves ago all white pieces were part of an attack. Now all of them have to go back to help their king.
 [ B b7 ]  [ R c b8 ]  [ B c7 ] , [ N d2 ]  Another blunder...I figured I'd just cut my losses never seeing the [ N f4 ] move which would've kept it even.
 [ N d7 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ g6 ] , [ B e3 ]  Not only completing development but another idea with this move is a strong B pair. The idea is that since they're both in the center with N's it's well coordinated so the center is well controlled. The idea from what I learned is that for the center to be controlled not only do you need the pieces out but everything has to coordinated in the center. Like hear the line up is with the B's and both N's placed right next to each B. That was my plan right after castling. What I just didn't realize is how quick I could do it because usually there are exceptions shortly after castling that a pawn or piece is threatened and then you must protect it but not in this position.
 [ N h7 ]  [ h4 ]  [ Q g3 ]  [ Q e4 ] , [ Q x h4 ]  25. ..... [ Q x h4 ] - and
 [ g x f5 ] , [ B x f5 ]  Now white has a threat on black's king.
 [ N e5 ] , [ N x e5 ]  I hadn't calculated properly. He's now just a piece up.
 [ R x a8 ]  [ Q x a8 ]  [ Q c2 ]  [ N f4 ]  [ R h2 ]  [ O-O ]  [ d3 ]  [ N g6 ] , [ N h4 ]  Switching Knights !!! it is the best for me ...
 [ O-O ]  [ N f6 ] , [ h3 ]  Intending a [ g4 ] boost.
 [ N d5 ]  [ Q f2 + ]  [ K d1 ]  [ Q x g2 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ R f1 ]  [ N e3 ]  [ R x e1 + ]  [ K x e1 ]  [ Q g1 + ]  [ N f1 ] , [ N d4 ]  White resigned.
 [ B x e4 ]  [ B x e4 ]  [ Q e1 + ]  [ K h2 ]  [ N f1 + ]  [ K g1 ]  [ R g8 ]  [ Q g5 ] , [ Q x e4 ]  !!
 [ R e3 + ]  [ K d7 ]  [ R e d3 ] , [ a6 ]  ?! Looking for complications? Black should be exploiting his kingside pawn majority instead of weakening his queenside defense.
 [ a3 ] , [ B d6 ]  Finally but this comes several moves too late. White's forces are finally joining up and eliminating the last of Black's most dangerous threats and a storm is coming.
 [ Q b3 + ]  [ K h8 ] , [ N g5 ]  White is threatening mate so r-[ f1 ] is forced
 [ h5 ] , [ Q f3 ]  My goal now is to win back the material and press the attack. I threaten 25 RxP ch.
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ] , [ c3 ]  A cautious approach to the Sicilan
 [ B c4 ] , [ B x c4 ]  ?? As Annabel took which I anticipated. But I told her that this is a blunder. Instead better was to protect and prevent what's coming. By that I was implying that best was 11...[ f6 ] By playing this though I have a nasty discovered check which going to win the Rook. And btw this is the reason why protecting with [ N f3 ] was the only move that came into consideration as otherwise I would've looked at retreating elsewhere. What I kept in mind for this training game however was something that tactical-abyss from his experience. That is that most people make this kind of mistake and when they think they can they'll take. But what they don't know is the consequences affiliated with it like here. So it is good for learning and another example of where I used TA's method to teach chess.
 [ N c6 ] , [ Q e2 ]  Watch out!
 [ N h5 ] , [ B d5 ]  Pins blacks knight at c6. Threatens [ B x c6 + ] winning the Rook.
 [ e6 ] , [ b3 ]  There is some logic in [ b3 ] - if the [ B c1 ] can't go to [ f4 ] or [ g5 ] may as well put it on [ b2 ] - however 5. [ N c3 ] (and other moves!) are more common.
 [ b x c6 ] , [ B a6 # ]  Next time Black should be careful what he's castling into!
 [ e x f5 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ b4 ]  [ Q x f5 ]  [ K f3 ]  [ R e3 + ]  [ K f2 ]  [ Q c2 + ]  [ K f1 ]  [ Q e2 + ]  [ K g1 ]  [ R g3 + ]  [ K h1 ] , [ Q g2 # ]  
 [ K f7 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ K g6 ]  [ B d3 + ] , [ K h5 ]  Kh5?? This changes everything. I guess with the material advantage black didn't want to settle for the draw. But it's back in whites favour after 23.R1[ e3 ] [ Q b6 ] 24.[ R h3 ] [ K g4 ] 25.[ R g3 ] [ K h4 ] 26.[ R x g7 ] [ Q b1 ] 27. Bf1.....
 [ R g6 + ] , [ K h3 ]  By attacking the bishop I force an exchange of rooks or an exchange of bishops. I'm hoping my tiny material advantage can be exploited to produce a bigger advantage and liquidiating pieces seems the best approach here.
 [ N d5 + ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ B x d5 ] , [ N c4 ]  If White takes on [ c4 ] I undouble my pawns and I like the ending better with a Bishop against a Knight with pawns on both wings.
 [ K x e7 ]  [ Q x d6 + ] , [ K e8 ]  Forced.
 [ b4 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ a3 ]  [ N c7 ]  [ B b2 ] , [ a5 ]  I wasn't sure about this move which wasn't in any of the databases. White could have ended up with a passed a-pawn though whether it would have been strong is another matter. I saw it as necessary to free my rather cramped position intending to bring the other rook over to b8.
 [ b3 ]  [ b5 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N c5 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ b4 ]  [ N e2 ] , [ Q c7 ]  Maybe [ d5 ] would have opened up things better.....
 [ K x g3 ] , [ R a7 ]  i thought of paralysing his rook. not a good idea. here his rook has to defend his knight. but he can come out of it by calling check.
 [ d4 ]  [ a6 ] , [ B c4 ]  9. Bc4! - moves her lsb on to a better diagonal striking at f7.
 [ N f3 ] , [ B b4 + ]  Uh...i think this is the Bogo-indian. I have not prepeared for it at all. (of course white still has a tempo so technically this isn't the Bogo-indian)
 [ e5 ] , [ N f3 ]  Develop my knight attack the weak e pawn and defend my d pawn
 [ e4 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ f4 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B c4 ] , [ N x e4 ]  A common trick in the [ B c4 ] lines of the Pirc
 [ f5 ] , [ R e d3 ]  White creates a battery with his two rooks. Black's king and queen are lined up along the same rank; Black must meet the threat of 44. Rd7+.
 [ R x e7 + ]  [ K b8 ]  [ Q e5 ]  [ Q a5 ]  [ B x a3 ] , [ Q x a3 ]  Worst move. Perhaps [ R c8 ] or Qd6.
 [ N h4 ]  [ B e2 ] , [ N x g6 ]  I preferred this to moving the R allowing 21....[ B x f2 ]  [ h x g6 ] , [ R b1 ]  but now I have to move it anyway
 [ K g2 ] , [ e4 ]  White's b2-rook is hanging and his f3-knight is hanging but also blocking my path to the f2-bishop. No matter what White does he's going to have to drop a grip of material.
 [ N e5 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ B x e5 ] , [ f6 ]  Black tries to repair at least some of the weaknesses in his half. If my bishop moves to [ d6 ] it should eventually be threatened by a b6-square pawn.
 [ K d6 ] , [ g7 ]  So this is where he resigned - After the exchange I will queen on G8 / 1-0. Endgames are really about calculating and playing sensible. In the end I was glad I missed the mate earlier because it was a good endgame for me.
 [ c x d5 ] , [ N x d5 ]  I immediately relieve Black of his central Pawn and he recaptures.
 [ R d h2 ]  [ c3 ] , [ Q g6 ]  The idea is to pin the Black KB threatening [ R h8 + + ]  [ c x b2 + ] , [ K b1 ]  Black resigns. He can stave off immediate mate by giving up his Queen for a rook but then he cannot stop [ R h7 ] followed by N-e3-f5.
 [ b7 ] , [ N x f4 + ]  Delays coronation by a move.
 [ R e1 ] , [ B g4 ]  pinning the N
 [ b5 ]  [ B f7 ]  [ R g4 ]  [ K f3 ]  [ R g7 ]  [ B d5 ]  [ c4 ]  [ g4 ]  [ a5 ]  [ g5 ] , [ K e7 ]  Black wants to position the king in the center.
 [ a4 ] , [ N b1 ]  Hoping to blockade the pawn at [ a3 ] or maybe exchange the knight for pawn later to prevent the pawn promotion.
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ c6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ Q a5 ]  I think this move was not needed.Doesn't serve any purposes
 [ N x c6 ] , [ B b6 ]  I was -5. And with few pieces active I didn't want to lose this good B.
 [ Q x c5 ] , [ B b5 + ]  This move ended the game (black resighed).
 [ B x d4 ]  [ a3 ] , [ Q a5 ]  My opponent's only major blunder as I saw it. The queen had to move where it still protected the bishop ([ b6 ] or c5).
 [ B b4 ]  [ Q c2 ]  [ g6 ] , [ N g3 ]  White fights for control of f5.
 [ B x f4 ] , [ h6 ]  He made this move because he wants to capture my queen with [ h x g5 ] but I am not about to let that happen.
 [ Q x g1 + ]  [ K d2 ]  [ Q f2 + ]  [ K c3 ]  [ N e2 + ]  [ K d3 ]  [ N x f4 + ]  [ K c3 ]  [ N e d5 + ]  [ Q x d5 ] , [ N x d5 + ]  and white concedes.
 [ Q c7 ]  [ g4 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N x c6 ] , [ b x c6 ]  Not [ Q x c6 ] allowing [ Q e7 ] mate.
 [ K e2 ]  [ N c2 ]  [ N b5 ]  [ R h5 ] , [ N x d6 + ]  well well well!! what do you know!! this game is far from over!!
 [ Q x e6 ] , [ O-O ]  I get my king to safety by castling.
 [ O-O ] , [ O-O-O ]  I could have played [ B c4 ] here as well but after 8. ... [ d5 ] I believe the exchanges favor white (slightly). Let's see how it plays out.
 [ B c5 ]  [ N b3 ] , [ B x f2 + ]  [?!] The quieter 9.… [ B d6 ] 10.[ d4 ] [ N x e4 ] is preferable but the text definitely gets White's attention just not enough of it.
 [ h4 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ h5 ]  [ g x h5 ] , [ R x h5 ]  Now we can see the writing on the wall. Nonetheless 21...[ h6 ] would force 22.gx[ h6 ] Bx[ h6 ] 23. Rx[ h6 ] [ K g7 ] forcing a retreat and allowing for some possible Black action to save a draw.
 [ d6 ] , [ Q x d4 + ]  But [ Q b6 ] worked out.
 [ N b3 ]  [ a5 ] , [ B e3 ]  15. [ B e3 ] - and now here is how to catch up with slow development as white in this opening!
 [ Q b8 ] , [ B g3 ]  I attack his queen and have all my pieces safe
 [ N f3 ] , [ Q g7 ]  Threatening ...R-[ N1 ] and ...QxP mate!
 [ B x f5 ] , [ e x f5 ]  Now White has the bishop pair and Black has to play carefully.
 [ Q c4 + ]  [ K d2 ]  [ Q a2 + ]  [ K d1 ] , [ Q b1 + ]  White resigns 0-1
 [ R x a3 ] , [ R x c5 ]  23. [ R x c5 ] - but I take anyway! I bet you are all now thinking what the????? Fancy voluntarily giving up the exchange to an IM when already down on material! But there is some method in the madness. I do get one of my pawns back as well as the knight and the [ c7 ] pawn is very vulnerable indeed and at the moment I am tying his rook down to the defense of it. Also Glenda now has the opportunity to yet again make her presence felt.
 [ c5 ]  [ b x c5 ]  [ B x f1 ] , [ a5 ]  Ooooooops. Black didn't (I think!) notice that discovered attack. But all is nowhere near lost - he has two passed pawns to White's bishop.
 [ R x a8 ] , [ e6 + ]  the monster awakes!
 [ N x c6 ]  [ N x a1 ]  [ B x a1 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ b5 ]  [ f6 ]  [ K f1 ]  [ f5 ]  [ B d4 ]  [ f4 ]  [ B x a7 ]  [ R a8 ]  [ a4 ]  [ K g8 ] , [ a5 ]  He can't stop my pawn from Queening without a Rook sac but that leaves me with a Bishop a Knight and 2 future pass pawns. He resigns instead of hoping I would blunder.
 [ R f2 ]  [ Q x b3 ]  [ B d4 ]  [ Q x c4 ]  [ B x g7 + ]  [ K x g7 ]  [ g x f5 + ]  [ K h8 ]  [ Q x b6 ]  [ R x f5 ]  [ R g4 ]  [ Q d4 ] , [ Q b2 ]  Things are looking drawish so long as neither side missteps.
 [ a3 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ b2 ] , [ B h5 ]  If 45. [ e6 ] then [ b1 = Q ] works similarly.
 [ N f2 ] , [ K e6 ]  Patience is a virtue in endgames. Black once again activates the king.
 [ f5 ] , [ B e2 ]  to prevent the knight from jumping to f3.
 [ K f2 ]  [ b3 ]  [ K e2 ]  [ b2 ]  [ B x c6 ] , [ R x c6 ]  didn't need to take the bishop continuing with queen wins anyway
 [ N f3 ] , [ N f6 ]  preparing for the fight. I have to kill this defensive [ f3 ] knight
 [ e x f5 ] , [ K h1 ]  can you explain this move (Kh1)? I'd have moved fxe5.
 [ B h5 ]  [ Q e4 ] , [ B g6 ]  ? letting white trade queens and get 2 central connected passed pawns
 [ d x c6 ] , [ b x c6 ]  Black's Q-side Pawn structure is in tatters.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ] , [ Q f3 ]  Queen develops in opening not so good
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ N f6 ]  The Petroff Defence. If beginner(s) are playing this can lead to discovered checks queen losses and broken hearts...
 [ K g3 ]  [ Q e2 ] , [ Q x h5 ]  55. Qxh5? - grabs another pawn and leaves Henry shivering. The Witch is threatening to descend on [ h8 ] at any moment. However I give that move a question mark because ......
 [ O-O ] , [ N c6 ]  The right idea that develops a piece prevents white from playing [ c4 ] and contests e5.
 [ R x e6 ]  [ R d2 ]  [ c6 ]  [ B f3 ] , [ R e1 + ]  Black himself sets up the Rooks coming off the board...
 [ c6 ] , [ N e3 ]  This blocks the Bishop's attack on [ f2 ] but I was expecting [ N c3 ] at the time--on [ [ e3 ] ] it will be easily-harassed. White wants to defend his kingside but on [ [ e3 ] ] he will be hard-pressed to defend his actual King!
 [ e5 ] , [ Q d7 ]  I think I noticed his Rook really didn't have anywhere useful to go if I did this. It gave me an opportunity to push the c pawn (which I did) and also positioned my Queen to defend the [ g4 ] square. N[ g4 ] would open my King for a mate threat (possibly indefensible too).
 [ c5 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ R d2 ] , [ Q f5 ]  making an issue out of the unprotected Bf4...
 [ N a6 ] , [ N b d2 ]  Knights work well together def an offence.
 [ K c5 ]  [ Q a5 + ]  [ K d4 ] , [ R d6 + ]  67. ..... [ R d6 + ] - King Mike now has to be very careful. With my rook joining in the fun he could now walk into a lawnmower type mating net.
 [ g4 ]  [ R x e5 ] , [ R e f1 ]  better [ R g1 ] [ R e4 ] [ R x e4 ] [ f x e4 ] [ R e1 ] [ e3 ] Kg3... this loses quicker...
 [ B x c7 ] , [ N e4 ]  Which she defends.
 [ B h3 ]  [ R d8 ]  [ N c7 + ]  [ K e7 ] , [ Q d5 ]  '??' - White is lulled to sleep by his dominating position and mating threats on the light squares. He underestimates the Black resource 19..Qh5! gaining a vital tempo in defense. It then arises that White's knight is stuck on [ c7 ] and his bishop is attacked and both cannot be defended. Then he has nothing better than [ Q b5 ] placing his queen en prise but forcing perpetual check. If the bishop is taken instead then [ Q x b7 ] and perpetual again. White blames such oversights to playing massive amounts of games (many against weaker players...there is no other way to start around here) which is a distraction. Never again he says :)
 [ N f6 ] , [ N g5 ]  Decide to attack his kingside no definite plan as such. Feeling exploring needling a superior ranked player
 [ N d5 ]  [ B d2 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ R a b1 ]  [ b6 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ R f e8 ] , [ B e4 ]  I don't want to trade Rooks just yet.
 [ R d7 ]  [ B x a3 ]  [ B c3 + ]  [ K g6 ]  [ K e4 ] , [ h5 ]  [?!] The GKE prefers 8...[ f6 ] but it is not clear why.
 [ N c6 ]  [ c3 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ e4 ]  [ Q e7 ]  [ B g2 ]  [ O-O-O ]  [ O-O ] , [ N e5 ]  These moves are theorie.
 [ K c5 ]  [ e3 ]  [ b7 ] , [ K x c7 ]  And White resigned.
 [ Q a1 + ]  [ N b1 ] , [ N a2 # ]  
 [ a3 ] , [ B d7 ]  Now I retreat the bishop to attck his rook...
 [ B g2 ] , [ N b6 ]  Black's knight was under pressure and I didn't like to block in my light-squared bishop with 6...e6.
 [ B a2 ] , [ b4 ]  Opening up lines on the queenside.
 [ f6 ] , [ Q d2 ]  Accomplishing nothing except putting the Queen in a more vulnerable location. This is probably intended to prepare [ R f b1 ] and [ Q b2 ] but that entire plan hinges on getting rid of the Bg6--so why hasn't White played f4-[ f5 ] yet???
 [ N x d7 ]  [ B x d7 ]  [ e3 ] , [ B x h4 ]  Ah [ h4 ] of course became undefended in the process. But again it can reverse to my benefit.
 [ B e6 ] , [ b4 ]  ?! A very logical move but I think it is too early as now Black is getting excellent chances to get back into the game. [17.[ N e1 ] with the idea of playing [ N c2 ] and maybe [ N b4 ] could have stabilized White's advantage.]
 [ B x c6 ]  [ R x d8 ]  [ R f x d8 ]  [ Q x e7 ] , [ R d e8 ]  Trying for counterplay Sue attacks the Queen. And not to my surprise not only does Ken protect but he goes after her B which she then is forced to protect.
 [ B h7 ] , [ B x b6 ]  Initially planned to play Bd4. Considering how the black pawn structure would look with doubled pawns on the b and f files I willingly gave up my bishop pair. How wrong was I as you will see.
 [ Q x e3 + ]  [ K h1 ]  [ B x b2 ] , [ R d7 ]  it seems that white has a great attack. I'm not sure of it.
 [ Q x e8 + ]  [ R x e8 ] , [ R x b2 ]  A rook under. Just a badly placed knight... I should resign right?
 [ K d8 ]  [ e x d7 ]  [ K x d7 ]  [ f5 ]  [ g x f5 ]  [ g6 ]  [ K e7 ] , [ g7 ]  Black resigns as he cannot prevent promotion.
 [ e4 ]  [ c6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ d4 ] , [ N c6 ]  This is an unorthodox Caro-Kann.
 [ N x b4 ] , [ N c3 ]  I go for the rook.
 [ N e7 ] , [ B e3 ]  I wanted to play [ Q x [ c7 ] ] but not while my knight is hanging on [ d4 ] undefended. Moving the knight loses a tempo and allows black to exchange queens. I would prefer the bishop on [ f4 ] or [ g5 ] but those squares are currently unavailable so this move lets me defend and develop and now threatens the [ c7 ] pawn.
 [ d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ g6 ]  The sicilian dragon which is very popular. It allows 6...[ B g7 ] and 0-0.
 [ Q x f3 ] , [ O-O ]  Finally I tuck my King safely away [and incidentally unpin my Knight.]
 [ e x d5 ] , [ h4 ]  ?! This pawn's intentions are obvious but it was here that I realized with horror that my pet pawn killing bishop was in serious trouble.
 [ B x c5 ] , [ e3 ]  This bishop attacking this diagonal is a central theme in this game.
 [ N e8 ] , [ N d2 ]  This move gives the Black bishop more scope but it can now be driven off with White's pawn moving to f3.
 [ N x f2 ] , [ Q x f2 ]  Either the Rook or Bishop must fall. 22 B-[ Q3 ] fails against ... NxB.
 [ N c6 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ N x e7 + ]  [ R x e7 ]  [ B b6 ] , [ R d7 ]  with a pawn down -- I stil went for the exchange -- I realized with the rook gone the bishop cannot attack the my pawns and I might be able to play on
 [ N g1 ] , [ N f4 ]  Finally moves 18 & 19 pay off!
 [ R b8 ] , [ N f4 ]  Here I make a mistake. I get over ambitious and cause what I had been trying to avoid.
 [ B x c5 ]  [ R x e1 ]  [ R x e1 ] , [ R e8 ]  Oh another exchange ([ R a8 ] would have saved the pawn).
 [ N e3 ] , [ Q e2 ]  hmmm. [ Q c1 ] appears slightly better.
 [ d4 ]  [ e x d4 ] , [ c3 ]  Danish Gambit I rather like white's chances after the two pawn sacrifice so i'll decline.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ B c5 ]  not a bad move but a little premature. Dev Ns 1st
 [ Q d6 + ]  [ K g2 ] , [ Q e6 ]  Black cannot move [ B e6 ] since it will allow white a move to bring the rook into the game.
 [ R a8 ] , [ K c3 ]  Making way for the b pawn to advance so white resigns. 0-1
 [ B x a8 ] , [ Q x d6 ]  I was mad at myself for not taking the obvious and taking back what I rightfully owned
 [ R f8 ]  [ R x f8 ] , [ K x f8 ]  Now the Pawn will tie down Black's K while my own heads for the Q side to much Pawns.
 [ Q c5 ]  [ N x c7 + ]  [ K d8 ]  [ N x a8 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ a3 ]  Taking care of the [ N b4 ] threat now I can play [ B d3 ] or Qd3.
 [ f5 ] , [ R e4 + ]  (!) Chasing off the King. Unplayable is 38...Kf3?? so the first probing attack is repulsed.
 [ N e6 ]  [ Q g8 ] , [ O-O ]  Joanne adhering to sound principles quickly castles and gets her King to safety.
 [ O-O-O ]  [ N b c6 ]  [ f4 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ f5 ]  [ Q f6 ]  [ h4 ] , [ g5 ]  finally I trap him here...
 [ R x d3 ] , [ Q g4 ]  The idea is to protect d1. But what Mary doesn't know is that her N cannot be defended due to my next move.
 [ N x f7 ] , [ B d1 # ]  No white missed the danger. Frankly who can blame him? With black's two rooks so far away the threat of being checkmated by what appears to be a lone bishop seems awfully remote but that is just what happened and black advances on the Fast Ladder but unfortunately only one rung since white removed himself from the ladder while the game was in progress.
 [ N f3 ]  [ e6 ] , [ g3 ]  with this move I announce my intentions to play the KIA vs the sicilian. It is much harder to gain then against the french.
 [ h5 ]  [ B x h5 ]  [ K x h5 ]  [ K x f4 ]  [ K h4 ]  [ K e3 ]  [ K g3 ]  [ f4 + ]  [ K g2 ] , [ K e2 ]  This is the first game I won against jongraft (and hopefully not the last)...
 [ B x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ N e7 ]  [ c3 ] , [ B g7 ]  14. ...... [ B g7 ] - if NxP then BxP.
 [ K b2 ] , [ Q d1 ]  he resigned
 [ d5 ] , [ B x d5 + ]  A pawn for free!
 [ N c6 ] , [ B d3 ]  
 [ c x d5 ]  [ B x f1 ]  [ d x c6 ]  [ b5 ]  [ Q x f1 ]  [ b x a4 ] , [ Q x a6 ]  Material is even (I did not count. This is a blitz game I just felt like I had good chances at this point.
 [ B e6 ]  [ R d2 ]  [ R a d8 ] , [ R a d1 ]  all secured... everything could be a draw. Computer confirms the advantage is ridiculous.
 [ f x e5 ]  [ f x e5 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ B x h5 ] , [ R e g8 ]  not 21 ... [ R h8 ] 22 Rxf5!
 [ N x h7 ] , [ N x h4 + ]  ...and we capture them making my knight's pawn passed but isolated and weak. However I have a two pawn advantage again and my knight can operate queenside...
 [ a4 ] , [ b x a4 ]  21. [ b x a4 ] - black gives up his a pawn what is he up to here? Is he planning a kingside mating attack and can I hold on to my remote isolani passer? My questions will soon be answered.
 [ B x e4 ] , [ R x e4 ]  No immediate threats material is equal white controls the open file both kings are safe white is better on the center and has a passed pawn but... but.. but... white pawn structure is far inferior and against a master the game is unwinable. I still plaid for the draw.
 [ N c3 ] , [ e6 ]  This position is the main line of the Semi-Slav by way of transposition. The normal move order is (1.[ d4 ] [ N f6 ] 2.[ c4 ] [ [ e6 ] ] 3.[ N f3 ] [ [ d5 ] ] 4.[ N c3 ] [ c6 ] 5.[ B g5 ] dx[ c4 ] ...) the text move 4...[ [ e6 ] ] assures a difficult game for white while maintaining strength at [ [ d5 ] ] and activates a bishop.
 [ K a2 ]  [ K c3 ]  [ K a3 ] , [ N b3 ]  The knight cornering method is complicated to master but the ideas will come in handy in knight endgames and especially in variants of this endgame.
 [ B x d5 ] , [ e x d5 ]  It is official: the LSB is a bad Bishop.
 [ b6 ] , [ B x d5 + ]  third !
 [ N f3 ] , [ d5 ]  i figure he is doing a black form of stonewall.
 [ N a3 ]  [ B x h6 ]  [ Q x h6 ] , [ B g4 ]  Black has lured the white queen to the far edge of the board where she has no useful moves. I wonder if she can be trapped.
 [ R x d4 ]  [ R a d1 ]  [ R x d1 ]  [ R x d1 ]  [ f6 ]  [ N g6 + ]  [ K e8 ] , [ R e1 ]  putting [ N e4 ] in a lethal pin...
 [ h3 ]  [ B h5 ]  [ g4 ]  [ B g6 ]  [ h4 ] , [ B b4 ]  A waste of time.
 [ R e8 ] , [ g5 ]  white's best after the previous slip.
 [ R x b7 + ]  [ K x b7 ]  [ N c4 ] , [ g2 ]  White resigned. Once I promote my pawn winning should be no problem for me. This game goes to show that fighting back in a seemingly hopeless position can give you extreme payoffs. And it also good for you psychologically because sometimes your winning opponent will be too arrogant or impatient to defend and take your threats seriously.
 [ N x b3 ]  [ B x b3 ]  [ K x f7 ] , [ B a4 ]  ?! I just wanted to keep the bishop pair when I played this. However I see nothing wrong with 25.[ B x e6 + ] [ K x e6 ] 26.Rc1. Now white will have to use some time to develop his rook withoug losing a pawn.
 [ g x f3 ] , [ h5 ]  Taking isn't possible because of [ N f4 ] so White has to move the Bishop.
 [ B h4 + ] , [ K f1 ]  i could've taken on [ [ h4 ] ] but i decide that the bishop on [ [ h4 ] ] would have to move again wasting another tempo for black.
 [ N d5 ] , [ B g3 ]  I push B to [ g3 ] instead of [ h2 ] because I was very confident that he'd castle on the bishop side. I didn't want to be in the [ R h1 ] way when I tried for the backdoor checkmate
 [ a3 ] , [ N x d3 ]  15. [ a3 ] Now finally deciding to kick the black knight (but probably too late). With a fairly open structure and well positioned bishops the exchange was probably attractive for black
 [ R c8 + ]  [ B d8 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ K d7 ]  [ R x d8 + ]  [ R x d8 ]  [ B x d8 ] , [ K x d8 ]  liquidating 2 pawns up seals the deal.
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ f4 ] , [ N c6 ]  Immediate [ d5 ] or [ e6 ] was more reasonnable but I didn't realise yet he has done [ f4 ] :D It's a blitz game after all.
 [ R f2 ]  [ K d6 ]  [ K c8 ]  [ R c7 + ]  [ K d8 ]  [ R g7 ]  [ N b5 + ]  [ K c6 ]  [ N d4 + ]  [ K d5 ]  [ N b5 ]  [ R b7 ]  [ N a3 ]  [ B x f5 ]  [ R x f5 + ]  [ K d6 ]  [ N b5 + ]  [ K c6 ]  [ N d4 + ]  [ K d6 ]  [ K c8 ]  [ R b4 ]  [ N b5 + ]  [ K c6 ]  [ N a7 + ]  [ K b6 ]  [ K b8 ]  [ K a6 + ]  [ K c7 ]  [ R b7 + ]  [ K c6 ]  [ K x a7 ]  [ R x g5 ]  [ R b6 + ]  [ K c7 ] , [ K a6 ]  I originally calculated that it would get to draw after rook trade. But doesnt seem to after calculating more. However this move serves also the checking thread [ R a5 ] followed by [ R c5 ] which is annoying.
 [ R d4 x d1 ] , [ N x d1 ]  Now the Queen must move and either the Bishop or Knight will be lost.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ] , [ N f3 ]  Everything is standard so far.
 [ N b6 ] , [ N d4 ]  My opponent hates forcings by now. Let's see what this variation does...
 [ R b8 ] , [ Q d7 ]  forced ...notice whites other option would involve sacificing his queen for the rook but the black pawn should win the game easily!
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ g6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ e4 ]  [ d6 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ e5 ] , [ B g5 ]  This isn't one of the most played moves. I think the pin over Black's knight isn't so painful.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ f6 ]  Damiano's defence (C40) This is a very poor defense because it exposes the king on the h5-[ e8 ] diagonal weakens the king-side and takes away the best developing square for the [ g8 ] knight.
 [ c x d5 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ e3 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ b6 ]  [ B d2 ]  [ B a6 ]  [ Q c2 ]  [ B x d3 ]  [ Q x d3 ]  [ N b d7 ] , [ N e5 ]  Now if (a) 12. ...[ N e5 ] 13. [ d e5 ] [ N d7 ] 14. [ f4 ] with play; or (b) 13. ...[ N e4 ] 14. [ N e4 ] [ d e4 ] 15. [ Q d8 ] [ R f d8 ] 16. [ B c3 = ]  [ B d6 ]  [ f4 ]  [ a6 ]  [ Q e2 ]  [ b5 ]  [ a3 ]  [ R c8 ]  [ R a c1 ]  [ N b6 ]  [ g4 ]  [ N c4 ]  [ N x c4 ]  [ d x c4 ]  [ g5 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ N x d5 ] , [ e x d5 ]  Most of the smoke clears. White has more space and an attack on the K-side; Black has more space and a counter-attack brewing on the Queenside.
 [ d6 ] , [ a4 ]  '!' This prevents ..[ b5 ] and secures [ [ c4 ] ] for the typical manuever Nf3-d2-[ [ c4 ] ] which arises in many Benoni structures. In effect White is preparing to suffocate Black on the queenside while he struggles to develop and bring his king to safety. White is clearly better now.
 [ Q d7 ] , [ a4 ]  Forced. Now [13.[ Q d3 ] was not good because of Qa4! sealing White's queenside.}
 [ a6 ] , [ K f6 ]  ?? This is either giving up or hoping for a stalemate.
 [ Q g5 + ]  [ B f6 ]  [ Q g3 ] , [ R g8 ]  i still can defend [ f4 ] but i think i will loose g6... :(
 [ K e2 ] , [ Q x e3 + ]  taking the rook with check if [ K f1 ] its mate
 [ d5 ] , [ e5 ]  Very rare that in multiple days time control I get an exchange on d5.
 [ h3 ] , [ g3 ]  24. .... [ g3 ] - although Chris is a piece to the bad you wouldn't think he was gonna cop Old Matey in just two moves would you?
 [ N b5 + ] , [ K d3 ]  [ K d3 ] is as good as anything as [ K c4 ] is met with [ B e2 ] check.
 [ N a2 ] , [ Q c2 ]  no where for king to go!
 [ N x e4 ]  [ B x e4 ]  [ Q f6 ] , [ b5 ]  I was thinking along the lines of other games and I remember the common theme of White's wins is the attack on the Queen-side. lol
 [ N f3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ e4 ] , [ d x e4 ]  3. ..... [ d x e4 ] - this move leads to an interesting gambit.
 [ R c6 ]  [ K f7 ]  [ R c7 + ]  [ K f8 ]  [ R f1 ]  [ Q a4 ] , [ B x h5 ]  Breakthrough.
 [ N g5 + ] , [ K f6 ]  As my opponent later explained to me after deciding that [ K e8 ] loses a bishop to [ N e6 ] he decided to go to [ f6 ] (unfortunately losing the king...) ************************************** Q. Can you see a forced checkmate in 6 for white? **************************************
 [ R b3 ]  [ a4 ] , [ R a3 ]  If
 [ Q c4 ]  [ Q h5 + ]  [ K f6 ]  [ N e7 ] , [ g6 ]  [ g6 ] will lead to a mate in six moves I think! Later on I'll put the puzzle on gk! Here you have the solution too :p
 [ B x e4 ]  [ R x e4 ] , [ R c1 ]  and black resigns. My plan was to play Nd4.
 [ g x f5 ] , [ e x f5 ]  From this move on I'm going after his queen.
 [ R x e7 + ] , [ B x e7 ]  In addition to the material advantage the bishop is used to capture the rook which opens up the possibility of castling.
 [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ] , [ d4 ]  Most common response by white to the Sicillian is to exchange pawns. This allows for fast development by white but at a cost of losing one of his centre pawns. For black the exchange opens the c file which unbeknown to me at this point was critical to the rsult of this game.
 [ R e1 ]  [ Q x c3 ] , [ B x h6 ]  Eliminating one defender from the area. I also considered 18.[ B g5 ] as the f7-pawn is pinned but I felt that the text was stronger.
 [ f x e4 ]  [ f x e4 ]  [ N x e4 ] , [ B g4 ]  Again an aggressive gesture but ineffective.
 [ R h1 ] , [ R g1 ]  ...and again...
 [ d3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ B e7 ] , [ O-O-O ]  The first indication of what white is planning. Looking to start a K-Side pawn storm after O-O however I won't commit myself this early
 [ Q x c4 ]  [ N e3 ] , [ Q b3 ]  Winning another pawn for Black
 [ d5 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ f6 ]  [ B h4 ] , [ N h6 ]  I haven't played this opening before. I am sure I followed some kind of weird DB moves trying to explore some kind of unusual and interesting game. Well it got interesting much faster than I anticipated. I don't like Knight on h and a line anyways. What was I thinking?
 [ R c8 ]  [ N d f3 ] , [ h6 ]  reaction to the mouthing pressure
 [ e3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ B d3 ] , [ B g6 ]  retreating was better than taking since taking his bishop helps white develop his queen.
 [ e3 ]  [ O-O ] , [ N f3 ]  White controls a big amount of squarest on the queenside
 [ Q e2 ] , [ h5 ]  Starting a futile but annoying attack.
 [ a4 ] , [ N g4 ]  Now that the Q-side is almost closed I finally decide to attack on the K-side. The intention is to go with [ f5 ] ex[ f5 ] Bxf5.
 [ R f1 ] , [ Q g8 ]  Black's Q and R are where they were in the beginning stages of the game.
 [ N x d3 ]  [ R x d3 ] , [ N c5 ]  In the after math black puts pressure on Joe's [ R d3 ] to gain time.
 [ Q e7 ] , [ B c2 ]  Anticipating the Knight to come to c5.
 [ d4 ] , [ e x d4 ]  I did not want to see her play P-[ Q5 ] and blow apart my position.
 [ R g1 ]  [ B x b3 ]  [ B x b3 ]  [ N c7 ]  [ R g7 + ]  [ K f8 ]  [ R g1 ]  [ N b5 ]  [ B c2 ]  [ a2 ]  [ N g4 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ R g2 ]  [ N x f3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ K f7 ]  [ N g4 ] , [ N d4 ]  Black fails to see [ R h8 + ] but just for few moves. Time is running out.
 [ d5 ]  [ e3 ] , [ a6 ]  Looking to block Bishop [ b5 ] - but pointless move as if bishop did dvance then [ c6 ] would have worked and given black a stronger pawn structure. if situation did arise black could also block check with knight [ d7 ] and develop knight
 [ R h6 ]  [ Q h4 ] , [ Q f5 ]  Black still wants to protect [ f6 ] and redevelop the knight. There is also a potential threat to the pawn on c2. White has a winning move but misses it.
 [ b4 ]  [ R b6 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ R a6 ]  [ b5 ]  [ R x a3 ]  [ b6 ]  [ R b3 ]  [ K f4 ]  [ K f7 ]  [ N c5 ]  [ R x b6 ]  [ K g4 ]  [ R b4 + ]  [ K g3 ]  [ K e7 ]  [ N a6 ]  [ R c4 ]  [ N b8 ]  [ K d8 ] , [ K f3 ]  ? White cannot win without that pawn. The best white can hope for would be a draw.
 [ N c6 ]  [ h3 ] , [ h6 ]  13. ..... [ h6 ] - this move is fairly OK but this pawn will become fodder for Chris' dsb later on.
 [ R f3 + ]  [ K e5 ]  [ R e3 + ]  [ K f6 ] , [ N g4 + ]  A zwischenzug which helps White's passed pawn go through quicker.
 [ N d e2 ]  [ Q a5 ]  [ B h6 ]  [ B x h6 ]  [ Q x h6 ] , [ R f c8 ]  Godfrey: Do you think I could be excused please? I find chess such an exciting game after an hour or two I always feel that I need.... Mainwaring: Yes Godfrey go and be quick we need all the brains we can get here.
 [ f4 ]  [ N a2 ]  [ R x c1 ] , [ N x c1 ]  now my idea is that my b pawn will monopolize his knight and my knoght can come back to defense.
 [ h4 ]  [ N e2 ] , [ K f5 ]  For the next 10 moves Black probes on the K-side looking for a way through. White seems to have few problems holding Black out.
 [ R e7 ]  [ R f4 ] , [ B a2 ]  No Bd4. But white is losing to badly and needs a miracle.
 [ Q x a1 + ]  [ Q d1 ]  [ Q x d1 + ]  [ K x d1 ]  [ a5 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ N a6 ]  [ e5 ]  [ f x e5 ]  [ R x e5 + ]  [ K d8 ]  [ R x a5 ]  [ K c7 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ R h e8 ]  [ N b3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ R h5 ]  [ R e6 ]  [ R f5 ]  [ R f8 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ R e5 ] , [ R f4 ]  Mm I kind of like Rf6. Black might respond with [ R h5 ] then white moves h3. [ R g5 ] g3... White's pawns defend each other. [ R c5 ] or (better) [ R a5 ] would be bad for black as [ N e6 + ] ends with white trading a knight for a rook (PxN RxR).
 [ N c6 ]  [ R d4 d6 ] , [ R c8 ]  coordinating the forces. I had to think: it is only one pawn it is only one pawn... but freedom is claerly clever.
 [ B f6 ] , [ R a d1 ]  White is loth to retreat its knight and throw away a move but [ B x f5 ] [ e x f5 ] [ e4 ] would be terrible for White as bishop knight would be forked and a discovered attack on the rook would also be revealed. [ R a b1 ] was my first instinct to avoid this wicked fate but the doubling on the d file could have some nasty implications for Black....
 [ R b1 + ]  [ K g2 ]  [ R g1 + ]  [ K x g1 ]  [ d3 ] , [ K g2 ]  ? The king doesn't need to be there for RxPh5#.
 [ K d7 ] , [ N f3 ]  But I decide to move this knight out instead so I can castle.
 [ R e2 ] , [ B d2 ]  Rook for a Bishop pawn looked like a good exchange at this point. I cannot remember if I was trying to prevent [ R c2 ] (which does not seem so bad to me now) or whether I was vacating [ f4 ] so my rook could go there for a devastating attack on his pawns effectively forcing him to trade rooks.
 [ B d7 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N g6 ]  [ e5 ] , [ N e7 ]  ?? exposes pawn on [ h6 ]  [ K g8 ] , [ Q h5 ]  Mate inevitable on h7.
 [ N e g5 ] , [ B b4 ]  another interesting move 10.[ N d g5 ] !? pins the black LSB on [ e6 ] threats to take it on he's next move and win a pawn and by the way blacks [ d4 ] pawn is under attack . there for blacks plays 10...[ B b4 ] with a tempo ( attacks the whit rook on [ e1 ] ) but Morphy finds a great way to advance hes advantage by another scarifies .
 [ Q x c2 ] , [ N x h8 ]  I take H8 in order to raise my moral.
 [ d x e4 ] , [ a3 ]  This is a good move. The threat is black plays [ e3 ] and white has no new defense against Nxc2+. The fork must be defended against and pushing the knight does that.
 [ B x d5 + ] , [ K a7 ]  King hides from the bishop but an earlier move (26. B36) exposed the black's back row to the white queen.
 [ B a4 ] , [ b5 ]  Now I really had to evaluate if 7.[ B [ b3 ] ] was safe. As some will recall in an annotation by someone who I also mentored he annotated a move and I said the B should've move back as would be here. And they accurately pointed out that I was wrong as he'd lose the B when the opponent boxes it in with one of my pawns. Then in one of my more recent games I made that same mistake. So I really had to evaluate and as usual which is why it's important do my HW to figure out if 7.[ B [ b3 ] ] and if not how he'd win a piece. After careful considerations I determined that retreating to [ b3 ] is in fact the right move.
 [ Q d3 ] , [ N c6 ]  Preparing to castle into safety on the Q-side.
 [ N f3 ]  [ B d7 ] , [ B e3 ]  Overprotecting [ d4 ]  [ N g e7 ] , [ B d3 ]  Planning to exchange the knight after ... [ N f5 ]  [ N f5 ]  [ B x f5 ]  [ e x f5 ]  [ a3 ] , [ B e7 ]  Losing a pawn so ... [ B x c3 + ] is probably better
 [ N d7 ]  [ b x c6 ] , [ R x c6 ]  Now for the free pawn.
 [ R d7 ]  [ R e3 ]  [ R d1 + ]  [ B f1 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ K f2 ]  [ R c8 ]  [ h4 ]  [ R c d8 ] , [ K g1 ]  This is a dreadful move allowing black to obtain an overwhelming position.
 [ K c4 ]  [ B d2 ]  [ N d3 ]  [ K c6 ] , [ N x b4 + ]  The last mistake after which White could have resigned
 [ B x d7 + ]  [ Q x d7 ]  [ Q x d4 ] , [ c5 ]  Rather dubious. Better here was [ N f6 ] [ N e7 ] or [ a6 ] which prepare O-O-O althought the A7 square is extremely weak.
 [ N c6 ] , [ N g5 ]  A weak move. too easy to defend. I think he missed my next move. Better is a move like 4. [ N c3 ] or 4.0-0
 [ N f3 ] , [ B g4 ]  9. ...... [ B g4 ] - development and pin.
 [ N e5 ]  [ h5 ]  [ N x d3 + ] , [ R x d3 ]  18. [ R x d3 ] - my rook ends up on a rather unfortunate square. I decide to keep on with my plan of a kingside mating attack with moving Glenda onto the g file next move and push my g pawn further up the board making contact with the black h pawn. I miscalculate black's threat big time.
 [ e4 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d4 ] , [ e6 ]  I had the feeling that I misplayed this opening badly. I think I should have been more aggressive and I opened a line I should not have.
 [ B x h6 ]  [ B x h6 ]  [ Q x h6 ]  [ Q x f2 ]  [ K d2 ] , [ N f4 ]  another good move threating to win a free piece and cutts off the whites queen the diagonale for help .
 [ K c6 ] , [ K d4 ]  expected moves
 [ f6 ]  [ e x f6 ] , [ Q x f6 ]  Exchange of pawns.
 [ f5 ]  [ Q g3 ]  [ Q e8 ]  [ c4 ] , [ Q g6 ]  Queen exchange offered. Black probably wants rid of those pesky Queen attacks.
 [ e6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ d6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ c6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N e7 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ N g6 ]  [ g3 ]  [ h6 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ e5 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ B f1 ]  Actually moving my bishop was a mistake So I decided to move it to [ g2 ] I lost 2 moves in this mistaked move.
 [ R a1 + ]  [ K g2 ]  [ R c1 ] , [ N x f7 ]  I get this weak pawn.
 [ B e6 ] , [ Q x d4 ]  23. [ Q x d4 ] - sigh I Joanne was right Turstin does perish to the Wicked Witch. Now Fou Leblanc must stay on Sector [ e6 ] to stop that footman on [ e5 ] opening up a nasty line for that evil Henrietta Maria. No Henry does not want any truck with Catholic queens. Neither do I said Gareth my great-grandfather was burned at Smithfield Market by that horrible old Catholic harridan Bloody Mary. Sorry to hear that Gareth I said I comforted him with the words - still since Good Old Queen Bess drove back the Spanish Armada we have not had the Spanish Inquisition set foot in this country. Now I will see if I can trap Archbishop Laud.....
 [ B e8 ]  [ R d4 d2 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ Q e3 ]  [ Q e7 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ K h8 ] , [ K b2 ]  The game slows down as both men maneuver for positional advantage.
 [ b x c3 ]  [ B x c3 ] , [ d5 ]  It should be a losing move but it brings a lot of pressure on black. Hope I can fish something positive out of this. At any rate 11...[ B x a1 ] is not (seems to me) a bad move at all.
 [ N d4 ]  [ N x d4 ] , [ R x d4 ]  20. ....... [ R x d4 ] - Ken also allows his knight to be traded off but at a price - he puts his rook in a dominant position.
 [ B g4 ] , [ N d6 ]  The point is that Black cannot take the pawn on e2.
 [ O-O ] , [ O-O ]  With my light squared Bishop and Queen on the board Black's king seem awfully exposed to attack after the castle
 [ b x c6 ] , [ O-O ]  Now I castle.
 [ K x d6 ]  [ b1 = Q ] , [ K x c5 ]  he munches trying to get his pawn a clear passage
 [ e4 ]  [ e6 ] , [ h4 ]  My very oldest and latest thought in this opening. To the chess addict nurtured on spineless convention this move comes like a slap in the face--but calm down dear reader; after all you cannot be expected to understand such moves. (Forgive me - it is not your fault until now no one has opened your eyes and ears.) Wait just a little while and there will pass before you a miracle of overprotection of more than earthly beauty. (I assume that I rightly surmise that you are quite familiar with my great theory of overprotection.)
 [ R b1 + ] , [ K f2 ]  ?! I was about to move 28. [ K h2 ] but then to my horror I found a way for black to win my queen: 28. [ K h2 ] [ B x c6 ] 29. [ d x c6 ] Qe5ch 30. [ Q g3 ] Rh1ch 31. [ K x h8 ] Qxg3. Here I stopped analyzing but the joke is on black (or perhaps Nosferatu who missed it) after all since after 32. [ c7 ] (remember this brave infantryman?) I can simply promote a queen as there is no move black can make to cover the [ c8 ] square. Not seeing this I figured 28. [ K f2 ] was forced. After 28. [ K h2 ] black has many more ways to go wrong than white.
 [ B x e2 ]  [ Q x e2 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ N x c6 ] , [ b x c6 ]  10. ...... [ b x c6 ] - now one pair of knights has disappeared from the board.
 [ K x h3 ]  [ K e3 ]  [ K g2 ]  [ K f4 ] , [ h4 ]  and my opponent resigns. he told me he was miscalculated by 1 square. i have to note here. this is the third clear game i remember a situation like this. where a player makes the end game mistake of forgetting the 1 square buffer around kings when analyzing ahead. as for me i think my 3 correct "predictions" helped me figure out when it was the right time to exchange out material to be on the 1 square lead and not behind in the end game race. i hope you all enjoyed the game. comments appreciated. boy was i happy to decline the draw. heres to hoping i tie our score 2-2 and win our 4th session hehe
 [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ g6 ]  But this is where it differs since 5...[ a6 ] is generally played.
 [ a6 ]  [ B c4 ] , [ K a5 ]  30. ...... [ K a5 ] - and now that king arrives on a5. But how can I ensure he cops Old Matey you can trust jstevens1 to make heavy weather of it though!
 [ N f6 ] , [ N e5 ]  My thinking here was to destabilise his protection of the dark bishop. Looking back now I guess I should have worked on development possibly I could have moved a3. Computer says taking the bishop was better.
 [ N c2 ] , [ B e6 ]  positioned so 12..... [ b4 ] 13.cx[ b4 ] ax[ b4 ] 14. either q[ b1 ] rendering it useless for a while or b3. giving me a territorial advantage and giving white less room to maneuver.
 [ N f6 ] , [ Q d2 ]  White threats [ h6 ] and is ready to castle. His position look fine.
 [ N d3 + ]  [ K f1 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ g3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B x c6 ]  [ b x c6 ]  [ g2 ] , [ c7 ]  I was low on time here as was my opponent. I believe pushing the B pawn would have been a better choice so it cannot simply be captured once black promotes.
 [ N f6 ] , [ N c3 ]  Not the most common move but perfectly playable.
 [ N e2 ]  [ d5 ]  [ Q x a1 ]  [ e4 + ]  [ K c2 ]  [ R h e8 ] , [ Q g1 ]  Attacking the [ a7 ] pawn.
 [ R a2 ] , [ Q c7 ]  16.
 [ K x g2 ]  [ g5 ]  [ R f1 ] , [ K g7 ]  Breaking the pin on the f pawn.
 [ N x c6 ]  [ Q x d6 ]  [ Q x h8 + ]  [ Q f8 ] , [ Q x f8 + ]  I took the queen exchange as with a rook and a pawn advantage together with better development I fancied my chances.
 [ N c6 ] , [ e5 ]  This prevents [ N e5 ] which is good for black.
 [ N d7 ] , [ R a g2 # ]  Simple. White had an excellent attack in this game although he could have mated much quicker than he did.
 [ O-O ]  [ B g5 ] , [ h6 ]  i like positions with black Q on [ f6 ] or [ b6 ] but i am poor in cramped positions.. if he takes my knight it could bee bad for me
 [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ c5 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ d6 ]  [ e4 ] , [ g6 ]  6. ..... [ g6 ] - preparing for a kingside fianchetto.
 [ N f3 ] , [ f5 ]  Black goes with 1...f5. Not what I usually see. Often I see 1...[ d4 ] which leads into a Queen's Gambit game.
 [ d x e5 ] , [ N x e5 ]  of course [ d x e5 ] is much safer...
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ N f6 ]  The Russian or Petroff is a popular opening at high levels Kramnik using it to win the first game of the 2004 world championship match against Leko.
 [ c3 ] , [ B x c3 ]  The key to the position now is are White's central pawns a strength or a weakness? They dominate the central dark squares but Black can hope to undermine them. One point is that Black does not want to play [ e6 ] because this would make [ f6 ] more difficult. (Fritz: -0.18)
 [ R x g6 + ]  [ K e7 ] , [ e4 ]  Unblocking my bishop.
 [ e x d5 ] , [ c x d5 ]  the diagonal is closed but I guess everyone has seen the dangerous e column. pawn king queen. A potential catastrophy.
 [ K g7 ]  [ Q d4 + ] , [ K h7 ]  ? Well now I should have took the gusto with 23...f6.
 [ e5 ]  [ d4 ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ c5 ]  As far the center game opening goes I do not believe this move is sound. It doesn't develop black in a meaningful way in fact I think it actually becomes harder for black to defend out of this position. [ N c6 ] I think is the right choice.
 [ R e1 ] , [ R e8 ]  Contesting the crucial open e file. I later realised this to be a mistake. [ N x e4 ] [ d x e4 ] then [ R e8 ] is a much better alternative as will be explained.
 [ a4 ]  [ a3 ] , [ R b a8 ]  trying to get out
 [ N c3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B c4 ] , [ B b4 ]  A little off beat...
 [ K h8 ] , [ Q d2 ]  Time to defend. Maybe [ B f2 ] would have be better but I keep underdeveloped. I am planning to castle queenside and either [ c4 ] or Nc3.
 [ h x g5 ]  [ B g3 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ Q e3 ]  Not that much for attacking the g-pawn but to drop the LSB to e2. That would increase the scope of the d1-rook and monitor a black knight that is likely to go to [ f4 ] via h5.
 [ B e3 ]  [ Q b4 ] , [ Q e2 ]  Botvinnik grapples to respond to Tal's 15th move.
 [ e x d5 ]  [ Q h6 ]  [ N e5 ] , [ N x d4 ]  The sacrifice. I hoped it would work.
 [ h x g4 ]  [ f x g4 ] , [ Q e3 ]  I moved my queen there to take his pawn [ h3 ]  [ Q x h3 + ] , [ K g1 ]  and from here it is easy
 [ N e5 ] , [ R e4 ]  Out of the blue came a major saver for my game! I had to pray to Cthulhu for making this possible!
 [ B g2 ] , [ N e5 ]  White drove the knight away but not far and now black offers an exchange.
 [ N x d3 ]  [ N f7 ]  [ a4 ]  [ N h8 ]  [ a3 ]  [ N g6 ]  [ a2 ]  [ N f4 + ] , [ K e4 ]  !?
 [ N x d5 + ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ K x d5 ]  [ K a3 ]  [ K e5 ]  [ b4 ]  [ K f5 ]  [ K x a2 ]  [ K x g5 ]  [ b3 ]  [ K h6 ]  [ b2 ]  [ g5 ]  [ b1 = Q ]  [ g6 ]  [ a4 ]  [ g7 ]  [ Q b8 ]  [ K h7 ]  [ a3 ]  [ g8 = Q + ]  [ Q x g8 + ]  [ K x g8 ] , [ K b3 ]  Kudos to my opponent for a very tenacious game. Luckily just before I queened the first pawn I took a long hard look at my options and realized she would be able to force the loss of that queen. As a result I prepared for its eventual loss by focusing on the promotion of the 2nd pass pawn.
 [ N f6 ] , [ B c2 ]  Defending my pawn. Perhaps too passive of a move but it does open up the possibility for a [ b4 ] push in the future. I wasn't looking to chase the [ f6 ] knight just yet.
 [ N x b6 ]  [ a x b6 ] , [ B g4 ]  It is to your disadvantage to trade (or offer trades) here. When your opponent is ahead in material (in this case a knight) it only leads to an endgame where you are behind. If we keep trading equal items I will have a knight lead in the end game. Your best chance for a win or a draw is to aggressively try to win back material. In addition you get doubled pawns after the trade. They are bad because they can't defend each other.
 [ f6 ]  [ N x d7 ] , [ B x d7 ]  Now as white I cannot say I have a good position after the exchanges... so [ B d3 ] was not good either. But let's go on with the exchanges.
 [ R a1 ]  [ K e5 ]  [ R c1 ] , [ K d5 ]  40. ...... [ K d5 ] - my pawns can go no further but can Jiri's?
 [ N x a6 ]  [ b5 ] , [ B b7 ]  this finish is easily won for black thanks to the zugswang mechanism.
 [ Q x e5 ]  [ B f6 ]  [ Q f5 ]  [ N d7 ] , [ N d5 ]  ! White dominates the centre with ideas such as delivering check from [ e7 ] and forking Black's Q (not immediately feasible due to the [ B f6 ] but what if Black were tempted to win the exchange on a1?)
 [ Q d6 ] , [ g4 + ]  This forces the King to surrender the [ g2 ] square.
 [ B a4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B e7 ] , [ N c3 ]  So far pretty standard. However this knight development is a little off the modern beaten track. I knew a correspondence player in this country who used to play this with the express purpose of continuing to [ d5 ] and exchanging on e7. Otherwise I don't really know what theory lies behind this move.
 [ R x g5 ]  [ B x g5 ]  [ Q x g5 ]  [ Q f3 ] , [ N e7 ]  Again combining attack and defense.
 [ K d6 ]  [ N x a6 ]  [ N f7 ]  [ N b4 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ b3 ]  [ N g4 ]  [ f3 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ K e3 ]  [ g5 ] , [ K d4 ]  and now Black cannot avoid losing a third pawn so she throws in the towel. Please leave a comment or two and don't forget to rate my annotation to let me know how I am doing!
 [ R a b8 ] , [ N d2 ]  saving his knight.
 [ K f2 ]  [ R x e2 + ] , [ K x e2 ]  I was very impressed with the way my opponent played this game especially his never say die attitude. I learnt a very important lesson here about not getting sloppy as there is almost always chance for your opponent to slip up and miss the chance for a win.
 [ R x b8 ] , [ R e8 + ]  Now I have a chance to get something big here
 [ e x d4 ]  [ N b5 ] , [ c5 ]  very interesting. Classical Chess: Hold the center with pawns. White must seek an answer to ...[ a6 ] pushing the N to [ a3 ] and minimal center influence.
 [ Q d3 ]  [ Q x d3 ] , [ B x d3 ]  the message is clear: Whites' center pawns will fall...
 [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ] , [ e6 ]  I wanted to go for the Nimzowich defence with 3...[ B b4 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ c5 ]  Attacking the white center. Maybe castling first is better. That's what most Game DB suggest.
 [ N x c3 ]  [ b x c3 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ h3 ]  [ B h5 ]  [ Q e1 ]  [ f6 ] , [ R b1 ]  Honestly I'm unsure of the point of this move.
 [ B x g6 ] , [ h x g6 ]  Taking the [ d5 ] pawn would have allowed a back rank mate. By capturing at [ g6 ] I gave my King a flight square.
 [ a4 + ] , [ K b4 ]  Now a Bishop check at [ d2 ] would mean mate.
 [ c5 ] , [ B c4 ]  I know - Knights before bishops however if it is going to come out eventually its all the same
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ a6 ]  [ B a4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ d3 ]  [ b5 ]  [ B b3 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ N c3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ B x d5 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ b3 ]  [ R b8 ]  [ c4 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ c x b5 ]  [ a x b5 ]  [ b4 ]  [ c6 ]  [ B b3 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ B d2 ]  [ Q b6 ]  [ a4 ]  [ b x a4 ]  [ R x a4 ]  [ R b a8 ]  [ Q c2 ]  [ R x a4 ]  [ B x a4 ] , [ R a8 ]  Honestly i dont know if I'd have any compensation if white played [ Q c6 ] here. My bishop at [ e7 ] would remain paralized.
 [ N e6 ]  [ b x a5 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B a6 ] , [ N d5 ]  I thought of exchanging my knight to get rid of [ f6 ] knight which is putting a lot of pressure on my [ e4 ] pawn.
 [ Q c5 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ B g7 ] , [ B g4 ]  White's central pawn! one of his most important pieces (controlling [ e5 ] and exerting control of [ f6 ] and [ d6 ] was his last hope in saving his center. Better here is 15.[ R e1 ] and eventually [ K f3 ] and Queen to follow if additional support is needed. As Black my focus the whole game was my pawn on d5. Making sure it was reinforced as needed and waiting to advance the d and c pawn on the endgame. Better here for White was 15.[ f4 ] or [ N f3 ] Took a lesson with a GM once and the FIRST thing he did was point to the four central squares of the board and say "this is what you're playing for". Like any game football-soccer-table hockey if you control the CENTER you control the whole playing field.
 [ K f2 ]  [ K e6 ]  [ K e3 ] , [ c5 ]  Not allowing a future Kd4.
 [ N e7 ] , [ d4 ]  Attempting to take over the center.
 [ N x d4 ] , [ N d5 + ]  If only my Queen were still on [ d1 ] this would be devastating.
 [ Q x e5 ] , [ Q c2 ]  So my opponent saw the move too and goes for it. White is threatening mate now of course.
 [ K f3 ]  [ e4 + ] , [ K x f4 ]  Mate in 1.
 [ B x c4 ]  [ Q x c6 + ]  [ K f8 ]  [ d x c4 ] , [ N x h4 ]  Now the best move is 15. Qe4.
 [ Q x f2 + ]  [ K x f2 ] , [ N f7 ]  Now it is obvious that the [ h6 ] pawn is doomed - but I had no idea if this ending can actually be won. Bishop pair is usually extremely problematic in such positions - Black has 3 pawn islands and the board is wide open.
 [ d x c4 ]  [ Q x d1 ] , [ R x d1 + ]  !
 [ K g1 ]  [ Q b1 + ]  [ K f2 ] , [ Q x b2 + ]  Wins the pawn and now is a pawn up.
 [ K g2 ] , [ N x e2 ]  This was getting a little anoying. I decided to give him a taste of his own medicine and threaten mate
 [ R f1 ]  [ R f8 ]  [ R x f8 + ]  [ K x f8 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ B x b2 ]  [ Q f5 + ]  [ Q f7 ]  [ Q c8 + ]  [ K g7 ]  [ Q x b7 ]  [ B e5 ]  [ N d2 ]  [ Q g6 ]  [ Q b4 ]  [ K f8 ]  [ Q b3 ]  [ Q a6 ]  [ N c4 ]  [ B f6 ]  [ h3 ]  [ K e8 ]  [ K h2 ]  [ c6 ]  [ Q b8 + ]  [ K d7 ]  [ N e5 + ]  [ B x e5 + ]  [ Q x e5 ]  [ c5 ]  [ Q f5 + ]  [ K d8 ]  [ Q x h7 ]  [ Q d6 + ]  [ K g1 ]  [ Q x d5 ]  [ Q c2 ]  [ c4 ]  [ K f2 ]  [ c3 ] , [ Q x c3 ]  1/2 1/2
 [ Q x c2 ]  [ Q x a5 ] , [ f5 ]  [The game is already strategically decided. White has no reasonable defence to ...f5-[ [ f4 ] ] and in some cases onwards to f3] - I wonder what [ [ f4 ] ] would achieve here though - simply worsening the position of the bishop?
 [ d4 ] , [ N e7 ]  preparing to open the c-file
 [ K g2 ]  [ K h4 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ B e4 ]  [ N b3 ] , [ K f1 ]  Now the c-pawn falls and suddenly White is on the defensive...
 [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ] , [ B c4 ]  The most common moves here are 3. [ d4 ] (The Open Sicilian) and moves like 3. [ B b5 + ] (The Moscow Variation) however my opponent played this [ B [ c4 ] ] move. I always see this move yet I feel it's basically handing Black equalization as Black can usually build up a nice center with ...[ e6 ] and ...[ d5 ] to follow (which would also kick the [ c4 ] bishop with tempo).
 [ Q c7 + ]  [ K d4 ]  [ Q x b8 ]  [ K x c4 ]  [ Q e5 ]  [ K d3 ]  [ N d6 ]  [ K c2 ]  [ Q c3 + ]  [ K b1 ]  [ N c4 ]  [ K x a2 ]  [ b4 ]  [ c x b4 ] , [ Q b2 # ]  The moral of this game is something that I learned from chesskingdom64 which I used to annotate a couple of games. But it applies here Sue and remembering this will help you to become a better player since I have problems with this myself. Well first is to be prepared for common openings like this. What goes into it however as he said was "The openings must be used with the greatest care. What you do in the opening will affect you in the midgame; what you do in the mid game will affect you in the endgame; what you do in the endgame will affect the final results." With that mistake in the opening Ken was able to tie down your pieces and thus win material which is what enabled white this win.
 [ K x b7 ] , [ Q x d8 ]  Black's cohesion is significantly better than White's but White is up a lot of material--if he can make it count. Unfortunately his KR is trapped in a tiny useless box and his QN is indirectly pinned by virtue of his Queen on d8--if White moves the [ N c3 ] Black has ...Bb4+! followed by ...Rxd8.
 [ R a2 + ]  [ N f2 ] , [ R x f2 # ]  In this game I sacrifice a bishop to Queen a pawn and deliver checkmate. I noticed that my opponent moved his knights over six times in the game losing a lot of tempos.
 [ K g2 ] , [ B e7 ]  prepare to castle
 [ Q c2 ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ] , [ N e5 ]  Now each player has a Knight on a good center square. Black still has a little development to complete but after some preparation again e3-[ e4 ] and driving the White Knight away with ...[ c5 ] he may be able to bring his Bishop out with tempo to f5.
 [ B x d3 ] , [ R x d3 ]  I am starting to like this moving tower :)
 [ O-O ] , [ B d6 ]  I am leaving plenty of room for a white's attack on the queenside but I was confident my opponent didn't seem to go for quick attack either.
 [ B d1 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ B a4 ]  [ N e2 ]  [ K f3 ] , [ N c3 ]  Success. N on [ c3 ] plus attack on the bishop. A tough game. White resigns.
 [ B e4 ] , [ c3 ]  White moves his LB to [ e4 ] probably looking to capture the d pawn if it attempts to move to the light square at [ d3 ] and same for c pawn moving to c2. I move pawn to c3.
 [ d x e5 ]  [ N g4 ] , [ e4 ]  Alekhine variation? Or the old mainline?
 [ f3 ] , [ N e3 ]  The Royal Dinner Pin coming right up.
 [ e4 ]  [ c6 ]  [ f4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ N g5 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B c4 ] , [ e6 ]  I still look foward to the day I get to play the Bg4?! line in a proper game.
 [ Q d4 ]  [ B f6 ]  [ Q x b2 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ c4 ]  [ B x h8 ] , [ K d8 ]  Heading to the exit.
 [ R a d8 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ Q f7 ]  [ B x e6 ]  [ Q x e6 ] , [ Q c4 ]  White is eyeing trading queens and playing [ N c4 ] and Nd6. The computer prefers playing [ N c4 ] instead. White's knight is more useful than Black's "bad" bishop.
 [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ B x c6 ]  [ d x c6 ]  [ d3 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ N b d2 ]  [ Q e7 ]  [ h3 ]  [ B h5 ]  [ g4 ]  [ B g6 ]  [ N c4 ]  [ f6 ]  [ g5 ] , [ O-O-O ]  We got to this position (im playing black) and he's challenging my pawn at f6.. which I cant move cus its defending the one on e5... and if he were to put a knight there i'd be in big trouble since I'd have no pawns to shoo it away with.
 [ R x c1 + ] , [ B x c1 ]  Now the bishop is badly placed.
 [ Q b2 ] , [ R e8 ]  Now 19... N-[ N6 ] dbl ch would win the White KR.
 [ K c7 ]  [ R g7 + ]  [ K b8 ] , [ R e8 # ]  finished!!!
 [ R x c2 + ]  [ K e3 ] , [ K f8 ]  The idea is to stop White's only winning chance right away...the supported [ d5 ] passer.
 [ N b6 ]  [ a5 ] , [ N a4 ]  Hoping I will take on a4. Of course I see through the trap.
 [ N g8 ] , [ h4 ]  I expect he wants to free up the file for his rooks.
 [ g x f4 ] , [ g4 ]  
 [ B g6 ]  [ Q x e7 + ]  [ K h8 ] , [ f4 ]  Because of black's exposed king I now get to cash in.
 [ b x c3 ] , [ Q x c3 + ]  Correctly White wants to exchange Queens and go in an endgame with the advantage.
 [ O-O ]  [ N f6 ] , [ B g5 ]  I'm not letting this knight go any further. Also I'm almost done with my development.
 [ Q c7 ]  [ b4 ] , [ R e d8 ]  activate the rook to [ d8 ] .
 [ N e4 ] , [ B x e4 ]  Taking the knight with the idea of simplifying the position since I am winning on material.
 [ Q e7 ] , [ N f3 ]  Preparing to castle and unpin his KP.
 [ B x d3 ] , [ Q x d3 ]  only
 [ K g2 ]  [ N h4 + ] , [ K h1 ]  king in a safe place.
 [ B b4 ]  [ R a8 ]  [ R b6 ] , [ R e8 ]  My plan is to use the bishop to further speed up the mate.
 [ N x e5 ] , [ d x e5 ]  Now I'm the one with the suffering pawn structure.
 [ h x g5 ] , [ B x g5 ]  So white is regaining the piece.
 [ b4 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ R b3 ] , [ N b5 ]  Establishing the knight on a good square.
 [ B x d6 ]  [ Q x d6 ]  [ R a e1 ]  [ N g5 ]  [ N h f3 ] , [ N e4 ]  if white accepts the trade he allows the d-pawn to advance on the e-file but as an isolated pawn.
 [ R d c1 + ]  [ K b4 ]  [ R x c5 ] , [ K x c5 ]  31. ....... [ K x c5 ] - now one pair of rooks is traded off and I now pick off the [ e5 ] pawn with my rook increasing the pressure on black still further.
 [ K g8 ]  [ R x g5 + ]  [ h x g5 ]  [ Q x g5 + ]  [ Q g6 ]  [ Q x d8 + ]  [ K h7 ]  [ N f6 + ]  [ K g7 ] , [ Q h8 # ]  Finally an ending worth Gameknot! Please do help this annotation and my yearning for learning.....thekingni......
 [ B e3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B d3 ] , [ Q c7 ]  Both players continue with natural development.
 [ K f8 ]  [ Q c5 + ]  [ Q e7 + ]  [ Q x e7 + ] , [ K x e7 ]  Exchange of queens
 [ N d4 ]  [ R f2 ] , [ B e7 ]  Really!!!
 [ Q a5 ]  [ B g6 ]  [ N d6 ] , [ a4 ]  Once again my first thought was to move my bishop so as to start attacking blacks position however I decided to throw in another zwishenzug. This move gains queenside space and also takes away a few squares from the black queen. I can also follow up with [ b4 ] where the queen is basically out of useful squares since [ g5 ] would be the only safe square however that allows white to further break down blacks position liquidating into an easily winning endgame
 [ N c4 ] , [ Q x e4 + ]  Naturally...
 [ Q x f8 + ]  [ K h7 ] , [ Q x g7 # ]  And he gets smothered
 [ h x g3 ]  [ h x g3 ] , [ K f6 ]  His king is getting closer.
 [ N h f4 ] , [ Q f6 ]  If the premature 19...g5? then 20. Ng6... +/-. Nonetheless that variation is playable but risky - and with the advantage White would gain - damaging to Black's dominance on the kingside.
 [ B d6 ]  [ a x b4 ] , [ a x b4 ]  I though about swap rooks but he can just retake with the bishop. But I realized now I could have won a pawn in a fancy way:
 [ K e2 ] , [ Q x e4 + ]  Now I decide to go for material value by taking the pawn Qxe4+. Once again I am forcing him to move his King. His only legal option becomes Kf2.
 [ h5 ]  [ g5 ] , [ N h7 ]  This is an ugly position of the black knight on the [ h7 ] point but in fact it didn't have better places to retreat to. E8 and [ g8 ] points would be even worse.
 [ Q e1 ]  [ B x f3 ]  [ R x f3 ]  [ N b d7 ]  [ Q h4 ] , [ O-O-O ]  A BITTER DISSAPPOINTMENT FOR WHITE He stalled until White put the weight of the position on to the Kingside. Good timing by Black.
 [ N e6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ a6 ]  [ N d5 ] , [ b5 ]  ? A serious error. GK Analysis gives as best … [ N f6 ] 16. [ N x f6 + ] [ g x f6 ] 17. [ B d3 ] [ B h6 + ] 18. [ K b1 ] [ b5 ] 19. [ B e4 ] [ R b8 ] 20. [ R h e1 ] [ B b7 ] 21. [ B x b7 ] [ R x b7 ] 22. [ h4 ] [ a5 ] 23. [ R d5 ] O-O advantage White.
 [ N a5 ] , [ Q b4 ]  Now it is MY queen the one threatening a discovered check. Double.
 [ Q a5 ]  [ N x c6 ]  [ b x c6 ]  [ B d4 ]  [ B x d4 ]  [ Q x d4 ] , [ O-O ]  15. ....... O-O (black finally castles - her position has been weakened by the exchange of dark squared bishops). I now zero in on it.
 [ e4 ] , [ d5 ]  This was a great game for black considering white was a higher rated player. Note how Black set the tempo throughout the entire game and limited white's development.
 [ a x b5 ]  [ N x b5 ]  [ Q a5 + ]  [ c3 ] , [ R b8 ]  Obviously [ Q x b5 ] loses to [ N c7 + ] with Nxb5. Black's best try was actually 14..[ R a7 ] being wary of his queen's location..
 [ O-O ] , [ e5 ]  The black pawn on [ d6 ] is pinned so it's time to charge in and make a nuissance of myself.
 [ N x f5 ]  [ B x f5 ]  [ B x g7 ] , [ K x g7 ]  Black's king is now totally exposed :)!
 [ N f5 ] , [ Q h7 # ]  can anyone point out any flaws in my double bishop sacrifice comments welcome. i am still learning
 [ b x a3 ]  [ R x a3 ] , [ g3 ]  At this point I was thinking and had at one point played 32.Rb5. Why? Because I wanted another pawn. But this is where "It's not so easy". There was a mate threat that I had missed until my coach said something. He asked "can you see the threat"? At first I didn't see it but then I spotted and told him. I said that if I captured you would get a back rank mate on a1. So I told him that this is my only move and he said "That's right."
 [ R d8 + ]  [ K f7 ]  [ R f8 + ]  [ K g6 ]  [ R x f3 ]  [ K x g5 ]  [ R g3 + ]  [ K f6 ] , [ B f8 ]  Was this a good plan? Probably not. I looked hard for a tricky mate but I miss a tempo and the h pawn.
 [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ f3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ O-O-O ]  This is slowly gaining favor over the old 9.[ B c4 ] which though still difficult for Black is gaining new favor because of newly found resources one of them being the very modern and fashionable Chinese Dragon.
 [ K g2 ]  [ R x c1 ]  [ N x c1 ]  [ Q x c1 ]  [ R a2 ]  [ B b2 ]  [ Q e2 ]  [ B d4 ]  [ R c2 ]  [ Q g1 + ]  [ K f3 ] , [ B x a4 ]  And now the disaster begins...
 [ e x f5 ] , [ N x f5 ]  why not the bishop? because [ f5 ] has to serve as a heaven for the bishop and first I wanted to put my knight on d4...
 [ B g7 ]  [ d4 ]  [ N e7 ]  [ B g5 ] , [ d5 ]  bring it on Z...
 [ R x f2 + ]  [ K g1 ] , [ Q f7 ]  To be perfectly honest this move was my gamble. I had thought 24. ... [ Q g5 ] was more appropriate. Attacking [ g3 ] and [ e3 ] would have been awesome. In my haste though I saw an opportunity to give him some things to think about: Knight on g6; Bishop on b2; potential checkmate (if 25. [ N x e4 ] [ R x b2 ] 26. [ N x c5 ] Qf2++). I was shocked what happened next...
 [ N e5 ]  [ K f2 ] , [ c5 ]  Now I have attempted to bar any threat of a central imposing bishop. If 21.Bb2... then an exchange on [ e5 ] wouldn't be the worst because my rooks would soon attack the centre.
 [ K c2 ] , [ Q d4 ]  Now I had to take care of the threat against my g pawn.
 [ B x e4 ] , [ f3 ]  I began wishing I had played [ N d2 ] a move earlier. It would also have prevented the feared [ N g4 ] and would not have weakened g3. But now I was strongly considering [ [ f3 ] ] with [ [ [ e4 ] ] ] to follow leaving a gaping hole at g3. The question was whether my past mistake would affect my future decisions. If it did I was going to play [ B d3 ] but expect Nf6. Nevertheless I was heavily leaning toward the f3-[ [ [ e4 ] ] ] plan. I didn't want to give Black time for Nf6. I thought that without his dark squared bishop the hole wasn't a big deal. But I was aware of the Knight possibly eyeing [ g3 ] via [ f6 ] and h5. I thought that in that time I could play Bc1-e3-f2. Also on my mind was that a move earlier I had seen a possible 14... N[ [ [ e4 ] ] ] 15. Nx[ [ [ e4 ] ] ] Bx[ [ [ e4 ] ] ] 16. [ [ f3 ] ] [ B b7 ] 17. [ [ [ e4 ] ] ] [ e5 ] 18. [ d5 ] [ f5 ] 19. d6+. Even if Black were to not blunder into the discovered check she would need an extra move to attack the pawn chain if that course of action was intended. Anyway it was time to forge ahead. I was moving much more quickly after 13. Nd2.
 [ Q g4 ] , [ Q f1 ]  23. [ Q f1 ] (after he surprisingly backs off his queen I now organise a kingside defense)
 [ B x g2 + ]  [ K x g2 ]  [ Q e4 + ] , [ K h3 ]  This is the position where Allwermann claimed he could see a forced checkmate in 8 moves. Can you see it???
 [ R h8 ] , [ K d4 ]  Now it's time for black to ensure the rook-pawn exchange.
 [ d5 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ g6 ]  I was a bit taken a back with the fianchetto I presumed black would rather play an open game versus white's future cramped position but what do I know?
 [ B f4 ]  [ d6 ] , [ B x e5 ]  white cannot afford to continue to trade like this.
 [ B g4 ]  [ f3 ]  [ R x f3 ]  [ Q h4 ] , [ N f6 ]  Now White is really in trouble and the slow role of the pawns that Black has been pushing up the queenside will start to tell.
 [ R c7 ]  [ B x a2 ]  [ R x a7 ] , [ B c4 ]  Now not 36 ... Rxe2? 37 Ra8+! [ K g7 ] 38 Bxe2.
 [ B c5 ] , [ B e6 ]  Now there are two defenders. He can remove one.
 [ R d1 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ c4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ d5 ]  [ c x d5 ] , [ K f1 ]  An oversight here leads me into a mean looking fork on my R and N. I choose to protect my R.
 [ R g1 ]  [ R h8 h5 ]  [ K c2 ]  [ R d5 ]  [ R d1 ]  [ R g5 ] , [ R d2 ]  This loses at once. Fine analyses the toughest defence as 87. [ R f1 ] after which he shows a win as follows: 87 ...[ R g2 + ] 88. [ K [ c3 ] ] [ R h h2 ] 89. [ R c1 ] [ c5 ] 90. [ N f4 ] [ R a2 ] 91. [ N d3 ] Ra3! (now [ [ c4 ] ] is a threat) 92. [ R b1 ] [ [ c4 ] ] 93. [ N c1 ] K[ c5 ] 94. [ R b2 ] (the exchange of rooks is now tactically permissible because Black's last pawn would fall but Black himself can now avoid it) 94 ...[ R h3 + ] 95. [ K c2 ] [ c3 ] 96. [ R b1 ] Ra8! and there is no defence.
 [ h5 ]  [ h3 ]  [ N e2 ] , [ Q c2 ]  Here I was expecting a force of repetition.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N g e7 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c6 ]  [ B a4 ]  [ b5 ]  [ B b3 ]  [ B x d4 ]  [ Q x d4 ]  [ N e7 g6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N e2 ]  [ B a6 ]  [ N f4 ]  [ b4 ]  [ N x g6 ]  [ N x g6 ]  [ Q x b4 ]  [ B x f1 ]  [ K x f1 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ g3 ]  [ R a e8 ]  [ f3 ]  [ R e b8 ]  [ Q d4 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ Q d1 ]  [ R b6 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ R a6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ R b6 ]  [ Q d4 ]  [ d6 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ c5 ]  [ Q d5 ]  [ R x b2 ]  [ B d1 ]  [ h6 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ Q c6 ] , [ B e2 ]  Hi! This is a recent tournament game that ended in a win for me... I will only annotate the mid-game and checkmate sequence because anything that precedes that is terribly boring and trivial. Also the checkmate is the only highlight.......I play as black here.
 [ R e1 ] , [ R e5 ]  White resigned here. Black can keep taking pawns while moving the K to [ f7 ] to keep White's R from penetrating on the e file. White will be tied down to a hopeless defense of the K.
 [ B b5 ]  [ d6 ]  [ O-O ] , [ f5 ]  Nows the time for the queens gambit.
 [ Q d3 ] , [ b x a6 ]  Material equality. Black's c pawn is only two squares away from promotion but white has a frk attack between the 2 bishops
 [ h3 ] , [ f6 ]  I could have seen the opponent almost shaking with his hand hovering over the board. It was a mere 17 seconds before he made the time control.
 [ B x d1 ]  [ R x a5 ]  [ B x e2 ]  [ R e1 ] , [ B d3 ]  An even trade. I am still down two pawns.
 [ Q f6 ] , [ e4 ]  Attack knight
 [ N g e7 ]  [ f x e6 ] , [ f x e6 ]  pre-move on ICC pre-moves only take 0.1 seconds away from your time it would take longer than that just to move the mouse so I always pre-move captures.
 [ K x f2 ]  [ N g4 + ]  [ K g1 ]  [ N x e3 ] , [ Q d2 ]  Byrne: As I sat pondering why Fischer would choose such a line because it was so obviously lost for Black there suddenly comes...
 [ K b2 ] , [ B g1 ]  Bishops now fully mobile again poised to hunt down and kill.
 [ B g7 ] , [ B g5 ]  What does black want to do? BxN. PxB. QxP+. White keeps the rook but is down a pawn and cannot castle.
 [ Q f3 ]  [ R g2 ]  [ Q e3 + ]  [ R f2 ] , [ Q x g3 + ]  Well he could take b6...Maybe he didn't see it.....Me neither.
 [ e x d5 ]  [ c x d5 ] , [ N b4 ]  6...[ N e7 ] 7.[ N c3 ] seems good for white.
 [ d5 ]  [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ c4 ] , [ g6 ]  He obliges to a drawn-out siege war by sacrificing his [ d5 ] pawn and preparing to fianchetto.
 [ b x c4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ c x d4 ] , [ d x c4 ]  Which Black accepts.
 [ K d4 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ] , [ R c5 ]  There is no way for white to guard the d pawn with another piece than the king while I'm attacking it twice now. Knight on [ d6 ] is not 1 move away from anything as well but is a good follow up target.
 [ B d3 ] , [ g6 ]  to avoid [ Q h5 + ] (chess) and the rook is lost and the king go to a journey.
 [ c4 ]  [ g5 ] , [ B e5 ]  Of course not [ N f6 ] developing another piece (but allowing Nxg5) but...
 [ b x c4 ] , [ Q x d8 + ]  And this is a forced #!
 [ R d7 ] , [ N a5 ]  Rescuing the white knight.
 [ d x e4 ] , [ R x f6 ]  Knight taken - rook now operating from a central position - good position to trap king later.
 [ B x h2 + ]  [ N x h2 ]  [ B h5 ] , [ Q h4 ]  I'm thinking that I'd like to have the bishop on [ d6 ] to keep his rooks off of [ b8 ] and f8. And maybe I'll bring the knight to [ e5 ] again to harass pawns.
 [ K f1 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ R e1 ] , [ R a8 ]  White can press me with something but there nothing clear in one tempo...
 [ N x f5 ] , [ R x f5 ]  I had no answer for Q to d8. Maybe Q to g8?
 [ B g4 ] , [ R c8 x c2 ]  Unless I have missed something white is playing into black's hands. The plan now is to simplify and put pressure on the [ b4 ] pawn which will fall eventually and leave black with a won end game
 [ O-O-O ] , [ a6 ]  forcing decisions by white
 [ B e3 ] , [ Q e7 ]  Both sides are now just finishing development.
 [ N c4 ]  [ N x c4 ]  [ d x c4 ] , [ K e3 ]  Bishops of opposite colours give Black good drawing chances especially with the remote passed pawn but white's two sets of connected pawns give him hope for splitting Black's King's attention and forcing one pawn home.
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ d6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ B d3 ] , [ B e7 ]  I have had less personal success with the common and more aggressive ... [ B d6 ] which has the disadvantage of leaving Black's d pawn somewhat vulnerable.
 [ B x a7 ] , [ B e5 ]  .
 [ O-O ] , [ N b d7 ]  or (O-O). This is pretty much the traditional setup - White has recaptured the pawn and brought his King to safety to begin his plan of e4. White will try to achieve this through either [ Q e2 ] of Nh4.
 [ Q c7 ] , [ e5 ]  It was from here I began to drift a little. This losses a pawn I think
 [ N c5 ] , [ B d4 ]  I have to give at least one ? to white's 44th move. 44. Nc5? was the worst thing white could do in this situation as black's reply demonstrates. Now white loses his knight and the game. Maybe two question marks.
 [ N b3 ] , [ B x b4 ]  It was either now or never. Any other move allows White to play [ b5 ] with the initiative.
 [ b x a3 ]  [ b x a3 ] , [ N e5 ]  Meanwhile I relied on my gut instincts since I didn't know what to do. So I again narrowed it down to 2 conditional moves since the only other thing I considered was 23...Be5. But I'd rather liquidate with my N then the B.
 [ R d x e4 ]  [ d x e4 ] , [ R x e4 ]  but now black has to cover [ g4 ] and to defend the knight...
 [ B g6 ] , [ K x f3 ]  The end.
 [ B x f5 ]  [ Q x h6 ] , [ Q f8 ]  Here is the time to stop and check about white's plan. The idea was to attack the weak [ h6 ] pawn while also opening the g file. Excellent plan. But here it falls short because the execution is faulty. It would have been better to first play the king to [ h1 ] then put the rook on the g file and then push the pawns. The problem with the present position is that the queen is alone to try and attack the king while the black pieces are all relatively well placed to replace the missing pawns in front of the king. But with the rook ready to come in it would have been a different story. Of course during all this preparation black would have had time to regroup. But at least this leaves a chance for error on the black side if he does not prepare well to meet white's plan.
 [ N g f3 ]  [ N a6 ]  [ N g4 ] , [ N b4 ]  Both Jabborg and Safeway were on their feet (Safeway stood on his chair) rapidly making their moves one spectator present at the game had said 'their hands were a blur!' another spectator had likened this part of the game to a table-tennis match - particularly safeway as he had to occasionally jump to achieve his moves.
 [ Q a4 + ]  [ b3 ] , [ c x b3 + ]  easy
 [ e4 ] , [ Q g8 ]  A good one. Black is playing very well defensively.
 [ c3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ h3 ]  [ N a5 ]  [ B c2 ] , [ c5 ]  Still by the book and my bishop on [ [ e7 ] ] has zero moves but at least the same is true for the white bishop on c1. My pawns are advanced which seems like it should impart mobility to my pieces and I'm ostensibly ahead in development though I don't know if I should count my paralyzed bishop on [ [ e7 ] ] and my knight on the edge at [ a5 ] is fairly limited too. What I don't like is my backward pawn at [ d6 ] or the hole in my formation at d5.
 [ B f6 ]  [ Q e4 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ Q d3 ]  [ N x e3 ] , [ Q x d8 ]  Thinking that this ended all troubles I exchanged Q's. But Stanley is still going to win a piece. I at first thought that better was to retake right away. However 20.[ N x e3 ] first wouldn't have helped as Stanley would forced the exchange of Q's on [ d2 ] before playing this move. And this is where I know for sure that white is lost. Against someone of my strength I wouldn't know since I've compensated before like in my last tournament game. But against Class B players and above once you've lost a piece there's generally speaking no going back. As they won't let you get anything back and it's certainly so here.
 [ R a8 ] , [ Q e2 ]  aimed against [ R a2 ] to capture [ f2 ] pawn
 [ R x d7 ] , [ b6 ]  ? So getting more desperate I do what I can to stay in and at the very slightest chance which is in reality 0 is to get counterplay.
 [ f x g4 ]  [ Q d4 + ]  [ K h1 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ R f4 ]  Threatens to capture the queen but she needs to stay on the a7-[ h1 ] diagonal where [ a7 ] is the only safe square for her.
 [ b x a6 ] , [ b x a6 ]  Notice now that BQ is some how oversaturated defending pieces. White will go for her wisely.
 [ Q x e3 ] , [ R e8 ]  attacking White's queen and moving the rook on the half-open file.
 [ N e7 ]  [ g5 ]  [ h x g5 ]  [ f x g5 ]  [ B x e5 ]  [ d x e5 ] , [ N d7 ]  engines suggest now a beautiful move: [ R h8 ] followed by a munching of black pieces or/and mate. Make sure you check out the variation.
 [ N f6 ]  [ f x e4 ] , [ d x e4 ]  [ B x e4 ] 0-0 is leading to roughly the same...
 [ B a7 ]  [ K b7 ] , [ B c5 ]  do you want to exchange and give me another passed pawn
 [ N g f3 ] , [ c5 ]  From black's perspective this known as the Semi-Tarrassh setup where black mirrors white pawns on [ d4 ] and c4. The plan for black is to develop his bishops on [ d6 ] and [ d7 ] with a knights on [ f6 ] and c6. As for the queen she is the most flexible which is able to go to [ e7 ] [ c7 ] or even [ b6 ] and [ a5 ] if the situation requires it.
 [ a x b3 ]  [ a x b3 ]  [ f6 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ f5 ]  [ R d3 ]  [ Q e4 ]  [ e x f5 ]  [ N e7 + ]  [ B x e7 ]  [ Q x e7 ]  [ R x b3 ]  [ R f e1 ]  [ R d3 ]  [ Q b4 ]  [ Q d7 ]  [ h3 ]  [ R a2 ]  [ R e7 ]  [ Q d5 ]  [ R e8 + ]  [ K f7 ]  [ Q e7 + ] , [ K g6 ]  White resigns because he has ran out of checks.
 [ B x g7 ]  [ K x g7 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ R e5 ]  [ Q f6 + ] , [ K g8 ]  Game note: 29...[ K g8 ] sets up a N fork on [ f6 ]  [ Q x e5 ] , [ N x e5 ]  Game note: And he fell for it but it's pretty much lost anyway.
 [ f5 ]  [ e x f6 ]  [ e ]  [ p ] , [ N g x f6 ]  I want your opinion. Was that a good trade for black?
 [ g4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N b3 ]  [ B e6 ] , [ g5 ]  10. [ g5 ] - this pawn push resembles the Byrne Attack. As black has not castled kingside this advance is to tie down black's king knight.
 [ B b7 ] , [ O-O ]  This was the best option I guess.. Doing a developing move (like [ B e3 ] for example) wasn't yet the time. King's safety is priority number one.
 [ R a c8 ] , [ N x e8 ]  Gained the rook.
 [ Q c7 ] , [ N e4 c3 ]  THIS is bad. The knight must go to [ g3 ] in order to make black lose a tempo defending the bishop (or more likely retiring it to g6).
 [ h6 ] , [ c4 ]  Trying to exchange a center pawn meanwhile developing my light-squared bishop. If black doesn't capture my c-pawn my next move would be 7. [ c5 ] taking away important fields for black's bishop.
 [ R a d1 ]  [ R x c2 ]  [ a4 ] , [ a6 ]  preventing [ b5 ] so that the next pawns can be fetched as well :)
 [ B x f3 ]  [ R x f7 + ]  [ K g8 ]  [ N x f3 ]  [ B x e5 ]  [ R x f6 + ]  [ K h7 ]  [ B d3 + ]  [ K g8 ]  [ B c4 + ] , [ K h7 ]  
 [ B x d4 ]  [ B x d4 ]  [ Q c2 ] , [ B e3 ]  preventing white from castling queen side which keeps the rooks out of the game.
 [ Q f4 ] , [ d5 ]  I liked this because it kept the pressure on White with 6. [ e x d5 ] [ N d5 ] attacking the Queen once again and with my Bishops acting in tandem giving the Queen few squares to which she might retreat
 [ K f8 ] , [ B x g5 ]  Now I take the Queen.
 [ c5 ]  [ N e7 ] , [ c x d6 ]  I really want my knight on the [ c5 ] square so I just have to move my pawn out of way.
 [ a6 ] , [ R e1 ]  Here it became apparent that white was planning for a [ e5 ] break
 [ K x b7 ]  [ R f b1 + ]  [ K c8 ]  [ B x c6 ] , [ Q a3 ]  To escape from mating net in fact 23... Kd8; 24.[ R b8 + ] [ B c8 ] and 25.[ R x c8 + ]  [ K x b8 ] , [ R x a3 ]  and Black resigned.
 [ d x e5 ]  [ N g4 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ B b4 + ]  Rubinstein's greedy insistence on maintaining the Pawn will be punished. Modern players know that often times the best way to deal with a gambit is to return the Pawn at the appropriate time in return for a positional advantage.
 [ Q f7 + ]  [ K h7 ]  [ R e7 ]  [ R x d3 ]  [ Q x h5 + ]  [ K g8 ] , [ R x e8 # ]  Mate it is...
 [ B a6 ]  [ Q d2 ] , [ f5 ]  After having weakened the [ e4 ] pawns forcing the queen to move black attacks. This is a strong move but it considerably weakens the king and if white manages to advance its e pawn it will be very hard to fire him.
 [ K f8 ] , [ Q x b7 ]  But all the responses I can think of are blocked because of the 'lowly' knight which is just in the wrong spot.....
 [ N d4 ]  [ R b2 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ c3 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ c2 ]  [ N e2 ] , [ R b1 + ]  40. ....... [ R b1 + ] - next move my c pawn makes it to Glendadom.
 [ g3 ] , [ Q f6 ]  The knight would prefer to go here but I suspect this is still the best move.
 [ Q d3 ] , [ O-O ]  Black has caught up and in fact gained a slight lead (White's undeveloped knight is in the way of his queenside rook) in what I will call the "Rook Race". However Black has payed a hefty price: his castled king is completely exposed and White's queen has a nice diagonal leading straight into his king's position. If White can chase away or eliminate Black's knight say with [ B e5 ] and then put his bishop behind his queen with [ B c2 ] he has a powerful attack.
 [ K e2 ]  [ B g4 + ]  [ N f3 ]  [ Q x h2 + ]  [ K e3 ]  [ Q x b2 ]  [ R a c1 ]  [ B x f3 ]  [ K x f3 ]  [ b x a4 ]  [ K f4 ] , [ a3 ]  White runs out of time. This is a very interesting game from the marshall and shows how a gambit ties down the defenders resources and makes it hard to find active plans.
 [ h3 ] , [ e5 ]  a typical move inviting white to close the center with d5. Then black will attack on the kingside with an eventual ...[ f5 ] while white will try to make progress on the queenside.
 [ O-O ] , [ g6 ]  black seeks to counteract my own bishop on the long diagonal.
 [ B x f3 ]  [ B d6 ] , [ b3 ]  guarding c4.
 [ B d7 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ B x d4 ]  [ Q e4 ]  [ Q d2 ] , [ R b1 ]  The game seems far from lost.
 [ N x d4 ]  [ R x d4 ]  [ R h8 ] , [ h3 ]  i control both open files and have a 3 pawn advantage
 [ Q f3 ] , [ Q e2 ]  I expected 29. [ Q c2 ] [ R a1 ] 30. [ d3 ] but think this is stronger.
 [ R h2 ]  [ R g7 ]  [ R h1 ]  [ K g8 ]  [ R c2 ] , [ R a7 ]  61. ...... [ R a7 ] - and we do the shuffle again!
 [ R c2 ]  [ R x h5 ]  [ R x g2 ] , [ R h6 ]  I feel white and black really need to get their bishops involved...
 [ R f d8 ]  [ R h3 ] , [ K f8 ]  24. ....... Henry tries to escape but to no avail. Freddy plays his queen to [ g5 ] and tells me that I am going to be checkmated (Oh No not that again!).
 [ R x a6 ] , [ Q d3 ]  Using the undefended position of the [ R a6 ] to secure the c-file.
 [ f4 ] , [ B c8 ]  ??
 [ Q b6 + ]  [ N e3 ] , [ R f8 ]  Now comes the rook.
 [ c3 ] , [ B e6 ]  Good move. I thought at this point that I would carry out with the usual "kill all" game.
 [ f6 ] , [ B g3 ]  I figured out that he was worried about mate. Personally I don't think any of his last two moves were mated since I didn't see any way to mate him.
 [ B b5 + ]  [ B d7 ]  [ N a3 ]  [ Q x e4 + ]  [ B e3 ]  [ f6 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ Q c6 ]  [ N b5 ]  [ d5 ]  [ B f4 ] , [ B c5 ]  Oof. Black should have played [ N a6 ] to protect against Nc7+. Better yet black should probably not have moved P[ d5 ] earlier (10).
 [ B e7 ] , [ N d2 ]  White is looking to move this knight to [ f3 ] and then e5. It will take a while to develop this piece but it also allows White to bring his remaining rook into the fray.
 [ K g4 ]  [ b3 ]  [ h5 ]  [ b2 ]  [ h6 ]  [ b1 = Q ]  [ K h5 ]  [ Q g6 + ]  [ K h4 ] , [ R h2 # ]  ...and I finish the job.
 [ K e7 ]  [ R a e1 ] , [ h5 ]  19. ....... [ h5 ] - too little too late now comes a nasty discovered check which will win the rook on [ e1 ] for starties. Also Fou Lenoir is very vulnerable as if Henry goes onto [ f2 ] then he will be caught in a pin and all white has to do is pile on with a move such as Be5. On making this assessment I waved the white flag. Well played antagonistknight.
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ B d3 ]  5. [ B d3 ] - after a few pawn moves on both sides I finally clear the way for kingside castling.
 [ Q x g6 ] , [ N x g6 ]  ...and we also trade queens...
 [ e x d4 ]  [ R x d4 ]  [ R x g6 ]  [ K f7 ]  [ R g5 ]  [ R d2 + ]  [ K f3 ]  [ R h2 ] , [ K e3 ]  There is nothing else i want to move at the moment. There is no real point in trying to keep the g-pawn but there is a way to get the black rook out of this corner.
 [ K x g2 ] , [ e4 ]  ? I presume that you were thinking about promoting Erika. But what you have to keep in mind is that this isn't a passed pawn. If it were the move would work but the pawn right next to it stops it. And with that white equalizes. So you have to ask how your opponent will respond and that is also very important. Better was 41...[ f5 ] followed by 42...[ [ e4 ] ] with a very solid pawn. And now when he takes on [ [ e4 ] ] you're still a pawn up.
 [ R f8 ] , [ Q e2 ]  The Black Queen still should not take the rook because of the mate threat
 [ h4 ]  [ B d6 ] , [ h3 ]  White's bishop move didn't seem much of a threat so still pushing that pawn for all its worth.
 [ h4 ] , [ B x f2 ]  12. ..... [ B x [ f2 ] ] - I take on [ f2 ] and I now have a dastardly plan which will unveil itself in the next few moves.
 [ O-O ] , [ B f4 ]  Maybe not the strongest move but it does align the Bs
 [ g x f5 ]  [ d x c6 ]  [ Q x c6 ]  [ Q b3 ]  [ a5 ] , [ g6 ]  
 [ N c4 ] , [ R c8 ]  Black's move 31. ... Rc8? needs at least one question mark and if the game were more even it would deserve two. Black's rook on [ b2 ] is en prise. Rather than save it he pins the attacking knight to the white rook offering a rook exchange but evidently overlooking the fact that the white bishop on [ a5 ] defends the white rook on c3. A better way to continue would have been 31. ... [ N d1 ] 32. [ K d3 ] [ B f1 ] 33. [ K e4 ] [ N x c3 ] 34. [ B x c3 ] [ R c2 ] 35. [ N e3 ] [ R x c3 ] 36. [ N x f1 ] winning the exchange and trading pieces leaving black with two rooks against a knight and still with a 6-3 pawn advantage and a passed e-pawn.
 [ B d6 ] , [ a4 ]  4pawns vs 1 pawn who will win?
 [ a3 ] , [ B x c3 + ]  [ B e7 ] certainly looks better. Now it will be a classic battle of knights v. bishops! White however is behind in development.
 [ Q x f3 ]  [ N x f3 ] , [ N h6 ]  ! Best in my opinion. Personally I would've played 14...[ N f6 ] but I like this better. What's going on here? Well although not the reason for taking as would be very unsound I am coincidentally threatening 15.[ N g5 ] followed by a capture on [ [ f7 ] ] so as they say the [ [ f7 ] ] square. This time with his black's decision to play 6.[ B a4 ] Bert's B is as Jack calls it "out of play" for the moment so it cannot defend the square. But with this move however that changes. It's because of an overload in which black adds a defender to that square.
 [ B d6 ]  [ B x g6 ]  [ h x g6 ]  [ N d3 ]  [ K f8 ]  [ f3 ]  [ K e7 ]  [ K f2 ]  [ B b8 ]  [ K e2 ]  [ B a7 ]  [ B b2 ]  [ N e8 ]  [ e4 ]  [ N d6 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ d x e5 ] , [ N c8 ]  Inaccurate. Black is still almost equal after 29... Nb7.
 [ d5 ] , [ c x d5 ]  Almost an automatic capture as the point of the english opening is to allow black to build a centre then destroy it. [ d5 ] cx[ d5 ] accomplishes this in one move. There are rare exceptions - see my game with hityerclock
 [ B x f6 ] , [ N c5 ]  I'd feared this. Now I fantasised about N or B x [ d4 ] and failed to find a satisfactory conclusion. Subsequent analysis suggested that this would have been successful: 18.... Bx[ d4 ] 19. Nx[ d4 ] Qx[ d4 ] (I'd only considered Nx[ d4 ] at the time) 20. Qx[ d4 ] Nx[ d4 ] 21. [ N x b7 ] [ N x b3 ] looks OK. Other lines also seem OK for Black. I failed to see far enough and blundered.
 [ R g8 ]  [ Q f3 ] , [ a4 ]  Why won't he take it?
 [ R a d8 ]  [ R f d1 ]  [ R f6 ] , [ h3 ]  Using a lull in the game to create a luft for the King
 [ K g7 ]  [ N e3 ] , [ B c5 ]  Another pawn falls. [ N e7 ] would have caused more resistance.
 [ Q h5 + ] , [ K x f8 ]  I told you it was a bizarre attack. Let's take stock of the situation with some basic board evaluation principles (thanks id=elyhim ). 1. Material relationship: White has a material advantage with an extra pawn and a Bishop for a Knight. 2. Presence of direct threats: Both sides have significant threats. White threatens two of Black's pawns and has various future opportunities available. Black on the other hand threatens immediate mate on f2. 3. King Position/Safety: Neither player's King can be considered safe. White's is a little more tucked away but Black is more prepared to attack it. 4. Possession of open lines: Here the advantage goes to Black for his dominant Rook on the e-file. 5. Pawn structure weak and strong points: White's pawn structure is much more stable and has only one significant weak point: f2. 6. The center and space: Black rules the center with absolute authority and has vastly more space. 7. Development and the position of pieces: White's only developed piece is his Queen which is somewhat out-of-position and harassable. Black has developed three pieces and his Queen may be considered developed as well. Conclusion: The position is very nearly equal. Black has perhaps a slight short-term advantage but if White plays very carefully he may be able to catch up in development and convert his material advantage and better pawns into a winning endgame.
 [ g x h3 ] , [ B x h3 ]  For some reason here I thought I'd trapped the Rook...
 [ N c6 ]  [ f4 ]  [ B d6 ] , [ N g f3 ]  7. [ N g f3 ] - looks as though there will be a mutual knight entrenchment on the squares [ e4 ] and e5!
 [ N a4 ] , [ B f8 ]  White's knight was en prise so running from the pawn seems like the right thing to do. But white overlooked the greater danger and now his queen has nowhere to run nowhere to hide. Already two pieces down white is about to become down by a queen and a minor piece. Instead he took the noble way out and resigned before his lovely lady had to lose her head.
 [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ e4 ]  [ N b d7 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ Q a5 ]  [ B d2 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ B f3 ]  [ a6 ]  [ Q b3 ]  [ h6 ]  [ N g e2 ]  [ N b6 ]  [ N g3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ N a4 ]  [ N b d7 ]  [ O-O ]  [ h5 ]  [ N e2 ] , [ g5 ]  Black is creating space for me to get in behind the g & h pawns and attack his king side.
 [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ] , [ Q e2 + ]  [ Q b3 ] usually leads to a draw...
 [ g x f5 ]  [ g x f5 ] , [ K f1 ]  Now that [ e6 ] is weak [ N x e3 ] isn't so good anymore so the White King moves to hold the newly created passed pawns.
 [ B b5 + ]  [ K f3 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ R f4 + ]  [ B f6 ] , [ R x f6 # ]  
 [ c5 ]  [ c3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ f4 ]  f4. This gains control on the kingside. This sets the game up for a White kingside and Black queenside game.
 [ N d7 ]  [ g4 ]  [ f x g4 ] , [ h x g4 ]  I like black's position now. 17. [ e x f5 ] [ g x f5 ] does not look good either the e and f pawns supported by the pieces seem dangerous.
 [ N d2 ]  [ c6 ] , [ N x b3 ]  22. ...... [ N x b3 ] - I decided to swipe the Witch off the board and allow Glenda to hang as there is still a WR en prise on c1. There is no way the WP on [ d7 ] will crown so I remain a good exchange up.
 [ h6 ] , [ B e3 ]  14. [ B e3 ] - an OK move at this time but it will be the start of an unwanted overload set up.
 [ d5 ]  [ c4 ] , [ c6 ]  Leading into the Slave or Semi-Slav one of Black's strongest replies to 1. [ d4 ] [ d5 ] 2. [ c4 ]  [ Q x b3 ] , [ N d7 ]  finally another piece develops. Like White's earlier [ N c3 ] this flexible move fulfils a number of objectives: preparing ... [ c5 ] ... [ R b8 ] ...[ e5 ] ... [ N d f6 ] or ... [ N g f6 ] depending on how the game develops. Alternatively the N could go to [ b6 ] contesting d5.
 [ a4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N g e7 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ a6 ]  [ B x c6 + ]  [ N x c6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B d7 ]  [ b3 ]  [ N a5 ]  [ N b d2 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B b2 ] , [ h6 ]  [ R c8 ] is also good.
 [ a4 ] , [ N b d7 ]  Delaying castling as the centre is closed
 [ c4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ N f6 ]  The Slav defense Breyer Variation with both knights defend the respective queen pawns and controlling the center.
 [ N h6 ]  [ R c1 ]  [ N g4 ] , [ B g6 ]  BxP[ b4 ] looks pretty good.
 [ K x f7 ]  [ Q c4 + ]  [ K e7 ]  [ Q c5 + ]  [ K d8 ] , [ B g5 + ]  there we go
 [ K f4 ] , [ B c8 ]  nothing is happening from my part.
 [ Q x b3 ] , [ d4 ]  And I push further ahead. Cho is slob and a shlub.
 [ B x d4 ]  [ R x d4 ]  [ R x d4 ] , [ c x d4 ]  16. ...... [ c x d4 ] - this plethora of exchanges results in Natalia undoubling her pawns.
 [ R a2 ]  [ N x c5 ]  [ N e2 ] , [ R a8 ]  Game note "21...[ R a8 ] get my position back together. I'm +3 material and boss in the centre."
 [ B d6 ] , [ R f d1 ]  Seizing the open file.
 [ e4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ f4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e5 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ N c6 ]  The computer prefers [ B e7 ] but I hardly think that it makes a difference.
 [ h3 ]  [ g5 ] , [ N x d7 ]  this bishop has been hanging forever!
 [ B a6 ] , [ B a3 ]  After White's 11th move I should adjudicate his position as slightly superior and at worst completely safe. To turn this into a mating position in eleven more moves is more witchcraft than chess! Quite honestly I do not see the man who can stop Bobby at this time. -- K.F. Kirby South African Chess Quarterly
 [ e5 ]  [ N h7 ]  [ d4 ] , [ g5 ]  This line is too slow...
 [ h3 ]  [ R c8 ] , [ e5 + ]  i calculated this carefully. Nothing black could do was good (as far as I saw)
 [ h6 ]  [ B h4 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ c4 ] , [ b4 ]  If Black plays [ b x c4 ] he will isolate his a-pawn and also give White's N a nice spot on c4.
 [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ O-O ] , [ d5 ]  This is good move as breaks center and free the bishop.
 [ B e3 ]  [ a6 ]  [ N b d4 ] , [ K f7 ]  [ Q b3 ] is the natural move
 [ N f3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ Q b3 ]  [ N a5 ]  [ Q c2 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ e3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B d3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B c6 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ Q c7 ] , [ b3 ]  Development is finally complete for both sides. Now the game begins.
 [ K b2 ] , [ R x c1 ]  Time was running low and I was mostly trying to keep the initiative but I would be curious to know if there was a knockout blow here...
 [ R x d8 + ] , [ K x d8 ]  ...and get the exchange I was looking for. Now with the rooks gone things get really interesting...
 [ O-O ]  [ c3 ] , [ N b8 ]  And there is the Breyer defense. Te knight is on its way to [ d7 ] where is is better placed. I also play this move to avoid the more common opening lines such as 9... Na5. In fact I have played some nice games with 9... Nb8; and feel comfortable with it.
 [ Q b6 ] , [ Q d1 ]  20. [ Q d1 ] - after [ Q b6 ] pinning my d pawn it looks as though I am about to lose material. However things are not that simple as you will see!
 [ b x c6 ] , [ K h1 ]  As advertised: White is preparing f4.
 [ R c8 ] , [ N d2 ]  Naive plan I have to admit. But if he exchanges it is all in my favour so no problem. Of course [ f3 ] is coming...
 [ h5 ]  [ N e3 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ N g2 ]  [ B f3 ]  [ N e1 ]  [ g4 ]  [ N d3 ]  [ K e6 ]  [ N f4 + ]  [ K x f6 ]  [ N x h5 + ]  [ K g5 ]  [ N g7 ]  [ B c6 ] , [ a4 ]  [ c4 ] would have been better than [ a4 ] because it allow capture of the pawn.
 [ Q x d3 ] , [ R f1 ]  Threatening 16.[ e5 ] with 17.[ e x f6 ] or mate to follow.
 [ Q a4 ] , [ Q x b5 + ]  I think this trade was in my best interests but it was a hard decision.
 [ R d1 + ]  [ K c5 ] , [ R c1 ]  lining up for a discovered check
 [ e5 ]  [ d6 + ]  [ K e8 ] , [ N x e5 ]  17. [ N x e5 ] - I decide to sacrifice my knight for two pawns to open up the e file and get at the black king. The Dentist went on holiday but did not set up his vacation flag. He therefore timed out. I think though that white has a winning advantage in this position. Do you the jury agree? Joanne
 [ N f3 ] , [ d6 ]  3. ....... [ d6 ] - dmaestro's speciality the Fisher Defense. I then play [ d4 ] which is what Master Chrisobee played against me in a mini-tournament many moons ago when I tried the Fisher Defense on him - I went on to lose that game.
 [ d x e4 ]  [ d4 ]  [ B c2 ] , [ N e5 ]  It was necessary to play this knight in order to stop his king's pawn; the more so because this very pawn in its present situation stops the passage of its own bishop and even of its knight.
 [ B x a2 ]  [ d4 ] , [ B b3 ]  22. ..... [ B b3 ] - wrong piece methinks. In retro the knight should have gone to this square.
 [ f3 ]  [ R a d8 ] , [ B e4 ]  Forcing another exchange hoping for white to further blunt the attack.
 [ O-O ]  [ Q d4 ] , [ Q g6 ]  And change Queen without getting piece winning did I found not good
 [ R x g6 + ]  [ h x g6 ] , [ R x a5 ]  But now nobody's winning....
 [ R e3 ]  [ R a c8 ]  [ B a1 ] , [ R c6 x c2 ]  His bishop is pinning my g pawn which could prove nasty
 [ b5 ]  [ a x b5 ] , [ c x b5 ]  the bishop is now threatened my knight snaps into action.
 [ K g2 ]  [ R a h8 ]  [ R f h1 ]  [ R h3 x h1 ]  [ R x h1 ]  [ R x h1 ] , [ K x h1 ]  White's rook trades have left his king farther away from the center in the endgame.
 [ Q f5 ] , [ g4 ]  This however is where it happens. Normally I'd play 23.[ B g4 ] followed by 24.[ B x e6 ] with that exchange. Although I don't like it there aren't choices. However with the variations I studied which was difficult to decide you often attack with the pawn. By overanalyzing those variations I now wind up in trouble. I'd normally feel that 23.[ B g4 ] was better but it isn't as black would've played the same thing. So I'm not sure what the best was.
 [ c6 ] , [ a4 ]  Instead of [ B a3 ] which I consider to be better White pushes the passed Pawn.
 [ a x b5 ]  [ a x b5 ] , [ c x b5 ]  After this game Jack Stockel taught me an important lesson and his lesson is also the moral of this story. If an endgame boils down to a Knight V. a Rook it is extremely important to keep your Rook active. If you deactivate it your opponents Knight becomes extremely powerful and dangerous ultimately leading to a loss.
 [ K x h2 ]  [ Q x f1 ] , [ N d2 ]  developing a knight and firing the queen
 [ B d3 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B g4 ]  [ h3 ]  [ B h5 ] , [ B e3 ]  I'm not sure if this is the best square for the B. [ g5 ] may be a better option.
 [ N d5 ] , [ N x f3 + ]  When ahead exchange pieces and head for the endgame. Another strategy however is to use your extra material to gain a winning advantage. Again I would have played [ B f5 ] here. The exchange removes Black's best placed minor piece and allows White's bishop the h1-[ a8 ] diagonal.
 [ c x b3 ] , [ Q x b3 ]  Aiming at Black's undeveloped K-side.
 [ R e1 ] , [ d6 ]  No risk no win. I think I can hold e6. But I was wrong: now white has [ B x f4 ] and if exB... [ N x g5 ] hxN Qxg4!?...
 [ R c8 ] , [ h3 ]  At any event the Bishop should be moved here as the exchange results in an overwhelming positional superiority for Black.
 [ Q e4 + ] , [ K g1 ]  Now I would expect ...Rc x [ b8 ] or ... Rf8. What does Black do?
 [ R a e1 ] , [ Q x b2 ]  but white has no substantial attack which black couldn`t parade
 [ B x e4 ] , [ f x e4 ]  I complete the exchange opening a file for my Rook in the process.
 [ B c4 ]  [ B b7 ] , [ Q f3 ]  White has no respect for black's ability shooting for the four move checkmate and bringing the queen into the fray so early in the game.
 [ B g5 ]  [ O-O ] , [ B h6 ]  Took me a moment to see the reasoning for this one the potential for pinning the queen to the king still think it was a very brave move.
 [ e x f4 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ d5 ]  This is a unfamiliar line of attack for me as lower rated players usually come after the N on f3. I decided to try and clear out his center pawns with [ e x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ] , [ N x d5 ]  I almost decided on the exchange of Knights on [ d5 ] but went with bringing out my bishop in preparation to castle so I could remove my king from the center and complete the KG.
 [ K g8 ] , [ R f d1 ]  Black resigns as he has no way to avoid having his Rook be exchanged off.
 [ N a7 ] , [ N d5 ]  13. [ N d5 ] - another knight finds an outpost but this steed will be exchanged for a black prelate.
 [ B x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ] , [ B d2 ]  And White indeed retreats to avoid a further exchange...
 [ Q x b5 ]  [ Q h8 + ]  [ K f7 ]  [ Q x a8 ]  [ Q d3 ]  [ Q a5 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ Q c7 + ] , [ K e8 ]  If Black tries 48... K - B 3 White can use a series of checks to bring his Queen to K 3 where his material edge will be decisive.
 [ R x d6 ]  [ N e8 + ]  [ K f8 ] , [ N x d6 ]  And my Knight has a wonderful post. Once again the computer saw 25. [ R f3 ] [ B b7 ] 26. [ R c7 ] [ B x f3 ] 27. [ R x a7 ] [ B c6 ] 28. [ R x a6 ] [ R c8 ] and I didn't but allowing that Bishop to skewer through the Rooks is possibly something no-one would have fancied?
 [ Q e3 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ Q f2 ] , [ B h3 ]  24. ....... [ B h3 ] - attacking the pinned [ g2 ] pawn and forcing it to advance to g3. Thank god my rook wasn't on [ f1 ] at the time!
 [ N f6 ] , [ f3 ]  Blocking the knight.
 [ B x a7 ]  [ K f3 ]  [ K e5 ]  [ K g3 ]  [ K e4 ]  [ K h3 ]  [ K f3 ]  [ K h2 ]  [ K x g4 ]  [ K g2 ]  [ K f4 ]  [ K h2 ]  [ K f3 ]  [ K h1 ]  [ g4 ]  [ b8 = Q ]  [ B x b8 ]  [ K g1 ]  [ B a7 + ]  [ K h1 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ K h2 ]  [ g3 + ]  [ K h1 ]  [ g2 + ]  [ K h2 ]  [ g1 = Q + ]  [ K h3 ] , [ Q g3 # ]  
 [ K e1 ]  [ Q c3 + ] , [ K e2 ]  Mutual defence is temporarily restored.
 [ c5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ g6 ] , [ N f3 ]  Black doesn't follow the main line...
 [ B c6 ] , [ R e1 ]  White puts pressure on the center but it's a bit empty: Black's King may run safely to the queenside now and the e-pawn has a wealth of possible defenders. 19.[ N d2 ] may have been stronger looking to transfer to the kingside or else 19.[ K h1 ] with an eye for c2-c3.
 [ R c4 ]  [ Q a5 ] , [ h3 ]  Creating luft for the king.Although this loses another pawn
 [ N c6 ] , [ a3 ]  10. [ a3 ] - to prevent Nb4.
 [ e4 ]  [ d5 ] , [ e5 ]  Less often played than exd leads to a well-known game in which one of main black concerns is how to develop the dsb.
 [ d5 ] , [ N d4 ]  When the opponent thinks he won a tempo slap him in the face by gaining one for yourself instead. By now you should have a huge psychological advantage... who cares that the game will be won on the chessboard?
 [ B f4 ]  [ R d7 ] , [ c3 ]  White prepares to relocate his Queen. However this is losing. White can do better with 19. Ng3.
 [ K x c4 ]  [ g4 ] , [ K x d5 ]  The D pawn falls as well.
 [ Q x d4 ] , [ a6 ]  A typical Sicilian move...
 [ d5 ]  [ c4 ] , [ h6 ]  A very odd line. Black is trying to take me out of my opening repertoire but there is a reason that no one plays this line. 2...[ h6 ] neglects the center so I develop classically which I feel is the best way to meet out-of-book moves.
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ a6 ]  This is the Najdorf variation of the Sicilian Defence. I play it as Black too.
 [ N e7 ] , [ B f4 ]  ...and bring out my bishop to eye up the c-pawn...
 [ N f6 + ]  [ g x f6 ]  [ Q c4 ]  [ N x b1 ]  [ R x b1 ]  [ B a3 ]  [ b4 ]  [ a5 ]  [ Q b3 ] , [ a x b4 ]  When annotating games like this I go by what Joe outlines which is the reason for doing anymore. And what he outlined is the moral of this story. In it TA said "Reinforced pawn capture on the a and b edgefile(B+P) clenches the win.No mate necessary!Game over!Opponent resigns and quickly leaves the arena voluntarily disconnecting. Again brett is a fine player but my constructive opinon(not destructive opinion)is that brett enjoys blitz and probably defeats many blitz opponents south of 2100(like I do)but needs additional blitz training that he lacks when confronted by a hyper severe electrical storm like me....and he has no proper grounding in blitz theory which is "different"than long corresp. game play theory.No brag on my part just fact....FYI."
 [ B d7 ] , [ Q f6 ]  Now to be truthful black can simply offer the queen's exchange and stay -2 based on c3's and a2's weakness.
 [ B d5 ]  [ N d b8 ]  [ N e3 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ B x d5 ] , [ e x d5 ]  Perhaps [ N x d5 ] was better.
 [ f x g5 ] , [ N e5 ]  Black doesn't wish to break up this attack by playing [ h x g5 ] but continues its strong attack on whites King.
 [ N b d7 ] , [ Q c2 ]  Looking for c6.
 [ R x f2 ]  [ R d3 ] , [ N b2 ]  ?? Gives the game back to me perhaps he was counting on [ R d7 + ] [ R f7 ] and he didn't notice the bishop.
 [ Q a4 ] , [ Q b2 ]  22. [ R e1 ] [ R x e1 ] and 23. [ N x e1 ] would've been very solid
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ d x c5 ] , [ B g7 ]  there is no rush to recover the pawn
 [ K a2 ]  [ R x h8 ]  [ c5 ] , [ R a8 ]  He cannot defend the [ a5 ] pawn.
 [ f x g5 ]  [ B b3 ] , [ B b7 ]  was expecting [ c6 ] here saving the pawn
 [ R f3 ]  [ f5 ]  [ R h f4 ]  [ B c8 ] , [ R f4 x f5 ]  now is the time for white to re-even the exchanges. this time however white is again left with positional and initiative advantages.
 [ e4 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ N c3 ]  I am not yoused to this opining
 [ B b3 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ d3 ]  [ R c8 ]  [ B d1 ]  [ c4 ]  [ B c2 ]  [ N x d3 + ]  [ B x d3 ] , [ c x d3 ]  Why no take [ [ d3 ] ] from opponent? => e2-[ [ d3 ] ] ; b7-e4; queen troubelled+ e4-[ g2 ] and big mess in his defense. This setup was a already the key to an artistic evolvement in my chesscurriculum wich doesn't often happens I have to admit.
 [ f4 ]  [ K g1 ]  [ h5 ]  [ R c5 ]  [ h4 ]  [ R g5 ] , [ K h6 ]  Torre bows to the inevitable and resigns. Well done by the Iranian.
 [ K e2 ]  [ K f6 ]  [ K e3 ] , [ g5 ]  Another road to the win is 38 ... [ K e6 ] 39 [ K d3 ] [ K d5 ] but there was no need to move the king any farther toward the center than necessary. After the text Black wins easily because White has no way to slow down the e and f pawns: 39 [ h4 ] gx[ h4 ] 40 gx[ h4 ] [ [ f4 ] ] and connected passed pawns rule; 39 [ g4 ] [ [ e4 ] ] 40 [ K d4 ] [ b6 ] 41 [ K e3 ] [ K e5 ] 42 [ g x f5 ] [ K x f5 ] and wins; 39 [ b4 ] [ [ f4 ] ] 40 gx[ [ f4 ] ] (40 Kf2/3 [ f x g3 ] 41 [ K x g3 ] [ [ e4 ] ] 42 [ b5 ] [ K e5 ] 43 [ K g2 ] (43 K[ g4 ] Kd4) [ K d4 ] and wins.
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ a6 ]  The Sicilian najdorf.
 [ N c3 ] , [ Q a5 ]  This I have seen countless times as white so I assume this is all book. But from this point I have no idea what is or is not book. I've seen enough to know that black can get a kingside attack that I don't like as white so I do something a little odd. Here is the thing for me: It's a given that black is going to reposition the queen. SO why chase it? It's going to move anyways so I'd rather spend the extra move to do something a little odd with one of my own pieces...
 [ N f6 ] , [ g3 ]  no commitment yet so I'm content to think about [ N f6 ] [ g6 ] [ B g7 ] and 0-0 and go from there.
 [ K f6 ] , [ B d4 + ]  Check and queen is dead.
 [ R x d3 ]  [ R x d3 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ c3 ] , [ c6 ]  Of course if... BxP 21 NxB QxN 22 R-K3. Black with a Pawn minus fights very hard.
 [ d6 ] , [ Q a4 ]  Probably premature. White should have preferred castles but was I worried about [ g5 ] making sense of blacks ninth move 9 h6?
 [ Q x e5 + ]  [ K f7 ]  [ B c4 + ] , [ K g6 ]  6... [ d5 ] is much better controlling the square [ f5 ] and making the attack much harder.
 [ O-O-O ] , [ d4 ]  13. [ d4 ] - that little seed of an attack again starts to germinate in my head when that happens I bet you are glad to be reading this game rather than be my opponent. This idea is to try and storm the queenside castled position by opening lines. This will distract black from getting any further with his kingside attack. I think I am finally learning a bitter lesson from my loss against The Dentist many years ago when I failed to find any similar counterplay when we both castled on opposite sides and succumbed to passivitis and a 3 pawn loss in the endgame. I The Black Queen will not make that mistake again!
 [ R x b1 ]  [ R h8 ]  [ R h1 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ R e2 + ]  [ K c3 ]  [ R g2 ]  [ h4 + ]  [ K h6 ]  [ K x c4 ]  [ R x g3 ]  [ K c3 ]  [ g5 ]  [ h x g5 + ]  [ K x g5 ]  [ R f1 ]  [ f4 ]  [ N x f4 ]  [ d2 + ]  [ K x d2 ] , [ R a3 ]  Most people would accept a draw here but not my opponent
 [ B x g5 ] , [ K g6 ]  Reuben sadly doesn't move his bishop and with this a forced checkmate follows.
 [ R x e3 ]  [ R x d5 ] , [ R f e1 ]  Doubled Rooks on the open file. I think this is quite a bit stronger than 21.[ R x [ f3 ] ] as I mentioned earlier. The [ f1 ] Rook really needed activation and White needs to retain control of the e-file. However it's worth mentioning that White must take [ f3 ] before he can go on the offensive since otherwise Black threatens a simple back-rank mate at any moment.
 [ N d4 ] , [ B x d4 ]  19 Bxd4! - White sacrifices his evil dark bishop a wakeup call for me! Now I will loose a pawn. I just have to decide the best way to do it. My plan is to improve the light bishop and disrupt his position.
 [ R c1 ]  [ B d2 ]  [ R c2 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ B x e5 ]  [ R x c8 + ]  [ R x c8 ]  [ R g5 ] , [ R c1 # ]  Made lots of mistakes so I lost the game. If I was in the position now I would have played 26... [ b c4 ] And he probably would have gone for [ b x h2 ] or something. Then I would have gone for r[ g5 ]  [ K d8 ] , [ R f1 ]  Finally mobilising my last piece and threatening Rf1-[ f8 ] mate.
 [ B d2 ]  [ B x d2 + ]  [ N b x d2 ] , [ d5 ]  8. ............ [ d5 ] - black counters in the centre.
 [ Q e4 + ]  [ K a1 ] , [ N e3 ]  did i forget to bishop?? Noo i saw better than bishop.. ;)
 [ R x b2 + ]  [ K c1 ] , [ R x e2 ]  Now black's advantage is overwhelming. One I couldn't save for a change. But still an interesting midgame (for my standards).
 [ f3 ]  [ N b d7 ]  [ g4 ] , [ N b6 ]  Nb6? A dubious move on my behalf. Originally 9.[ N b d7 ] was aimed at backing up my knight on [ f6 ] but then [ N b6 ] was aimed ...[ B [ c4 ] ] offering a bishop exchange and hoping for my knight on [ c4 ] thus forking white bishop and b pawn thus breaking up that phalanx of pawns. Better may have been ...[ b5 ] or ...Rc8.
 [ B f4 + ]  [ R e3 ]  [ B x e3 + ] , [ f x e3 ]  Apart from the decisive material imbalance White's pieces are fixed in place with the only means of release (Bb2) making Black's job easier. Otherwise Black can now very easily centralise the King exchange and win pawns and promote. (Fritz: -6.76)
 [ a x b4 ] , [ h x g3 ]  White captures my knight but I am continuing to attack with my pawns. White's move has blocked the b file which white may have thought would stop my rook coming down to attack the king. Meanwhile I capture white's pawn at [ g3 ] so I have a pawn protecting my [ f2 ] pawn plus my LB at [ h3 ] is protecting the queening square.
 [ N x b1 ]  [ R x b1 ] , [ g6 ]  So two points down not many options to attack available things are not looking good.
 [ e6 ] , [ K b2 ]  Black chases but the game's over.
 [ N d4 ]  [ B h6 ]  [ d3 ]  [ Q f6 ]  [ N b5 ]  [ K d8 ]  [ B e3 ] , [ N c6 ]  Standard chessbook stuff... trying to get all my pieces out and clear the way for Castling
 [ d5 ] , [ c4 ]  The overwhelmingly preferred move in this position: the Queen's Gambit. White intends to draw Black's central pawn onto the wing and grab a lion's share of the centre.
 [ N x e4 ] , [ R x e4 ]  While white's position is active black is still very solid and should easily draw. I would only say that white is slightly better.
 [ K f1 ]  [ Q e5 ]  [ h3 ]  [ Q e3 ]  [ R d7 ]  [ Q b6 ] , [ R d7 x d5 ]  46. R7[ x d5 ] - could not prevent that d pawn from dropping off. Glenda vainly tries to counter-attack the relatively weak queenside pawns.
 [ N h3 ] , [ N e6 ]  Presumably he wants to put pressure on my [ N h3 ] and threaten a K exposure.
 [ R f4 ] , [ Q c8 + ]  Only decent move still...
 [ R a d1 ] , [ B d7 ]  Now Black demonstrates a stubborn unwillingness to give up the queen. While there is no way to do so and stay ahead in material it would have resulted in an endgame where Black has a rook and knight for it and might still be able to put some play together.
 [ O-O ]  [ d3 ] , [ N f5 ]  Was looking at getting rid of the h-Pawn and threatening the Rook something like 11.[ [ h5 ] ] [ N g3 ] 12.[ h x g6 ] [ f x g6 ] 13.Rf2. Or I could've ignored the Pawn and gone through with something like 11.[ [ h5 ] ] [ N g3 ] 12.[ h x g6 ] Nxf113.[ g x h7 + ] [ K x h7 ] 14.Bxf1. Wasn't sure which line I preferred yet but White had other ideas anyway.
 [ N c6 + ]  [ N x c6 ]  [ R x c6 ]  [ N f4 ] , [ R c3 ]  [ g2 ] is taboo of course ([ R g1 ] then Rxg7)
 [ Q e7 ] , [ Q h5 ]  We're both close to 10 mins each here...
 [ d6 ]  [ g4 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ N e2 ]  This blocks the queen's protection of Pg4.
 [ B x h7 + ]  [ K h8 ] , [ R e1 ]  threatening mate in 1
 [ b x c4 ] , [ N x h7 ]  Not sure why but that knight had a suicide mission since he was moved there.
 [ N d5 ] , [ Q d6 ]  protecting [ f6 ]  [ R h5 ] , [ a6 ]  preparing and queen side attack and exploiting a fork threat on [ b5 ]  [ B b3 ]  [ a5 ] , [ f4 ]  classic approach when attacked on the wing counter in center unfortunately it s creating a massive weakness on [ e3 ]  [ a4 ] , [ B a2 ]  bishop find safety behind pawn chain on a very good diagonal
 [ R x c6 ]  [ a x b4 ] , [ R x d6 ]  At last White has regained material equality but Black's position is about to become much freer once the pressure on the d-file has been neutralised.
 [ K f8 ] , [ N d6 ]  As now not only is his Bishop attacked but I will take his [ f7 ] pawn with check.
 [ R c7 ] , [ d4 ]  Still White doesn't take the hapless rook advancing the d-pawn as planned.
 [ Q f5 ]  [ R b5 ]  [ Q x f4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ Q c1 + ]  [ K e2 ] , [ R c8 ]  should I be scared? No i saw the key to get out of here
 [ B f5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ a3 ] , [ c5 ]  Black generally does pretty well with [ N f6 ] here. P[ c5 ] (from the database) appears to give white a slight advantage.
 [ e x d5 ]  [ N b4 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ c6 ]  He is taking control of the center. [ d5 ] is starting to look more and more like a gambit than a pawn drop if not a very effective one. d5[ x c6 ] is practically forced...
 [ Q e5 ]  [ N h3 ]  [ R g8 ]  [ R f e1 ]  [ Q c5 ]  [ B h7 ] , [ R h8 ]  here I didn't really have much
 [ b6 ]  [ a x b6 ]  [ K x b6 ]  [ g3 ]  [ R f3 ] , [ B f4 ]  [ B f4 ] Again white tries to trap the rook and make queening along the h-file possible.
 [ N c4 ] , [ K e2 ]  preparing [ f3 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ a3 ]  [ R c b8 ] , [ R d b1 ]  mistake according to the computer.
 [ Q c2 ]  [ R c8 ] , [ b4 ]  To prevent from a future attack with the queen-side pawns which may happen in a sudden.
 [ Q e3 ]  [ B g7 ] , [ B d2 ]  With that being said Ted continues with his development.
 [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ] , [ c5 ]  Aiming for the Benko (3.[ d5 ] b5). Unfortunately my opponent did not feel like allowing this and after this I made a hash of the opening.
 [ N c6 ] , [ g4 ]  Gaining space on the kingside and protecting the G pawn but opens up the kingside too much and discourages me from castling in that direction
 [ N f3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ g3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ B g2 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ d3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ e4 ] , [ e5 ]  I'm obviously going with KIA. My opponent has mirrored my moves.
 [ e6 ] , [ d4 ]  white occupate the center
 [ B a4 ]  [ R h c8 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ Q c5 + ]  [ K h1 ] , [ d4 ]  From about here I'm done no space and nothing to protect the c and d files
 [ K x e1 ]  [ R a8 ]  [ d5 + ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ R b6 + ]  [ K e5 ]  [ c x d5 ] , [ N x d5 ]  I set my hopes on [ K x d5 ] to move [ h4 ] later.Unfortunately.It looks that the game is coming to an end and the result could be not possitive to me..:)
 [ R d1 ]  [ B x c3 ]  [ R c1 ]  [ Q x a3 ]  [ R x c3 ] , [ Q x c3 ]  forces the exchange of queens and gives a winning advantage to black because of the mobility of his queen pawns
 [ B e2 ]  [ O-O ] , [ B x f6 ]  Things are pretty stale I figure I'd better get some action going before one of us is bored to death. Plus I weaken the power of the bishop on g4.
 [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B b4 ] , [ N h4 ]  The french queen dines on white horse a delicacy in those parts. Before moving the knight to the side of the board advancing the g pawn one square would have offered it some cover. Otherwise you're sacrificing a valuable piece just to draw the french (black) queen out.
 [ f4 ]  [ R b7 ]  [ a4 ]  [ a5 ]  [ R f1 ] , [ R b4 ]  Keeping the pressure on trying not to let the extra rook and knight overwhelm the queen's advantage.
 [ K x f7 ]  [ Q e6 + ]  [ K e8 ]  [ g6 ]  [ N g f6 ] , [ Q f7 + ]  Black has had enough and resigns. A possible continuation might be 17...[ K d8 ] 18. [ N e6 + ] [ K c8 ] 19.[ N x c7 ] [ B g8 ] 20.[ Q x f8 ] [ N x f8 ] 21.[ N x a8 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ N f3 ]  Reply with e5. Stops Knight advance to [ g5 ] and continues development.
 [ g5 ]  [ K g2 ] , [ g4 ]  A mistake. 54... P-[ B5 ] would leave Black with two connected passed Pawns if I chose to exchange them.
 [ B x d5 ]  [ B x d5 ]  [ Q x d5 ] , [ N b4 ]  ? Not surprised to see my Q attacked. Here I gave advise but was a little off as Sue will only lose a pawn and not a piece. I did say that I will cost material but I thought it was a pawn. However it was just one move that I overlooked which was 20...[ [ a5 ] ] since in all other variations black loses a piece. But it was 20...[ [ a5 ] ] that I overlooked. But losing a pawn isn't completely off. So I was a little overly critical but not completely to say ?? I understand why you played this. As the Queen appears attacked. But black has other options like 19...[ N [ b8 ] ] 19...Na7. I don't like it on [ a7 ] as well as it's on the rim. And bringing back to [ b8 ] does undevelop though from there it can go to [ d7 ] followed by [ f6 ] with a nice position. However best was 19...[ N e7 ] as now I'm forced to retreat. And from there black 20...[ N f5 ] where the N is well placed. But this move however is going to lose more material. Correcting a little bit of what I said I reposted by saying Edit: 19...Nb8?? does not work as the Rook is not protected. But better was 19...N[ a7 ] or 19...[ N e7 ] However for the reasons noted 19...[ N e7 ] was best. Therefore it's actually would've been more accurate to post it as ? then an ?? move since it's nothing terrible.
 [ N x c4 ] , [ N f6 ]  4. ........ [ N f6 ] - if the knight had been on [ c3 ] instead of [ c4 ] it would be a weird kind of four knights opening without the pawns in the centre!!
 [ B f4 ] , [ B d6 ]  black mistakenly offers up his only mobil B (the Q-side dark squares offer good line placement) while allowing white to force black to lose a move's time against the Q-side pawn push by making Q recapture with his Q. better is 25....[ Q c6 ] if black intends to continue with the Q-side push.
 [ B g5 ] , [ B d7 ]  Getting my bishop into the action.
 [ B x e5 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ a3 ]  Clearly to prevent 6. ... [ B b4 + ] but in fact merely wastes a move.
 [ R c2 ]  [ R b x c2 ]  [ Q x c2 + ]  [ R x c2 ] , [ b8 = Q ]  White gets his shiny new Queen at last! But just in time for...
 [ a x b3 ] , [ B x d5 ]  Mission accomplished!
 [ a5 ] , [ N x a5 ]  32. [ N x a5 ] - I am now faced with another dilemma I have an opportunity to destroy most of that pawn mass at the cost of my knight. Should I take it? I think I will make the game safe but I think my winning chances are virtually nil.
 [ R b7 ] , [ R d d1 ]  There seems to be no reasonable move I can make in this position but this one re-connecting my rooks. At this time in the game I kept moving my rook up and down waiting for Black to come up with anything. I felt he did have an advantage but nothing concrete... yet.
 [ B d2 ] , [ Q b6 ]  The problem with this move is that now White has [ d3 ] for his Bishop. Best was the ignominious retreat 15. … [ Q d8 ]  [ c4 ] , [ N f6 ]  I gotta say it felt pretty good to play this move. I haven't played anything so pretty in a long time!
 [ K c2 ]  [ N x c3 ]  [ N x c3 ] , [ B f5 + ]  I thought of castling here (0-0) but wanted to keep the pressure on his King to see what he does...if he plays [ K2 ] then I bring-out my Queen to [ g5 ] then castle. Right now there is no threat to my King.
 [ Q a3 ]  [ N d3 ] , [ N c3 ]  Mistake much better was 32.Ba4!-Rxb2(32...Bc5.33.Bxc5-Rxe2+.34.Kg3-Rbxb2.35.Bc2!and white is better ) 33.Qxb2-[ N x b2 ] .34.[ B x e8 ] with big advantage for white.
 [ N f3 ] , [ B d6 ]  Black wants to castle so the bishop move clears the way. I considered 4. ... [ B b4 ] but after 5. [ B d2 ] we just end up exchanging bishops. I wanted to keep the position complex so exhanging pieces early was contrary to my plans in that regard. Of course white can easily play [ c5 ] at any time to drive back my bishop so [ e6 ] might not have been the wisest choice for black here.
 [ d4 ]  [ b5 ]  [ f5 ]  [ b4 ]  [ f6 ]  [ R g8 ]  [ f7 ]  [ R f8 ]  [ d5 ]  [ b3 ]  [ d7 + ]  [ K d8 ]  [ N c6 + ] , [ K x d7 ]  bad move by white on #52
 [ N d4 ] , [ c3 ]  ? Missing the fork. Black's attack also illustrates the problem with trying to defend doubled pawns while short on pieces: overwhelming attacks.
 [ N e4 ]  [ Q c2 ] , [ B b7 ]  Did not expect this move but f5. I won't trade my bishop for his knight now. That would make his bishop too powerful. But since his bishop is now blocking his b-file I can try to open up the queenside. His rooks will now not be able to defend the b-file since the bishop is in the way.
 [ R e1 ] , [ N f6 ]  Again going for f2.
 [ Q d3 ] , [ B c4 ]  This move releases the pressure on my mid-back-hovskys-smovky-piddleplop. Very nice move I can't help but congratulate myself.
 [ K e7 ] , [ N d5 # ]  Known as de Legal's trap this combination has been used by masters for centuries to take down duffers in simultaneous exhibitions. It has even appeared in modified form in some games between two masters!
 [ R d3 ] , [ N b4 ]  i whould like to get rid of this [ c3 ] bishop whitch is defending [ b2 ]  [ R d3 ]  [ N x c3 + ] , [ R x c3 ]  the white position is still strong but i win the center and a paw ! preparing the alignment of my rooks in d8-[ d1 ]  [ R x d4 ] , [ Q x f7 ]  paw back for white it doesnt matter this [ f7 ] paw have not the same value than the [ d4 ] white paw i have eaten ! so now i 'm going to threat a mat : 21. Qx[ f7 ] [ R h d8 ] 22. ...Rd4[ d1 + ] 23.h1[ x d1 ] - d8[ x d1 + + ] !!!!!!!
 [ g4 ]  [ R d3 ]  [ f3 ]  [ R d2 ] , [ Q c5 + ]  24. [ R h6 ] would also have won it.
 [ Q x b5 ]  [ R b1 ] , [ Q a6 ]  ? In hindsight I think [ Q a5 ] may have been slightly better. There are a lot of variations that give white decent attacking chances here I opted to be cautious. Thoughts?
 [ N c3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ f4 ]  [ B b4 ]  [ B d2 ]  [ d6 ]  [ f5 ]  [ B d7 ] , [ g4 ]  I don't know why he did this i'm not going to caste there any way.
 [ K h8 ] , [ Q f6 + ]  Well look at that! I've got...
 [ B x h6 ]  [ g x h6 ] , [ N e4 ]  here if he exchanges knights i develop my queen higher but im really hoping he doesnt exchange
 [ e5 ] , [ Q c5 + ]  ! wins his DSB
 [ B h3 ] , [ B x b7 ]  I should have played [ R f d1 ] here
 [ B x e2 ]  [ Q x e2 ]  [ a6 ]  [ h x g5 ]  [ f x g5 ]  [ Q h5 + ] , [ K d8 ]  I don't mind not castling. Just my way of playing. So this move didn't hurt me much.
 [ f x e3 ]  [ N e6 ] , [ Q f2 ]  23. [ Q f2 ] - the WQ defends.
 [ O-O ]  [ R e8 ] , [ e5 ]  ! →
 [ Q x a7 ] , [ B g4 # ]  And he didn't! After move 25 it seemed I managed to cope with the pressure doubtless there were other lines that white could have followed but glad I managed to survive that one!
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ a3 ] , [ N f6 ]  it was an opening i never played before
 [ R a d1 ] , [ O-O ]  Getting the king out of the way though surprisingly it is not as safe there as it looks.
 [ N f4 ] , [ Q g4 ]  Furthering the pressure on [ e6 ]  [ g3 ]  [ N g6 ] , [ f4 ]  I'm ready to attack now but he does have a way out by [ Q d2 ] then if I took the rook he gets my queen.
 [ e x d4 ]  [ e x d4 ] , [ Q e7 ]  I may be a whole minor piece down but his king is in a awkward position
 [ c6 ]  [ f4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ N g5 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ Q x g4 ]  [ N x g4 ]  [ B x f7 + ]  [ K d7 ]  [ B e6 + ]  [ K c7 ]  [ B x g4 ] , [ Q d6 ]  9. ..... [ Q d6 ] - ssss the Wicked Witch of the West is attacking my [ f4 ] pawn. What shall I do? I know a knight check ......
 [ B e7 ]  [ R a d1 ]  [ O-O ] , [ N e2 ]  Headed for the kingside.
 [ N f4 + ]  [ K f5 ] , [ N x h5 ]  The effect of White's remarkable 47th move can now be seen. By eliminating the h-pawns he has "widened the front" on the kingside and his king now has a potential entry route round the back of the black position via the h-file.
 [ a3 ]  [ N b3 ]  [ a2 ]  [ N a1 ]  [ N a3 ] , [ K c3 ]  I think it was around this time that I offered a draw. He declined.
 [ B e6 ]  [ R d2 ]  [ R a d8 ]  [ R x d8 ]  [ R x d8 ]  [ a4 ]  [ N d6 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N c4 ] , [ Q c1 ]  preventing the fork on [ a3 ]  [ N d2 ] , [ R b2 ]  pretty much forced due to the fork threat on [ b3 ]  [ N f3 + ] , [ K h1 ]  I didn't like the look of [ K f1 ] was this a mistake?
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ] , [ e5 ]  Going into the budepest gambit.
 [ N f3 ]  [ d5 ] , [ h3 ]  Now I can save the bishop just in case. It is not regarded as good.
 [ d6 ]  [ K e8 ]  [ h4 ] , [ R c4 ]  White should try to avoid the Rook trade!
 [ c4 ]  [ c6 ]  [ c x d5 ] , [ N f6 ]  This move makes my position a little safer as with the Knight on Black's [ K B3 ] it eliminates the possiblity of ...Q-[ R5 ] ch in the future.
 [ R a e1 ]  [ R x e1 ]  [ R x e1 ] , [ B g6 ]  Black is ahead two points--all even trades count in his favor. If white doesn't trade the c pawn doesn't actually fall because [ R c1 ] pins BxPc2. Very bad for black.
 [ R x c8 + ]  [ B x c8 ] , [ N e2 ]  Yep and black resigns here. Personally I would not have but what I know is that players like me should not give up hope because there might be a second chance if the opponent doesn't find the right move. That's why the idea is "Don't give up right away." Which was kind of that same idea as to what I noted in my last annotation. But the really strong players however will often resign after being a piece down as there's generally no chance of compensation since they're up against the strongest players such as this opponent.
 [ d x e4 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ] , [ Q a5 + ]  Both players are attacking without thinking of development.
 [ Q d2 ] , [ N x g4 ]  21. ................. [ N x g4 ] - with disastrous results!
 [ e x f3 ] , [ N x f3 ]  For compensation for the pawn I have better control of the centre my pieces can find good squares easily I have a strong central d-pawn and Black will have a hard time trying to develop and position his units.
 [ h6 ]  [ h5 ] , [ B h7 ]  White develops
 [ N e4 ] , [ R c7 ]  Not with a concrete plan but the most active square anyway.
 [ d5 ] , [ a3 ]  I play [ a3 ] now and the consistent follow up for Black is to capture. Now that Black has played ...[ d5 ] White has the option of recapturing with the pawn because he can un-double the pawns with exchanges.
 [ B d3 ]  [ O-O ] , [ a4 ]  1 chance on 2 that he will advance on b4...
 [ R d6 + ] , [ K f7 ]  By forcing the king away with an unchallengable rook the pawns are now isolated and hopefully can be killed.
 [ f x e4 ]  [ R e2 ]  [ R c4 ]  [ a3 ] , [ K d6 ]  "and now the tragic story".
 [ b6 ]  [ B x e7 ]  [ R f e8 ] , [ d6 ]  here it is the bishop is secure and my d pawn keeps it's steady advance
 [ c6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N f6 ] , [ c4 ]  Both Black and White have been working towards a favorable transposition. Here Black has gotten his bad bishop out but White is now pushing back.
 [ Q e1 ] , [ f5 ]  White's light square bishop is less dangerous (for now)
 [ N b d2 ]  [ d x e3 ]  [ B x e3 ] , [ N e4 ]  There are now three pieces both attacking and defending the white [ d2 ] square and if Black can bring another piece into play white is going to have a difficult time
 [ R e1 ]  [ R c6 ] , [ B c1 ]  Attacking the weak pawn on e3.
 [ c x b6 ] , [ Q x b6 ]  Now I am going to lose a pawn if I am not very careful. Now: a rated player (or myself in a non-blitz game) would have had to be able to calculate this position and evaluate whether white is able to keep his pawns or not. Given "yes" white would have reached an equal endgame... not much!
 [ b x c4 ]  [ R x b1 ]  [ R x b1 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B x a5 ] , [ R a8 ]  taking one pawn back with a better position.
 [ a x b6 ] , [ N d5 ]  Black must have seen this is coming after 22.[ N x b6 ] but there wasn't much he could do about it. The Knight is untouchable because of the subsequent pin on the Queen.
 [ R f4 x f1 + ]  [ N x f1 ] , [ g3 ]  ?
 [ f6 ] , [ N e5 ]  Probably wrong but making life complicated for my opponent...
 [ K g7 ]  [ K g3 ]  [ K f6 ]  [ R f1 + ] , [ K e6 ]  A difficult decision. Moving the K to the N file would keep it near the threatened passed P but trap the King on the flank.
 [ R c7 ]  [ R c5 ] , [ R f6 ]  Better was [ K f7 ] so my R had forbidden both places.
 [ d6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ e4 ] , [ B g7 ]  7. ...... [ B g7 ] - Putting pressure on the a1-[ h8 ] diagonal.
 [ Q h6 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ N x e4 ] , [ B x e4 ]  17. [ B x e4 ] - knight trade.
 [ Q c2 ]  [ K a1 ] , [ Q b3 ]  I think this was his biggest blunder. Better would have been [ Q c3 ] pinning my pawn.
 [ B e3 ] , [ B x e3 ]  accepted the exchange to be 1 pawn up
 [ N c3 ] , [ g5 ]  Black needs to safeguard his king before playing moves like this.
 [ N f1 ]  [ K f8 ]  [ f3 ]  [ N h5 ]  [ B f2 ] , [ N f4 ]  A good outpost for the Knight.
 [ e4 ]  [ Q h5 ]  [ N d1 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N e3 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ N x g4 ] , [ N x g4 ]  Black has no attack.
 [ B d2 ]  [ d6 ]  [ O-O-O ] , [ Q e7 ]  7. ........ Qe7. I start to clear the decks so that I can choose whether to castle kingside or queenside. I would prefer to castle queenside same side as Freddy this time but there is the possibility of Freddy putting a knight on d5. Freddy prepares for it by playing e4. This move makes [ N [ d5 ] ] a very strong move because if there is an exchange of knights on [ d5 ] the e pawn will recapture threaten the [ c6 ] knight and open up the possibility of a rook pin on the e column. Henry and Glenda are really sitting ducks there!
 [ B a3 ]  [ Q c4 ]  [ B d6 + ]  [ K d7 ] , [ B c6 + ]  The bishop on [ d6 ] cannot be taken because of the discovery on b5. This move is stronger that 31.[ B x b8 ] because the [ a6 ] rook is attacked 31.[ B x b8 ] Qx[ a6 ] 32.[ B c7 ] [ c2 ] would give black hope.
 [ R d8 x d7 ]  [ R x d7 ]  [ R x d7 ]  [ b5 ]  [ R b7 ]  [ a4 ] , [ B c2 ]  ? [ B d3 ] seems preferrable; I think this only forces [ R a1 ] (and you don't really want the White Rook behind his passed pawns). With [ B d3 ] you have fighting chances at wedging the Bishop in front of one pawn and holding the line that way freeing your Rook for bigger and better things.
 [ h6 ]  [ B h4 ]  [ g5 ]  [ B g3 ] , [ B b7 ]  After I retreat he decides to fianchetto his LSB. In this position that move is very effective for two reasons. First nothing is blocking his diagonal like his Knight. Second this is the only way for him to develop his LSB as there is still a pawn on c7.
 [ B x c7 ]  [ B x c5 ]  [ d x c5 ]  [ Q x c5 ] , [ N g5 ]  To correct my misjudgement I played this move. As now exchanging will give me an immediate advantage as we will see.
 [ Q x c3 ]  [ R x c3 ]  [ f x e4 ]  [ R e3 ] , [ e x f3 ]  not a good move as i now trade and have a clear position with no Black counterplay
 [ N a x c5 ] , [ B c2 ]  Remembering the lesson of the game against piratiizi and allowing eventually [ a3 ] without getting forked by the knight.
 [ N a4 ] , [ N b6 ]  ?
 [ N f6 ]  [ b4 ]  [ B g7 ] , [ B b2 ]  As I'm not familiar with this opening at all I'm going for early safety and aiming to castle soon. This should give me a little time to see what my opponent is up to
 [ N x f6 ]  [ Q x f7 ]  [ R x f7 ] , [ O-O ]  ... and hope to press home the pawn advantage thinking four pawns for the knight would see me through .. especially as the kings side is wide open.
 [ K h7 ]  [ R e7 + ]  [ K g8 ] , [ B c4 + ]  gotcha. no more need to worry about mate
 [ Q x a4 ]  [ N x a4 ]  [ N x h1 ]  [ R x h1 ]  [ R a f8 ]  [ R h3 ]  [ N f4 ]  [ R h2 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ N h3 ]  [ R x f3 ]  [ N f2 ]  [ R h f8 ]  [ N d3 ]  [ h3 ] , [ K d2 ]  Black's advantage grows in pawns. All thanks to that fork. The king no longer needs the castle he lost. I have thrown this game away with one foolish move.
 [ c4 ]  [ B x c4 ]  [ N d1 + ]  [ K b3 ] , [ N x f2 ]  33. ..... [ N x f2 ] - the crazy captures have not come to an end!
 [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B d3 ] , [ B d7 ]  Another move that didn't seem to accomplish a great deal to me unless Black is planning on a longside castle which does actually happen in the game continuation.
 [ K d7 ] , [ N a c5 + ]  Now the other knight joins the action! Having knights defending each other like this can either be a weakness or a strength. It is a weakness if the knights get in each other's way (this is often called "the superfluous knight"). But it is a strength as here if they are immune to attack by pawns and can remain as a self-supporting unit a thorn in the enemy's side controlling several useful squares.
 [ B a7 ]  [ a6 ]  [ Q g4 ]  [ Q e1 ]  [ Q e6 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ Q g4 ]  [ Q d5 ]  [ Q e6 ]  [ Q x e6 ]  [ f x e6 ]  [ K g2 ]  [ K g7 ]  [ K f3 ]  [ K f6 ]  [ K e4 ]  [ B b6 ]  [ f4 ]  [ h5 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ K e7 ]  [ B c6 ]  [ K d6 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ B a7 ]  [ K f3 ]  [ K e7 ]  [ e4 ]  [ K d6 ]  [ g4 ]  [ K e7 ]  [ g x h5 ]  [ g x h5 ]  [ f5 ]  [ e5 ]  [ K e2 ]  [ K d6 ]  [ K d3 ]  [ K c7 ]  [ f6 ]  [ K d7 ]  [ f7 ]  [ K e7 ]  [ B d5 ]  [ K f8 ]  [ K c4 ]  [ K e7 ]  [ K b5 ]  [ K f8 ]  [ K c6 ]  [ K e7 ]  [ K b7 ]  [ B d4 ] , [ a7 ]  poor Bishop
 [ c6 ]  [ e4 ]  [ c x d5 ] , [ e x d5 ]  Now my queenside will become my weak wing so I should have to castle kingside and... the game will be a normal one.
 [ K c4 ] , [ Q d3 + ]  Now to move in for the kill.
 [ B x d5 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ R d4 d2 ]  [ B x d5 ]  [ R d2 x d5 ]  [ R d c8 ]  [ R d5 d7 ] , [ B x b2 ]  sacrifice with the hope of promoting the c pawn but I miscalculated as we will see
 [ N b d7 ]  [ O-O ]  [ R e8 ]  [ N e2 ]  [ N f8 ]  [ N g3 ] , [ N g6 ]  The N is happier on g6.
 [ R e1 ]  [ N f5 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ f6 ]  [ e x f6 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ B x f6 ] , [ Q x f6 ]  we need to control d4...
 [ g5 ] , [ N h5 ]  Taking the pawn opens the h-file toward Black's king but also allows Black to unleash his bishop toward my overextended position.
 [ B x g7 ]  [ Q h4 + ] , [ K f1 ]  Now the White king has [ f1 ] to go to it is not so bad for White. Quite honestly I am not sure what is going on in the position it seems pretty wild!
 [ Q x e4 ]  [ R f e8 ]  [ Q c4 ]  [ B e5 ]  [ B x e5 ]  [ R x e5 ] , [ d6 ]  An inaccuracy ...
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ f4 ] , [ Q h4 + ]  Bad idea - you will lose time when the queen is pushed back by the pawn.
 [ e4 ] , [ e5 ]  Kings pawn opening
 [ N f3 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ N c3 ]  [ N c3 ] is flexible in case of [ e6 ] transposing into the semi-slav.
 [ d5 ] , [ e5 ]  Classical answer
 [ B x f6 ] , [ N x f6 ]  Not 10...[ B x f6 ] locking the dsb on the KS where the pawn structure inhibits its movement. Now the knight reinforces e4. wish should become a target for the black pieces. Black might be slightly better out of the opening.
 [ K e5 ]  [ a5 ]  [ f5 ]  [ K b6 ]  [ f4 ] , [ a6 ]  At this point my opponent offered me a draw and I declined. I was certainly ahead in the match and their was only one acceptable result.
 [ N x e4 ]  [ f5 ]  [ N g5 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ R d8 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ R h8 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N x h7 ]  [ N e4 + ]  [ K f3 ]  [ K c5 ]  [ R a8 ]  [ K b6 ]  [ N g5 ] , [ N d2 + ]  A pointless check; it achieves nothing.
 [ e4 ] , [ e5 ]  ?! Black chooses to block the centre up entirely however his Queen in now somewhat misplaced as Black obviously intends to play ...d6.
 [ O-O ]  [ f5 ] , [ e5 ]  I decided to try to take his last active piece out of play.
 [ K e3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ f x g6 + ]  [ K x g6 ]  [ K e4 ]  [ K f6 ]  [ h4 ]  [ b6 ]  [ g5 + ] , [ h x g5 ]  My next move would have been [ h x g5 + ] and possibly the response would be [ K x g5 ] and mine [ K x e5 ] but my numerical pawn advantage told.
 [ N e4 ] , [ R e d1 ]  31. [ R e d1 ] - white can only delay the mate with the self-immolating Re2. He decided not to do this and my knight comes to g6. White decided to resign on the grounds of Unavoidable Mate here and I pick up 10 useful rating points.
 [ e5 ]  [ N f d7 ] , [ B d3 ]  The best diagonal for white's light-squared bishop in the French usually. Here it targets [ h7 ] which is that bit weaker now that black's knight can't get to f6.
 [ a x b5 ]  [ B x b5 ]  [ N e5 ] , [ a4 ]  Still pushing pawns leaving two pieces undeveloped.
 [ R d3 ]  [ R a d8 ]  [ Q c4 ]  [ R x d3 ]  [ Q x d3 ] , [ Q x c3 ]  wants to exchange queens for an endgame with a piece up
 [ R x b7 ]  [ Q x b7 ]  [ Q e3 ]  [ g4 ]  [ Q g5 + ]  [ K f8 ]  [ Q f6 + ]  [ K g8 ]  [ Q g6 + ]  [ K f8 ] , [ Q x h5 ]  Winning a pawn without removing the pressure.
 [ c3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ B d2 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ O-O ] , [ O-O ]  But my opponent played all these moves quickly looking as if he were playing a line quite familiar to him and I started wondering if I would be getting in trouble soon.
 [ Q d1 ] , [ f5 ]  The computer says I should have left my pawn on [ f6 ] and castled short. Normally I would have castled by now however the match was playing differently than foreseen and I did not see the need to castle.
 [ b x c5 ] , [ a3 ]  finally open the liberty door to Ra1.
 [ f4 + ] , [ K e6 ]  Forced back to the sixth rank by the pawn.
 [ f x g6 + ] , [ K g7 ]  Now Black is using his opponent's pawn as shelter.
 [ R x d8 ]  [ R x d8 + ]  [ K f7 ]  [ R b8 ] , [ N e4 ]  A sly trap!Black threatens [ R e1 # ]  [ R x b7 + ]  [ K f6 ] , [ g4 ]  Protecting the knight and defending 27...[ R e1 # ]  [ R x b2 ]  [ N x g7 ]  [ K g6 ]  [ N h5 ]  [ N c5 ]  [ R b6 + ]  [ K g5 ]  [ b4 ] , [ N e4 ]  White's queenside pawns will fall.
 [ R c7 ] , [ R a e1 ]  Getting my rook on the beautiful open file :D
 [ b3 ] , [ a5 ]  with [ c5 ] secured against any sudden infiltration I get to consolidate my b pawn also avoiding any tactics related to a double attack on the a pawn and queen by the knight with Nc5...
 [ N c5 ] , [ R d1 ]  Discretion is the only part of valor here.
 [ N f d3 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ N x f4 ] , [ g x f4 ]  A series of exchanges occurs where I do end up making up the missed knight. Better for black would have been 23.... Nxe5. Then i could not have recaptured.
 [ N b3 ] , [ b4 ]  and even more so now...
 [ K x d2 ]  [ K e7 ]  [ K d3 ]  [ K d6 ] , [ K d4 ]  White has the opposition but Black has a huge advantage--two connected passed pawns just out of reach.
 [ N f7 ]  [ R g8 ] , [ B e5 ]  (!) Centralisation! Also good was 26.[ N e5 ] but the move played is more effective and the more visually pleasing.
 [ a6 ]  [ B x c6 ]  [ B x c6 ]  [ B d2 ] , [ b5 ]  The plans for both sides are clearer. White will attempt to close the position maximally and to provide support for the knights over the bishops. Black should open up the position for the bishops but only after he has caught up in the development and safety of the king. You can tell the correct plan in an instant by looking at the position and looking at the motifs and ideas for both sides.
 [ R f e1 ] , [ B d2 ]  Now I can create a Pawn weakness for White...
 [ f6 ] , [ h5 ]  fighting for the initiative.
 [ Q x d1 ] , [ Q a5 ]  the best one: we soon need to neutralize White's pawn majority on the Queens' side...
 [ B g6 ] , [ N e5 ]  I attack again and threaten to double up his pawns on the g files. After what happened in our first game Carl is not about to let me take of his weakest square on the board.
 [ K h7 ] , [ R c3 ]  a pin that is crushing
 [ B x f3 ] , [ Q x f3 ]  Now the White Queen has a relatively open board to roam on. The consequences will be disastrous for Black.
 [ N g2 ] , [ b4 ]  passed pawn
 [ N c6 ]  [ B x c6 ] , [ b x c6 ]  27. [ b x c6 ] - this B for N trade has brought the pawn one step closer to Henry. Trouble is he is gonna have to abandon the kingside pawns to round it up!
 [ g x f5 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ f4 ]  [ N x e7 + ]  [ N x e7 ]  [ B f2 ] , [ N g6 ]  ? - Now it was Black's turn to uncork some aggression of his own with 14. ...d5! ripping the center open and giving full scope to Black's Bishops.
 [ c x b6 ] , [ c7 ]  Black resigned. After eg. 27. - [ N f6 ] 28. [ R c1 ] [ Q x a7 ] 29. [ c Q8 ] [ N g8 ] 30. [ R c7 ] Black is lost.
 [ e x d4 ]  [ c3 ]  [ d x c3 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ c x b2 ] , [ B x b2 ]  6. [ B x [ b2 ] ] - at last the pawn that started on [ e7 ] has finally been captured on [ b2 ] all in the space of 6 moves!
 [ Q c7 ]  [ d5 ] , [ h5 ]  Especially on this move. I was expecting Qh3.
 [ N c6 ]  [ B x c6 + ]  [ B d7 ]  [ B x a8 ]  [ Q x a8 ] , [ g3 ]  ?????
 [ d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ B b5 ]  Gains a tempo allows White to castle pins Black's knight to the king and threatens the knight. Threatens a fork following capture of Black's knight.
 [ R x d8 + ]  [ K x d8 ]  [ N x e6 + ]  [ f x e6 ] , [ N e4 ]  N in Rogic Davor (CRO) - Dabo-Peranic Robert (CRO) Croatia 1992 [ B g5 ] was played the game ended in a draw with this move white diverged but I can still transpose in to the game by playing [ B e7 ]  [ B e7 ] , [ B f4 ]  surprised me! I was expecting either [ B g5 ] or the even more probable [ N g5 ] point being of playing 14.[ N e4 ] instead of 14.[ B g5 ]  [ K c8 ] , [ B g5 ]  white forces the exchange due to the threats [ g4 ] and [ N x c4 ] next
 [ Q d1 ]  [ Q b6 ]  [ N b d2 ]  [ Q x b2 ]  [ Q c1 ]  [ B a3 ]  [ Q x b2 ]  [ B x b2 ]  [ R b1 ]  [ B x c3 ] , [ O-O ]  It was touch move.
 [ O-O ] , [ h3 ]  This is not to stop [ B g4 ] that pin is useless. [ B g4 ] [ h3 ] [ B x f3 ] [ Q x f3 ] etc and white has a more pieces out in the open. The idea behind this move is just pawn expansion on king side
 [ N g6 + ]  [ N x g6 ]  [ B x g6 ]  [ b6 ] , [ N c2 ]  I am not sure why white played. But this time it is safe to say it as I don't see a danger in a move I'm thinking about. And with that being said I would've played 28.[ N c4 ] which is a better outpost for his N. The idea being is that it is semi cramped on [ c2 ] meaning this is not a comfortable square for him. And after say 28...[ d5 ] my next move would be 29.[ N e5 ] If however 28...[ b5 ] then I would answer with 29.[ N e3 ]  [ B c2 ] , [ e5 ]  Going after white's N with the reason being to achieve another set of pawn chains. It is worth noting that tactical-abyss also taught me about the importance of a pawn chain. And although I have been corrected for getting them wrong I now see the importance of that and where you really need them.
 [ e4 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ d3 ] , [ f5 ]  Challenging the center.
 [ N x d3 + ]  [ K f1 ]  [ N x b2 ]  [ K e2 ]  [ B g4 + ]  [ K f2 ]  [ N d3 + ] , [ K f1 ]  Was in real need of some breathing space!
 [ Q f4 ]  [ Q e6 ] , [ h4 ]  An aggressive pawn move: perhaps White is going in for an attack on Black's kingside.
 [ R c4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ] , [ B f1 ]  He looks menacing but I'm not really worried about it as I analyzed and it seems he doesn't really have a way of getting mate.
 [ N c4 ] , [ B g4 ]  I lost the pawn but did put the queen into a bad position so I thought pushing her around was a good strategy.
 [ B f2 ] , [ B x f2 # ]  With that being said despite the mistakes I had the lesson to be learned is still the same. Therefore the moral of this story is word of advice that chesskingdom64 gave to me. "The openings must used with the greatest care. What you do in the opening will affect you in the midgame; what you do in the midgame will affect you in the endgame; and what you do in the endgame will affect you in the endgame." That's what happened here because Ted blundered in the opening which indirectly (since he overlooked my errors) took it's toll here.
 [ K x h7 ] , [ N g5 + ]  12. [ N g5 + ] - this knight check opens up a line for the WQ to come to h5.
 [ f6 ]  [ g x f6 ]  [ Q h6 ]  [ f5 ] , [ B x f7 + ]  !! A elegant finish. Whether of not he captures the bishop Black loses material.
 [ N x g6 ]  [ f x g6 ] , [ B x d6 ]  I am not sure what happens if here [ R x f2 + ] Ke1. But probably it is not good for black. [ R x b2 ] [ B a3 ] Rmoves and I am free to attack g6.
 [ N e5 ] , [ g5 ]  The push... I wasn't expecting g5.
 [ Q a5 + ]  [ B d2 ]  [ b4 ] , [ f3 ]  ...this normally prepares [ e4 ] with strong central push....blacks eventual plan will be 0-0 and [ e6 ] opening the f file.
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ] , [ e6 ]  I think 2...[ e6 ] is the strongest defence with 2...c5.
 [ b x c3 ]  [ e x f6 ]  [ B x f6 ] , [ b x c3 ]  I really think it is a satisfactory position for Black. My both Bs are active and the initiative is mine.
 [ d3 ] , [ B e7 ]  He is now free to castle whenever he wants.
 [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ] , [ N e5 ]  Black sees the threat and takes defensive maneuvers. Sometimes they do not. But my opponent is a crafty one. Perhaps a Romulan?
 [ N x c4 ] , [ B x c4 ]  [ b x c4 ] is out of the question: it leaves black tied up trying to stop a pair of passed pawns.
 [ N f3 ]  [ a6 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ B g7 ] , [ O-O ]  Black's next move is the first one not out of the books :)
 [ B x d4 ] , [ B x d4 ]  The pressure against [ f2 ] is easily enough contained but the open a7-[ g1 ] diagonal is useful for Black.
 [ f x g4 + ]  [ K g3 ]  [ B f5 ] , [ h3 ]  Trying to find somewhere safe for my King. The black Bishops are extremely strong
 [ g5 ] , [ N d3 ]  28. [ N d3 ] - step 3 and now black trades off his knight and I get Fou Leblanc right back to where I wanted him.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ c3 ]  OK eventhought I am not an expert with this opening system I have a the ability to find similiarities with other systems or a practical appilication of postional appreciation! With this system white threatens to "bulid" a board pawn center this is the good... but on the "dark side" [ c3 ] take best square for the Nb1!
 [ d4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B g5 ] , [ d x c4 ]  This is not the usual move order at which I arrive at the accepted position and I think slightly better for white because it allows development and capture in the same move with the light squared Bishop
 [ R x e2 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ N e4 ] , [ N x e4 ]  Naturally I don't let my opponent centralize his own Knight.
 [ K f5 ] , [ h3 ]  Pushing the pawn with tempo - threatening checkmate with [ g4 ] now.
 [ Q d2 ]  [ Q x d2 + ]  [ N x d2 ] , [ B x b2 ]  Black gains a tempo and material.
 [ Q x b8 ] , [ f4 ]  I don't want to open the way for the bishop with e4.
 [ K d2 ] , [ N g3 ]  A very powerful move.
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ a6 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B g7 ]  [ B e3 ] , [ N g4 ]  Let's attack that bishop since it's tied down defending the knight.
 [ a5 ]  [ h4 ] , [ B x h4 ]  This was the blunder that should have lost the game. But as you'll see I finished this game in spectacularly bad fashion.
 [ B e2 ]  [ Q x g5 ]  [ R c1 ]  [ Q h4 + ]  [ K d1 ]  [ Q x h2 ]  [ Q d3 ]  [ Q g1 + ]  [ K c2 ]  [ Q g6 ]  [ K d1 ]  [ Q g1 + ]  [ K c2 ]  [ Q g6 ]  [ N b3 ] , [ Q x d3 + ]  Time to swap queens and look to promote a pawn
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B f4 ] , [ g6 ]  Stronger seems Nh5. If I don't want to take the bishop back I go [ B g3 ] accepting the exchange to use the h file.
 [ K e2 ]  [ K e7 ] , [ R d1 ]  Exchanging pieces is generally a good idea when material up especially when there is still plenty of material on the board.
 [ K a4 ] , [ R h5 ]  ﻿Temporarily protecting the a-pawn but it will fall eventually. Black should be able to trade rooks and move his h-pawn down the board to queen first.
 [ f5 ] , [ Q e2 ]  I'm kind of committed now as I have to guard the Bishop. At this point I was kicking myself for not developing my Rook.
 [ f4 ] , [ c6 ]  The knight would've been annoying on f6. This forces the knight to move and white will lose a pawn or the exchange.
 [ N x f6 + ] , [ Q x f6 ]  White accepts the trade.
 [ N c3 ] , [ B x a6 ]  This is the main tabya of the gambit. Personally I'm not a fan of gambits but someone would make a list of the most respectable and sound gambits the Benko would be pretty up on the list. Before I carry on with the rest of the game let me summarize what has Black gained for his invested material. A lead in development and more than that a better pawn structure in fact Black's only weakness is [ e7 ] which is pretty hard for White to attack. The main benefits of a better pawn structure pretty evident here. White has no useful pawn breaks pushing e4-[ e5 ] doesn't do much while pushing the Q-side pawns only creates weaknesses. Black's pawn break/advance is [ c4 ] clearing [ c5 ] for a Knight which can come to [ d3 ] or even [ b3 ] in some cases. The open files on the Q-side give Black a lot of pressure and make it difficult for White to develop his pieces his [ B c1 ] is particularly hard to find a role in the game. There is another side benefit for Benko when it comes to blitz games. The play is very smooth so you save time on moves you don't have to memorize a lot of lines in fact I know almost no theory and in spite of that have very good results with it.
 [ R f2 ]  [ R a f8 ]  [ R a f1 ] , [ R f7 f4 ]  Black is looking at the [ f2 ] Rook to attack if his bishop goes to h4. White attack is slow in coming maybe a few equal exchanges will take the sting out of it.
 [ R b d1 ] , [ B d4 ]  [ B d4 ] [ B e3 ] wins the bishop. Allowing a possible drawn position.
 [ B e3 ]  [ a4 ]  [ B c2 ]  [ N b6 ]  [ N b d2 ]  [ e5 ]  [ b4 ]  [ a x b3 ]  [ e ]  [ p ]  [ B x b3 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ Q c2 ]  [ R a6 ]  [ R e b1 ]  [ Q a8 ]  [ Q c1 ]  [ N a5 ]  [ B a2 ]  [ Q c6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c4 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ B x b6 ]  [ R x b6 ]  [ a4 ]  [ b x a4 ]  [ R x b6 ]  [ Q x b6 ]  [ N x c4 ]  [ N x c4 ]  [ B x c4 ]  [ Q c5 ]  [ Q d1 ]  [ Q x c4 ]  [ Q x d7 ]  [ Q x e4 ]  [ Q x a4 ]  [ Q d3 ]  [ c4 ]  [ e4 ]  [ R d1 ]  [ Q e2 ]  [ N h2 ]  [ B c3 ]  [ R f1 ]  [ B d4 ]  [ Q c6 ]  [ h5 ]  [ Q d5 ]  [ Q d3 ]  [ g4 ]  [ h x g4 ]  [ h x g4 ]  [ K g7 ]  [ K g2 ]  [ R h8 ]  [ Q d6 ]  [ Q h3 + ]  [ K g1 ]  [ Q d3 ]  [ K g2 ]  [ Q h3 + ]  [ K g1 ] , [ Q c3 ]  
 [ B x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ] , [ c6 ]  Two good targets in one move. He simply hopes to swap a white center pawn and to make the knight more active.
 [ Q c2 ] , [ e4 ]  Well I'll force a sacrifice and let's see how it comes!
 [ Q f4 ]  [ R e8 + ]  [ B x e8 ]  [ Q e6 + ]  [ K b7 ]  [ g3 ]  [ Q f3 ]  [ Q e3 ]  [ Q x e3 ]  [ f x e3 ]  [ R x f1 + ]  [ K x f1 ]  [ B g6 ]  [ K f2 ] , [ g4 ]  i closed him with two pawn..
 [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ c6 ]  Semi-Slav is a very solid defensive choice.
 [ c6 ]  [ e4 ] , [ b5 ]  Starting to advance his pawns quite a bit.
 [ R d2 d8 + ]  [ R x d8 ] , [ R x d8 + ]  26. [ R x d8 + ] - now a rook trade.
 [ a4 ]  [ R a c8 ]  [ B a3 ] , [ e5 ]  ? And you will see why!
 [ c x b4 ]  [ a3 ]  [ e6 ] , [ f4 ]  Sicilian defense wing gambit doesnt get the atention it deserves its maybe not the best opening in Sicilian but is best way to get your oponent out of his comfort zone.
 [ O-O ] , [ N x b5 ]  Simplifying the position. In most opening positions I prefer my bishops to my knights and so try to avoid exchanging them but in this particular opening it's not only acceptable it's preferable to exchange it.
 [ e6 ] , [ B x d5 ]  The game now becomes forced.
 [ R x f6 + ]  [ K e8 ]  [ a1 = Q ] , [ K e7 ]  Another blunder allows mate in 2.
 [ Q h4 ] , [ K h7 ]  I feel horribly exposed at this point.
 [ B x g7 ]  [ B x d2 + ]  [ N x d2 ]  [ R g8 ] , [ B d4 ]  ...blacks pieces are not devloped with is a help but i am still struggling...
 [ Q d7 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ O-O-O ] , [ O-O ]  O-O with the plan to attack against the enemy castle (a bit risky since white has his pawns advanced in this side)
 [ d3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ O-O ] , [ N g e7 ]  Developing but with [ d5 ] in mind.
 [ e4 ] , [ d5 ]  Scandinavian Defense or Center Counter
 [ f4 ]  [ B e4 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ N d x e4 ] , [ f3 ]  16. ......... [ f3 ] - hmm puts a bit of a clamp on white's kingside position but then that could be a case of Too Many Cooks Spoil The Broth as far as direct mating chances go. Ion's queen will need to take her own pawns to get through here and that is illegal!! Ion's king is looking just a little draughty but his opponent will not be able to take advantage of this.
 [ K g3 ] , [ K e6 ]  the other option is [ R d3 + ] to win a pawn with [ K f2 ] [ N x b2 ] [ R x b2 ] [ R x c3 ] but I'm not sure about the need for white to play either [ K f2 ] or [ R x b2 ]  [ R f2 ] , [ b5 ]  It serve the purpose of denying [ a4 ] to white's knight while I start pushing my pawn majority
 [ N x e5 ]  [ R e4 ] , [ K f6 ]  black is strong here. White's combination coming up guarantees that he will lose to the distant protected passer on c6.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ B c4 ] , [ d6 ]  This is a bit passive.
 [ N c6 ] , [ O-O ]  Playing [ d4 ] at some point may have been a nice choice opening up the game.
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ a6 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ e6 ]  [ f4 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ Q f3 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ O-O-O ]  [ N b d7 ] , [ B d3 ]  probably the most dangerous line to combat this tabiya.
 [ Q e7 ] , [ N f3 ]  ...but as the queen comes out I cover the front pawn with my knight. Although the pawn won't stay defended forever I can get ahead on development...
 [ Q h5 + ]  [ K g8 ] , [ b5 ]  with hindsight I realised the purpose of this was to open the a3-[ f8 ] diagonal for whites dsb
 [ O-O ]  [ b6 ] , [ Q c1 ]  Forming an important battery with the dark-squared bishop while simultaneously protecting c2.
 [ Q d2 ]  [ Q g3 ]  [ R e h1 ] , [ Q g2 ]  He offers his Queen. My understanding that if one is being attacked it's a good thing to exchange pieces.
 [ K g3 ]  [ e4 ]  [ R d2 ] , [ e3 ]  advancing the e pawn
 [ B g6 ] , [ B f3 ]  Ok the good thing is this way I will get some tempo sooner or later attacking h2. The bad part is that he will be able to press hard on the diagonal - and [ b7 ] if ever my pawn chain gets open. Which is not likely just now but wait...
 [ d6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N c6 ]  [ c3 ] , [ Q f6 ]  I can see a kingside attack coming on...
 [ N c6 + ] , [ Q x c6 ]  What else? Well [ K f1 ] allowed Q[ x R b8 + ] but black has [ Q e8 ] to shield and [ K e7 ] to follow for some more moves. Now it's too late.
 [ N f3 ]  [ Q c3 ] , [ Q b1 ]  In accordance with the plan no queen exchange and pressure on g6-[ h7 ]  [ h4 ]  [ a6 ]  [ h5 ] , [ g x h5 ]  Black underestimate white's attack. [ f5 ] hxg hxg [ N h4 ] [ R d6 ] seems more solid.
 [ R f e8 ]  [ N e5 ] , [ N c7 ]  This was a tough move. I was looking at [ N c7 ] and Qd6. Either way I'm committed to being in a defensive position until he makes a mistake or breaks it open. What finally led me to [ N c7 ] instead of [ Q [ d6 ] ] was in case he plays [ f3 ] I'm thinking that I might want to play Nd6. Though it just occurred to me now that I've made the move that if he chase my knight to [ d6 ] and then plays [ Q a4 ] (I'll play Ra8) then [ N x c6 ] to trade the knight for two pawns is uncomfortable for me.
 [ K f7 ] , [ B e5 ]  Breaking the pin.
 [ N h5 ] , [ R a c1 ]  seeing an eventual movement including [ e5 ] out...
 [ B x e6 ] , [ Q x f2 + ]  Now having managed to return my heart rate to something approaching normal I resume being offensive.
 [ g5 ] , [ f4 ]  I think this can be classed as "something exciting"! I was hoping to break open Black's kingside pawn shell then if he decided to castle there (unlikely!) I could perform a bold sortie for the king's head...!
 [ d4 ] , [ e x d4 ]  I'm not liking this. He's going to have a pawn in the center now although it will be isolated.
 [ h5 ]  [ N f2 ]  [ b5 ]  [ N b3 ]  [ N b6 ] , [ B e5 ]  I force the exchange of another set of minors.
 [ e5 ]  [ B g2 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ d3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ B g5 ] , [ B e7 ]  All solid opening play so far though back at move 3 [ N c6 ] isn't seen a lot - it seems that the other knight move [ N f3 ] was more popular with the Gameknot Database though I don't know why [also more popular was [ d5 ] which I had played next move]
 [ R h4 ] , [ R g3 ]  ...and cover again...
 [ c4 ]  [ d5 ] , [ c x d5 ]  The Exchange variation. Can be boring and therefore drawish. For more interest try 2. [ e3 ] or 2. Nf3.
 [ N x f7 ] , [ R f8 ]  it is really dangerous to allow knight play with you..
 [ B x d4 ] , [ N b5 ]  The final blunder. Black leaves the 8 rank totally undefended.
 [ B b6 ] , [ Q d6 ]  The most forcing as I give up the exchange for a pawn to render his pieces immobile for the rest of the game.
 [ B x d5 ] , [ O-O ]  At long last. Now things get interesting since we have a wide open center where it is effectively going to be a fight of 2 bishops and a rook vs a queen.
 [ K g1 ]  [ R d3 ]  [ h3 ] , [ K h7 ]  avoiding back rank tactics to free my knight
 [ R x g6 ]  [ h x g6 + ]  [ K g7 ]  [ K g5 ] , [ K g8 ]  The most basic of defensive positions. There's no way to successfully force the Pawn through.
 [ N x e1 ] , [ R f8 ]  ?! Maybe [ K g8 ] here? The rook is now somewhat impotent.
 [ Q x d3 ] , [ N b4 ]  At the same time the Rook was attacked. Similar to what I noted before black defends by counterattacking.
 [ N x e4 ]  [ f5 ]  [ N x d6 ]  [ Q x d6 ]  [ B x b4 ] , [ Q x b4 ]  I get rid of that pesky knight only to have it replaced by...His queen. I'm up but I'm extremely passive and need to move fast or he might be able to get a draw.
 [ h6 ]  [ N g4 ]  [ K h7 ]  [ Q c2 ]  [ N d e5 ]  [ N f x e5 ] , [ d x e5 ]  This pawn capture rather than a capture with either Knight or Bishop makes Black's K-side almost impregnable.
 [ Q x e5 ]  [ Q f8 ] , [ R f1 ]  The last straw . Blacks position is over!!!
 [ B c7 ]  [ N e c2 ]  [ R e4 ]  [ N b4 ]  [ R x f4 ]  [ Q b2 ]  [ h4 ] , [ N b5 ]  ???
 [ b6 ] , [ a6 ]  34. ...... [ a6 ] - Henry is boxed in on [ b8 ] but at least Bob cannot attack him via the a column.
 [ N g3 + ] , [ K h2 ]  He offered me a draw at this point?
 [ K x f5 ]  [ R f2 + ]  [ K g4 ] , [ a5 ]  Black doesn't need another queen. March the white king into the wall with the rooks: [ R g1 + ] 48. [ K h3 ] Ne4. White's moves are numbered.
 [ a5 ]  [ e5 ]  [ h5 ] , [ B h7 ]  Ops blacks king is trapped
 [ g x h5 ]  [ N x h5 ] , [ N x h5 ]  Tantamount to resignation.
 [ Q a4 ] , [ Q d7 ]  I figured I had decent position and I was welcome to the trade; however my opponent fell for the trap....
 [ K e5 ]  [ R g5 + ]  [ K e4 ]  [ Q c4 + ] , [ K e3 ]  No Kf3?
 [ a3 ]  [ Q a5 ]  [ e5 ] , [ N f x d5 ]  should take with the other N - Nbxd5. gets your N out of trouble and opens a diagonal to the K for your Q
 [ h5 ] , [ K h2 ]  31. [ h x g4 ] [ B x g4 ] 32. [ Q a2 + ] is probably better for white gaining me a Tempo at least
 [ N e1 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ f3 ]  [ f4 ]  [ N d3 ] , [ g5 ]  14. ...... [ g5 ] - and it gathers momentum.
 [ K f3 ] , [ B x g1 ]  Black is really good but I think lasting this long is pretty nice for white. The end is near now though.
 [ B x a8 ]  [ R x a8 + ]  [ K g7 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ R c1 + ]  [ K h2 ]  [ d3 ]  [ R d8 ]  [ c4 ]  [ N e3 ] , [ R c2 ]  blacks last chance white must be careful not to capture the rook because i wont be able to stop the black (c) pawn and i will lose .
 [ b5 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ b x c6 ]  [ b x c6 ]  [ B c1 ]  [ B b6 ]  [ N d e2 ]  [ g5 ]  [ f4 ]  [ e x f3 ]  [ e ]  [ p ]  [ B x f3 ]  [ N x f3 + ]  [ R x f3 ]  [ f4 ] , [ R d f1 ]  This is a blunder. I had looked at [ K g2 ] which is necessary to cover the [ [ h3 ] ] pawn. The continuations after that move are still favorable for Black so I mentally discarded it. However covering the [ [ h3 ] ] pawn is not optional. White's position is already bad and completely falls apart after Bxh3. Just goes to show that blunders although less common in correspondence chess can still happen in slow games.
 [ g6 ] , [ N c3 ]  Now is he going to play the Gruenfeld with 3....[ d5 ] or a King's Indian with [ B g7 ]  [ B g7 ] , [ e4 ]  King's Indian it is!
 [ B x f4 ] , [ h5 ]  Black ideally wants to play [ R x c3 ] and try and get some counterplay in. However he can't do that quite yet because 25. [ B x f4 ] [ R x c3 ] gets met with 26. [ R e8 ] checkmate. Therefore he plays [ h5 ] first to create a flight square. Well spotted.
 [ f1 = Q ] , [ R x f1 ]  forced
 [ N c6 ] , [ Q x c5 ]  The free Pawn is tempting but White's development is already starting to lag.
 [ N c5 ] , [ N a4 ]  Another sack to clear out black material
 [ f x e6 ]  [ Q x e6 + ]  [ K d8 ] , [ R e1 ]  now we see how not organized are black pieces.
 [ d x c5 ]  [ B x c5 ] , [ e3 ]  Good play - and the kind of move that I am usually hesitant to play. White restricts his DSB but immediately answers the question of [ f2 ] defense. White will now most likely play his DSB to its long diagonal.
 [ e4 ]  [ f x e4 ]  [ f x e4 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ B x c4 ] , [ b x c4 ]  32. …… [ b x c4 ] - bishop trade. This messes up my queenside pawns but white's are also very pickable. Big breakfast for Henry!
 [ N b d2 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N b3 ]  [ Q f6 ]  [ N h2 ]  [ h5 ]  [ f3 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ Q e2 ]  [ O-O-O ]  [ N d2 ]  [ R d e8 ]  [ Q b5 ]  [ Q g5 ]  [ K f2 ] , [ e x d4 ]  Now what do we have here?! The dreaded tripled pawn!
 [ d5 ] , [ N b4 ]  I was expecting 5. ... [ N a5 ] followed by 6. ... b6.
 [ B d6 ]  [ b4 ]  [ O-O ] , [ c5 ]  It's at the cost of tempo which to me is well worth it since my monarch is safe. I considered exchanging but figured that my pawns were useful. So I decided to go back [ e7 ] but this is was a bad as 10...Be7?! is going to lose several tempii with the attacks that are coming.
 [ Q x d7 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ O-O-O ]  I felt safer castling queen side in this situation due to the threat of the bishop opening up my defense on the king side had I castled the opp side
 [ B c4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ] , [ Q x d4 ]  ...white is distinctly ahead in development...and my structure is going to get a bit loose....
 [ K d3 ] , [ e4 + ]  59........ [ e4 + ] - King Chris is driven back.
 [ h x g5 ]  [ f3 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ R x e8 + ] , [ R x e8 ]  And my opponent forces a rook exchange. I thought I was done for. However then my opponent erred himself. Complacent in probable victory? Perhaps.
 [ B x e5 ] , [ N b5 ]  black advances his knights which are bound to be powerful together in the a to c files and at the same time reveals an attack on the white knight.
 [ a6 ] , [ B g5 ]  6. [ B g5 ] - white brings his pieces out rapidly.
 [ B c1 ] , [ f5 ]  Kramnik continued to attack
 [ N x d4 ] , [ N x d4 ]  Black decides to exchange knights and a pawn. This position generally gives an advantage to white in development.
 [ K f7 ]  [ f3 ] , [ N c2 ]  Black wins a pawn here. Maybe white could have considered r[ d5 ] and after 35 [ g6 ] maybe 35... r[ b5 ] attacking the weak pawn on [ b6 ]  [ R d2 ]  [ N x e3 ]  [ f x e4 ] , [ f x e4 ]  This crates a rather dangerous past pawn for black
 [ B g5 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ h6 ]  why not d5? where would the bishop go to?
 [ d5 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ N f6 ]  We mirrored each others moves at the start with [ d4 ] and [ d5 ] and then I moved [ N f3 ] and black went with Nf6.
 [ a x b7 ]  [ B x b7 ] , [ Q h5 ]  Claiming the open h-file for myself while I try and figure out some way to defend my king.
 [ K h7 ]  [ N x f8 + ]  [ K g8 ] , [ N g6 ]  This is a mistake but I am not sure what was better
 [ b x c3 ]  [ B x c3 + ] , [ N d2 ]  I do not want to block the exit way of my bishop with Kf2. Unfortunately the knight becomes a liability in its current position as you will see later.
 [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ a6 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d5 ] , [ e x d5 ]  ??In this position the idea was to exchange right away which is why I played this. The idea being is that my OTB coach recently emphasized that it's generally a good idea to exchange early when you're up against a much stronger player. Especially players like andywm. And there's a little bit of theory behind it as well. The reason for this is that the really strong players know how to organize their pieces and get an advantage. By exchanging you get rid of that obstacle. However this is a time and place to do so. According to the post game analysis this is an inaccuracy. And best was 8.Nbd2. The reason is that black would 8...[ N c6 ] Note everything is safe. The idea being is that the e pawn would remain right on the e file prevent black from attacking my N and B. Afterwards we'd wind up with something like 9.0-0 [ B e7 ] 10.[ e x d5 ] [ N x d5 ] 11.[ N c4 ] [ N x e3 ] 12.[ f x e3 ] [ B g4 ] 13.[ B e4 ] [ f6 ] 14.[ B x c6 + ] [ b x c6 ] 15.[ Q e2 ] And I like the way that position looks as it would result in a good and close game between Andy and I with material even rather then 2 points down. Having said that I disagree that this is just an inaccuracy when it comes to this move. Looks good but what looks good might be bad. And this is a perfect example. As it turns what I played here is a blunder because it loses a piece for a pawn after he forks my N and LSB with 8...[ e4 ]  [ e4 ] , [ B c4 ]  ?! The idea behind this is that I'm going to lose a piece for a pawn. And here I have to decide what that piece is going to be. Given that it appears to be an open position I decided to let him have my N as opposed to the B. So there is a strategy behind. According to the post computer analysis however this is an inaccuracy. Best was 9.[ B x e4 ] with the idea of 9...[ N x e4 ] 10.0-0 [ B f5 ] 11.[ Q d4 ] [ B e7 ] 12.[ Q e5 ] [ B g6 ] 13.[ N b d2 ] [ N x d2 ] 14.[ B x d2 ] [ f6 ] 15.[ Q e2 ] [ B x c2 ] This time I agree that it's just an inaccuracy but not for all of the reasons that the computer outlines except for the beginning as it mentions 10.0-0 From my POV after 9...[ e x f3 ] it will no longer be safe to castle K side. And even with best play now K exposure is something to worry about. So already black has a noticeable advantage.
 [ h6 ] , [ B x f6 ]  Slightly better than 6. cxd5.
 [ N x f3 + ]  [ g x f3 ]  [ Q x f3 ]  [ Q x f3 ]  [ R x f3 ] , [ B g2 ]  Headed to d5.
 [ Q d2 ]  [ e4 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ Q g6 ]  [ B c2 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N e2 ] , [ R f2 ]  Threatening Mate.
 [ N f3 ]  [ b5 ] , [ O-O ]  6. 0-0 - I decided to keep in the habit of getting Henry to safety even though my opponent is not the Master Mater!
 [ N b d7 ] , [ Q e2 ]  I was expecting 11.[ B e3 ] after which 11...[ [ c5 ] ] gives black a comfortable position. I've played that position dozens of time in OTB tournaments but that was probably before my opponent was born ;) 11.[ Q e2 ] throws a wrench into black's plans as now 11...[ [ c5 ] ] fails miserably to 12.e5! and if black is lucky he'll only lose the [ b7 ] pawn.
 [ B x e4 ]  [ N x e4 ] , [ Q e6 ]  My only very tiny hope....
 [ N h6 + ] , [ K g7 ]  Settling for a perpetual draw.
 [ B x d7 ] , [ Q x d7 ]  as planned...
 [ d x c4 ]  [ R x c4 ] , [ Q d2 ]  More Q-side dark square pressure almost forcing simplification into a superior endgame for black with his extra N.
 [ K e3 ]  [ N x b3 ]  [ K d3 ] , [ K d6 ]  Finally realizing he lost. The white resigns!
 [ f4 ]  [ R c5 ] , [ R f3 ]  White needs to get rid of that powerful knight and this appears to be the only way.
 [ N f3 ] , [ R d7 ]  My idea black doesn't have anyway to defend the [ g7 ] square without losing at least a piece.
 [ B d3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B b7 ]  [ c x b6 ] , [ c x b6 ]  There we go an open file at last
 [ c6 ]  [ B a4 ]  [ b5 ]  [ B b3 ]  [ B e6 ] , [ N c3 ]  Here I am partial to B[ x B e6 ] which doubles black's pawns. Not that that is a big thing but it makes [ N g5 ] nice.
 [ Q f6 ] , [ R a e1 ]  doubling the rooks is especially attractive with Black's N still on [ b8 ]  [ B b3 ] , [ a5 ]  and again but these moves help me to reconfigure my attack on [ h7 ]  [ Q d6 ]  [ R e1 e3 ]  [ a4 ]  [ B c2 ]  [ f6 ] , [ Q d3 ]  Now if Black took on [ e5 ] I planned to prosecute my attack regardless: 24... fx[ e5 ] 25. [ Q h7 ] [ K f7 ] 26. [ Q x g7 ] [ K e8 ] 27. Rx[ e5 ] but I'm not sure what happens after 27... [ K d8 ]  [ f5 ] , [ R g3 ]  I have to work around Black's f-pawn now. The immediate threat is 26. [ R x g7 ]  [ R f7 ] , [ N f4 ]  now I'm threatening 27. [ R g6 ]  [ B x e8 ]  [ Q x e8 + ]  [ R f8 ] , [ N g6 + ]  I decide to keep Qs on in pursuit of the win
 [ B e3 ] , [ Q h4 + ]  unfortunately the LSB will not be coming to the aid of his king because he is being held prisoner by the dragon's tail.
 [ R e6 ]  [ Q h4 + ]  [ K g7 ]  [ Q g5 ] , [ R d7 ]  Much better was attacking with [ R c2 + ]  [ N f5 + ] , [ K g8 ]  Not [ K f8 ] or [ K h8 ] as these both lead to mate in 2
 [ N e5 ]  [ Q c8 ] , [ B f7 + ]  Finally I launched the attack.
 [ N d b5 ] , [ O-O-O ]  I do not fall for the same trap.
 [ N f3 ] , [ B b4 ]  7. ...[ B b4 ] !? moving bishop twice but pinning the knight for [ e4 ] pawn.
 [ B d7 ] , [ B x d7 + ]  White move achieves one of most important goals for black in the french: to exchange the white squared bishop. [ B e2 ] was better.
 [ K d7 ]  [ d5 ]  [ R b b6 ]  [ R c5 ]  [ c6 ]  [ K e2 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ R b x b5 ]  [ d4 ]  [ R x b6 ]  [ d3 + ]  [ K d2 ]  [ R x b6 ]  [ K x d3 ]  [ R b3 + ]  [ R c3 ]  [ R b6 ]  [ B f3 ]  [ g5 ]  [ B d1 ]  [ R a6 ]  [ R c4 ]  [ K d6 ]  [ R x a4 ]  [ R b6 ]  [ R b4 ]  [ R a6 ]  [ a4 ]  [ K c5 ]  [ R b5 + ]  [ K c6 ]  [ B f3 + ]  [ K d6 ]  [ a5 ] , [ K c7 ]  Going fairly routinely.
 [ N c3 ] , [ d5 ]  So on your 2nd move I was wrong. Your playing the Grunfeld Defense. According to MCO the vast majority of lines in this defense give White at least a slight advantage. Some lines give Black equality and a rare few give Black a slight advantage. I found this very encouraging because I know that a very slight advantage if played accurately becomes a great advantage which in turn if worked correctly becomes a won game.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ a3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ d3 ]  [ B c5 ] , [ h3 ]  White is ignoring the development of his pieces which triggers black to play aggressively
 [ B x f6 ]  [ B x f6 ] , [ Q g4 ]  This is why I wanted Black's knight gone.
 [ b4 ]  [ d x e5 ] , [ B x f7 ]  Not [ d x e5 ] because 38...Ng5+!! is an obvious fork but also initiates a discovered attack on my Q if I reply with the natural fxg5. Also watch that his h-pawn is doing absolutely nothing.
 [ N x e6 ]  [ f x e6 ] , [ e4 ]  ! My first instinct was that this was an inaccuracy. I calculated 13...[ N x e4 ] 14 [ B x e7 ] [ Q x e7 ] 15. [ N x e4 ] [ d x e4 ] 16. [ B x e4 ] [ R a d8 ] gave me a small edge. However white had a better idea....
 [ B e3 ] , [ B h4 ]  Taking advantage of the nailed down knight!
 [ O-O ] , [ B d2 ]  A passive move. [ N f3 ] or [ e4 ] would have been improvements.
 [ d5 ]  [ e5 ]  [ d x c4 ]  [ R e d1 ]  [ N g4 ] , [ R d4 d7 + ]  White want to exchange one rook may be it gives some relief.
 [ h3 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ O-O ] , [ g4 ]  Here I go with a "normal" London attack.
 [ K g6 ]  [ R a5 ]  [ R g4 + ]  [ K a3 ]  [ R x h4 ]  [ R g1 + ]  [ K f6 ]  [ R f1 + ]  [ K e7 ]  [ R a6 ]  [ R h3 ]  [ R e1 + ]  [ K f8 ]  [ R f6 ]  [ K g7 ]  [ R f4 ]  [ K g6 ]  [ R g1 + ]  [ K h5 ]  [ R f5 + ]  [ K h6 ]  [ R f6 + ]  [ K h7 ]  [ R f4 ]  [ R h6 ]  [ R f g4 ]  [ R g6 ]  [ R h4 + ]  [ K g7 ]  [ R f1 ]  [ f6 ]  [ R f h1 ]  [ f5 ]  [ R x a4 ]  [ B x a4 ]  [ K x a4 ]  [ f4 ]  [ K b4 ]  [ K f6 ]  [ K c4 ]  [ K e5 ]  [ R e1 + ]  [ K f5 ]  [ K d4 ]  [ R d6 + ]  [ K c5 ]  [ R d2 ]  [ K c4 ]  [ f3 ]  [ K c3 ]  [ R d8 ]  [ R e7 ]  [ K f4 ]  [ R f7 + ]  [ K e3 ]  [ R e7 + ]  [ K f2 ]  [ R f7 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ K d3 ]  [ R e3 + ]  [ K d2 ]  [ R e2 + ]  [ K d1 ]  [ R e3 ]  [ K d2 ]  [ R a3 ]  [ K d1 ]  [ K f1 ]  [ R f8 ]  [ f2 ]  [ R f7 ]  [ R a2 ]  [ R f8 ]  [ K g2 ]  [ R g8 + ]  [ K f3 ]  [ R f8 + ]  [ K e3 ]  [ R e8 + ]  [ K d3 ]  [ R d8 + ]  [ K e3 ]  [ R e8 + ]  [ K f3 ]  [ R f8 + ]  [ K g2 ]  [ R g8 + ]  [ K f1 ]  [ R g7 ]  [ R e2 ]  [ R g6 ]  [ R e8 ] , [ R f6 ]  the final mistake in a game riddled with them!! what a game!!
 [ h3 ] , [ N h6 ]  thats better
 [ N d7 ] , [ B g5 ]  Get the B out of the firing line.
 [ K h2 ] , [ R g f8 ]  Threatens my bishop and also increases the pressure on the f-file !
 [ R d8 ] , [ R d1 ]  !?
 [ b5 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ e6 ]  Again I am not keen on this move as it renders blacks lsb pretty useless.
 [ O-O ] , [ Q x b7 ]  here we open blacks pawn structure so they can't support themselves but require assistance from a minor piece(s) for protection.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ e x d4 ] , [ B c4 ]  Scottish Gambit! My specialty! My opponent took an extremely long time for the next move. After the match he admitted that he was very unfamiliar with this opening. He countered fairly effectively though relying on instinct.
 [ R x d1 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ N x e5 ] , [ B x a2 ]  Now a 3 to 0 advantage on the queenside with three supported adjacent passed pawns. There is absolutely no way for black to fail to promote one ore more of these lucky pawns right?
 [ a4 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ B e2 ] , [ B f5 ]  8. ......... [ B f5 ] - I trusted the World DB and Freddy exposed this as a weak time wasting move. Freddy moved his knight to [ h4 ] and I had to either back up or move the bishop. I chose to move Fou Leblanc to d7. In retrospect would [ Q c1 ] have been a better choice. Jury please advise.
 [ B c3 ] , [ B e7 ]  the plan was to get to [ f6 ] with my bishop
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ N c3 ]  Not just holding the pawn but trying to activate my own pieces
 [ f x g3 ]  [ e ]  [ p ]  [ R f3 x f5 ]  [ R x f5 ] , [ R x f5 ]  Black loses a rook and the pawn in [ g3 ] is not enough to balance.
 [ K e6 ] , [ Q g4 + ]  Brings the Q into the attack .
 [ K c6 ]  [ K f2 ] , [ f5 ]  Controls [ e4 ] and g4. Trying to force a zugzwang which for those that don't know is a position in which you would rather pass than make a move.
 [ K h1 ]  [ R f3 ]  [ Q h5 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ Q g5 ]  A naive-looking attempt which proves surprisingly difficult to stop.
 [ R e c8 ]  [ N x a8 ]  [ B x a8 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ R c7 ]  [ R f d1 ]  [ h6 ]  [ N d4 ] , [ R c3 ]  try to enter......
 [ N e6 ]  [ h6 ] , [ B g6 ]  Computer analysis Mistake: +0.90 » 43. [ B g6 ] [ e3 + ] 44. [ K g3 ] [ R f1 ] 45. [ B d3 ] [ B b3 ] 46. [ N c5 ] [ R d1 ] 47. [ N x b3 ] [ e2 ] 48. [ R x f8 + ] [ K x f8 ] 49. Bx[ e2 ] [ R d5 ] 50. [ B f3 ] [ R g5 + ] 51. [ K f4 ] [ a4 ] 52. [ N d4 ] [ R a5 ] 53. [ B e4 ] Best: +3.21 » 43. [ R x f8 + ] [ K h7 ] 44. [ R f7 ] [ R c2 + ] 45. [ K e3 ] [ R x g2 ] 46. [ B g4 ] [ K g6 ] 47. [ R f5 ] [ K h7 ] 48. [ R x a5 ] [ B c2 ] 49. [ B f5 + ] [ K g8 ] 50. [ B x e4 ] [ B x e4 ] 51. [ K x e4 ] [ R e2 + ] 52. [ K f5 ] White misses the weaknesses in his attack in his eagerness to press towards the prize...
 [ O-O ] , [ N e2 ]  I assumed this was aimed at an early [ f4 ] but that never came. It could also have helped an advance to [ d4 ] leaving the B protecting [ e4 ] but that didn't come either so I'm not sure what the purpose of this rather than 6. [ N f3 ] was.
 [ g6 ] , [ N c3 ]  Getting saddled up and preparing an attack say with 11. [ Q g3 ] and even [ B h6 ]  [ Q g3 ] , [ B b4 ]  Probably 12...[ R f7 ] is better. White can build up a dangerous attack with an inventive sacrifice
 [ Q b4 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ Q c4 ]  [ N a5 ] , [ Q d3 ]  This is where I get sneaky with a beautifully crafted move (for me).
 [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ] , [ B b5 + ]  The only anti-Sicilian I consider worth playing. Ivanchuck used this line to end a non-losing streak of Kasparov's. The point of this move is to delay the central break and either exchange a pair of Bishops or force Black to develop his pieces on slightly awkward squares.
 [ R x g2 ] , [ h3 ]  After he took my h pawn was hanging so I have to protect it. As it turns out this is the only way to do that.
 [ N f3 ]  [ h x g3 ] , [ f x g3 ]  only recapture
 [ R b1 ]  [ R d2 + ]  [ K c8 ] , [ R d7 ]  White turns up the pressure.
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ a6 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ e6 ] , [ f4 ]  [A well-known position in the Najdorf. Stockfish team opts for the most common continuation.]
 [ K e6 ] , [ B h6 + ]  White missed a potentially winning tactic: 34. [ B a7 ] [ N e5 ] 35. [ f4 ] winning the knight.
 [ B g5 ] , [ B e6 ]  I could have had this move for something more useful. :-) I mean Bishops can move more than one square at a time.
 [ g4 ]  [ N g3 ]  [ R h2 ] , [ B e5 ]  This move is another strange one to look at. It has a few interesting lines though. The main sequence I looked at was [ f4 ] [ B x c3 ] [ b x c3 ] ([ Q x c3 ] [ N x e2 ] [ R x e2 ] Bxg4) [ N x e2 ] [ Q x e2 ] where white does have the doubled pawn weakness but this wont be significant because of the dark square weaknesses in Black's kingside and fact that White's queenside is much more developed.
 [ B x c1 ]  [ R x a6 ] , [ R d1 + ]  Just to win a tempo for doubling rooks.
 [ K f3 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ K e4 ]  [ K g7 ]  [ f5 ]  [ K f6 ]  [ R c7 ]  [ g x f5 + ]  [ g x f5 ]  [ B b4 ]  [ h4 ]  [ h5 ]  [ R c6 + ]  [ K g7 ]  [ R c2 ]  [ f6 ]  [ R g2 + ]  [ K f7 ]  [ R g3 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ R g6 ]  [ B e5 ]  [ R h6 ] , [ K g7 ]  I realized now I couldn't take the h pawn since my rook will become trapped.
 [ K f8 ]  [ B d7 ] , [ B d4 ]  Silly Silly Silly move.
 [ f3 ] , [ R d2 ]  Black rook attacks the 2nd line...
 [ K e5 ]  [ K c6 ]  [ K e6 ]  [ K b7 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ B f1 ]  [ K d6 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ B b6 ] , [ K a6 ]  Until now. Even I can see finally I have no chance of winning this.
 [ N f3 ] , [ Q x d1 # ]  so there was please comment on all moves i though i did well but my oponent got to tangled in his position....
 [ N f6 ] , [ e5 ]  2. [ e5 ] - standard pawn stab.
 [ K d8 ]  [ Q a5 + ] , [ K c8 ]  Now not [ Q c5 + ] (Qc6!) but use the tempo to bring the reinforces...
 [ N x d6 ]  [ N c3 + ]  [ K a1 ] , [ R f8 ]  31. [ R f1 ] and it is basically over for Black. 31...[ R g8 ] 32. [ R d e1 ] +-
 [ B x d4 ] , [ Q x d4 ]  And now the queen takes up the defense of [ b2 ] and adds pressure against the knight on [ c4 ] which now must be protected further or moved.
 [ R x f5 ]  [ f4 ] , [ h5 ]  ....and here is one of three mistakes that should have cost Black the game. Here 51...[ R d5 ] halts White's attack enough so that Black can organise himself to get better chances.
 [ K g2 ]  [ R x h1 ] , [ K x h1 ]  ...and all my "fantastic" idea lent me into a -5 position fighting two minor pieces with a R. I should lose right? My only potential soldier is the pawn g7. It's my hero. As long as it stays where it is...
 [ R x d4 ] , [ R b d1 ]  However now the rook has no way out except [ R h4 ] which is totally harmless.
 [ Q g3 ]  [ R e h8 + ]  [ K g1 ] , [ Q h5 ]  [ Q h1 # ] White has 1 normal move to get out of it.
 [ R x c5 ] , [ h6 ]  I I know that [ R x d4 ] will follow but I want a cage around his king because I am setting a mate net. Unfortunately white didn't see it and fall into a one-into-a-million chances I had to save this game.
 [ N h6 ]  [ Q d1 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N d f3 ] , [ N c6 ]  ...Nc6?? loses the piece but Black gains some compensation
 [ N a7 ] , [ R a8 ]  In case you're wondering Erika this is a skewer which is the opposite of a pin. As now he's forced to pull back his N which enables to get yet another pawn.
 [ N c3 ] , [ B g4 ]  Bg4? I think the Bishop could have been better used in breaking the pin rather than being traded away.
 [ O-O ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B a3 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ R a b1 ]  [ b6 ] , [ R f e1 ]  Let me be honest here: I had completely run out of ideas. I fell into a vicious circle of simply playing solid "waiting" moves and hoping my opponent would do something exciting.
 [ B d2 ] , [ R a b8 ]  Also playable was 18...[ B f5 ] to bring the central light squares even more under Black's control. Black figures that the e-file can wait...
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ b3 ]  [ e5 ] , [ B b2 ]  Some sort of Danish opening.
 [ N e2 ]  [ Q x e4 ]  [ Q x e4 ] , [ d x e4 ]  Material regained! and now i can attack the knight.
 [ N f6 ]  [ B g5 ] , [ N b d7 ]  Black protects his knight on [ f6 ] . A knight - bishop exchange would have meant a double up of Black's pawns on the king side I guess black did not want that.
 [ B x e5 ]  [ Q d2 ] , [ Q d7 ]  Wanting [ Q x d7 ] [ N x d7 ] and then the knight is unprotected.
 [ N x e5 ] , [ N c6 ]  ?! The Fraser Variation hoping somewhat naively for 4.[ N x c6 ] [ d x c6 ] with great potential for Black.
 [ N b3 ]  [ Q f6 ] , [ N b d2 ]  Hmmm... I suppose he did that since I could chop on [ e3 ] with the Queen.
 [ B c5 ]  [ f4 ]  [ d6 ] , [ f5 ]  looks like we are playing: "the first who takes loses"
 [ g x h5 ] , [ O-O-O ]  Enough? I don't know really I like to play in an "attack or die" fashion when no serious prize is on the table.
 [ Q f1 + ]  [ K h2 ]  [ N f4 ]  [ B x e5 ]  [ N x d5 ] , [ e x d5 ]  In the confusion I overlook that Black can win the Exchange. Now material is even but my passed QP gives me an advantage.
 [ c6 ]  [ d4 ] , [ Q e7 ]  ? What's that for? To protect the pawn on e5? Why not Nd7?
 [ h5 ] , [ h3 ]  Giving my bishop an escape square.
 [ K h1 ] , [ K e7 ]  Making sure the rook isn't hanging and vaguely hopeful I might be able to double up on the h or c files. Also getting my king off the white squares felt important.
 [ K a5 ]  [ R c6 ]  [ g3 ]  [ K e5 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ K d4 ]  [ R d1 + ]  [ K e3 ]  [ R f1 ]  [ K e2 ]  [ R f8 ] , [ e3 ]  Computer assesses this position as plus 5.15 for black and I have to agree. Anyway I resigned here.
 [ B b7 ]  [ N f6 + ]  [ g x f6 ]  [ R x d7 ] , [ N x d7 ]  The exchanges are performed and I see now that White's gains are not limited to a single point of material. Granted Black's bishops are very powerful on their diagonals but Black's kingside is cracked open and since White retains his queen he will hold an advantage if he goes for a kingside attack. Black's minor pieces are also far from the kingside's defence. However of course if Black mobilises his defensive pieces quickly he will stand a good change of weathering the onslaught.
 [ d4 ] , [ c x d4 ]  White expands his center. A defense of the [ c5 ] pawn could could have been considered with [ b6 ] but the exchange takes a wing pawn for a center pawn.
 [ B b8 ]  [ K f2 ]  [ g4 ] , [ N h4 ]  Slipping out of the way of the Pawn.
 [ c x d4 ] , [ N x d4 ]  4. [ Q x d4 ] [ N f6 ] 5.[ N c3 ] is the critical line according to Casten and Heine Neilson's book on the Accelerated Dragon.
 [ K g2 ]  [ Q e4 + ]  [ K f2 ] , [ Q d4 + ]  I have accepted that I will have to remove the immediate threat to make any progress.
 [ N c3 ]  [ O-O ] , [ N f3 ]  Continuing with development.
 [ g x h3 ] , [ c4 ]  Pushing another pawn.
 [ O-O ] , [ N c3 ]  Finally
 [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ a6 ]  the Najdorf tends to become my favorite as white or black though I never play [ [ e4 ] ] as white as I am afraid of 1 [ [ e4 ] ] [ e5 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ N b d7 ]  [ B c4 ] , [ e6 ]  black very defensive condemned to crunchy position.
 [ K h3 ] , [ N e5 ]  ...and as the Pawn will fall White resigns.
 [ K d2 ]  [ K e6 ] , [ g4 ]  Keeping his king away from my king side pawns they have a good position.
 [ R g3 ] , [ Q h5 ]  here it is the f pawn is lost for white
 [ N x c6 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ d x e5 ] , [ Q x e5 ]  Black regains his pawn and is not looking terrible at the moment but not great either.
 [ f5 ]  [ R b8 ]  [ f x g6 ]  [ f x g6 ]  [ Q c1 ]  [ Q a5 ]  [ R x f8 + ] , [ R x f8 ]  forced if the king??????? than rxb8+!
 [ B x e7 ]  [ Q x e7 ] , [ B f3 ]  I'm not exactly sure why she played this but my guess is to keep a better connection of her Rook. Had Sue played [ R e1 ] right away the center would be blocked by her Bishop which I believe is an interference by definition. By doing this they're better communicated. The problem here however is that it'll leave her with doubled pawns near the K. Now that we're in the midgame as per what tactical-abyss has outlined in similar games we don't want that.
 [ e6 ] , [ g4 ]  The start of White's exploitation of the exposed position of Black's Bishop. White gains tempi to establish a formidable territory on the kingside.
 [ N g f3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ d x c5 ] , [ B x c5 ]  6. The exchange develops blacks bishop to a good square attacking [ f2 ]  [ B b5 + ]  [ N c6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ N b3 ] , [ B b6 ]  9 Black prefers to retreat on the same diagonal attacking [ f2 ]  [ B g5 ] , [ a6 ]  10 I think white would be better off here to exchange But he retreats to [ d3 ] wasting yime
 [ K f2 ]  [ B h4 + ]  [ K g2 ]  [ K d6 ]  [ N g3 ]  [ B x g3 ]  [ B x c4 ]  [ d x c4 ]  [ K x g3 ]  [ K d5 ]  [ R a7 ]  [ c3 ]  [ R c7 ] , [ K d4 ]  The game was adjourned and Botvinnik saw no way to save it so he chose to resign.
 [ B c2 ] , [ N c4 ]  Avoiding the indian's ambushes on the way
 [ N c6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ e6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ B d6 ] , [ d x c5 ]  I don't remember making that trade before but I want to put the knight on [ e5 ] without him trading the bishop for it and giving me doubled pawns. I want to see if I can take advantage of my pin before he castles.
 [ Q b8 ] , [ N f7 + ]  To avoid immediately losing the game Black must sacrifice the exchange on this move but I think he prefers to see the denouement :-)
 [ c6 ]  [ N b x d4 ]  [ e x d4 ] , [ Q x d4 ]  I took with the queen rather than the knight in order to attack the [ f6 ] pawn.
 [ e6 ]  [ B e4 ]  [ O-O-O ]  [ O-O ] , [ R d7 ]  This lets black move the queen off the second rank without losing the f pawn. But really this was a wasted move. White's d pawn is vulnerable.
 [ Q b6 ]  [ d x c5 ]  [ B x c5 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ O-O-O ]  [ B x f2 ]  [ N a4 ]  [ Q b4 ]  [ Q x f2 ]  [ Q x a4 ]  [ a3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ Q g3 ]  [ f5 ]  [ e x f6 ]  [ e ]  [ p ]  [ N x f6 ] , [ B d3 ]  The position is known to theory - although White's 12th move [12.a3] is not his only option and is not necessarily best.
 [ K f7 ]  [ B x f4 ] , [ Q c5 + ]  44. .... [ Q c5 + ] I anticipated this spite check but ascertained that Henry is safe from checks at least for one move on f1.
 [ d5 ]  [ d4 ] , [ e5 ]  I offer pawn as sacrafice for development in a dutch-ish gambit opening
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ h3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ a3 ] , [ B d6 ]  With the dark square bishop off its home square my king is ready to castle.
 [ c6 ]  [ b x c6 ]  [ R h d1 ]  [ N c5 + ]  [ K c2 ]  [ f6 ]  [ N f1 ]  [ N e6 ]  [ B g3 ]  [ R e d8 ]  [ B f2 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N d2 ]  [ c4 ]  [ b x c4 ] , [ N c5 ]  attacking [ a4 ]  [ e4 ]  [ d4 ]  [ N b1 ]  [ d3 + ]  [ K b2 ] , [ d2 ]  White resigns
 [ f6 ]  [ d x e5 ] , [ N x e5 ]  Holding like a hero. I know I could play this because the [ B f3 ] blocks the f pawn. The other option [ f x e5 ] leaves a bad hole on [ g5 ] white can exploit. It comes that the best move is [ B x e5 ] I realize now.
 [ B x b5 ] , [ R b8 ]  Skewering my bishop to b2.
 [ N x c6 ]  [ b x c6 ] , [ Q x c6 ]  white has taken over the board!
 [ b x a5 ]  [ b x a5 ]  [ K e3 ]  [ K c5 ]  [ K d3 ]  [ a4 ]  [ K c3 ] , [ h5 ]  Black's advance is a little awkward but it doesn't much matter how he advances. White's concern is the a-pawn and by the time he gets rid of it black's kingside pawns will be so far advanced that he won't be able to recover.
 [ B b3 ] , [ N g8 ]  White's LB moves to [ b3 ] and black moves knight to [ g8 ] to provide protection to [ h6 ] square.
 [ O-O-O ] , [ N f7 ]  16. [ N f7 ] [expected] forks both Rooks. .....
 [ R c6 ] , [ Q e7 + ]  The best move because it prevents the king from escaping at [ b7 ] to [ a6 ] and with this move a concept begins to form in my thoughts in which I attempt to trade off all major pieces to an endgame having 3 pawns vs the bishop. This idea will require some work but that is the plan.
 [ N e4 ]  [ N d4 ] , [ R f2 ]  25 [ N x f6 ] was not allowed because of 25...[ N x f3 ] 26. [ R x f3 ] ([ K h1 ] Rh2#) [ N x f3 ]  [ N e x f3 + ]  [ K g2 ] , [ R b3 ]  In hindsight I don't really like this move. I considered I might be able to block the white's pawns with my knights so I wanted to create three connected passed pawns to force the issue. However as we will see later white's rook becomes an important tool to cut off my king from the king side. Therefore 26...[ R x f2 ] 27.[ K x f2 ] [ f5 ] followed with rushing my king to the king side to catch white's passed pawn was likely better.
 [ Q d7 ] , [ R e1 ]  A bit of a stall move but protecting the knight and hoping to win the [ e4 ] pawn after Bxc6.
 [ R x b7 ] , [ B g2 ]  Forcing the Black rook to [ c7 ] square with two Knights and nearby enemy Major pieces White is eyeing a fork by these two knights.
 [ c6 ] , [ N c3 ]  Better developing the knight. A knight gains strength every rank it advances generally till the 7th rank.
 [ e6 ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B f4 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ R e1 ] , [ h6 ]  This gives White a strong advantage because [ h6 ] is a target.
 [ h4 ] , [ c5 ]  The Pawn marches towards the eighth rank.
 [ Q d5 + ]  [ Q x d5 + ]  [ B x d5 + ]  [ K f8 ]  [ B x c4 ]  [ B x b4 ]  [ K g2 ] , [ K e7 ]  Another great fighting draw. Black cannot make progress despite the extra pawn on [ a7 ] owing to opposite-colored bishops.
 [ K c2 ]  [ R a8 ]  [ B b5 ] , [ R x a3 ]  +4
 [ N x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ B x d4 ]  [ B x d4 ] , [ Q x d4 ]  so at the end I have centralised queen very powerfull knight and king ready to castle with open f file.black need to defend the a rook and has a lot of weak undefended squares...not bad uh?
 [ b x a5 ]  [ R x a5 ] , [ b6 ]  Black tries to prevent white to win the pawn after 24.[ B x g5 ] [ f x g5 ] 25. [ R x g5 ] but loosing this pawn would be the least evil for black.
 [ Q x f6 ] , [ N e5 ]  Not a bad move in itself. But it does set up a trade and when you are down a piece you don't want trades if you can avoid them.
 [ d x e5 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ O-O ] , [ B b7 ]  maybe better for black is 10....BxN 11.PxB ....this trade puts white further down while creating doubled pawns on the c-file.
 [ N c6 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ h6 ]  Black does same move to protect threat of [ B g5 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ h3 ]  Ultimately I prefer the Bishops to always have some pressure on Black pawn at [ c7 ] in case they castle. Same goes for White bishop currently at f1. Although looks like Black is more likely to O-O
 [ R e8 ]  [ Q c4 ] , [ Q e7 ]  25. ..... [ Q e7 ] - declines queen swap and keeps an eye on my back row. Must make some luft for Henry soon.
 [ Q x f6 ]  [ N g4 ]  [ Q g7 ]  [ N e3 ]  [ Q f6 ]  [ N g4 ]  [ Q g7 ] , [ N e3 ]  Kingside pressure is far bigger for black now so I play for repetition.
 [ h4 ] , [ Q e6 ]  Threats of [ Q e4 ] forcing a trade of queens.
 [ B a5 ] , [ e5 ]  5th rank and the great wall is complete
 [ B x a4 + ]  [ K f8 ]  [ B c2 ]  [ K g7 ] , [ R f6 f3 ]  This is a mistake. [ R b6 ] was best.
 [ e x d5 ]  [ Q x c8 + ]  [ K e7 ] , [ Q c7 + ]  ?! The computer says that after [ B d2 ] white has a winning attack. I missed the move order and went on to an inferior position
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ] , [ c4 ]  Gambit of the queen...
 [ R x e7 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ R f5 ] , [ R e1 ]  At this point white would just like a pawn battle.
 [ Q x a1 + ]  [ B x a1 ] , [ d5 ]  The bishops still exercise dangerous pressure but there seems to be no easy way for black to get rid of them.
 [ f6 ] , [ N e f3 ]  finally kicked the knight away
 [ R x c2 ] , [ B x e5 + ]  This check forced her to exchange her bishop and I got a free pawn after that.
 [ O-O ]  [ e6 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ N x c6 ]  [ b x c6 ]  [ e5 ] , [ N d5 ]  Black can get away with this now because of the shepherding pawns on [ c6 ] and e6.
 [ d3 ] , [ O-O ]  Observing the battlefield their king sees fit to retreat into his castle!
 [ N f4 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ] , [ d4 ]  White bilds up an impressive center. At this point Black's position is somewhat cramped. Notice that moving my Knight is a must because of the discovered attack.
 [ B b4 + ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N e7 ] , [ a3 ]  Trying to win the Bishop pair and strengthen my center pawn chain.
 [ K e3 ]  [ K x g4 ] , [ K d3 ]  Whit is simply going back and forth now but it is obvious which pawn will be promoted. It is over for white of course but the inevitable could of still of been prolonged. This move is a blunder because now there is no way to stop the [ h7 ] pawn from promoting. [ K f2 ] would of been a way better move.
 [ f x g5 ]  [ N f7 ]  [ g x f6 ]  [ O-O-O ]  [ g4 ] , [ K c7 ]  The king seemed fine where he was. I would have tried [ b5 ] maybe get [ N c3 ] to move.
 [ K h3 ]  [ K f4 ] , [ Q f7 + ]  Blunder but white was pretty much lost anyway.
 [ N c3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ N x c6 ]  [ N x c3 ]  [ N x d8 ]  [ N x d1 ]  [ K x d1 ]  [ K x d8 ]  [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ B c4 ] , [ f6 ]  Time to move that pawn
 [ O-O ] , [ N d7 ]  A blunder I think. The knight was alright where it was but hard to see what would have been a better move.
 [ N f3 ] , [ d6 ]  I'm planning to play the Najdorf.
 [ N c6 ] , [ N e3 ]  White has in mind [ N d5 ] Kd6/[ d8 ] to protect the B but [ N f4 ] and white wins the rook.
 [ K h8 ] , [ R f3 ]  Now black must lose the Queen or the game is lost.
 [ d5 ] , [ c4 ]  I try to use the Queen's gambit as my main opening for the moment.
 [ N a3 ]  [ e6 ] , [ h5 ]  Advancing pawns almost always need to be blocked or threatened. Once they are in your side of the board they are dangerous. So when I'm playing well in this case I stop and ask "What happens if that pawn advances again next turn? a6. 1) I take it weakening my possible castle or weakening my pawn attack. He can then even bring his bishop to [ a6 ] and cause more weakness. 2) I leave it. Same result. It weakens everything. Pawn structure is critical. I'll exchange a bishop or knight almost 100% of the time if it means pawns that are back to back and can't support each other. I'll make exchanges all the time if it means a pawn gets isolated. Once it is I muster the troops to attack that little pawn. Maybe your opponent will need to defend the lonely pawn leaving him vulnerable elsewhere.
 [ R x e4 ] , [ Q x e4 ]  White can take the [ g3 ] pawn now.
 [ e4 ]  [ B x e4 ] , [ f x g3 ]  Now white is forced to chose between mate or loosing the Bishop.
 [ Q a4 ]  [ R b8 ] , [ N f3 ]  Prepares to castle.
 [ K h1 ] , [ Q x f2 ]  I calculated that this led to a forced win as the text shows by exchanging off most of the pieces on the board into a winning rook-and-pawn endgame. Shame I didn't find the forced checkmate to crown my rather nice attack but such is life...an important skill in chess as well as in life is to know when to stop attacking exchange off all the pieces and convert the small advantage that you have gained in the attack.
 [ Q x e8 + ]  [ K h7 ]  [ R f3 ]  [ R e7 ]  [ Q c6 ]  [ Q g6 ]  [ g4 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ Q d6 ] , [ B f6 ]  I really can't find a way out of this.
 [ Q h4 ]  [ R h8 ] , [ Q x e4 ]  White takes my lone lone pawn but allows me a tactical shot.
 [ b x c6 ] , [ R c1 ]  The c-file is a good place for the rook right now
 [ K f1 ] , [ Q a8 ]  Going for a full Rook instead of the measly Knight.
 [ N b8 d7 ] , [ N f g5 ]  17. [ N f g5 ] - with ideas of plonking my knight onto e6. The knight will be well supported on that square provided that Fou Leblanc remains on the a2-[ g8 ] diagonal.
 [ c4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ g5 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ h4 ] , [ N e5 ]  now it is getting interesting the counterattack is rolling...lil threat here lil threat there..
 [ f x g5 ] , [ N e4 ]  One reason for not resigning was my hope that Jack would blunder a pawn and even allow me to renew a threat.
 [ c5 ]  [ c4 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ h6 ]  [ B h4 ]  [ B e7 ] , [ N d5 ]  Was hoping that he would play this as I wanted to pin his knight to his queen take then post my knight on d4. This is possible without this move but some other moves could have prevented this. I thought that White may play [ B e2 ] and try to castle then I would trade knights take on [ f3 ] then post the knight. Although it played out slightly differently the end result was the same.
 [ B d5 ]  [ R c8 ]  [ B x f7 + ] , [ K g7 ]  black does not take the bait... the bishop has to retreat to prevent [ Q c2 ] mate...
 [ B f2 ] , [ Q x b5 ]  Black has material advantage
 [ B c4 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ B x e6 ] , [ f x e6 ]  black takes control of the center (can play d5) but is ruining his king side pawn structure)
 [ R c8 ]  [ R d b1 ] , [ N c4 ]  Ooops I made a mistake do you want a free knight?
 [ Q d6 ] , [ N f3 ]  Developing second knight securing now [ e5 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ g3 ]  [ B c5 ] , [ N x e5 ]  The fork trick.
 [ f4 ]  [ e x f3 ]  [ e ]  [ p ]  [ N x f3 ] , [ B x c3 + ]  another pawn won. no problem ill take it.
 [ K x h1 ] , [ Q x d2 ]  This is the time for the queen trade. My passed pawns will prevail.
 [ a x b3 ]  [ a x b3 ]  [ R a1 + ]  [ K h2 ]  [ B d7 ] , [ Q g4 ]  Black's rooks may now soon get annoying on the second row but if I get my queen to [ g3 ] it can get very active on the dark squares that are weak for black
 [ N x d1 ]  [ R x b4 ] , [ N x e3 ]  Aha... and the mate isn't any near! This is becoming annoyant. And after all I am only +2. The fact that black pieces are cashed in gives me the edge but... I see free pawns coming in.
 [ c4 ]  [ O-O ] , [ R a d1 ]  Figured while there was a lull in the action I would try for a sneak attack on his queen. I was planning on [ c5 ] his pxp my N-[ c4 ] then advancing my [ d5 ] pawn having my Rook and N as back up....just a small side plan.
 [ g3 ] , [ d6 ]  Bringing out pawns so bishops can be developed.
 [ N b3 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ B e2 ] , [ B e7 ]  That E file is stacked! Freeing up the back line for castling white prepares for a major kingside pawn assault
 [ e x d5 ] , [ Q e7 ]  Still aiming at the K-side.
 [ b4 ]  [ B f6 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ g5 ]  [ c4 ]  [ b5 ]  [ c x b5 ]  [ a x b5 ]  [ B c5 ] , [ h5 ]  And a concession. Black can free up his h-pawn then block the b8-[ h2 ] diagonal with a bishop on [ e5 ] and happily march to h1.
 [ b x c4 ]  [ b x c4 ]  [ a3 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ B h5 ]  [ N x c6 ] , [ Q f3 ]  Here I was gunning for his rook. I figured that I could bluff an attack while actually shooting at the rook but it didn't quite work like that.
 [ Q h6 ] , [ B b5 ]  39. .... Bb5?? - this is a blunder of which Julia will have to give up her queen to avoid mate.
 [ R g1 ] , [ N h4 ]  looking to fork king and rook
 [ e4 ] , [ c5 ]  Not to my surprise he plays the Siclian.
 [ g x f6 ]  [ e ] , [ p ]  [ g x f6 ] e.p. I was hoping Black would allow me to take this move. En passant (from French: in passing)
 [ N e4 ] , [ B h4 ]  Gives the initiative to black with many attacking chances. Better maybe 17. [ B x e4 ] which removes the potentially strong black knight and creates a strong pawn on the c-file for white.
 [ R x f8 + ]  [ R x f8 ] , [ N g3 ]  So I start getting my out to protect and seeing what I could do with it.
 [ Q e3 + ]  [ K f8 ] , [ Q x a7 ]  White goes for a petty pawn grab which in all honesty is probably his undoing.
 [ Q d2 ] , [ N c6 ]  and finally black begins development.
 [ d x c4 ]  [ B x c4 ]  [ B b4 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ B x c3 ]  [ b x c3 ] , [ N x e4 ]  Oops I hadn't noticed that pawn loss. But then what do pawns matter when I'm about to uncork a stunning sacrifice?
 [ R f d1 ]  [ R d7 x d4 ]  [ B x d4 ] , [ Q f7 ]  ...I swap off a pair of Rooks.
 [ d5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ e4 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ N g5 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ B x f7 + ]  [ K d7 ]  [ Q x g4 + ]  [ N x g4 ]  [ B e6 + ]  [ K c6 ]  [ B x g4 ] , [ e6 ]  9. ...... [ e6 ] - this was before it was pointed out that maybe [ B g7 ] was the better move here.
 [ K f6 ]  [ Q x d7 ]  [ R f d8 ] , [ Q g4 ]  Celle resigns. He has fought off the mate but his material and positional disadvantages render his position hopeless. Well done by Fischer! [He had a mate in 5 with 27 R-[ B4 ] ch K-[ K4 ] 28 R-[ [ [ B5 ] ] ] ch K-[ [ K5 ] ] 29 P-[ B3 ] ch K-[ K6 ] 30 R-[ [ K5 ] ] ch K-[ [ [ B5 ] ] ] 31 Q-[ [ [ B5 ] ] ] mate but as this was a timed simul he decided to play a move that would end the game immediately with a resignation.]
 [ f6 ]  [ B h2 ] , [ O-O ]  21. .......... 0-0 - after driving my bishop back to [ a2 ] black finally castles.
 [ N x f6 ] , [ Q f5 ]  Trying to prevent more damage Rotterdam uses his Queen as a shield. But Ken can still cause further as is about to happen next.
 [ N d6 + ]  [ K d7 ] , [ N c4 ]  Black's Q has very few safe squares particularly given the discovered check by White's LSB.
 [ B f4 + ]  [ e5 ]  [ B x e5 + ]  [ B d6 ] , [ B x d6 # ]  I've got a looooong way to go before I'm at all passable at faster games but I have a feeling that with games like this I'm on the right track!
 [ N d4 ]  [ N x d4 ] , [ e x d4 ]  All book to this point very standard stuff...
 [ O-O ]  [ O-O ] , [ N b c6 ]  The position so far seems routine and roughly equal.
 [ R g3 + ]  [ K f2 ] , [ R f8 + ]  I ran through the possibilities and decided that [ R f8 + ] was a better option than moving back into a discovered check position or moving Rg2+.
 [ B x f4 ]  [ R x f4 ] , [ e5 ]  Now Black's center is starting to look a bit menacing.
 [ K h8 ]  [ N x h5 ]  [ R x e5 ]  [ Q d4 ]  [ B b8 ] , [ f4 ]  Attacking the pinned piece. He resigned.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ] , [ h3 ]  less common waiting move
 [ B f6 ] , [ K d6 ]  Now White is on top again
 [ R d1 ]  [ R e6 + ]  [ K x c5 ]  [ R x a6 ]  [ R d3 + ]  [ K f4 ]  [ R d4 + ]  [ K g3 ]  [ K b5 ]  [ R h6 ]  [ R g4 + ]  [ K h3 ]  [ K c5 ] , [ R x h5 + ]  ...but can't believe my luck.
 [ B x d7 + ] , [ Q x d7 ]  Mission accomplished.
 [ B b5 ] , [ N g e7 ]  and I've achieve an equal yet dynamic game with this move I've added several conditionals... as I believe white will play next [ N b3 ] (the purpose of playing Nbd2) a) 9. [ N b3 ] [ B g4 ] 10. N[ b x d4 ] O-O-O I'm hoping for this one yet I think the other two are more likely to be played... b) 9. [ N b3 ] [ B g4 ] 10. [ Q x d4 ] [ B x f3 ] 11. [ Q x f6 ] [ g x f6 ] 12. [ g x f3 ] O-O-O with almost completed development and open lines on white's king c) 9. [ N b3 ] [ B g4 ] 10. [ Q x d4 ] [ B x f3 ] 11. [ g x f3 ] [ Q x f3 ] 12. [ R d1 ] [ Q g4 + ] threatening a draw by repetition
 [ c x b5 ]  [ a6 ]  [ b x a6 ] , [ g6 ]  This is the most accurate move order for black since white can go for a specific set up involving [ b3 ] and [ g3 ] that solves many problems early if black captures the pawn immediately. I think the point with this move order is that if white goes for the set up the black LSB may prove to be more useful on the c8-[ h3 ] diagonal.
 [ g x f3 ] , [ N f x d4 ]  Down goes the pawn. The bonus prize here included the doubled pawns on the f-file which are easily stopped and an open g-file to the King. The pawns on [ f4 ] and [ e5 ] will be useful in restricting White's dark-squared Bishop's mobility.
 [ N b6 ] , [ Q b3 ]  possibly a mistake but also threatens [ b f7 + ] which leads to k[ d7 ] and hten maybe [ e6 + ] putting the pawn in a powerful well-protected position
 [ N x e5 ]  [ N g5 ]  [ h6 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ N x f6 + ]  my knight is being chased all over the board I figured might as well cut my losses...I think.
 [ K e7 ] , [ Q d7 # ]  learned not to try to srace the other player until you are down getting tthe minor stuff out
 [ a6 ] , [ B a4 ]  He presents an attack and I move back.
 [ R a6 ] , [ K f7 ]  Now I repeated the position to grab some seconds.
 [ B e5 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B b5 + ]  [ B d7 ]  [ N x d7 ]  [ N x d7 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ a6 ]  [ B x d7 + ]  [ Q x d7 ]  [ d5 ]  [ B e7 ] , [ Q g4 ]  !? White is playing on the [ e6 ] square and seeking to trade ASAP. I was in a simul with 25-30 other people and I can infer Illia was seeking the shortest game possible.
 [ Q e3 ]  [ R x e5 ]  [ Q x e5 ] , [ N e8 ]  The best move! Exchanging rooks was fine for white but black now besides watching important dark squares offers a deadly exchange of queens. 26. Qxc7? [ N x c7 ] and the white bishops look awful trying to defend weak pawns: 27. [ B c1 ] [ B a4 ] or 27. [ B e2 ] [ N b5 ] any line will lose a pawn.
 [ B x b1 ]  [ R c x b1 ]  [ N x a3 ]  [ R b3 ]  [ N c4 ]  [ Q d3 ] , [ N e3 ]  The knight has gone a long path b8-d7-f8-e6-c7-b5-a3-c4-[ e3 ] winning a pawn and finally occupying a cramping position in white's camp.
 [ Q a4 + ] , [ K e7 ]  The beginning of the end. The King-hunt now starts in earnest.
 [ R g6 + ]  [ N f6 ]  [ K h4 ] , [ R c5 ]  in many lines white has drawing chances for example stalemate possibilities and allowing the rooks to be traded in which white has a positional draw thanks to black's giving up the knight white can draw by stalemate. The text hopes to bypass those possibilities and also contains a trap which white unexpectedly falls into.
 [ c4 ] , [ B h4 ]  20. [ B h4 ] - Step 1 - I gain a tempo by attacking the Wicked Witch of the West.
 [ c4 ]  [ d x c4 ]  [ b x c4 ]  [ b x c4 ]  [ B x c4 ]  [ N a5 ] , [ B d3 ]  I think Black's position is now slightly worse after decentralizing the Queenside N.
 [ c x b5 ]  [ a x b5 ] , [ K e4 ]  He can only move backwards
 [ N x c4 ] , [ R x c4 ]  Rather than weaken the pawn structure white recaptures with the rook giving me the option to keep the heavy pieces or weaken his pawns.
 [ K h7 ] , [ Q g8 + ]  This stunning move forces the rook to take the queen so now the pawn's promotion square is clear.
 [ Q b6 ]  [ Q e5 + ] , [ K b7 ]  32...[ Q c7 ] is lost after 33.[ Q x c7 + ] [ R x c7 ] 34.[ d6 ]  [ e7 ] , [ R g1 ]  Black tries his last idea to do something.
 [ a4 ]  [ R a e8 ]  [ f4 ]  [ f6 ]  [ B h4 ] , [ R e2 + ]  Game over again. White cannot interpose and [ K h3 ] or [ K g1 ] end with Qg2#.
 [ R e e7 ]  [ R a4 ]  [ Q d8 ]  [ Q b3 ] , [ Q c7 ]  31. ...... [ Q c7 ] - I can do little room but shuffle my heavies around now be prepared for big action!
 [ K e7 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ N a6 ] , [ h4 ]  White should play [ d5 ] and try to hold onto his e pawn. However getting a passed kingside pawn is a good idea just not right now.
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ e3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ d6 ]  [ c3 ]  [ N b d7 ]  [ h3 ] , [ e5 ]  a system which I usually employ
 [ K e7 ]  [ B x a8 ]  [ R x a8 ] , [ B g5 ]  To liquidate pieces of course. And to open a file if black will let me.
 [ e x d5 ] , [ N h4 ]  ?! An obvious lure of black's g pawn as the white bishop on [ b2 ] can be activated after white plays dxc. This just seems a little slow however and loses tempo. Maybe 12. dxc bxc 13. BxN QxB 14. [ e4 ] was a stronger continuation.
 [ d x e4 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ N x e4 ] , [ Q x e4 ]  The backside is that I freed his black diagonal...
 [ Q x c3 ] , [ Q x c6 ]  The first assaulting wave is over. Black has won material but the lost of the [ c6 ] pawn seriously weakens the defense.
 [ Q d2 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ B d3 ] , [ Q h3 ]  Threatens to take the bisshop.
 [ d6 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ O-O-O ]  [ B g4 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ B g5 ] , [ e5 ]  White sheds another pawn.
 [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N d b5 ] , [ d6 ]  6. ...... [ d6 ] - the first six moves were the standard move set up by our MT.
 [ e4 ] , [ c5 ]  I'm not surprised that Charles played this. He must have studied plenty of my openings. And he has annotated games where he's played this defense.
 [ B c5 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ Q e7 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ f4 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ N g5 ]  I start thinking about a pin
 [ R h d8 ]  [ R d e1 ]  [ N f8 ] , [ N e5 ]  Exchanging pieces isn't going to help but nothing else will either. 26. [ b5 ] is the most obvious attempt to get something going but Black can play 26. ... [ c5 ] and 27. ... [ b6 ] to stabilise the Q-side.
 [ K e7 ]  [ Q f3 ]  [ N d4 ] , [ N d5 + ]  And here is the second check moving [ K d7 ] had probably been the best move for black
 [ K b2 ]  [ R b4 + ]  [ K a2 ]  [ R e4 ]  [ R x a7 ]  [ R e2 ]  [ K b2 ] , [ h3 ]  46.... [ h3 ] - strange I expected black to take on [ h2 ] with his rook. He will do this next move however. In the meantime me and my rook decide to liquidate black's queenside pawns and get a passer of my own. It seems to be another Battle of the Wings Part 2 only this time my passer never gets to leave the second rank black's passer is on the 7th at the end!
 [ e4 ] , [ c5 ]  My favourite
 [ K e7 ]  [ B x e8 ] , [ K x e8 ]  Minimum amount of moves needed for the white king to get to [ d3 ] or e4: 3 Moves for the black king to get to c5: 3.
 [ Q e7 + ]  [ K g8 ] , [ Q x f6 ]  !? Maybe I can escape from three-fold repitition
 [ B x e7 ]  [ Q x e7 ] , [ a3 ]  white is preparing to locate his bishop to b5. but first should prevent Qb4.
 [ B g7 ]  [ R g8 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ e x f6 ]  [ R x d6 ]  [ K f8 ] , [ Q d4 ]  An important centralization move defending the b-pawn and attacking f6. Black can try to scurry his King to defend [ f6 ] with 21...[ K g7 ] but White has a winning combination: 22.R1xe6! [ f x e6 ] 23.[ R d7 + ] forcing mate.
 [ B f4 ]  [ d6 ]  [ B c4 ] , [ N d7 ]  Ugh. I hate this opening.
 [ Q x g2 ]  [ Q f1 + ]  [ Q x f1 ]  [ R x f1 + ]  [ K g2 ] , [ d2 ]  ! Now White is entirely lost. Preventing the promotion ceremony fails to 32.[ B x d2 ] [ R x b1 ] and taking the Black Rook is no better (and is in fact much worse).
 [ K f1 ]  [ N g3 + ]  [ K f2 ]  [ N h1 + ]  [ K f1 ]  [ N g3 + ]  [ K f2 ] , [ N h1 + ]  Finally he declares a draw. Please rate and comment honestly.
 [ N h5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ R b2 ] , [ R a6 ]  omg I can be so mean!
 [ R x f7 + ] , [ K h6 ]  Oops again. Forgot it was guarded by the Knight. Oh well I'm only down a Pawn. Still can fight on.
 [ B d7 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ Q d1 ]  [ N x f3 + ]  [ Q x f3 ] , [ B d6 ]  Alternatives where 7. ...[ f5 ] or [ N f6 ] again "fighting for control of the white squares.
 [ K f2 ]  [ R d f3 + ]  [ K e2 ] , [ R f b3 ]  This is needed to stop the white rooks from getting active
 [ B g7 ] , [ d4 ]  Finally!
 [ N e8 ] , [ B g5 ]  20. [ B g5 ] - and Fou Lenoir develops with a threat - on the Wicked Witch of the West.
 [ K d2 ] , [ K x h8 ]  Black's extra pawn is now meaningless as white can force a perpetual check given the position is objectively a DRAW.
 [ R d3 ]  [ R c8 ]  [ Q e3 ] , [ Q a3 ]  White through maximum defence has now a chance to try and at least tempt Black to "simplify" 42. [ Q h6 ] [ Q f8 ] and the ladies take their leave. 42 [ Q h6 ] [ Q b2 + ] 43. [ K e1 ] [ R g8 ] 44. [ Q d2 ] and the Qs face off again. But no guarantees that Black will agree to the exchange. We'll soon find out!
 [ d3 ] , [ d6 ]  [ g4 ] is looking good a bishop attack seemed obvious so i wanted to change it up a bit.
 [ K f5 ]  [ B d2 ]  [ h4 ] , [ N e4 ]  The pawn that was hindering the devolpment of my knight to [ d5 ] is not gone. The knight places himself in the center of everything. Threatening [ B d6 ] and defending g3.
 [ R h3 ]  [ B f6 ] , [ R f3 ]  And now what moves black has anymore left :) ?
 [ B x h7 + ]  [ K x h7 ] , [ Q h5 + ]  Having my knight on [ e5 ] traded I sort of panic and pull the trigger too soon and we will be fighting for position for a while.
 [ K e7 ] , [ N c3 ]  [ N c3 ] White develops his remaining knight.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B c4 ] , [ N f6 ]  That's the key possition. Here white usually play 4. [ N g5 ] followed by 4... [ B c5 ] or 4...d5. That's why people more often play 3... [ B c5 ] rather than 3... Nf6. So I rarely get a chance to play my favourite variation and that's not an oportunity to miss.
 [ d x e5 ] , [ N x e5 ]  White has a huge lead in development and Black is in real trouble.
 [ R g8 ] , [ N g4 ]  Permits Black to lock up the bishop on h6. Instead 18.[ B f4 ] would have kept some freedom of action. Too bad about the exchange of minor pieces. When behind sometimes one must accept the exchange of pieces to avoid incurring worse.
 [ R c8 ]  [ Q h4 ]  [ N e7 ] , [ B a3 ]  Better is an immediate [ N g5 ] with some tactical play against blacks kingside. THis is one reason the white Queen went to [ h4 ]  [ b6 ] , [ N g e4 ]  With some ideas of [ N d6 + ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ R b5 ] , [ Q a3 ]  If black noiw play [ Q e7 ] he will be in trouble after g3-g4!
 [ a6 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ R c1 ]  [ R a c8 ] , [ N e4 ]  Here in my head I saw one set of moves but did another. I originally saw this sequence: [ Q x c2 ] 22.[ N x f6 + ] [ N x f6 ] 23.[ R x c2 ] [ R x c2 ] 24.[ B x c2 ] Rc8. Now let's see what I actually did...
 [ d3 ]  [ d6 ] , [ B g5 ]  The knight is now pinned and as I'm ahead on material I don't mind exchanging pieces.
 [ B d3 ] , [ B b7 ]  Reinforcing the weak pawn on c6. I also enjoy lining up 'cannon attacks' on the enemy castles.
 [ c3 ]  [ R x e5 + ]  [ K f4 ] , [ R x c5 ]  Now Jupiter cashes in the prize for his persistance and luck for playing against a drunk sexholic who was worshipped for some reason nobody will ever fully understand. Baco's flaw of character seems to be the biggest flaw in here.
 [ R x f5 ] , [ R d4 ]  He pins my bishop not bad.
 [ K a1 ] , [ B a3 ]  I want the check to come on b2..
 [ e3 ] , [ B e8 ]  14. .... [ B e8 ] - uh oh heading for [ h5 ] and then a possible landing on [ f3 ] in an attempt to trade off the lsbs and to effect a support mate with the Witch on [ g2 ] should I initiate the trade. If that happens then I must put Fou Leblanc on [ h1 ] so that if the bishops are traded off it will take Janet longer to rustle up this mating attack.
 [ Q x g5 + ] , [ R d2 ]  (?) White is now falling apart 26.[ K b1 ] is preferred.
 [ B b8 ]  [ K f1 ]  [ K x b6 ]  [ N d5 + ]  [ K c5 ] , [ N e7 ]  The next few moves demonstrate the superiority of the bishop over the knight in the endgame but is not enough to win the game for black.
 [ B x h3 ] , [ g x h3 ]  I am starting to like this sacrifice more and more. It has brought me a lot of success in the past. Similarly I have struggled to defend against this sacrifice as well. So now I look much more aggressively to prevent the Bishop sacrifice by my opponents. Either way it is a both strong and an exciting move and most of times dramatically changes the course of the match. It sure did this time.
 [ O-O ] , [ d5 ]  Better are [ g6 ] d6. I was expecting g6. Without it he's going to have a rough time castling kingside if he wants to. Time to see how he handles pressure.
 [ O-O ]  [ d4 ]  [ c3 ]  [ d x c3 ] , [ B c1 ]  13. [ B c1 ] - wow and double wow black wins a pawn here because if [ B x [ c3 ] ] then we have an example of a PAWN FORK on b4. Either Jim's knight or his bishop will have to go. Now that pawn on [ c3 ] could become very awkward indeed for Jim.
 [ K h4 ]  [ K f1 ] , [ g3 ]  This seems to be the quickest way to win: If 40. [ K g1 ] [ g2 ] 41. [ R h2 ] [ K g3 ] the rook can reach the first rank in two moves winning. Otherwise a pawn promotes as mentioned in the previous note.
 [ N c3 ] , [ e5 ]  The Old Indian. As its name suggests hardly the height of fashion but a sound opening with counter-attacking possibilities.
 [ B d1 ] , [ K d4 ]  King centralises
 [ R h5 ]  [ Q x h5 ]  [ g x h5 ] , [ f4 ]  As I messaged you it is common practice to resign a game when in your situation. I suggested you don't resign our game. The reason is there may be techniques I will use in the mate that will be instructional to you.
 [ R h8 ] , [ B g7 ]  ? I should have played [ B g5 ] to keep the pawn.
 [ g3 ]  [ f x e5 ] , [ Q x e5 ]  Now my pawns on [ d4 ] and [ e5 ] have been replaced by pieces which are powerfully placed. Perhaps Black should try and exchange them with say 18.... Qf6? White will always have positional trumps in this sort of position if he plays carefully as the Black e pawn is now a backward pawn on a semi-open file (i.e. White can attack it with rook and/or queen down the e file) and the Black bishop is bad. It is to improve this bishop that my opponent tries next.
 [ Q x d3 ] , [ O-O ]  king in savety and queen free to move
 [ e x f4 ]  [ B x f4 ] , [ N d4 ]  Now the bishop is attacking the rook on h1.
 [ B b4 + ]  [ N c3 ] , [ N e4 ]  He was playing awfully aggressive for black especially considering his passive pawn structure. He is already able to castle but if he were to trade off pieces he would fall way behind in development.
 [ R c1 ] , [ R d8 ]  21. ...... [ R d8 ] - if I now move that knight to [ d7 ] the [ c6 ] pawn falls. Wait a minute in retrospect (hindsight is 20/20 vision eh what?) maybe I should have played this move because if N[ d7 ] Rx[ c6 ] [ N x e5 ] then his rook and lsb will be forked. Ahhgh I feel a right chessic dunce here!
 [ B c4 + ] , [ N f7 ]  ?! I don't like this move. Now Black will get very cramped. I think the normal 12...[ K h8 ] would be better.
 [ Q d6 ]  [ Q b7 + ]  [ K f6 ]  [ Q b5 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ Q d3 ] , [ c4 ]  Coming tricky for Petrosian.
 [ g3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ c3 ]  preventing advancement of knight opening diagonal for queen and giving support for d4.
 [ B x e6 ] , [ B x g7 ]  I take the Bishop at [ g7 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ Q e2 + ] , [ R e7 ]  The move was a mistake because I get the Knight with check. Better: [ Q e5 ] because the queen is protected by the pawn at [ f6 ] and the Queen protect the Knight at [ h5 ]  [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ f4 ] , [ c5 ]  Mini-Tournament with fixed opening: KGD Mafia Defence. This is the initial position for the games.
 [ N x e5 ] , [ f x e5 ]  not dxe5? Qxe3+! winning a pawn
 [ N e7 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ a6 ]  this is were the Najdorf extension comes in handy: square [ b5 ] is a very important square in any Sicilian...
 [ e x d5 ]  [ f6 ]  [ N h4 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N g6 ]  [ K f7 ] , [ N h4 ]  And yet another horrendous move. Instead of capitalising on his mistake I saw the knight under attack and retreated. Obviously KxR gives me material equality.
 [ R x h7 ] , [ R a6 ]  Trying to win white's N.
 [ Q g2 ]  [ R x f1 + ]  [ Q x f1 ] , [ R e1 ]  white cannot survive and with the lost of the queen he should resign
 [ R x g7 ] , [ R c6 ]  an important subtlety.
 [ c5 ] , [ d5 ]  So into the Benoni-Benko systems. White has a slight space advantage. But will play his [ B f8 ] to [ g7 ] and try to build up pressure along the long black diagonal combined with play on the Queen's side. White may try for a large break through in the centre and/or a king side attack. It is quite unbalanced which is why it is popular. According to the stats 2.....[ c5 ] leads to less draws and more wins for both White and Black.
 [ R d7 ]  [ Q e2 ]  [ R d2 ]  [ Q e5 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ Q e3 ]  [ Q x e3 ]  [ f x e3 ] , [ R x c2 ]  And now I've lost a second pawn with little hope of getting either back while my structure is collapsing by the move.
 [ B x c3 + ] , [ b x c3 ]  And we have doubled pawns as well. So far so good for me.
 [ B d3 ] , [ N g6 ]  [ N [ g6 ] ] preventing [ B x h7 ] maybe winning a pawn (after [ g6 ] Bx[ g6 ] fx[ g6 ] Qx[ g6 ] the position is a Bishop for three pawns and Black's King is exposed in the centre).
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ Q e7 ] , [ N x e5 ]  This sacrifice is unsound according to Fritz.
 [ a4 ] , [ f5 ]  so be it! I calculated that I may have an advantage here by getting out of my black hole.
 [ B d3 ] , [ B d6 ]  both developing to active squares for kingside castling
 [ h x g4 ]  [ Q x g4 ] , [ N e2 ]  Black will double on the open file so white must prevent mate on [ g2 ]  [ N g3 ]  [ h5 ]  [ N h2 ] , [ Q g7 ]  And white resigns due to the threat of ..[ h4 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ B b4 ]  White plays the main line 3.[ N c3 ] so Black renews the pressure on White's e-pawn by pinning the defending knight signalling the start of the lively Winawer Variation. Here White's most usual choice is to advance the e-pawn: the main line runs 4.[ e5 ] [ c5 ] 5.[ a3 ] [ B x c3 + ] 6.bxc3. Another feasible option which several tournament opponents have played against me is to transpose into an Exchange Variation with 4.exd5. However White's next move is one that I have never played against before.
 [ N d4 ]  [ Q f6 ] , [ N c6 ]  Black's lsb is not a problem anymore.
 [ O-O-O ]  [ Q g7 ] , [ N b1 ]  20. [ N b1 ] - that knight is really innocuous but that is the one that will be the death of Henry later on.
 [ K e6 ] , [ R d e3 ]  ...allowing me to pin his rook down to the e-file...
 [ Q x c2 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N b c6 ]  [ B d1 ]  [ Q b2 ]  [ B a4 ]  [ Q b6 ]  [ B c2 ]  [ h6 ] , [ g4 ]  This move higly effective for white.All in all I thing [ f x g4 ] lose the game for black.Open files always be dangerous for rooks.And if white king move [ h1 ] and after castle [ g1 ] then this is very serious danger for black.Espacially game is stuck in the middle and black queen and other peaces can not come for help easily.
 [ N f5 ]  [ R x e4 ]  [ N e3 ]  [ R h4 ]  [ B f3 ] , [ f5 ]  Time to advance that strong pawn formation and gain ground in the center.
 [ R f1 ] , [ B x e4 + ]  BOOM! I'd like to say that I was planning this move from the start or atleast from 4 moves earlier but no. After a little guess work & imagination I found it and was happy with the resulting forced mate. White resigned.
 [ N x f3 + ]  [ g x f3 ]  [ B x h3 ] , [ f4 ]  14. [ f4 ] An absolutely critical choice to stop 14....[ Q g5 + ] and mate in two moves.
 [ B g3 ]  [ R b8 ]  [ h4 ]  [ g4 ]  [ N d2 ] , [ b6 ]  Given our respective abilities I was confident that I could outplay the opponent and so I decided to create some imbalance in the postion to play around with.
 [ N x e4 ]  [ g6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ h3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N x f6 + ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ O-O ] , [ O-O ]  untill now this follows GAMEKNOT database.
 [ B g5 ]  [ R d e8 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ N b5 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ b4 ]  This is a mistake as it gives me two passed pawns
 [ R b7 ] , [ N x f7 ]  
 [ K x h5 ] , [ R e5 ]  I want the pawns!
 [ N c6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O-O ] , [ c3 ]  I moved up the pawn in front of my remaining bishop to prevent Black's knight from camping on [ b4 ] or [ d4 ] and to allow my kingside rook the [ e1 ] square without any danger from my rooks being forked.
 [ a x b4 ]  [ a x b4 ] , [ h5 ]  Black's counterplay is slow and his centre seems about to break.
 [ g5 ]  [ N e2 ]  [ Q a5 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N g4 ]  [ N g3 ]  [ h5 ] , [ N f5 ]  Knights look better when they can't be captured near the middle of the board no?
 [ O-O ] , [ g6 ]  I plan to put my DSB on the long diagonal where it will have plenty of targets. This is also another reason why I prefer not to play 5...e4.
 [ K x g5 ] , [ N e6 + ]  White wanted to get some counter play but it was just not enough.
 [ e4 ] , [ d5 ]  Counter-Counter one of my favorite openings as of late.
 [ B x e4 ]  [ f x e4 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ Q d5 ]  [ f4 ]  [ R a b8 ]  [ Q c2 ]  [ R b d8 ]  [ Q a4 ] , [ N b3 ]  The compouter says nothing about this move but I think its an oversight
 [ N f3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ] , [ B d6 ]  Normally would expect [ N f6 ] black to take the [ e5 ] pawn and white attack the [ f4 ] pawn. Although here it appears black has different plans. Black will have to careful of whites center.
 [ b6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ c6 ]  It takes a good place for the knight I know. But I wanted to control [ b5 ] and [ a6 ] would have caused me troubles after pawn's exchange in the center. Maybe all this is a wrong line of thinking.
 [ K c7 ] , [ N e5 ]  The exchange is lost and now he can give up.
 [ e4 ] , [ B g6 ]  E4 to threaten blacks LSB and also establish more center control. [ B g6 ] is the only safe spot for my LSB. The downside of not playing 4...Nf6.
 [ O-O ]  [ Q x e4 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ O-O ]  [ Q a5 ]  [ B d2 ] , [ R d8 ]  Black wants to fork my Queen & Bishop
 [ N x c3 ]  [ b x c3 ]  [ Q a2 ] , [ Q d2 + ]  40. ........ [ Q d2 + ] - the invader.
 [ Q f3 ] , [ e6 ]  Make way for KB & cover QB
 [ B x f5 ]  [ e x f5 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B d6 ]  [ N h4 ] , [ g6 ]  Well I must defend the pawn in [ f5 ] even if to do it i must move the pawn ahead the castle.
 [ e6 ] , [ c4 ]  Here comes the [ c4 ] pawn
 [ K h8 ] , [ N x e8 ]  If Black doesn't retake I simply retreat the Knight having reestablished material equality. If Black does recapture...
 [ B x c6 ]  [ d x c6 ]  [ N x e5 ] , [ R e8 ]  At first I thought that he was trying to win my pawn. But I quickly realized that it's defended by my Nc3.
 [ g4 ]  [ N h f6 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ Q e2 ] , [ N e5 ]  Good move by Ion.
 [ Q x h4 ]  [ d6 ]  [ Q d4 ]  [ R c7 + ]  [ K f6 ]  [ d7 ]  [ h4 ] , [ B b3 ]  A little "finesse" move. Allows me to place my rook behind my passed pawn without fear of capture.
 [ B x g7 ]  [ N x f2 ]  [ R g3 ]  [ N x d3 + ]  [ R x d3 ] , [ Q f4 + ]  Getting out of the threat with tempo so he can save his rook only...
 [ B d4 ]  [ R h8 ]  [ R d2 + ]  [ K b1 ]  [ K d5 ]  [ R a8 ] , [ K c4 ]  White can help himself to all the Pawns he wants. I am after bigger game now!
 [ B x d6 ]  [ Q x d6 + ] , [ Q d7 ]  After 22...[ K e8 ] I worked out 23. [ R e1 + ] (23. [ R c7 ] also forces mate) [ K f7 ] 24. [ Q e6 + ] [ K f8 ] 25. [ Q e8 # ]  [ K e7 ]  [ Q x h8 ] , [ Q d2 ]  White has nothing to fear
 [ R x e2 ] , [ B x e2 ]  White retakes rook at [ e2 ] and black bishop takes white rook.
 [ R g8 ] , [ Q g6 ]  attacking my bishop.
 [ c4 ]  [ b x c4 ]  [ b x c4 ] , [ a4 ]  OK now we each have a passed pawn but black's is farther from the action and a more imminent threat of promotion.
 [ f6 ]  [ K e2 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ B h3 ]  [ d4 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ d3 + ]  [ K d1 ]  [ K d4 ]  [ B h3 ] , [ e3 ]  [%clk 0:04:15] Wrong. The K has to pass first and stop the white B to act.
 [ K g6 ]  [ K f2 ]  [ R d3 ] , [ R e7 ]  He can't move pawns. This is the key.
 [ R a c1 ] , [ Q c6 ]  Qc6. I missed the better one Qc4! (really? exchange?.. yes! without queens Black can laugh of the white attack and the c2-pawn weakness will be more workable.
 [ B c4 ] , [ h6 ]  ? The Queen already guards against the Knight's advance plus Black has still not developed any pieces other than pawns.
 [ N x d7 ]  [ B x d7 ] , [ e4 ]  White's central pawn advance is more even more effective as it is supported by his pieces.
 [ N x e3 ]  [ R x e3 ]  [ R a d8 ] , [ R d3 ]  Here a better move is [ R d1 ] but since I was playing at blitz speed I totally missed that idea until after I had submitted my move and I noticed he could now play [ R f e8 ] unchallenged.
 [ d4 ]  [ Q b6 ]  [ b3 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ f x e5 ]  [ f x e5 ] , [ c4 ]  a bold try to get something going. White responds well gaining a very strong position.
 [ B e3 ]  [ Q c8 ] , [ a5 ]  ?
 [ c x d5 ]  [ R x d5 ]  [ R a x b4 ]  [ R x b4 ]  [ R x b4 ] , [ c6 ]  this move wins me the c pawn regardless of what my opponent does next move
 [ K f2 ]  [ R x f3 + ]  [ K e2 ]  [ R x f1 ]  [ R x f1 ] , [ f3 + ]  Tactic that wins the rook.
 [ O-O ]  [ B d3 ]  [ N b d7 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ a6 ]  [ a4 ]  [ R b8 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ N h5 ]  [ B h2 ]  [ B x c3 + ]  [ b x c3 ]  [ Q a5 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ b5 ]  [ O-O ]  [ b x a4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ B x e5 ]  [ R b7 ]  [ Q h6 ] , [ f6 ]  was tempted to play 19 [ g4 ] [ f x e5 ] 20. [ g x h5 ]  [ Q e4 + ]  [ Q x e4 ]  [ R x e4 ]  [ a2 ]  [ R a1 ]  [ R b2 ]  [ K f1 ]  [ K g6 ]  [ R e2 ]  [ R b1 + ]  [ R e1 ] , [ R b2 ]  another draw I avoided.
 [ Q d8 ]  [ N a5 ] , [ d5 ]  23. ....... [ d5 ] - seemed a good idea at the time but ....
 [ B x e4 ] , [ R g1 ]  White did not want to have his rook pinned and probably wanted to play with his knight. [ N g5 ] would be a strong move thats why I played h6.
 [ B f5 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ B x d3 ]  [ Q x d3 ]  [ b4 ]  [ Q x d8 ]  [ R x d8 ]  [ R a d1 ] , [ R e8 ]  and now i thought it was a good move because there is 2 threats on 2 opponent knights. i had a dream... a dream that i would win this game !
 [ B h5 ]  [ a3 ]  [ B x c3 ] , [ b x c3 ]  15. [ b x c3 ] - was [ R x c3 ] better? Gameknot Analysis does not have anything to tell me here. Except that my score is -0.26.
 [ f6 ] , [ Q a1 # ]  
 [ K g2 ]  [ Q e2 + ]  [ K g1 ]  [ B e3 + ]  [ K h1 ] , [ Q f2 ]  47...[ Q f1 + ] would have been mate in two. But this looks more aesthetic. Plus it gives White a chance to go kamikaze with his Queen.
 [ K g7 ] , [ R c1 ]  Threatening 38. [ R c7 + ]  [ B d6 ] , [ R c6 ]  This shows why a rook is just so strong compared to the minors. The Knight and King are tucked away in the corner and the rook is free to harass the Bishop until the rook wins the pawn on a7.
 [ B g7 ]  [ N x g6 + ]  [ K g8 ] , [ Q x h5 ]  White now has a forced mate in 4 (it was probably a forced mate in 6 with 31. Nh4! though I didn't work it out then) though black has a couple stalling tactics if he wishes to extend the forced mate a bit longer. White entered the moves from this point as conditional moves.
 [ f5 ]  [ Q g5 ] , [ B f6 ]  Queen msut go back to [ g3 ]  [ Q x f5 ] , [ Q x f5 ]  ? Further compounds the last mistake. DON'T EXCHANGE WHEN YOU DOWN ON POINTS
 [ N c3 ] , [ N x c2 ]  Ultimately this move was a mistake. After 23....[ N x c2 ] 24.[ B x c2 ] [ b4 ] 25.[ R x d8 + ] [ B x d8 ] 26.[ R g3 ] [ b x c3 ] 27.[ R x c3 ] [ R x c3 ] 28[ b x c3 ] leads to an opposite colored bishop endgame. Better was the immediate b4.
 [ K g3 ] , [ Q x d3 + ]  27. .... [ Q x d3 + ] As my motto "When a opponent is in the check position it's difficult for him to win."
 [ K g7 ] , [ c4 ]  I don't think there is any way to force a mate with just a bishop and a rook. I could bring my king up but black's pawns would force me to use the d-file to get past the pawns letting black escape or letting him block me in with his own king. That could take a while. On the other hand I figured it was mate in 7 or less by simply pushing the c-pawn - black cannot pass the d-file so the pawn can march merrily to promotion unmolested.
 [ Q f5 ] , [ e4 ]  Or she may want to exchange. I still don't want to give up my lovely lady so I reinforce the center.
 [ N h3 ]  [ a4 ]  [ R c1 ]  [ B b6 ] , [ Q x b5 ]  bishop wants to go kill the queen even if it costs his life but antony won't allow him
 [ R d2 ]  [ B c4 ] , [ B x f5 ]  White scores a pawn but is still in an akward position.
 [ Q c5 + ] , [ B e7 ]  This was a decent move on my behalf because attacking the queen and queen cannot take because 21..... q[ x e7 ] loses the queen.
 [ h3 ] , [ Q f1 + ]  47...[ R f5 ] would have been better guarding the a-pawn. Black was too keen to give a check himself for a change.
 [ R e7 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ N d7 ] , [ B d6 ]  ! forces black to exchange rooks. white should notice that the pawn chain that black has in the queen side is in the color of his bishop and the bishop that black has is in the opposite color so he cannot defend them.
 [ B x f1 ]  [ B x d2 ] , [ R d1 ]  ...and I am the one who ends without a B!
 [ N x d8 ]  [ N f5 ]  [ B c5 + ]  [ N x c5 ]  [ R x a1 + ]  [ K f2 ] , [ R a5 ]  The final point white might be able to hold the endgame if he's only down an exchange and with knights there are so many forks to worry about that it would have been difficult to prove if it was not for this skewer.
 [ B c6 ] , [ h3 ]  ? why? Bxf6!
 [ Q x d3 ] , [ B b4 + ]  [ B b4 + ] The queen is no longer attacking [ g7 ] this allows me to develop my bishop with check.
 [ R c3 ] , [ R e c1 ]  he already renounced
 [ N c6 ] , [ a3 ]  Hold the potential interruption.
 [ B h3 ]  [ d4 ] , [ N f6 ]  This can't be theory because....
 [ K e4 ]  [ N f2 + ] , [ K f5 ]  
 [ B d3 ]  [ R d7 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ R d4 ]  [ R e1 + ] , [ K f2 ]  he's just out-playing me now... I need to work on my endgame
 [ K b4 ] , [ Q d2 + ]  [ K a3 ] was played in game so I'll skip over that one. [ K b3 ] [ R b2 + ] [ K a3 ] [ Q b4 # ] Best was [ R c3 ] [ Q c3 + ] [ Q x c3 ] [ R x c3 ] [ K x c3 ] and now I have a winning endgame.
 [ e4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ d x e6 ]  [ B x e6 ] , [ d3 ]  I can't say this is a mistake but certainly it opens a bunch of possibile continuations for black that otherwise are just impossible. The first one that comes to mind is c5. But one of the things white has to be aware is white's [ B f4 ] which is annoying (since I normally plan to castle queenside). So...
 [ f x e5 ] , [ f4 ]  Trying to generate some play against the same pinned [ e5 ] square.
 [ K d1 ]  [ a3 ]  [ K c2 ]  [ b4 ]  [ K b1 ]  [ f5 ]  [ K c2 ]  [ K f7 ]  [ K b1 ]  [ K e6 ]  [ K c2 ]  [ K e5 ]  [ K b1 ]  [ K e4 ]  [ K a2 ]  [ K f3 ]  [ K b1 ]  [ K x f2 ]  [ K c2 ] , [ K g2 ]  He went at my pawns when all he needed to do was kill my [ B3 ] pawn with his king then A2 would be checkmate. But he tried a different plan. It forced me to go for three fold repetition but then I remembered it had to be forced
 [ f5 ]  [ B f7 ]  [ R b d4 ] , [ N d6 ]  29. .......... [ N d6 ] - d pawn is successfully blockaded.
 [ b3 ] , [ B b4 ]  But what I didn't realize is that Loyd will equalize since I'm going to lose a different pawn. That's because Loyd has removed the guard since my [ N c2 ] was the only thing that was protecting my e4. Now that I'm forced to remove it from that square black will take go for it by nabbing that pawn.
 [ K b7 ]  [ Q e1 ]  [ a5 ]  [ a4 ]  [ b4 ] , [ R f3 ]  After planting my bishop on [ d6 ] and seeing black's king moved over to the queenside I move my forces over there.
 [ B f4 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ B x d6 ] , [ c x d6 ]  The idea seems to have been "hold the center " but [ Q x d5 ] would have been better.
 [ c3 ] , [ N g e7 ]  Black's plan is to castle long and attack on the king side
 [ Q a5 ]  [ B d2 ] , [ Q d8 ]  so she gets back. Result: 3 pawn for a piece: seems average. But white is much more developped (of course) than black. On the other side black is closer to complete protection.
 [ g4 ] , [ f x g4 ]  what else?
 [ g3 ]  [ N g f6 ] , [ K g2 ]  There is nothing particularly wrong with blacks position at this point do really there was no reason for me to choose to sac a piece in the following way. Instead something like the simple ...[ R c8 ] and black is doing well however I decide to mix things up
 [ K c5 ]  [ Q c8 + ]  [ K b5 ]  [ Q d7 + ]  [ K c5 ] , [ h4 ]  At last hitting on the idea of pushing home his h-pawn. It isn't the only plan he could have adopted as we have already seen but it looks promising. However he had a better plan available which would have made a fine and spectacular conclusion to a fascinating game: 75.Rxd4!! [ Q x d4 ] 76.Bxe3!! [ Q x e3 ] 77.[ Q a7 + ] picking up the loose Q at e3. A couple of decoy sacrifices followed by a skewer.
 [ B g6 ]  [ R h6 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ B x f5 ] , [ e x f5 ]  Now with no bishops left it's up to the rooks...
 [ K g6 ]  [ K c5 ]  [ K x h6 ]  [ K d5 ]  [ K g5 ]  [ K e4 ]  [ h4 ] , [ B d1 ]  And now White loses the f-pawn whatever he does and in the same stride ends up in a loosing pawn endgame.
 [ Q b7 ]  [ N f8 ] , [ a5 ]  pushing my pawns he can't stop it
 [ K f5 ]  [ e3 ]  [ K f4 ] , [ R f6 + ]  Black instructs the white king to step away from the pawn.
 [ N d5 ] , [ N f3 + ]  Yikes! There should be laws against moves like this. The White queen is toast. I thought about resigning then saw that White gets almost enough material compensation for the queen. In addition I was way ahead on development. Perhaps then 13 [ N d5 ] was simply the beginning of a very deep queen sac in which I had looked deeply into the position and analyzed numerous positive variations. Yeah that's my story and I'm sticking to it.
 [ K f2 ] , [ Q x f4 + ]  It is very pleasant to calculate mate in these kind of positions! If the king goes to [ g1 ] then [ Q e3 ] is just mate! If he goes to [ e1 ] then after 31...[ N c4 ] 32.[ Q d1 ] [ R e8 ] 33.[ Q e2 ] [ R x e2 ] 34.[ K x e2 ] [ Q e3 ] 35.[ K d1 ] [ Q d2 # ] So the best try is to go to e2...
 [ b x c4 ]  [ b x c4 ] , [ K d3 ]  Not surprised that he played this. At first I thought that I was going to go from a pawn up to a pawn down. But at the last minute I find a way around it which is always what one should do anyhow.
 [ B d3 ] , [ Q e8 ]  Freeing my knight.
 [ B x d6 ] , [ B b5 + ]  This is another waste of time by white. But my intention here is to provoke c6. You see here is the fun in what I just did: black ought to play aggressively now and continue to do so. But someone who favors a certain style of play can't easily switch gears... yet... if I'm playing a really highly rated player I don't play like this. There's no getting away with such games then!
 [ Q x a5 ]  [ N x a5 ] , [ N e5 ]  Threatening to exchange black's lsb. The game looks pretty equal so it's a matter of subtleties now...
 [ h3 ] , [ N f6 ]  kicks my knight back home
 [ R h7 + ]  [ Q x h7 ]  [ N x h7 ]  [ K x h7 ]  [ Q h4 + ]  [ K g8 ]  [ Q e7 ]  [ B c6 ]  [ N f4 ] , [ K g7 ]  This leads to an immediate disaster but I think the position is lost anyway. Black is completely tied up even without this blunder.
 [ K f2 ] , [ B f7 ]  played with tempo the idea is that threatens the [ e2 ] bishop so white must do something about it
 [ K d7 ] , [ O-O ]  leave the bishop where it is for now
 [ K h2 ]  [ R e3 ]  [ Q f5 ]  [ Q b8 + ]  [ K g1 ] , [ Q g3 ]  44. ….. [ Q g3 ] - threatening [ R e1 + ] winning Q for R but now Luca gets a Get out of Jail Free card with [ Q c8 + ] and a draw offer which I accept. At least this draw gave me another sojourn in the 1900s from 23.11.19-13.1.20!
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ B b5 + ]  [ N c6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B d7 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ e6 ] , [ d4 ]  I expected a closed sicilian.
 [ Q f2 ] , [ B x a2 ]  Bishop takes [ a2 ] black is ahead two pawns in material and the pressure on white's king is increased.
 [ N f3 ]  [ B g6 ]  [ c3 ] , [ N f6 ]  I'd like perhaps to get the knight to e4.
 [ R c1 ]  [ a6 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ d5 ]  [ a4 ]  [ N c7 ]  [ B b6 ]  [ B e5 ] , [ R f e1 ]  X-raying. Planning to capture Bishop on e5. After which RxR and White would have a triple fork after Bishopxnc7!!
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B b5 ] , [ N d4 ]  The Bird Defense a very aggressive if not perfectly sound counter.
 [ N f4 ] , [ Q e8 ]  I needed to get my queen out of danger while still defending e4.
 [ R h8 ]  [ K g3 ]  [ f6 ]  [ R g6 ]  [ R f8 ]  [ N g4 ]  [ f5 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ f4 + ] , [ K g4 ]  I need to eliminate Black's final resource the passed KBP.
 [ a x b4 ]  [ c x b4 ] , [ R a3 ]  Comment from easy19; 'Time to ramp up the pressure' That comment had me worried as you could imagine. The rook can't do any damage on [ a3 ] and after White's next move Freddy has to retreat it...
 [ N g5 ] , [ R g3 ]  Overcoming white's defense of his pawn.
 [ N x d5 ]  [ B x d2 ]  [ Q x d2 ] , [ R x d5 ]  Following the exchanges black comes out considerably better. He has complete control of the only completely open file on the board a well placed rook and a good line of pawns.
 [ R b6 ] , [ N d8 ]  It is good move which threatens [ c6 ] again. Computer likes [ K f2 ] at first but misses threat of [ R e7 ] trapping the bishop.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ d3 ] , [ a6 ]  A standard Ruy Lopez openning.
 [ B g5 + ]  [ K b1 ] , [ Q d7 ]  Preparing for [ R d8 ] giving extra protection.
 [ O-O ] , [ a3 ]  ?! Now we're off the GK database; this move just begs Black to inflict some doubled pawns on the White queenside.
 [ f3 ]  [ B h5 ] , [ B d3 ]  Moving the bishop four times. Obviously not good.
 [ B x c4 ] , [ O-O ]  With a strong queenside presence it makes sense to castle kingside.
 [ c x d4 ]  [ c3 ]  [ d x c3 ]  [ N x c3 ]  [ e5 ]  [ B c4 ] , [ B b4 ]  And with that White immediately gets his gambit pawn back.
 [ N d5 ]  [ Q d6 ]  [ b3 ]  [ N b4 ] , [ B a3 ]  I try to pin his knight.
 [ Q c8 ]  [ Q b5 ]  [ B b4 ]  [ B a3 ]  [ B x a3 ]  [ R x a3 ]  [ Q b8 ] , [ R x a5 ]  Black is free to choose which one he wants to exchange. I should have tried to keep the initiative.
 [ B b5 + ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B x c6 + ] , [ b x c6 ]  Strengthening my center and gaining the bishop pair.
 [ B h3 ] , [ f5 ]  I move my LB over to [ h3 ] and black moves his pawn to f5.
 [ c x d5 ]  [ B x e7 ]  [ Q x e7 ] , [ Q x d5 ]  Now I am up a pawn although he does have two bishops versus my knights.
 [ O-O ]  [ B d2 ]  [ a5 ]  [ B g2 ] , [ h6 ]  [ h6 ] and [ a5 ] this moves are not very active.
 [ d x e5 ]  [ N c e4 ]  [ N d4 ] , [ N x f6 + ]  Capture and check all in one hoping for a quick checkmate.
 [ R g1 ] , [ B x g1 ]  
 [ Q b6 ] , [ N x f8 ]  of course he take it and nothing wrong happens to him...i'm dying
 [ Q d2 ]  [ Q f7 ]  [ B b2 ]  [ R b d8 ] , [ B x g7 + ]  A "Zwinenshoe" or a in-between move
 [ N e3 ]  [ B e6 ] , [ b3 ]  This move acknowledges that I am unable to recover the lost pawn. I was hoping now to complete the development of my queenside and open up some files to bring pressure to bear on Black’s queenside.
 [ B g5 ] , [ N b d7 ]  6...[ e6 ] can also be played here and is more mainline [correct me if I'm wrong] than the move played. However since this move develops a piece and prevents Nakamura from doubling pawns it can hardly be faulted [though it does make it harder for Van Wely to get out his light-square bishop]
 [ K b1 ] , [ R e1 + ]  that rook is really not welcome back here... please move.
 [ e x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ] , [ Q x d4 ]  white is preparing an attack on blacks king
 [ B f8 ]  [ Q h4 ]  [ B g7 ] , [ R h3 ]  The final blow. Cobo's position is now in tatters.
 [ Q x d7 + ]  [ K x d7 ]  [ N a7 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ b4 ]  [ N a4 ] , [ b5 ]  Always PUSH a pass pawn.
 [ c x d4 ] , [ B b6 ]  The best move i guess.
 [ c6 ]  [ N e4 ] , [ N f4 ]  Do I have to worry about him sacrificing the knight on [ h3 ] and swooping down with the bishop and then the queen on g4? My magic 8-ball said "you better believe it!"
 [ N g4 ] , [ R e7 ]  Black defends [ f7 ] because soon the king might have to leave g8.
 [ R g1 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ R h1 ]  [ N f3 + ]  [ K f1 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ R h4 ] , [ g5 ]  giving back the piece. Maybe better was [ h5 ]  [ R x g4 ]  [ h5 ]  [ R x g5 ]  [ h4 ]  [ g x h4 ]  [ Q f6 ]  [ h5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ R f5 ]  [ N h2 + ]  [ K g2 ]  [ Q h4 ]  [ h6 ]  [ N g4 ]  [ Q g3 ] , [ Q x g3 + ]  getting rid of the queen
 [ N c4 ] , [ R f8 ]  This move was the blunder that took away any chance for black to regain any hope of winning. Essentially a premature attack and poor development by Black resulted in a trashing. I am certain a more attacking type player would have finished this game a lot quicker in about 35 moves.
 [ g x f4 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ R d4 ]  [ R a d8 ]  [ R a d1 ]  [ R x d4 ] , [ N x d4 ]  he offered a draw i agreed!
 [ N f6 ]  [ B b5 + ] , [ B d7 ]  This seemed the obvious option to me as it developed my bishop. Using either knight would simply block up my lsb
 [ K h2 ] , [ f4 ]  !! The key move I had in mind since some moves. I think this seals white's fate. Do you agree dear reader?
 [ h x g3 ] , [ Q d4 + ]  This move is strong better than Qxc4. However I don't see something in the continuation of the game
 [ h3 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B x g6 ]  [ h x g6 ]  [ R x c3 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ R c8 + ]  [ K g7 ] , [ N e5 ]  I move that N cause if 30.[ a5 ] [ R x f2 ] and Black takes it.
 [ N b d7 ]  [ Q c2 ]  [ B d6 ] , [ B e2 ]  7. [ B e2 ] - clearing the decks for Henry to go kingside.
 [ N x b2 ] , [ N b1 ]  21.[ K x b2 ] is suicide after 21...[ Q x c3 ] 22.[ K b1 ] dxe5! threatening Ba3.
 [ B d6 ] , [ N e5 ]  The usual response that...
 [ f5 ] , [ N h4 ]  ...but mine must get out of the way...
 [ c x b4 ]  [ B d6 ] , [ N c2 ]  Defending [ b4 ] and clearing [ d4 ] for the King.
 [ d4 ] , [ N f6 ]  OK really my sixth straight annotated game as black. At least this time I'm not playing the Sicilian again. Somethiing fresh the Indian system for a change.
 [ N x c3 ]  [ Q a5 ] , [ d4 ]  Yes now white stands on top but I wasn't going to accept that!
 [ Q e2 ] , [ Q b6 + ]  This check was mainly played to prevent his knight on [ b3 ] getting into the game.
 [ R d7 ]  [ R b2 ]  [ R g d8 ] , [ B e2 ]  Ok I got something out of the situation. But I have to be creative.
 [ B x c3 ] , [ K f2 ]  Simple idea here. If I take the bishop he has a passer up the c file after 28. [ B x c4 ] [ b x c4 ] and my kings in the corner. If I play my king over to protect the bishop after 28. Kf2(Kf3) [ B x e2 ] 29. [ K x e2 ] black has no passer and I've moved my king to center of the board. Black still has a 2 on 1 pawn majority queenside but baby steps for white.
 [ R d1 ] , [ Q c5 ]  or [ Q b4 ] [ N c4 ] [ R e8 ] [ a3 ] Qc5...
 [ a3 ] , [ e5 ]  This is the "Budapest" choice followed by the next...
 [ R f g8 ] , [ R x h7 # ]  Owch. Thanks for looking at this annotating everyone.
 [ N b1 ]  [ b5 ]  [ c x b5 ] , [ a x b5 ]  have to be very careful to avoid the draw or the free a-pawn
 [ Q x d4 ]  [ e x d4 ] , [ R d1 ]  Now i have to be more careful about my pawns I have to get some pawns from him
 [ B x g8 + ]  [ K x g8 ]  [ R e8 + ]  [ K g7 ]  [ Q e7 + ] , [ K g6 ]  Fleeing the King
 [ N x e4 ] , [ e x d6 ]  I bet here that I will have compensatio for the R.
 [ N d2 ]  [ e5 ]  [ d5 ]  [ R d8 ] , [ d6 ]  this stops the threat but the [ [ c5 ] ] pawn is weak. If the knight has to go into service to defend [ [ c5 ] ] the king will be woefully blocked in....
 [ Q d4 + ]  [ Q x d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ K e6 ]  [ K b2 ]  [ K d5 ]  [ K b3 ]  [ K x d4 ]  [ K b4 ]  [ K d5 ]  [ K b5 ]  [ K d6 ]  [ K b6 ]  [ K d7 ]  [ K b7 ]  [ K d6 ]  [ a4 ]  [ K c5 ]  [ a5 ]  [ K b5 ]  [ a6 ]  [ K c5 ]  [ a7 ]  [ K d5 ]  [ a8 = Q ]  [ K d4 ]  [ Q e8 ]  [ K d5 ]  [ Q e3 ]  [ K d6 ]  [ Q e4 ]  [ K c5 ]  [ K c7 ]  [ K b5 ]  [ Q d4 ]  [ K a5 ]  [ K c6 ]  [ K a6 ] , [ Q b6 # ]  The only one out of the group. Good play from my opponent.
 [ B g7 ] , [ N g5 ]  Gives black all kinds of problems to deal with.
 [ g3 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ Q d4 ]  [ f6 ]  [ f3 ]  [ K f7 ]  [ e4 ]  [ K e7 ]  [ K f2 ]  [ Q d6 ]  [ K e3 ]  [ Q x d4 + ] , [ K x d4 ]  Perhaps I shouldn't have allowed the Q swap here but I felt that the more advanced position of my king would give me an advantage.
 [ N c6 ]  [ f4 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ N x c6 ] , [ b x c6 ]  9. ...... [ b x c6 ] - a knight trade which keeps black's pawns doubled on the d column and in addition black is left with an isolani on a7. However white must be careful as a check on [ h4 ] could still potentially cause a few problems.
 [ R b6 + ]  [ K c7 ]  [ R b5 ]  [ K c6 ]  [ R a5 ]  [ g3 ]  [ R a6 + ]  [ K b5 ]  [ R a1 ]  [ g2 ]  [ R g1 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ K c2 ]  [ B x h4 ]  [ K d1 ] , [ B f2 ]  No hope for white.
 [ B d2 ] , [ a5 ]  an unpleasant diversionary tactic that threatens to become a powerful passed pawn if I don't take it. But if I take immediately I was worried by 30. [ b x a5 ] [ Q x c5 ] ...In the cold light of day 31. [ B e3 ] seems an adequate response so perhaps I didn't need to swap rooks after all
 [ B x d2 ] , [ N x d2 ]  This here was silly and I'm a bit surprised computer analysis didn't take any notice of the following move. I had been so focused on the black pawn that I forgot about the newly opened file on D for the Black Queen...
 [ e x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ] , [ f3 ]  A bad mistake by my opponent. Loses the bishop.
 [ e7 ]  [ R b5 ] , [ N f4 ]  After [ N f6 ] [ N x f6 ] [ K x f6 ] [ R b6 ] Black can win both pawns and it's easy win after that.
 [ h4 ]  [ a5 ]  [ a4 ]  [ K c7 ]  [ R g7 ] , [ R f8 ]  See? Black wasted a move.
 [ Q h3 ] , [ R g8 ]  a sort of boring move.
 [ d6 ]  [ c x d6 ]  [ c x d6 ]  [ Q d8 ] , [ Q c4 ]  Nice a chance to get a rock
 [ N b8 ]  [ R h1 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B d2 ]  [ N f d7 ]  [ d4 ]  [ N x c5 ]  [ d x c5 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ R a g1 ]  [ e6 ]  [ K f2 ]  [ N a5 ]  [ b3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N g5 ]  [ h6 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ f5 ]  27. R takes [ g6 ] right away and B is just about cooked
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ] , [ f4 ]  exactly what I would have played: steering at the Grand Prix Attack...
 [ g3 ]  [ Q h5 ]  [ Q x h5 ]  [ N x h5 ]  [ B h3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ d6 ]  [ B x c8 ]  [ R x c8 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ b3 ]  [ h6 ]  [ B b2 ]  [ c6 ]  [ N b d2 ]  [ N h f6 ]  [ K g2 ]  [ R c e8 ]  [ a4 ]  [ a6 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ R a c8 ]  [ a x b5 ] , [ a x b5 ]  Black cannot keep White from opening the a-file but he can make a mess of White’s pawn structure in the process with 18.… [ c x b5 ] 19.[ R x a6 ] [ B x d4 ] 20.[ B x d4 ] [ d5 ] 21.ex[ d5 ] [ R x c2 ] 22.[ N e4 ] Nxd5.
 [ B e7 ]  [ B g2 ] , [ N b4 ]  I decide to take advantage of the fact that [ a3 ] has not been played and hopefully slow my opponent down a little I can castle pretty rapidly if i need to so I'm happy to plough forward a little..
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B f4 ] , [ N d5 ]  Interesting and new but... good?
 [ R c d8 ] , [ R e h1 ]  22. [ R h1 ] - carrying out the first stage of my plan but alas this is how far I get.
 [ R a b8 ]  [ b4 ]  [ Q b6 ]  [ B d5 ]  [ Q c7 ] , [ Q e3 ]  Thinking about [ Q h6 ] and following up with [ R e3 ] and Rh3.
 [ c x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ B x b5 ] , [ N d f6 ]  Avoiding an exchange getoverit moves his N. And this is exactly what I would've also played. However Kanie is still going to exchange the other N. Personally I don't see how this benefits him since that's what he wants. But I can't find anything else for white though.
 [ N h3 ]  [ B h4 + ]  [ N f2 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ R g1 ] , [ Q f6 ]  I don't know why I did this. If White tried to take my bishop with his bishop he'd have the advantage because the rook basically guarantees my queen can't recapture.
 [ R h f1 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ Q h3 ] , [ R x b6 ]  +4!!!!
 [ K f6 ]  [ K e4 ]  [ K e6 ]  [ K d4 ]  [ h5 ]  [ K c4 ]  [ f5 ]  [ K b4 ]  [ R a1 ]  [ K c5 ]  [ g5 ]  [ K b6 ]  [ R b1 + ]  [ K c7 ]  [ R a1 ]  [ R b6 + ]  [ K e5 ]  [ K b7 ]  [ g4 ]  [ R a6 ]  [ R b1 + ]  [ R b6 ]  [ R a1 ]  [ a8 = Q ]  [ R x a8 ]  [ K x a8 ]  [ g x h3 ]  [ g x h3 ]  [ f4 ]  [ R b5 + ]  [ K e4 ]  [ R x h5 ]  [ f3 ]  [ R h8 ]  [ f2 ]  [ R f8 ]  [ K e3 ]  [ h4 ]  [ K e2 ]  [ h5 ]  [ f1 = Q ] , [ R x f1 ]  So there you have it. I'm not proud...but many thanks to Cavendish for this and other very good games!
 [ R f7 ]  [ R d7 ] , [ R x d7 ]  Of course! cxd is followed by [ B f6 ] and all is said...
 [ c5 ] , [ N c4 ]  11. ... [ N d7 ] is a little better.
 [ R c8 ] , [ e5 ]  Forced.
 [ K h8 ] , [ Q f2 ]  The good-looking fork [ N g6 + ] would indeed lose a piece: ...[ K g7 ] and after White notices that the mating thread is still present and opens up space for the king Black eats the knight ...[ K x g6 ]  [ R h1 + ] , [ K g3 ]  Phew only one move left and the time pressure is over finally.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B c4 ] , [ B c5 ]  3. ....... Bc5. The first three moves are those of the Guico Piano. An opening beginners are encouraged to try first. This opening is old and is also played at Expert level at least on Gameknot. It is not seen quite as often at GM level because the Spanish Opening and the Sicilian have dominated things.
 [ N x e2 ] , [ Q x e2 ]  11. [ Q x e2 ] - knight trade.
 [ R f7 ]  [ N d5 + ] , [ K e8 ]  I think this is best e.g. [ K e6 ] looks unpleasant for black after [ B b6 ]  [ b6 ] , [ f5 ]  I dont think this helps black much I was expecting something like [ R e7 ]  [ R c7 ]  [ Q a4 ] , [ g3 ]  Anywhere else and black could get a few more checks in
 [ f x g4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ g3 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ f5 ]  [ Q a5 + ]  [ c3 ] , [ N d7 ]  Knights actually are more valuable than pawns. This sacrifice does not help black.
 [ O-O ] , [ g6 ]  Prophylaxis against possible f4-[ f5 ] with an idea of sending the king "by foot" to [ g7 ] keeping the rook on [ h8 ] moving the h pawn forward and then bringing the other rook to f or e file depending on what the position requires.
 [ R b6 ]  [ B d3 ] , [ e5 ]  [ Q d8 ] is going nowhere fast after [ Q h6 ] [ f5 ] [ Q h5 + ] [ K e7 ] g4!...
 [ Q c7 ]  [ B x e4 ] , [ N b5 ]  Here Bobby misses the win with 12. Qc8+.....Ke7; 13. 0-0-0. Later he told me about his hectic schedule playing 50 board exhibitions every night the past seven days. He simply missed the win. Even after his appearance that night we sat up until 2AM eating pizza and drinking imported black beer.
 [ B e3 ] , [ N b d7 ]  Solid development by Black but [ c5 ] [ e5 ] and [ N c6 ] are more common
 [ g3 ]  [ R f e8 ]  [ f4 ]  [ R b6 ]  [ R d3 ]  [ R e b8 ] , [ R b3 ]  Seeking simplification.Houdini2 prefers [ R d2 ]  [ B x f7 + ]  [ K x f7 ]  [ Q c4 + ]  [ Q d5 ] , [ Q x d5 + ]  ZI didn't see Houdini's suggested 25.[ N d3 ] [ Q x c4 ] 26.Ne5ch [ K f8 ] 27.[ N x c4 ] with a small edge
 [ B x b4 ]  [ R x b4 ] , [ a5 ]  Black desperately tries to create an escape for one of his rooks
 [ N d7 ]  [ B g2 ]  [ R b8 ] , [ Q d2 ]  Stopping the slightly troublesome Bh6.
 [ R h4 ]  [ B g4 ] , [ Q h6 ]  An attempt at an attack...and not a good one - but it forces a tempo loss
 [ R x f8 + ]  [ K x f8 ] , [ Q f3 + ]  Maybe 26. [ Q f5 ] would be more clean-cut but this is enough for me.
 [ d4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ b6 ]  [ e4 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ B b4 + ] , [ c3 ]  [ B b4 + ] allows White to finish building a strong pawn structure in the center while gaining a tempo. It's now up to Black to try to undermine White's center.
 [ B b7 ] , [ N e5 ]  A provocative move threatening [ Q h5 ] ! White does not mind if Black trades one of his Bishops for one of White's powerfully centralized Knights. Let's take a look at some variations. If 9...Bxe5? then 10.[ Q h5 ] ! (zwischenzug) and White recovers the piece with a centralized Queen and a better position since Black is forced to give up castling or weaken his kingside with 10...g6. Also weak is 9...Bxe4? 10.[ B x e4 ] where Black has parted with his fianchettoed Bishop along with his light squares. The Rook on [ a8 ] is attacked making 10...[ [ d5 ] ] absolutely forced. Other blocking moves are worse; 10...[ c6 ] is inadequate in light of 11.[ Q d3 ] [ g6 ] 12.h4! (12...Bxh4?? 13.Bx[ g6 ] ! is crushing); and of course not 10...Nc6?? 11.Nx[ c6 ] dc 12.Bx[ c6 ] and White wins. Returning to 10...[ [ d5 ] ] White simply plays 11.[ B d3 ] with a clear advantage due to the backward e-pawn and the outpost square on e5.
 [ B d7 ] , [ B f4 ]  Fritz's number one pick with the threat of [ N b5 ] to be considered.
 [ a3 ] , [ R d4 ]  Now the pawn.
 [ N f4 ] , [ B a5 ]  i wanted to eat horsie
 [ B b7 ] , [ f6 ]  Black's light bishop moves to [ f7 ] possibly protecting rook and attacking knight at e4. Pushing f file pawn forking pawn and bishop.
 [ d5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ e4 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ N g5 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ B x f7 + ]  [ K d7 ]  [ Q x g4 + ]  [ N x g4 ]  [ B e6 + ]  [ K c6 ]  [ B x g4 ] , [ Q e8 ]  9. ....... [ Q e8 ] - Hmm I played this against Master Freddy and came to grief so after that I decided to play either [ e5 ] or [ e6 ] here.
 [ K e1 ] , [ R x d4 ]  Maybe there were better moves but I found this the most crushing. Any moves other than [ Q x f8 ] and [ Q h3 ] lead to quick checkmates. Maybe even [ Q g7 + ] stops a quick checkmate as well. I did not see/consider [ Q x f8 ] and [ Q g7 ] as viable options for him since they would mean surrendering his queen and/or resigning.
 [ O-O ] , [ N h6 ]  This move gets an !? This move opens the possibilities of ...[ f6 ] and ...[ N f7 ] or even ...f5. Today normal might be 6...[ Q c7 ] 7.[ a4 ] Ng[ f6 ] 8.[ h3 ] 0-0 as in Topalov-Rauschenbach frankfurt (Rapid) 1997.
 [ B x e4 ]  [ B x g5 ] , [ Q h5 ]  Threatening Checkmate!
 [ Q e3 ]  [ Q d8 ] , [ h x g6 ]  Thank you white
 [ Q e7 ]  [ c5 ]  [ b x c5 ]  [ R x c5 ]  [ f5 ]  [ Q e5 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ R c7 ]  [ Q f8 ] , [ B c4 ]  the mate is near...
 [ N f3 ]  [ B x f3 ] , [ g x f3 ]  [ R x f3 ] loses so [ g x f3 ] is correct. He still has 1 minute on his clock due to time increments.
 [ f5 ]  [ e x f5 ] , [ g x f5 ]  Opening the g-column for the rook (in a future possibility). Maybe [ e x f5 ] was better since it activates white´s bishop but it did not seem clear to me.
 [ B d3 ]  [ B g6 ] , [ b4 ]  White chooses to attack earky. Ok.
 [ O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ B e3 ] , [ B b7 ]  One of the key differences with the ..[ B e7 ] lines. Its a matter of taste. This way black is directly supporting ..[ d5 ] and save a tempo over playing ..[ d6 ] first
 [ N c6 ] , [ B g2 ]  Started developing with [ B g2 ]  [ e5 ]  [ c4 ]  [ d6 ]  [ e4 ] , [ N f6 ]  At this point my opponent is trying to control center with knights
 [ c6 ]  [ R a5 ] , [ Q d8 ]  Targeting [ d4 ] and I have a ready answer since 16.[ R a4 ] was also the equivalent to a conditional move.
 [ Q d6 ] , [ R f3 ]  To cover [ Q a3 ] or counter it with [ R g3 ] with mate threat then we'll see.
 [ N e7 ] , [ Q g4 ]  Main line. Queen comes out early in a modern style.
 [ R x e8 ]  [ K d1 ]  [ f x e4 ] , [ R a3 ]  White is up the Exchange and a pawn but how will he survive? The text bluntly introduces the [ a1 ] rook into defense.
 [ d4 ] , [ e6 ]  [ c x d4 ] is more logical ...
 [ Q x f2 ]  [ B x f2 ]  [ N g2 ] , [ K g7 ]  Moving the king closer to the action and planning to break up white's k-side pawns with f5.+0-22. Houdini also considers 29....[ f5 ] +0.22 and 29....k[ f8 ] +0.24
 [ a4 ] , [ B e5 ]  Pressuring [ g7 ] as obvious.
 [ b6 ]  [ a x b6 ]  [ R x b6 ]  [ Q a3 ] , [ R f b8 ]  Now attacking my other weakness [ b3 ]  [ R f b1 ] , [ N f5 ]  Taking control of the weak squares
 [ B x a2 ] , [ b3 ]  And then I realized he wanted me to do [ B x a2 ] also. Drat.
 [ K x h5 ]  [ b2 ]  [ g6 ]  [ b1 = Q ] , [ g7 ]  As now thinking about what happened against anitam and the decisive mistake after throwing away a win that turned a draw into loss I go forward with my pawn. If Carl doesn't do something to stop [ g7 ] I'll have a win. But if he does I'll be able to get a draw since I know Carl and he'll continue to throw in perpetual checks until it's a 3 fold repetition which was my goal due to how little time I have. As a matter of fact this is the first time that I've made what Jack calls "a 2 second move" since 17.Nxe4? However it has to be like this for the rest of the game as I only had 10 minutes left at most. The last time something like this happened I lost on time. It was against Mariann a number of years where I was winning although we played it out and I would've lost anyhow with a blunder. But this is where I realized that I could not win but at best could get a draw. And I was confident that I would get one since Carl enjoys perpetual checks.
 [ d5 ]  [ b5 ]  [ B x a5 ]  [ b x c4 ]  [ B x d8 ]  [ R x d8 ] , [ b x c4 ]  Now white has got a connected free-pawn in the centre
 [ R e c1 ] , [ N x a3 ]  To take a pawn but I should probably have plaid 30. [ B d4 ] to keep the center complicated and protect f5. Probably Perceval's morale was no more sufficient to properly fight.
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e3 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ b3 ]  [ e6 ] , [ B b2 ]  I've been experimenting with the Zukertort-type setup.
 [ Q x e8 + ]  [ K g7 ] , [ g5 ]  And with that I attack Carl's B again because of what I can and will do when he takes. And it's more then just exchanging pawns.
 [ R a c1 ]  [ b6 ] , [ B g5 ]  Other moves that have been played more often here include 15. [ b3 ] [ B b1 ] and Qe3. It appears we are now out of book...
 [ K g2 ]  [ g5 ]  [ h3 ]  [ K f8 ]  [ K f2 ]  [ g x f4 ]  [ g x f4 ]  [ f6 ]  [ K e3 ]  [ B g6 ] , [ B d4 ]  With this move White commences a plan of going after the black h-pawn.
 [ N d5 ]  [ Q c6 ] , [ Q c4 ]  Re-extending the invitation ...to get a quick lead in development.
 [ B e3 ]  [ R d e8 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ R d8 ]  [ c4 ]  [ R d e8 ]  [ K e2 ] , [ R f8 ]  Black really loves moving that rook doesn't he?
 [ R x e8 ]  [ R x e8 ]  [ Q c6 + ] , [ K a6 ]  And white loses his chances to recover the pawn.
 [ N x d5 ]  [ Q x a7 + ]  [ K e6 ]  [ c4 ] , [ B d3 ]  White will be happy to trade knight for pawn. KxP[ d5 ] QxPf7+...
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B c4 ] , [ B e7 ]  This is how he usually responds. Now I was thinking about what I could do to create a threat by bringing my N to [ g5 ] which Jack showed in terms of what most players do. And in fact upon walking away from the Spanish Opening that's what got me into the Guaco Piano. But before I get into it I decide to castle once and for all since I like to do these things early. The only time I hold off is when I see something better immediately like winning a piece. Or if someone has a threat against me.
 [ h3 ]  [ B d5 ] , [ Q a5 ]  Leaves the 2nd rank ungaurded.
 [ R h f1 ] , [ N g8 ]  ...even when I do this. I'm up a Pawn but White seems to have the initiative.
 [ d6 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ d x e5 ] , [ N x e5 ]  Now White is only slightly better after 8... Nd7. If 8... [ Q x d4 ] then White has a better position after 9. [ N d f3 ] or 9. Qe2.
 [ N x e7 + ]  [ K h8 ]  [ N g6 + ]  [ K g8 ]  [ N x f8 ]  [ Q x f8 ]  [ B c4 + ]  [ K h8 ]  [ h4 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ B c3 ]  preparing possible h:[ g4 ] and R: h6.
 [ N x e4 + ]  [ R x e4 ]  [ R c7 ]  [ g3 ]  [ K f7 ] , [ R a4 ]  provoking a weakness
 [ h6 ]  [ R x a5 ] , [ K g7 ]  I needed my pawns up a few more squares. I needed to sit back and think earlier. Look at the bigger pictures rather than having gotten blinded by looking at pieces only. I needed to ponder the board and all the places where there were no pieces but territory that needed to be crossed quickly.
 [ N c2 ] , [ N d4 ]  And we both get our wish...
 [ B d7 ]  [ R e1 ] , [ R f e8 ]  17...[ R f e8 ] contesting the efile. Also preparing [ f8 ] for the bishopin the event of a white incursion into f5. Its about here that I decided I might have the possibility to win against Jo so I decided to switch from a fast moving tempo to correspondence mode like my esteemed opponent. Though the position looks potentially drawish : (fixed & symetrical pawn positions equal centre control safe k positions and equally contested e file with potential multiple Rook exchanges). We do have a minor piece imbalance. N/B V Bishop pair though the fixed centre tends to balance them out. Blacks plan will be to try and provoke weakness on both sides of the board in the hope of utilizing his B pair. Whites plan to exchange down to a Q/N v Q/B ending where white has the superior piece combination.
 [ R d1 ]  [ R d8 ] , [ R a d3 ]  Here comes the battering ram - will he crash through and take my kingdom?
 [ Q e2 ] , [ N x c3 ]  In the process a pawn got down I got to recover it or I have to attack with the remaining pieces. This stage I'm bit nervous.
 [ B e6 ] , [ B e3 ]  [ B g5 ] [ h6 ] [ B e3 ] is almost the same
 [ R x c4 ]  [ Q x c4 ]  [ K x g7 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ K h7 ]  [ R c d1 ] , [ R b7 ]  forced but black's pieces have bad coordination so maybe I can force some win here
 [ b x c6 ]  [ Q f3 ] , [ Q a5 ]  With equality slipping out of blacks hands he has to try and create a sense of imbalance or complications. In truth black is seriously behind in development and as a result can not create an serious threat. To me this feels like I am bear and my supposed hunter is trying to slay me with a pellet gun.
 [ d5 ]  [ R x h7 ]  [ d x e6 + ]  [ K x e6 ] , [ R x h7 ]  Nonsense but the game is lost anyway.
 [ K h8 ] , [ R x c6 ]  !A tactic that even material equality.
 [ Q e3 ]  [ Q x d3 ] , [ R b d1 ]  allowing an elegant finish but white should lose anyway a piece and a pawn down.
 [ R x g1 ]  [ Q f3 + ]  [ R g2 ] , [ Q x g2 # ]  # It was a really wonderful game I thank chessmeastro for this excellent chance to play with him. I hope that it was as amusing to you all please feel free to PM me any comments you have in mind cheers himu (himadri mukherjee)
 [ B x e6 ]  [ Q e7 ] , [ N d5 ]  Why not bring another piece into the attack.
 [ N f5 ] , [ B f6 ]  Computer suggests awkward moves like …[ R h7 ] or …Kf8.
 [ B b2 ] , [ d6 ]  Consolidating the central pawn formation.
 [ N c6 ] , [ N c3 ]  White develops an extra piece. Black's attack is shattered.
 [ Q e1 ]  [ Q c5 ]  [ N e4 ] , [ Q x c2 ]  Finally winning a pawn but that was incidental; the real goal is squashing all counter play and continuing to overwhem the center.
 [ R h6 ] , [ B g5 ]  Only one square for the rook to go too now.
 [ B h5 ] , [ B a4 ]  we both try to keep the pins.
 [ B e2 ]  [ R f b1 ]  [ B x f2 + ]  [ K h1 ]  [ g5 ] , [ b4 ]  24. [ b4 ] - three moves too late.
 [ Q x e4 + ] , [ Q e2 ]  ..forced.
 [ K b3 ]  [ N c5 + ]  [ B x c5 ] , [ R f3 + ]  41. ... [ b x c5 ] 42. [ R x c5 ] [ R f3 + ]  [ K a4 ]  [ b x c5 ]  [ R x c5 ]  [ R c3 ]  [ K x a5 ]  [ R x a3 + ]  [ K b6 ]  [ R c3 ]  [ R c7 + ]  [ K g8 ]  [ c5 ]  [ R b3 + ] , [ K a7 ]  All is tidied up. Now for the closure 48. [ K c6 ] [ f5 ] leads to complications...
 [ R b1 b5 ] , [ Q c6 ]  or 33 [ f4 ] getting the pawn majority moving
 [ R g8 ] , [ f4 ]  Delicate moment. Black can have counterplay with that column.
 [ b4 ]  [ B c7 ]  [ B x f5 ]  [ e x f5 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ d x c6 ]  [ b x c6 ]  [ d5 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ e4 ]  [ f4 ]  [ N e2 ]  [ Q d8 ]  [ Q c3 ]  [ B e5 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ f6 ]  [ N x d7 ]  [ N x d7 ]  [ d x c6 ]  [ R x e4 ]  [ c x d7 ]  [ R a7 ]  [ Q c8 ]  [ Q x c8 ]  [ d x c8 = Q + ]  [ K h7 ] , [ Q f5 + ]  
 [ O-O ] , [ N f8 ]  So I decide to regroup on the kingside and try to get some fireworks happening there.
 [ e4 ] , [ Q b5 ]  The queen is the only piece playing except for the rook defending d3.
 [ K b6 ] , [ R b1 + ]  and a draw finally agreed. By the time I got home my dear lady was asleep! Thanks for looking at my annotation. Please leave comments and don't forget to rate my annotation. Many thanks!
 [ N x e7 ] , [ B x e7 ]  White was probably hoping for ...[ Q x e7 ] but this will do
 [ R x e5 ]  [ R x e5 ] , [ B x e5 ]  Removed some pressure and got rid of his rook which was partially defending the kingside and displaced his bishop which is at least for now an easy target
 [ B x e1 ]  [ N x d3 ]  [ Q x b6 ] , [ R x e1 ]  Not a wonderful outcome! It could be worse.
 [ N f6 + ]  [ B x f6 ] , [ g x f6 ]  I keep more chances with the queen on the board. I am threatening [ Q g7 # ] soon.
 [ R e3 ]  [ R f8 ] , [ R g3 ]  Now the pressure is just too much
 [ d5 ] , [ e x d5 ]  Opening the way for my queen.
 [ g5 ]  [ K c6 ]  [ K g6 ]  [ K d5 ] , [ K f5 ]  These last two moves really weakened my score on GK analysis. Maybe it is because it looks even more like a draw with the kings in this position.
 [ N f4 ]  [ N x d7 ]  [ N x e2 ]  [ Q x g7 ]  [ K x d7 ]  [ Q g4 + ]  [ K c7 ] , [ Q x e2 ]  Whites manoeuvres have netted two pawns and the king can still castle.
 [ B x f6 ]  [ g x f6 ]  [ B c4 ] , [ B f7 ]  Not quite sure why I did this. Perhaps I was uncomfortable with the bishop dangling defenselessly at [ e6 ] while his knight was in a fairly offensive position?
 [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ] , [ c x d5 ]  The exchange of pawns was pretty obvious.
 [ Q e7 ] , [ d3 ]  Creating an escape route for my King.
 [ Q a1 + ]  [ K g2 ] , [ B f8 ]  Black is lost at this point in my opinion.
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ g6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ d5 ]  Switching gears and keeping me guessing.....I assumed the [ d6 ] KID line was coming. What to do what to do........
 [ a5 ]  [ Q e2 ]  [ a4 ]  [ f4 ] , [ d5 ]  The center is potentially troublesome but worth considering is exf as I think my hold on [ f5 ] must be wrestled with sooner or later.
 [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ B b5 ]  Was this OK?
 [ B x e2 ]  [ N c2 ] , [ B d3 ]  Somehow I played this instead of my first plan 26...Bc4.. Note that if I'd played 26...[ B c4 ] White cannot defend the pawn with 27.Nb4? because of 27...[ a5 ] when the knight has to leave the pawn undefended.
 [ b4 ] , [ B b2 ]  ? [ B e5 ] threatening [ B d6 ] was much better. Not because on disadvantage you shouldn't threat the most with your pieces
 [ K e4 ]  [ K e7 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ K d6 ]  [ R f1 ]  [ B d8 ] , [ B f7 ]  aiming at [ g6 ] to cut of communication between my pieces.
 [ B x g3 ] , [ R b3 ]  Rb3???? This move loses the game. He tries to overload my defense on the e pawn but...
 [ K f3 ]  [ R d5 ]  [ R x d5 ] , [ K x d5 ]  White is lost now as there is nonway he can prevent the black king from eating his pawns
 [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ N x c6 ]  [ b x c6 ]  [ O-O ] , [ d5 ]  Maybe I should have played ...[ a6 ] first. What follows although not frightening was not exactly what I had in mind.
 [ c x b4 ]  [ c x b4 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ N d6 ]  [ f5 ]  [ a5 ]  [ N c8 ]  [ N x b7 ]  [ Q x b7 ]  [ a6 ]  [ Q f7 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ N c8 e7 ] , [ O-O ]  Finally to arm the "gun"
 [ N f3 ]  [ N g f6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ a6 ] , [ B e2 ]  Alternative: [ B x d7 + ] [ Q x d7 ] [ d4 ] cx[ d4 ] Qx[ d4 ] e5. I didn't want to trade off my bishop just yet though.
 [ f x e4 ]  [ c x b7 ] , [ B x b7 ]  It seems that I may have escaped just a pawn down (and certainly positionally worse) I was envisioning much worse. White is still certainly better but Black hasn't quite given up hope yet.
 [ R x d4 ]  [ N e7 + ]  [ K f7 ] , [ N c6 ]  attacking the [ a7 ] pawn and the black rook
 [ B e3 ] , [ a x b4 ]  I have no idea why I played this move if I was playing this game over I would play 24. ... [ [ a4 ] ] instead ten White would have to defend the a-File. Perhaps I wanted to exchange Rooks. I still think 24. ... [ [ a4 ] ] would have been better though.
 [ e4 ] , [ c5 ]  Normally I reply with 1... P-[ K4 ] but every now and again I play the Sicilian. Variety is the spice of life after all.
 [ Q f4 ]  [ Q e2 + ]  [ K g3 ]  [ R x h5 ]  [ R g2 ]  [ Q e1 + ] , [ R f2 ]  ? Allows mate or even [ N e7 + ] forking K and Q. The mate is 28. [ R f2 ] [ Q g1 + ] 29. [ R g2 ] [ N e2 + ] 30. [ K f3 ] [ Q f1 + ] 31. [ K e3 ] [ N x f4 ] 32. [ R f2 ] [ N g2 + ] 33. [ K f3 ] [ R d3 + ] 34. [ B e3 ] [ R x e3 # ]  [ N d4 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ c3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ Q h5 ]  Trying to mate à la scholar and/or winning the [ c5 ] pawn
 [ b6 ] , [ N a4 ]  If he hadn't castled I would have been guaranteed a high-value piece. now I'm just threatening the queen... Note the knight moving and guarding in one...
 [ e x d3 ]  [ g x f8 = Q + ]  [ K x f8 ]  [ B h6 + ]  [ K e8 ]  [ c x d3 ]  [ R c8 ] , [ K b1 ]  26. [ K b1 ] - I just had to get Henry out of the threatened discovery else he would become a widower because that light squared bishop that I talked about in a previous note woud play [ B x f3 ] and I would have to get Henry off the c file and abandon Glenda to her fate. Moving Henry onto the d file was probably no better as the Wicked Witch would simply snap off my b pawn.
 [ K g8 ] , [ K e5 ]  getting away from the pin.
 [ b4 ] , [ B b6 ]  Another forcing move his other bishop has to retreat as well. Meanwhile I’m gaining space on the queen-side while threatening his knight on [ c6 ] if I decide to push this pawn again.
 [ N f2 ] , [ K c2 ]  The king is really strong there
 [ f5 ]  [ R h4 ]  [ Q f3 ] , [ B e8 ]  20.[ f x e6 ] Bh5_21.[ Q f5 ] g6_22.[ Q [ f7 ] + ] (and a bishop or a knight on [ f7 ] perhaps but one again it am not able to visualize 2 moves and a half)
 [ R x d1 ]  [ R x d1 ]  [ c5 ] , [ B d5 ]  Cenralizing the B.
 [ K d1 ]  [ R g4 ]  [ K c2 ]  [ R x h4 ] , [ R x g7 ]  I didn't want to allow connected passed pawns so I thought I'd just take out [ g7 ] first
 [ N c6 ]  [ N g3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ B e2 ] , [ B g7 ]  Now black took complete control of the [ d4 ] and [ e5 ] squares this is due to the loss of a tempo by the white with his knight moving twice in the opening a general guidline that's usually true is not to move a piece twice in the opening unless you have to!
 [ B d2 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ N x d4 ] , [ B x d4 ]  Black trying to put some pressure on White whose position is generally pretty well defended.
 [ N c e2 ] , [ K h8 ]  Defensive move. The real plan behind [ N c e2 ] is [ N d4 ] as I previously said. But this moves also make it possible to threaten [ B b4 ] : the queen has to leave [ [ d6 ] ] and then [ [ d6 ] ] wins the rook if the remains on the direction of the bishop b3.
 [ N f4 ]  [ N e3 + ] , [ R x e3 ]  
 [ K x e2 ] , [ Q a6 + ]  Logical. The black queen moves to a white diagonal. Note how much control black has over the crucial [ d3 ] square.
 [ O-O ]  [ B b2 ] , [ a5 ]  My plan is obvious: gain space on the queenside and break open either the a or c file.
 [ B h3 ] , [ g6 ]  White's LB moved to [ h3 ] and I pushed g pawn to stop progress of [ g5 ] pawn.
 [ B e1 ] , [ B e6 ]  This indirectly eyes [ b3 ] because Black might play [ b6 ] and [ b x c5 ] and if then [ d x c5 ] then the move [ d4 ] becomes strong for Black. If 18. [ Q c2 ] [ N b d7 ] 19. [ N f3 ] [ b6 ]  [ R g1 ] , [ a4 ]  Or 19... [ [ b6 ] ] 19... [ R f e8 ] or 19... Ne4. White can hold out best with 20. [ b4 ] a3. Now if play were to continue 21. [ Q a2 ] [ N [ e4 ] ] 22. [ R d3 ] [ [ b6 ] ] 23. [ R x a3 ] [ Q b7 ] 24. [ N h4 ] [ b x c5 ] 25. [ b x c5 ] [ R x a3 ] 26. [ Q x a3 ] [ R a8 ] 27. [ Q b2 ] [ Q a6 ] 28. [ B x [ e4 ] ] [ d x [ e4 ] ] 29. [ B c3 ] [ R b8 ] 30. [ Q c2 ] [ B b3 ] 31. [ Q x [ e4 ] ] [ Q x e2 ] 32. [ R e1 ] [ Q c4 ] 33. [ K d2 ] [ N x c5 ] 34. [ Q b1 ] (34. [ d x c5 ] Qxe4) 34... [ Q d5 ] 35. [ e4 ] [ Q g5 + ] 36. [ R e3 ] [ Q x h4 ] 37. [ Q e1 ] (37. [ d x c5 ] Qf2+) 37... Qd8.
 [ N e2 ] , [ B b6 ]  Provided I make no more blunders I finally have a small advantage now.
 [ R a c1 ] , [ b5 ]  and the last blunder black last try to resist will leave his to his doom he missed whites last move .
 [ c x b7 + ]  [ K b8 ] , [ e3 ]  Not only to defend the pawn but to give my bishop access to defend d1.
 [ e5 ] , [ f4 ]  2. [ f4 ] - after a double king pawn opening we have the King's Gambit of which I accept.
 [ Q x d5 ] , [ Q f3 ]  Oh come on! What next? A draw offer? I think that OTB I'd probably punt for 5. ... [ c6 ] because if White exchanges the pawn structure is like an exchange Caro-Kann and I can develop the [ B c8 ] before playing ... e6. Instead however I made the fatal error of looking at the database and went for
 [ R x d5 ] , [ c x d5 ]  Not that white had any further winning/drawing chances without serious blunders by black but trading his last piece with 29. Rxd5? is definitely the final nail in white's coffin.
 [ f4 ] , [ c5 ]  I always like to move the c-pawn before the knight if I can.
 [ N c3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ f3 ]  [ N a5 ]  [ e4 ] , [ N b3 ]  no one likes losing a Rook and this time he did as expected. and i did not need my bishop anymore but i don't think he saw that.
 [ f3 ]  [ R d8 ]  [ d6 ]  [ e4 ]  [ R h e1 ]  [ e x f3 ]  [ g x f3 ]  [ N b d7 ]  [ Q a3 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ R a c1 ]  [ N b6 ] , [ Q b4 ]  Probably better than [ Q b4 ] was to occupy the 7th rank but after Black replies [ R d7 ] nothing is really achieved although [ Q b4 ] doesn't really achieve anything and maybe is a waste of time?
 [ R f e1 ] , [ B a6 ]  even if the rook is not there any more the position for the bishop is perfect
 [ b4 ] , [ N e4 ]  Trading is bad for you as you are too far behind in material. So I attack the bishop to see if you will defend it. To keep it you need to move it instead.
 [ R x f8 ]  [ B c4 ] , [ c6 ]  13. ..... [ [ c6 ] ] - I do however play [ [ c6 ] ] before launching that combo first. This is a multi- purpose pawn move. It frees up [ c7 ] for Henry so that I can castle queenside by hand and it stops Ion from posting a knight on [ d5 ] or b5.
 [ K f7 ] , [ Q x a7 ]  Black now has a material disadvantage so he is obliged to create activity in order to gain compensation. I achieved this by creating a series of threats as follows:
 [ c3 ]  [ R d8 ] , [ Q e4 ]  Adding a second attacker to [ c6 ] and threatening to win the pawn.
 [ g5 ]  [ K f3 ] , [ h5 ]  This is a poor move. Black had the opportunity to oppose the white king with 43...[ K f5 ] forcing him to take a side (possibly after 44. [ [ h4 ] ] [ [ g4 ] ] or 44. [ h3 ] [ h5 ] 45. [ [ h4 ] ] [ [ g4 ] ] which would allow the black king to advance
 [ B c7 ]  [ a6 ] , [ B b8 ]  Trying to stop the a-pawn queening
 [ Q d8 ]  [ b x c5 ]  [ Q a5 + ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ a6 ] , [ Q x a5 ]  ...[ Q x d2 ] [ K x d2 ] was probably ugly looking but better than the text. Gameknot analysis Inaccuracy: +1.58 » 16.

 [ N f3 ]  [ e4 ]  [ N e1 ]  [ e x d3 ]  [ Q x d3 ] , [ a5 ]  ! An important insurance move for Black conceived on move 9 for upon b5-a6x Black's white square bishop threatens a nasty pin and Black has the a-file all to himself. Anything else and Black can castle Queen side without ever having to worry about a pawn storm from White -- his pawn structure is impervious and White's b-pawn is blocking [ a6 ] (even White's knights cannot land there). This move seems to guarantee Black's future.
 [ R f d8 ]  [ N h g4 ] , [ R d2 ]  Game note: “24...[ R d2 ] is a powerful post but dangerous on account of discovered attack from his DSB.”
 [ R x b1 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ K f7 ]  [ B b4 ]  [ R d1 ]  [ B e1 ] , [ b1 = Q ]  After Jack Queens however we both agreed on resignation. For one thing in addition to what I mentioned resignation generally didn't happen until mate could be forced since easy19 continued that game where I resigned before mate was proven. But after showing my loss against reversion he did not question it so things have changed. And in this position I figured that mate was soon to follow after 44...[ Q c2 + ] but after getting out of check it'd still take longer. What can be agreed on however is that there is nothing else to learn here. Right after this game was finished and in the Men's Room while we were saying goodbye to each other for the week the game was discussed with two things learned. But one of the things he said (which is the more important) is the moral of the game. First in general you should keep the Rooks together as opposed to seperating them. He said that I got myself in trouble by isolating both rooks. In general that's true but after analyzing it here I realized that it's not in the context of this game. Because after those variations I still have a manageable position. Second but more importantly (the lesson) is to slow down in the endgame. In it he said that I could sometimes wiggle my way out of a mistake in the midgame. But in the endgame however one mistake will often make or break it. This makes sense to me because as shamash put it "The endgame is your ability to play chess." I can relate to that due to what I studied in understanding how to mate with your Knight and Bishop. For one thing you must play accurately in the N+B+K mate to win. If you blunder it will most likely end in a draw. This happened to me for months before becoming second nature. Second during that time in the second to fourth times that I retook the quiz after failing the first time I still didn't pass due to moving too quickly. It took time before realizing that I had to slow down in order to become familiar with the concepts. In doing so things started making sense and I was able to pass the quiz understand the fundamentals and use it to explain in previous annotations. Well the same thing is true in endgames like this because you must go slower and concentrate more then the middle game to hold the position and even win. Failing to do so is what led to my downfall.

 [ Q b3 ] , [ Q d7 ]  We both defend our bishops each waiting to see who's going to exchange first.
 [ Q a5 ] , [ N x d4 ]  Material equality.
 [ g x f4 ]  [ R d5 ]  [ K g7 ]  [ R f5 ]  [ R a4 ] , [ K b5 ]  Clearly the only hope.
 [ c x d5 ]  [ d6 ]  [ O-O ] , [ c5 ]  Transposed into A60: Benoni: 4.[ N c3 ] [ e x d5 ] 5.[ c x d5 ] [ d6 ]  [ f4 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ B f3 ] , [ a6 ]  +0.08/28 14. ... [ a6 ] 15.[ a4 ] [ c4 ] 16.[ B e2 ] [ Q c7 ] 17.[ a5 ] [ B f6 ] 18.[ B d2 ] [ b5 ] 19.[ a x b6 ] [ N x b6 ] 20.[ Q c2 ] [ R b8 ] 21.[ R f e1 ] [ B b7 ] 22.[ e4 ] [ B d4 + ] 23.[ K h1 ] [ N d7 ] 24.[ B f3 ] [ N c5 ]  [ a4 ]  [ c4 ]  [ Q e2 ] , [ N c5 ]  +0.04/27 16. ... [ N c5 ] 17.[ Q x c4 ] [ B f6 ] 18.[ R a3 ] [ B d7 ] 19.[ a5 ] [ R c8 ] 20.[ Q a2 ] [ B f5 ] 21.[ B d2 ] [ Q d7 ] 22.[ b4 ] [ N e4 ] 23.[ N x e4 ] [ R x e4 ] 24.[ B e2 ] [ R e e8 ] 25.[ B d3 ] [ B x d3 ] 26.[ R x d3 ] [ Q b5 ] 27.[ Q b1 ] [ h6 ] 28.[ R c1 ] [ R x c1 + ] 29.[ B x c1 ] [ Q c4 ] 30.[ B d2 ] [ R c8 ] Offering the pawn on c4.
 [ B c4 ] , [ b5 ]  Finally begining his counter attack white has lost his advantage both sides are equal at this point.
 [ g x h5 ] , [ K x h5 ]  If I only had my h pawn and no other pawns were on the board this would be a stalemate. However the extra pawns give me the advantage I need.
 [ K h2 ]  [ R a1 ]  [ R x b6 ]  [ R x a3 ] , [ R b8 + ]  And with white having 5 seconds left I resign here. Mate in one is unavoidable now but was preventable 2X.
 [ g x f3 ]  [ d4 ]  [ f x g2 ] , [ B x f7 + ]  Another sacrifice!
 [ B d2 ]  [ B b4 ] , [ c3 ]  now I have a tempo on [ b2 ] soon.
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ d5 ]  My opponent is supposed to respond K-c6. I know that opening. Now I'm lost I really need to study openings.
 [ b5 ] , [ a3 ]  No you won't pass so easily.
 [ N x d4 ] , [ B x d4 ]  Now I must protect Pg7.
 [ N d2 ] , [ R e f8 ]  Ok I admit it this is a very passive move. I had this lurking fear of some dangerous tactics heading towards my [ f7 ] pawn.
 [ N x b3 ] , [ N x c7 ]  Expected exchanges.
 [ N g6 ] , [ B d4 ]  Accepting some exchanges but White's dark square grip persists. In contrast 15 [ B x g6 ] gives black too much counterplay along the half-open f-file.
 [ d5 ] , [ c4 ]  actually arriving here mabar is playing with white one of my favorite start...
 [ N e7 ] , [ N d6 ]  Black's queen can safely move to only [ d8 ] and b8.
 [ Q x g3 + ]  [ K x g3 ] , [ c3 ]  Back to the pawn storm
 [ O-O ] , [ N f3 ]  Better was to develop [ N d2 ] for instance. I was looking for the black squares.
 [ e x d5 ]  [ c x d5 ] , [ B b3 ]  ??
 [ Q b6 ]  [ N x c6 ]  [ B x c6 ] , [ Q h3 ]  Keeping pressure on black's kingside pawns while clearing a way for a rook on the half-open d-file.
 [ d4 ] , [ Q x a3 ]  Uh oh white is threatening my pawn at [ e5 ] (36. Px[ e5 ] Pxe5? 37. Qx[ e5 ] and white gains a pawn forks both rooks and forces black to get back on defense). But worse he's threatening 36. Rb1! skewering the black queen against the [ b7 ] pawn. After 36. ... [ Q x [ a3 ] ] 37. Qx[ b7 ] Kmoves 38. [ Q b8 ] Kmoves 39. [ Q x h8 ] and now white is right back in the game material is even and black's kingside is going to crumble as the white queen attacks it from the rear. I search around for the move that prevents both eventualities but there is none. So I take the [ a3 ] pawn extending my material lead to a knight and 2 pawns knowing I will lose a pawn in the center and have to run back on defense.
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B c4 ] , [ Q f6 ]  I was certainly aware by now of his tendency to attack hard and fast.
 [ b x c6 ] , [ N x e5 ]  Threatens the [ c6 ] pawn
 [ B f4 ]  [ N c5 ]  [ R a e1 ] , [ g5 ]  Black drives the Bishop away.
 [ N x g5 ] , [ B b7 ]  double fianchetto ... at this time the game is a fine mess for black and for white but this is the way of playing grob never easy always risky !
 [ B d7 ]  [ R c1 ]  [ O-O-O ]  [ N a3 ] , [ a6 ]  Black needs to prevent the White's knight from reaching the [ b5 ] square.
 [ K g3 ]  [ Q d3 + ]  [ K g2 ]  [ Q e2 + ]  [ K g3 ]  [ Q h2 + ]  [ K f3 ] , [ R f8 ]  Wins the Queen. But Janowski still has drawing chances.
 [ K h2 ] , [ Q c2 ]  20. ... [ Q c2 ] ! Rush attack
 [ g4 ] , [ e5 ]  I take advantage of the fact that the knight must retire far from the action on b3. Better than nothing.
 [ b x c4 + ]  [ K x c4 ]  [ R a6 ]  [ R a3 ]  [ K b6 ] , [ K b4 ]  ? I think trying for a queen side break would be better here say [ f4 ] so [ R a5 ] doesn't come with tempo.
 [ R f8 ] , [ N d6 ]  Here I was thinking of either forcing an exchange knight for bishop and then gobbling up the doubled up pawns with my rook or.. letting black move [ B d5 ] and then moving [ e4 ]  [ B d3 ] , [ R c6 ]  Defending an eventual attack on the knight and also putting pressure on blacks pawns forcing him to occupy his rook with defensive tasks.
 [ B e7 ]  [ b4 ] , [ c6 ]  26. …… c6? - So Joe gives Glenda another pawn to turn into dust - wowee!
 [ g4 ]  [ a5 ] , [ K b1 ]  ? At this point resignation seems to be the best option. The game is straightforward from here
 [ c4 ]  [ h6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ N g6 ]  A mistake allowing the kingside to be destroyed.
 [ d x e5 ]  [ f x e5 ]  [ Q e6 ]  [ R g3 ]  [ b4 ] , [ R a g1 ]  No need to worry about the knight. Mate is much more important.
 [ K x h7 ]  [ Q h4 + ]  [ K g8 ]  [ R e7 ] , [ N d7 ]  22. .......... [ N d7 ] - finally I manage to develop that horse but I end up in deep horse dung!
 [ N a5 ]  [ B b3 ]  [ N x b3 ] , [ a x b3 ]  After a small skirmish opposite-colored Bishops are left. Already the sense that a draw could ensue is foreboding. OCB's often do lead to drawish end-game positions.
 [ d x e5 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ N x c6 ]  [ b x c6 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ B x f6 ] , [ N e4 ]  threatening the pawn
 [ R d6 ]  [ R h1 ]  [ R e6 ] , [ h6 ]  Expecting black's rook to do the right thing and take one for the team.
 [ N d2 ] , [ R c1 ]  The check is better since it wins black's h pawn. You can see it in two moves.
 [ R e4 ]  [ K c2 ]  [ K x h4 ]  [ K b3 ]  [ g5 ]  [ b x a5 ]  [ R x a4 ]  [ K x a4 ] , [ b x a5 ]  
 [ R b8 ] , [ B c3 ]  I considered and almost took on d5. But then I realized that he'd would get the [ b2 ] pawn in return. Well I also wasn't going to allow it since I was confident that I would eventually win his [ d5 ] which is as noted earlier bound to happen. But Tom delays it with his next move and that's when I attack again. It might seem longer but it only took me a few second to go after his R and move my B to [ c3 ] as well and that's due to how much happier I'm feeling about my position. And getting happier is also affiliated with the breathing that I learned Yoga.
 [ B d8 ] , [ B e5 ]  
 [ K d2 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ K c2 ] , [ R f8 ]  47. ...... [ R f8 ] - now the black rook finally threatens to spoil Henry and Glenda's Valentine's Party.
 [ K f7 ] , [ B x f6 ]  good move white steel a live and steel little bit a dangerous 32...Kxf6.33.Rxe3!-[ Q x g4 ] (33...Qxg4?.34.[ N d4 + ] and the black queen dies and black can resign ) and white have some chances even to win because of his a and c passing pawns whoare very dangerous
 [ b6 ]  [ R c1 ] , [ a5 ]  Black opening up castle and creating counterplay.
 [ Q f8 ] , [ Q g5 + ]  The more forcing move.
 [ B c1 ]  [ Q x c1 ]  [ R x c1 ]  [ h4 ] , [ R h3 ]  Black is in a major mess with one of his rooks taken out of the game and his knight out of effective moves. Worse still NONE of his pawns can move. To be fair none of White's can move either but his major pieces are positioned well to attack the f-file with a modified Alekhine's gun possible.
 [ B g7 ]  [ h5 ]  [ e5 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ h x g6 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ R x h7 ] , [ Q d7 ]  That move probably should have occured after the exchange of rooks as now Black has just sacced their Bishop. Possibly a mistake Black may have viewed [ R h8 + ] as inevitable and not realised that their dcb was vulnerable. Or possibly Black is deliberately making the sac gaining the open h file to link up with the collapsed kingside it is about to force through 13... Bxf3. However White hasn't castled so the collapsed kingside isn't the death it would be had White castled short. Additionally the rook can get back to [ h7 ] to occupy the open file. Overall I wouldn't class White as ahead by the full 4 given Black has a shorter route to castling long (if that makes sense :) ) but hell I'll take it!
 [ h5 ] , [ R b c8 ]  Probably not the most accurate way to seek counterplay. More straightforward was 23…[ N c3 ] 24.[ h x g6 ] [ Q x g6 ] 25.Qxg6! [ f x g6 ] (The point being that after 25…[ N x e2 + ] 26.[ K h2 ] [ f x g6 ] the rook on [ c5 ] is not defended 27.Rxc5) 26.[ B d3 ] [ R b c8 ] 27.[ R a1 ] [ K f7 ] 28.[ R a7 ] when white enjoys a slight or should I use the synonym “Carlsen” edge in the endgame but his active pieces promise him very good chances to equalize.
 [ d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ a6 ]  It winds up being what I have the most experience with being the Sicilian Nadjorf.
 [ B x c6 ] , [ R e8 ]  Against Much stronger players I'd resign but Carl's about my strength. And Coach Stockel that resignation after losing a piece is reasonable against much higher rated players. But if you're about the same rating especially during a tournament that's the time to slow down and try to figure out a way out of trouble. Besides a couple of games where I won hopelessly lost games I played one a while back against Loyd. I had a winning initiative due to being an entire piece up. But then I made mistakes didn't develop my pieces quickly enough which allowed him to compensate. Then I misplayed the endgame which allowed Loyd to pull a swindle and win. Thus "it's not over until the opera singer sings" as Susan Polgar puts it. Therefore I follow ION's logic of "Play the man not the board". I do this by pinning his Ne3.
 [ B f6 ]  [ c4 ] , [ B b7 ]  I thought Black would trade here instead.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ f5 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ f x e4 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ Q g5 ]  [ d4 ] , [ Q x g2 ]  All games start here. Black has just captured the "poisoned Pawn."
 [ e4 ] , [ c5 ]  The Sicilian popular at all levels.
 [ Q x a7 ] , [ N c6 ]  Keeping the White Queen away from the action.
 [ Q f6 ]  [ d4 ] , [ d6 ]  4. ...... [ d6 ] - the knight on [ e5 ] is now attacked and must move. I choose c4.
 [ e x f5 ]  [ B x f5 ] , [ N d4 ]  (EL) ! Decisive. (RC) Lasker could still try 46 NxB RxN 47 RxRp but the text move is better because more exchanges are forced and Black's center is broken open.
 [ Q e2 ] , [ a6 ]  i don't understand the sense of this move. 6...[ N b c6 ] was better.
 [ R a f1 ] , [ c6 ]  Attacking the advanced QP. White goes in for the exchange.
 [ K f6 ]  [ Q e7 + ]  [ K f5 ] , [ R g1 ]  My position is completely lost. However I have one move up my sleeve that really threw my opponent off. It made him think for a while until has clock had run all the way down to under 3 minutes. That is when he messed up.
 [ N f3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ] , [ N x d4 ]  And it now looks a bit like an open sicilian (maroczy bind) with the pawn still on e2.
 [ b5 ] , [ B b3 ]  Black plays the Arkhangelsk variation (5. ... b5) driving back the white bishop.
 [ K x e2 ]  [ R e8 + ] , [ K d3 ]  and that was the tempo...
 [ N x e4 ] , [ d5 ]  Gain tempos. People like games with may tempos in one side they make the opponent feel like they doing something wrong.
 [ B b5 ] , [ a3 ]  Sparta (pawn) vs. Athens (2 bishops)
 [ K f8 ]  [ Q x c5 + ]  [ d6 ] , [ Q x c3 ]  White has equalized the material.
 [ K f6 ]  [ B d4 + ]  [ K e6 ]  [ K f3 ]  [ h5 ]  [ K f4 ]  [ h4 ]  [ K g4 ]  [ h3 ]  [ K x h3 ]  [ K d6 ]  [ K g4 ]  [ K c6 ] , [ K f4 ]  Black resigned here although it would have taken a little work to avoid a stalemate or a draw. But being a 1900 player he felt this was his loss and took it like a man. Good game.
 [ c6 ]  [ c3 ]  [ a5 ]  [ N g2 ]  [ a4 ]  [ N e1 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ N c2 ]  [ R e7 ]  [ f3 ]  [ N e d2 ]  [ B x d2 ]  [ N x d2 ]  [ R f2 ]  [ N c4 ]  [ e4 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ f4 ]  [ R a5 ]  [ g4 ]  [ R b5 ]  [ N b4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ d x c5 ]  [ B x c5 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ B x d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x a3 ] , [ R c1 ]  probably the losing inaccuracy of them all... [ R x a3 ] [ R x b4 ] or Nc6(!) [ b x c6 ] [ R x a3 ] [ R b1 + ] were much to be preferred...
 [ N f3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ d3 ] , [ b5 ]  As planned exploiting the weakness of 2. Bc4.
 [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ a6 ]  5. ....... [ a6 ] - the Naijdorf - this little pawn push prepares another pawn push to b5.
 [ e4 ] , [ d5 ]  Part of my series of annotations explaining the Scandinavian Defence 1.[ e4 ] [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ Q x d5 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ Q a5 ]  3.. [ Q d6 ] and ..[ Q d8 ] are also possible. But this is the signature move. The classic books say "..[ Q a5 ] is bad as it allows white to chase the queen around and rapidly develop" but this is not the case if black plays accurately
 [ d x c4 ] , [ Q h4 ]  Actually I rather think I overlooked 16...[ Q f6 + ] here which would have picked up the bishop. But as it happens this move is very nearly as good if rather 'too' subtle.
 [ R x a8 ] , [ N d6 ]  After an almost forced exchange of rooks I finally land my knight on [ d6 ] as planned.
 [ R d8 ]  [ Q b3 ]  [ Q a8 ]  [ d x c6 ] , [ B x c6 ]  i was thinking about resigning right here.
 [ R h6 + ]  [ K g1 ] , [ d5 ]  ?? As Erika played 24...[ R h6 + ] just to place her opponent in check. I know this because she's played other moves just to get her opponents in check. That's also ill advised and has costed her the game before. Instead the check should've been played to protect her Rf8. Having said that 25...[ R e8 ] or 25...[ R d8 ] were much better as Ole is going to win the exchange a compensation for material lost.
 [ N e2 ]  [ R a b1 ] , [ N d4 ]  gonig for the [ f3 ] pawn.
 [ Q x c6 ]  [ Q x c6 + ] , [ R x c6 ]  removing the defender of the [ d8 ] square to recapture.
 [ R d6 ]  [ R a e4 ]  [ Q d8 ] , [ h4 ]  32. [ h4 ] - I now see another plan - swap off the dsbs.
 [ N x b3 ] , [ N x a3 + ]  White's only chance is to take the knight and try to defend. Playing like a coward and moving the king just lets me have the attack without losing any material.
 [ N f3 ] , [ g5 ]  This is the Quaade gambit which favours black in the gameknot database
 [ h4 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ B x d5 ] , [ c6 ]  To defend [ b7 ] and send the bishop packing but better still to prepare for 15. ... d5.
 [ Q d4 ]  [ R c4 ] , [ Q b2 ]  35. [ Q b2 ] - the Wicked Witch of the West is driven back by my latest rook move. Glenda now checks on [ b6 ] and more importantly siezes control of the a7-[ g1 ] diagonal.
 [ R e d8 ]  [ Q c4 ] , [ R d6 ]  i dont really understand these couple of moves from here on. [ N d6 ] seems better.
 [ Q x a2 ]  [ B c4 ] , [ Q a5 ]  Trying to stop an attack like that Vladimir tries to stop that by bringing his Queen to the fifth rank.
 [ Q b2 ]  [ b x c4 ]  [ B x e6 ] , [ c3 ]  still leaving white with another hanging piece to keep the initiative
 [ N x e4 ]  [ N x e4 ] , [ h4 ]  Necessary move to avoid his Q's incursion on h4. This is all theory in "my" book.
 [ d6 ] , [ R d7 ]  White's d-pawn is a credible threat. It's not going anywhere but neither is black's rook on [ d7 ] now.
 [ N c6 ]  [ d4 ] , [ Q g5 ]  Interesting. Never saw this move before this game. I think the game database had good stats on this move but I think the game shows it does not quite work for black.
 [ Q x d2 ] , [ e3 ]  Now the Queen has to go somewhere and I will be one step away from getting my own back!
 [ R h8 ] , [ g5 ]  i saw this reply but discounted its chances. i looked at ...[ f x g5 ] and after he recaptures i push but that passed pawn starts to make my life hell soon thereafter so i tried for this tactical line instead.
 [ B f4 ]  [ h5 ]  [ B x d6 ] , [ K x d6 ]  With the Bishops gone it's just a matter of time.
 [ N d4 ] , [ g5 ]  Okay n[ d2 ] to develop and back [ e4 ] also preps for n[ f3 ] if required.
 [ N c6 ]  [ B g2 ] , [ B b4 ]  Counter my plan to defend e4. This typical respond I see from this rated group.
 [ Q x h5 ] , [ N x h5 ]  Queens are gone the opposite-bishop ending has been prevented and black has a winning material advantage. Time to figure out how to win with it.
 [ e5 ]  [ d x e5 ] , [ d x e5 ]  From here on in things start to get messy.
 [ c x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ] , [ Q x d5 ]  By now I was ahead on the clock slightly and remained so for the rest of the game. I had been slightly chary of this exchange as it left my Q in the line of a revealed attack from the fianchettoed B but I couldn't see any seriously injurious way that White could exploit it.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ] , [ N c3 ]  Probably my favorite opening as white
 [ c x d5 ]  [ R c1 ] , [ B x d3 ]  Surprising timing as White is looking to clear the c-file anyway.
 [ N d7 ] , [ Q e1 ]  Rook is very good in the line f.
 [ d6 ] , [ N f3 ]  I am completely out of my known lines so I am prepared to suffer in the opening. I sense this move is not the most accurate.
 [ g x f3 ] , [ Q d4 ]  his attack continues to develop--his queen now controls center and protects the loose pawn on c4.
 [ Q g8 ] , [ h5 ]  ! Another quiet move with great impact. Now the point of last two moves becomes obvious – White has basically stalemated Black queen.]
 [ N c6 ] , [ Q x b3 ]  And then he did blunder. 49. ... Nc6? loses a pawn.
 [ d4 ] , [ B g7 ]  I'm not surprised to see Ken complete the fianchetto.
 [ Q x d5 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ B b4 ]  He pins the Knight to my King which was a great move on his part.
 [ B f4 ]  [ R a d8 ] , [ N e5 ]  NOW i will get a very good setuation let's see
 [ O-O-O ] , [ B x f7 ]  Blacks castling left this pawn free to pick... Note: The black queen can't move! Note 2: I could have done 11 0-0-0 and I would have been good to go for Nd5...
 [ B x d1 ]  [ R a x d1 ]  [ B x h4 ]  [ g3 ] , [ B e7 ]  Piece gone - look forward and re-assess - where can you make progress - look at [ d4 ]  [ R x d3 ]  [ R f e1 ]  [ b x c3 ] , [ N c4 ]  now [ c4 ] again but worse off - After loosing the piece you needed to make a new plan. Even a bad plan is better than no plan. Plans help us to make "joined-up" moves to achieve a better position exploit a weakness etc. The last 3 moves show how important a plan can be.
 [ d3 ]  [ B g4 ] , [ B e3 ]  He atempts to scare the knight away.
 [ f3 ]  [ h5 ] , [ B g2 ]  Another weak move. Now which pawn to advance?
 [ N f6 ]  [ a3 ] , [ c5 ]  Playing as white with black.
 [ g5 ]  [ R f5 ] , [ h7 ]  Black is now torn apart his rook is no longer capable of halting the pawn from promoting so he must exchange to save himself.
 [ K g2 ] , [ Q c3 ]  I give the queen the runaround here...
 [ a4 ] , [ a5 ]  Blocking the QRP and creating a haven for my K at QR3.
 [ c5 ] , [ a4 ]  so he stake a claim to space on the queen side as well as the centre. Shredder likes [ h4 ] immediately.
 [ R d7 ] , [ f5 ]  Black looks virtually paralysed now.
 [ R d5 ] , [ K f3 ]  .
 [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ] , [ N a5 ]  another option is [ N x d5 ] Nxf7!? (although d4! is much stronger) [ K x f7 ] [ Q f3 + ] usually leading to very sharp play from both sides...
 [ Q f7 ]  [ N f1 ]  [ h5 ] , [ B c3 ]  23. [ B c3 ] - the start of a plan to open up the queenside.
 [ e5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ B b5 + ] , [ c6 ]  This is my favorite form without the knights. It might look weird but it helps later
 [ f6 ]  [ B d2 ] , [ R a d8 ]  Maybe 21...[ R f e8 ] or 21....[ R a e8 ] are better by placing the rook on the open half file? I prefer the former.
 [ N d b4 ] , [ d5 ]  ..aiming for [ d6 ] clamp on the dark bishop..or open up the centre owing to development advantage
 [ Q x f7 + ]  [ K h6 ]  [ e6 ]  [ Q x c3 ]  [ e7 ]  [ h4 ]  [ Q x g6 + ]  [ K x g6 ]  [ e8 = Q + ]  [ K h6 ]  [ Q e6 + ]  [ K g7 ]  [ Q g4 + ]  [ K f6 ]  [ Q x h4 + ]  [ K f5 ]  [ Q g4 + ]  [ K e4 ] , [ f5 + ]  
 [ K x h7 ]  [ Q x d8 ]  [ Q x d8 ]  [ R x d8 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ R h d1 ] , [ N e7 ]  I have no idea what I was thinking to totally ignore the gift of the Rook... so regrettable What might have followed would have still led to the forgone conclusion that I was headed for anyway... but I'm sure I would have felt better about it after 2o. ...[ N x d8 ] 21. [ R x d8 ] [ N d7 ] 22. [ f5 ] ex[ f5 ] 23. [ N d5 ] [ N c5 ] 24. [ N c b6 ] [ R b8 ] 25. [ N x c8 ] [ b5 ] 26. [ R e8 ] [ N e4 ] 27. [ g4 ] fx[ g4 ] 28. [ R x e4 ] [ R x c8 ] 29. Rx[ g4 ] [ R e8 ]  [ R d1 d3 ]  [ R b8 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ g6 ]  [ R f8 ] , [ N h5 ]  A blunder with the inevitable occurring in 6 moves...
 [ K c7 ] , [ K e7 ]  Mate would be impossible here (and in other endgames) if it was legal to pass a turn in chess but since it isn't White is forced to let Black restrict more squares. After White attacks the knight Black will oppose White's king two horizontal squares away and if [ K x [ [ a7 ] ] ] then [ K c7 ] [ K a8 ] Nd5!! [ K [ [ a7 ] ] ] (if [ [ a7 ] ] then Nb6#) [ N e7 ] [ K a8 ] [ N c8 ] zugswang and White must let himself get mated [ [ a7 ] ] [ N b6 # ]  [ K d7 ] , [ K b6 ]  If [ K b8 ] then [ K c6 ] [ K a8 ] [ K b6 ] [ K b8 ] [ N d7 ] [ K a8 ] [ N b5 ] followed by [ N c7 # ] after White smothers himself.
 [ Q d7 ] , [ B x f6 ]  now black can double rooks on his half open f file and prepare an attack
 [ K c7 ]  [ R c1 ]  [ N x a4 ]  [ R x c4 + ] , [ N c5 ]  After 34...[ K x b7 ] 35.[ R x a4 ] black still has a passed pawn but after e.g. 35...[ B b7 ] (because of the thread [ R a e4 ] forcing his king to c7) 36.[ R x d8 ] [ B x d8 ] 37.[ f3 ] I should be faster.
 [ c4 ]  [ g6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ e4 ]  [ d6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B e2 ]  [ e5 ] , [ d5 ]  Until here is all SOP.
 [ N f6 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ g6 ]  Black plays the King's Indian East Indian defense (I don't know this from experience or study. I looked it up). Seems to be a variation of the Reti system or Benko opening except in reverse.
 [ e4 ] , [ c6 ]  Caro-Kann Defence. I've become familiar with this.
 [ R e8 ]  [ N e f3 ]  [ f5 ]  [ K f1 ]  [ K g7 ]  [ N h4 ]  [ K f6 ]  [ N d f3 ]  [ f4 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ K g5 ]  [ N h f3 + ]  [ K f5 ]  [ N x f7 ]  [ R f8 ] , [ N x h6 + ]  Longer than I expected
 [ N f4 ] , [ R f6 ]  Now white knight comes to [ f4 ] and black's rook moves to the 6th rank to f6.
 [ B g5 ] , [ B e7 ]  Steinitz develops with a threat by attacking the black queen which can almost never be a bad move. Curt von Bardeleben must now take a moment to defend against the threat. now both white and blackhave four pieces developed but white has also castled and is on the move. Which colour would you rather be. White I think no?
 [ c3 ] , [ R c e8 ]  Game note "Check his 29...[ R e8 ] I think it's a blunder I think 28...[ R e8 ] was needed. Sure sucks I'm down a pawn....."
 [ N d7 ]  [ f4 ]  [ f6 ]  [ e x f6 ] , [ N x f6 ]  Now I am the only one with central pawns.
 [ N f6 ] , [ B g5 ]  Bg5? [ f4 ] was a lot better.
 [ N f4 ] , [ N x f4 ]  I did not want to exchange the advanced N but at least I double the Black pawns.
 [ B d7 ]  [ O-O-O ] , [ R b8 ]  The move that gave new life to the Dragon in the Yugoslav attack. The first serious analysis published on it was done by Luc Henris although the move itself is much older than that but it wasn't very prominent until Black players started to have serious problems in the more analyzed lines with 10...[ R c8 ] and 10...Qa5.
 [ h6 ] , [ B f6 ]  Mission accomplished.
 [ B x d7 + ]  [ N x d7 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N g f6 ]  [ Q e2 ] , [ e5 ]  Played in response to a perceived threat to advance the e-pawn though I suspect White would have proceeded more circumspectly.
 [ B x e5 ] , [ d x e5 ]  A weird pawn structure. That white D-pawn passer concerns me but if I can get my king pawns going. It is white who will wake up tomorrow wondering what happened!
 [ h5 ]  [ R h4 ]  [ R g5 ]  [ N e2 ]  [ K d6 ]  [ K e3 ]  [ a6 ]  [ K f2 ] , [ R f5 + ]  37. ... [ h5 ] 38.[ R h4 ] Rg5! 39.[ N e2 ] Kd6! 40.[ K e3 ] [ a6 ] 41.[ K f2 ] [ R f5 ] 9K maneuvers to limit the activity of my king. King position assumes great importance in the endgame and the side with the more active king position usually has the advantage.
 [ B b5 ] , [ a6 ]  Now I'm the one putting the question.
 [ Q g4 ]  [ Q e8 ]  [ B h6 ]  [ g6 ]  [ B x f8 ]  [ Q x f8 ]  [ d x c4 ] , [ Q e8 ]  Up the exchange and a piece and a pawn
 [ d x e3 ]  [ N x e5 + ] , [ K e6 ]  And so the king insists on getting involved as well.
 [ h x g5 ]  [ h3 ]  [ g x f4 ] , [ h x g4 ]  No minors but five pawns.
 [ B g7 ] , [ h3 ]  This was one of white's first improvements in the developmental history of the Modern Benoni. White takes some time to prevent ...[ B g4 ] which has led to some favorable lines for black in the past. The idea of ...[ B g4 ] is that black will exchange his weak LSB for the critical knight on f3. The absence of the [ f3 ] knight makes e4-[ e5 ] much more difficult for white.
 [ R g3 ]  [ R h x g6 ]  [ R x g6 ]  [ R x g6 ]  [ N f4 ]  [ R d6 ]  [ K c2 ]  [ g5 ]  [ N d3 ] , [ K f7 ]  Black tries to keep K and R on different color squares to avoid a simple fork. White's K has to stay home to prevent the pawns from running to the endzone.
 [ B x e5 ] , [ B d6 ]  Sharp. I thought over this for a while and decided to play [ B x g7 ] in exchange for Ms. Hannahs Bxh2.
 [ N g3 ]  [ R a d8 ]  [ B c2 ] , [ h6 ]  In anticipation of [ d3 ]  [ d3 ] , [ N h7 ]  Almost 20 moves in and still no captures so I needed space
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ d3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ h3 ]  [ a6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B b4 ]  [ B d2 ]  [ Q e7 ]  [ a3 ]  [ B x c3 ]  [ B x c3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ b6 ]  [ g4 ]  [ h6 ]  [ b4 ]  [ O-O ]  [ g5 ]  [ N h5 ]  [ g x h6 ]  [ N f4 ]  [ h4 ]  [ K h7 ]  [ h x g7 ]  [ R f g8 ]  [ N g5 + ]  [ K x g7 ] , [ N x e6 + ]  lets pick another piece and keep his king open
 [ Q h4 ] , [ N b7 ]  21 ... [ g5 ] is out of question to my opinion. It would allow the queen to win a tempo. Instead I recuperate the knight for the center.
 [ K g3 ]  [ K c8 ]  [ K h4 ] , [ B g6 ]  Now Black's bishop is committed to defending the K-side.
 [ N x d3 ]  [ R x d3 ]  [ N c5 ]  [ R e3 ] , [ B e6 ]  Black plays natural moves and the White position starts to creak.
 [ B x h3 ]  [ B x h3 ] , [ e4 ]  Merely threatens to win a piece but there is more to it than that....
 [ N f6 ]  [ B c4 ] , [ N d4 ]  (!) Anderssen finds the sharpest reply
 [ h x g3 ]  [ B g7 ] , [ B x c4 ]  Maybe I should have played [ Q h5 + ] here?
 [ Q a5 ] , [ B d2 ]  Back we go sneaky plan unfulfilled.
 [ O-O ] , [ B h3 ]  A common but effective tactic to annihilate the defending bishop...
 [ B e7 ]  [ Q c2 ] , [ B f6 ]  Black overprotects [ e5 ] so he can move Nd7.
 [ N c6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ d3 ]  [ B g7 ] , [ c3 ]  This move is intended to relieve the pressure on b2? - white has restricted the space that his knight can develop into and does not seem to have gained very much for it.
 [ h4 ] , [ B d7 ]  I bring my other bishop up...
 [ N e3 ] , [ R c5 ]  Have to keep appearances up: Black makes it look as if he's focused on winning the d-pawn. But he's not.
 [ Q c3 ] , [ Q d8 ]  White avoided the pitfalls and now seriously threatens the fork at d7. Black could trade queens but that would liberate the only advantage he has on the board the isolated white pawns. Now black avoids the fork and chases away the white knight.
 [ R h c8 ]  [ R c3 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ B x e5 ]  [ f x e5 ] , [ O-O ]  Previous exchanges improved black position.
 [ R a b8 ] , [ Q c7 ]  Computer lists this move as an innacuracy coming up with the continuation [ Q c7 ] [ R b e8 ] 20. [ K d2 ] [ Q e4 ] 21. [ R a e1 ] [ R f7 ] 22. [ f3 ] [ Q d5 ] 23. [ Q g3 ] [ N x d4 ] 24. [ e x d4 ] [ R x e1 ] 25. [ R x e1 ] Rx[ f3 ] Which atually is very good for white because of the bank rank weaknesses. I admit though I didn't look into it that depeely I just made this move because I saw no better square for my queen.
 [ B b2 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ e3 ]  [ a6 ] , [ N f3 ]  The fact that Black has not played [ [ e5 ] ] allows White to develop more aggressively with more control over the center. If [ [ e5 ] ] had been played White could still play [ N f3 ] but with ... [ e4 ] Black could gain more space and force the Knight to find a new home. If then [ N d4 ] White's development becomes more cramped.
 [ a3 ]  [ B c7 ]  [ N h4 ] , [ g5 ]  Deep Blue attacks Kasparov's knight on [ h4 ] by playing g5. This however wasnt a bad move but will cost him towards the end as it loses all defense for whites future King side pawn rush.
 [ B x d6 ]  [ Q d7 ]  [ B x c7 ] , [ N x b2 ]  Now all of the sudden the black DSB has become a monster and the knight on [ c3 ] is a sitting duck!
 [ K d2 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ K c3 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ b4 ]  [ a x b4 + ]  [ a x b4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ h4 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ K d2 ]  [ K g7 ]  [ K e3 ] , [ K h6 ]  I can block h pawn....But i can't block the other ones....
 [ N b6 d7 ] , [ c4 ]  ! Opening even more the Black King position. White one is safe because Black is too behind in development to highlight it.
 [ R g8 ] , [ N h5 ]  Now [ B x h3 ] isn't a sacrifice.
 [ e4 ] , [ c5 ]  The Sicilian a personal favorite of mine.
 [ Q x f3 ]  [ N b4 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ Q e7 ]  [ Q g3 ]  [ d6 ] , [ B d3 ]  The major blunder that put me on the back foot and lost both bishops with no gain!
 [ R x a1 ] , [ Q x e5 ]  ...and black wins for free the N with overwhelming material advantage that made white resign honourably.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ] , [ B c4 ]  Bishop's opening.
 [ Q g6 ]  [ N e3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B d2 ]  [ c6 ] , [ B e2 ]  9. [ B e2 ] - I now pave the way for kingside castling.
 [ K x g4 ]  [ K e7 ]  [ K f3 ] , [ K d6 ]  All I got to do is get my king to [ e5 ] and I win easily.
 [ R a2 ]  [ N b4 ] , [ R a1 ]  The board gets tough now for a long while.
 [ R c2 ]  [ B d5 ] , [ R e1 ]  Preparing [ e4 ] but ignoring a2...
 [ e5 ]  [ c x d4 ] , [ Q x d4 ]  The resulting trades of [ e x f6 ] benefit black
 [ R a4 ] , [ R g6 + ]  Now the Rs manouvre for a mate
 [ N b d7 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ d x c4 ] , [ B x c4 ]  7. [ B x c4 ] - pawn trade - note the [ d4 ] pawn prevents black from expanding by playing [ N c5 ] or Ne5.
 [ N b1 ] , [ e5 ]  And now... center control is much more balanced than before... but I know my Queen's in rut!!!
 [ R a1 ]  [ K d7 ]  [ h5 ]  [ B f6 ]  [ N e5 + ]  [ B x e5 ] , [ d x e5 ]  i'm glad to trade my bad Bishop for his knight.
 [ R h e8 ] , [ h4 ]  Restricting black's queen.
 [ B d3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ O-O ]  d-knight is free now. so it can move to [ [ [ b3 ] ] ] and pressure d4. also after [ a3 ] black bishop finds problems. while [ [ [ b3 ] ] ] knight is solid at [ [ [ b3 ] ] ] ... so
 [ B c4 ]  [ Q x e4 ] , [ R x b4 ]  The final mistake of the game but white was already losing.
 [ R c8 ] , [ B a4 ]  We can see here that if the attack on the queenside is stopped then White marches on the Black king with his pawns and since Black's pieces are stranded on the other side you can truly see the importance of the b7-pawn. 15...[ N b4 ] wouldn't succeed because 16.[ h4 ] N7[ a6 ] 17. [ a3 ] [ N c6 ] 18. Nd5!... with the edge going to White.
 [ N x c3 ] , [ d x c3 ]  Last move of this opening AFAIK where the d pawn captures so to enable lines for the queen and bishop.
 [ B x f4 ] , [ Q f6 ]  P[ d6 ] is undefended. Not a blunder but an apparently questionable move. That early [ R b1 ] is starting to look almost prescient.
 [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B b4 ] , [ B d2 ]  Shades of Nimo Inidan but not an opening I know very well. Happy to learn though
 [ B f4 ]  [ B e5 ]  [ B x e5 ] , [ R x e5 ]  27. .....[ R x e5 ] - I chose this capture to keep my rook active on the e column and to try and cut off the WK and keep him confined to the kingside as much as possible. If white puts his own rook on the e column to neutralise its power I will be more than happy to trade it off which should accentuate my 1 pawn advantage.
 [ R d8 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ a4 ] , [ R b2 ]  More resiliant is 31. [ R b1 ] [ B x f3 ] 22. [ g x f3 ] [ R a8 ] 23. Ra1...
 [ R x b3 ]  [ a x b3 ]  [ B x f5 ]  [ N x f5 ]  [ c6 ]  [ b2 ]  [ K c2 ]  [ N x e3 + ]  [ K x b2 ]  [ N x d5 ] , [ h5 ]  Now the game is simplified which is to my taste. I have threats to promote a pawn on both sides of the board. Theoretically it is either win or a draw for me at this point so I got my confidence back.
 [ b x c3 ]  [ Q b2 ] , [ B d4 ]  Slight inaccuracy
 [ R a e8 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ B x d5 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ Q f3 ]  [ B h2 + ]  [ K h1 ] , [ B f4 ]  The idea is to tempt white to play g3.
 [ R d2 ] , [ R c6 ]  Planning a sneaky little trick to clear out some pieces. If white allows it 37. ... [ R x c1 ] 38. [ R x c1 ] [ B h6 ] skewering the two rooks and regaining the exchange.
 [ O-O-O ] , [ N b8 d7 ]  Yes. No good was 10...N8[ c6 ] due to white's N on d4. In addition even if it weren't for that problem I still like the arrangement better as black will be able to bring onto [ c5 ] or e5. Both of those squares appear stronger then on c6.
 [ f x e2 ]  [ K f2 ]  [ e x f1 = Q + ]  [ K x f1 ] , [ K g7 ]  Alekhine has an easy win with his passed QP.
 [ K g8 ] , [ Q g5 ]  "Appear at places to which he must hasten; move swiftly where he does not expect you. To be certain to take what you attack is to attack a place the opponent does not protect. He whose advance is irresistible plunges into his opponent's weak positions..." (ibid. 6:5 7 10). And as a sidenote compare the mobility of White's queen to that of Black's queen...
 [ K d7 ]  [ h x g5 ]  [ h x g5 ] , [ b4 ]  It looks like White might make progress by playing [ d5 ] and answering ...[ K d6 ] with [ R e6 ] ck.
 [ e6 ] , [ b3 ]  What is White up to now?
 [ R g6 ] , [ f4 ]  And Ljubojevic resigns as his g pawn will never reach it's goal because of white's pawn on h2. His a pawn is worthless as well. In a game of queen vs. rook he may have some play but now because white's f pawn has entered the picture he knows he can't defend on that many fronts. A wonderful game and a beautiful example of the concept of TIME being used in a mating attack. I hope you enjoyed it:) - Thomas
 [ e x f5 ]  [ N x a4 ]  [ B g3 ]  [ Q c5 ]  [ K g6 ]  [ N b6 ]  [ f4 ]  [ e x f4 ]  [ e3 ]  [ Q c2 + ]  [ K g7 ]  [ N c4 ]  [ Q e7 ]  [ K f1 ] , [ B x f4 ]  Alternative variation: 48... [ Q c7 ] 49. [ K e2 ] [ Q x f4 ] 50. [ N x e3 ] $14 Alternative variation: 48... [ e2 + ] 49. [ Q x e2 ] [ Q c7 ] $11
 [ h x g3 ]  [ h x g3 ] , [ R a c8 ]  I was expecting something like 24...Qh7. But this is even more powerful.
 [ N d7 ] , [ N x c7 # ]  I did not see the checkmate until after Black's move.
 [ d x c5 ]  [ B x c5 ] , [ N e4 ]  !
 [ R e8 ]  [ Q g5 ] , [ R g8 ]  Black must give up one piece he choices the knight.
 [ N e2 ] , [ Q c7 ]  [ c3 ] was useless after e4. [ f5 ] to stop it was vey dangerous - or I thought so.
 [ N e7 ] , [ B b2 ]  My king is still not in danger so I finish my minor piece development.
 [ B x e6 ]  [ b4 ] , [ B f5 ]  Now Black's endgame is pretty simple. White cannot make any progress on the Queenside at all. Black can take as much time as they like to prepare on the Kingside. If they ever need a tempo the B can provide a null move.
 [ c x d6 ] , [ c x d6 ]  It was here I thought of [ N x e5 ] check...
 [ K e6 ] , [ R g f1 ]  Again [ R g5 ] is preferable
 [ Q e1 + ]  [ Q f1 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ h3 ] , [ Q x f1 + ]  What's the loss of a queen? Checkmate isn't inevitable. Yet. You're playing 2184--might as well see what he does next. A stalemate is highly unlikely but... oh of course. KxQ Re1#. [ K h2 ] isn't much respite.
 [ N f6 ] , [ d3 ]  The [ d3 ] move is the best way to defend the pawn. On 5. [ N c3 ] Black has the option of 5. ... [ N x e4 ] 6. [ N x e4 ] [ d5 ] forking the knight and the bishop and getting an easy game.
 [ b x c6 ] , [ d x c6 ]  Nice! Of course RxN leaves me just undefended since [ R e8 + ] is impossible.
 [ K x f1 ] , [ Q c1 + ]  As anticipated.
 [ Q x e5 ] , [ f3 ]  Alternative variation: [Fritz 11:] 20. [ c5 ] [ B g7 ] 21. [ Q c1 ] [ f3 ] 22. [ Q e3 ] [ f x g2 ] 23. [ K x g2 ] [ Q h5 ] 24. [ f4 ] [ B f5 ] 25. Q[ f3 ] [ Q x f3 + ] 26. Kx[ f3 ] [ B x h3 ] 27. [ R h1 ] [ B c8 ] 28. [ R d6 ] [ B x c3 ] 29. [ b x c3 ] [ K g7 ] 30. [ B c4 ] [-0.36/21]
 [ Q d6 ] , [ N c3 ]  He has now develop both his knights.I am down minus 10
 [ B b2 ] , [ N e4 ]  And the book also recommends that if in doubt [ N e4 ] is always a good move for Black. I think [ c6 ] would be the natural move here to complete the Stonewall but he's playing passively. I figure in every game at least one person has to be attacking and if my opponent wants to be passive then it must be me who should be doing the attacking. (Don't worry he'll punch back soon enough.) I don't remember which pawn I was planning to take back with if he captures the knight. Maybe I hadn't decided because there's things I like about both. I like giving my rook a half-open file with fxe4. But I also like the threat of moving the pawn to f4. Yeah I'd probably recapture with the d-pawn for that reason. But I don't think he wants to trade off that bishop for the knight so I didn't think I'd have to face that choice and he can't take with the knight because my pawn forks his knight & bishop.
 [ B x d4 ] , [ e5 ]  ? This must have been the point Black wants to gain more center control with tempo. Unfortunately it fails tactically.
 [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N b5 ]  [ a6 ]  [ N d6 + ]  [ B x d6 ]  [ Q x d6 ] , [ N g e7 ]  At the time I liked this move but now I think I like a queen move better.
 [ Q x f7 ] , [ B g5 ]  Your bishop may have been better off on e3. You have a potential discovered attack on [ a7 ] by moving the knight off of d4. If you could get your queen to [ a4 ] (move [ b3 ] to b4) you have a possible checkmate with Qa7.
 [ Q a5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ d3 ]  [ e6 ] , [ B d2 ]  White develops another piece to threaten the black queen.
 [ B d6 ]  [ N a6 ] , [ B c5 ]  doing what i should have done at move 20
 [ N x h8 ]  [ Q c5 ] , [ B f7 + ]  Black is in quite a predicament now.
 [ b4 ] , [ N h4 ]  i decided i wasn't too worried about that c-pawn being taken just yet. still this could have wound up awkward for me. i figured that after recapturing with the b-pawn my center would be a little stronger. i'm not so sure my thinking was correct on this one though.
 [ B b7 ] , [ N b5 ]  ...and my knight also eyes up the pawn...
 [ e x d5 ]  [ Q x d5 ]  [ h3 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ N c3 ]  My queen is being attacked here. Although it doesn't follow the line exactly she's being shrewd not to chase my queen all over the board.
 [ N f3 ] , [ B g4 ]  too late is 7...[ c5 ] since 8.dx[ c5 ] [ Q a5 ] 9.O-O Black has lost the sting of ...[ N e4 ]  [ B x f3 ]  [ g x f3 ] , [ b6 ]  Now White has created a weakness in Black's queenside
 [ N x e4 ]  [ B g3 ] , [ N f2 + ]  I took some time before this move. Not so obviously good
 [ Q b1 + ]  [ K h2 ] , [ Q b6 ]  exchanging the queens here is good for black. the b and c pawns are going to be connected and the black knight will help the promotion. for example 25.[ Q x b6 ] [ a x b6 ] 36. [ N e1 ] [ b5 ] 37. [ K g1 ] [ c3 ] 38. [ K f1 ] [ N c4 ]  [ K h7 ]  [ Q d5 ]  [ Q c7 ] , [ K g1 ]  avoiding [ N b5 + ] picking the [ a3 ] pawn.
 [ B x b4 ]  [ N x b4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ B x e4 ]  [ N e3 ]  [ N e7 ]  [ d3 ] , [ B c6 ]  Black ended their mobility and have a strong bishop at a big diagonal.
 [ B g3 ] , [ N d4 ]  Black's problem is the LSB : it has no proper place to go. I find it common in the Pirc opening (or at least it commonly happens to me...). This trading move will enable the LSB to have an active spot on [ b7 ] and will weakens black's kingside where black plans the attack.
 [ d6 ]  [ c3 ]  [ B b6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ R e8 ] , [ B g5 ]  It is common for white to insert [ a4 ] [ R b8 ] [ a x b5 ] [ a x b5 ] at some point
 [ B x d5 ] , [ c x d5 ]  ?? should have taken with the bishop or knight. Now loses a pawn
 [ N g5 ]  [ f4 ]  [ N x h3 + ]  [ K h2 ]  [ N x f4 ] , [ R a7 ]  attacking and pinning the pawn on b7.
 [ Q x a7 ]  [ b6 ] , [ Q a3 ]  Retreat back and pin the knight.
 [ R h e1 ] , [ B b7 ]  ...and unleash the bishop onto the diagonal to threaten the knight...
 [ K h1 ] , [ Q e1 + ]  Here my friend quit forced mate r[ x e1 ] r[ x e1 = ]  [ R x e1 ] , [ R x e1 # ]  I believe we both missed a lot but danish my arse openings dont win games on there own... you need to work for it
 [ B f4 ] , [ Q f5 ]  19. ..... [ Q f5 ] - puts Glenda in a more active spot with ideas of Qc2. I also have [ R f8 ] in mind but I got impatient and played [ B e5 ] first. Maybe I should have played [ R f8 ] and traded off all the major pieces after all Henry is closer to that [ d5 ] pawn that Ion's king.
 [ g3 ] , [ N f6 ]  Black begins the queen chase.
 [ K f7 ] , [ f4 ]  In doing this I hope to prevent a possible [ e5 ] from messing up my plans of attacking the king.
 [ O-O ] , [ N g e7 ]  He is trying to castle but blocking his black bishop is not a good idea if you ask me. Then he cannot move his knight to [ f6 ] because i have a freaking pawn there.
 [ K x d5 ]  [ a4 ]  [ K c4 ] , [ K g5 ]  I move my king to attack the d-pawn...
 [ Q x g7 ] , [ N x c3 ]  I must or Be5.
 [ N d5 + ] , [ K f5 ]  I don't think he noticed that this was pretty much the worst possible move in this situation.
 [ Q e8 + ]  [ K h7 ]  [ Q g6 + ] , [ Q x g6 ]  Simpler would have been 32...[ K x g6 ] 33 [ R g1 ] Rh2++. I didn't realize that after the game believing I would lose my queen from the pin.
 [ B x d4 ] , [ N x d4 ]  an must take otherwise my rock falls
 [ R b4 ] , [ O-O ]  A rather late castle.
 [ B f4 ]  [ B g7 ] , [ e3 ]  After this move I started feeling better about that development. Fianchetto in place his dark bishop squeezed my castling options still alive.
 [ B h3 ] , [ B h1 ]  The rook shift allowed this Bishop retreat.
 [ b5 ]  [ a x b5 ] , [ B x b5 ]  Even in material again though more and more I am comfortable playing a couple point down. Three or more points down worry me however but sometimes a couple in the middle game (not end) does not freak me out the way it used to.
 [ K e2 ] , [ K g6 ]  Now if White keeps heading for the queenside then I play [ h4 ] [ K h5 ] and break through the kingside with my king.
 [ a x b5 ]  [ a x b5 ] , [ N a3 ]  Now there is no defence against 26.[ N b5 ] with threat of 27.[ R a7 ] with great pressure on f7.
 [ B e2 ] , [ O-O ]  And here we are. Firmly entrenched in the Queen's Gambit Declined semi-Slav Stoltz variation. White is ever so slightly ahead in this position but its anyone's game from here.
 [ N d b4 ]  [ Q g4 ]  [ Q f6 ]  [ Q e2 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ Q g4 ]  [ N d x c2 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ Q f7 ]  [ R a c1 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ a3 ]  [ N x d3 ]  [ R c b1 ]  [ R f8 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ h5 ]  [ Q e4 ]  [ N e2 + ]  [ K h1 ] , [ B x e3 ]  
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ N c3 ]  Normal
 [ h4 ]  [ K f5 ]  [ h5 ]  [ K g5 ]  [ g4 ]  [ K h6 ]  [ f4 ]  [ K g7 ]  [ g5 ]  [ K f7 ]  [ f5 ]  [ K g7 ]  [ f6 + ]  [ K h7 ]  [ f7 ]  [ K g7 ]  [ g6 ]  [ K f8 ]  [ h6 ]  [ K e7 ]  [ h7 ]  [ K f6 ] , [ f8 = Q + ]  Say hello to Queen #1...
 [ N b c6 ] , [ O-O ]  White doesn't fear an opposite sides castling as black can make no progress on the white king due to the strong [ g5 ] Bishop.
 [ N c6 ]  [ B e2 ] , [ N f6 ]  All four knights have been developed early.
 [ N d5 + ] , [ K a5 ]  14. ...... [ K a5 ] - Henry seems safe here but an attack on Glenda - the white knight simultaneously defends the lsb gains Freddy a vital attacking tempo.
 [ K x d8 ] , [ R d1 + ]  And white is quick to grab the open file with tempo against my king.
 [ b x c3 ] , [ N x c3 ]  "I LIVE" roars the knight! When was the last time you saw a game where white didn't develop one of his knights until the 32nd move and won?! This looks better to me by the way than either [ B x c3 ] or Rxd6.
 [ g4 ]  [ R g5 ]  [ Q e3 ] , [ R f8 ]  I was expecting [ h6 ] to protect the R. This has to be classified as a blunder as it drops an entire R.
 [ B c4 ] , [ b x a2 ]  I take as I hoped but of course that pawn is lost.
 [ R x c1 ]  [ N x g2 ] , [ K x g2 ]  and now please tell who's the boss ?? :) but the game is not already done ...
 [ c5 ] , [ B x f6 ]  One square too many 16. [ B e5 ] looks stronger pinning the knight to the [ g7 ] bishop and keeping the Black Queen's rook off of b8.
 [ h3 ] , [ c6 ]  Stop a moment and look at my bishops. Neither one has any hope of moving to any square where they'll be useful any time soon. White's [ e4 ] pawn in particular completely locks down my e-pawn my dark-squared bishop and takes the [ f5 ] square away from my other bishop. If I'm going to do anything this game it has to go. And since I don't want to move my f-pawn that means attacking white's d-pawn first.
 [ R x h3 ] , [ Q d7 ]  The idea behind this move was to inhibit White's planned g-pawn advance since on [ g4 ] it would be pinned against the Rh3. I hoped thereby to slow down White's attack sufficiently to generate some activity for myself. This move also connects my Rooks.
 [ Q x d5 ] , [ d x c5 ]  Tim let's Jim decide if they will play the remainder of the game w/ or w/o Queens. Take a close look here because this is a mistake by Tim. A blunder. Why? Because Jim can take Tim's Knight with his Queen giving Jim a material advantage. If Jim did this he'd have 2 Rooks 2 Bishops and a Queen. Tim would have 2 Rooks 1 Bishop and a Queen. Advantage Jim.
 [ g x f5 ] , [ g x f5 ]  12...ef is best here with future pressure on the a8-[ h1 ] diagonal.
 [ R g b1 ] , [ R c b8 ]  what about 25...Ra4?
 [ R c8 ]  [ g3 ] , [ K g8 ]  The K wakes up and decides his services could be helpful.
 [ R d f8 ] , [ f4 ]  This is not a passed pawn so I'm surprised that Charles advanced. Therefore he wasn't giving extra protection so that brings me back to square one. This means that I don't know why those couple of moves were played.
 [ f x g5 ]  [ c x d4 ] , [ c x d4 ]  Transposing to the line I mentioned after 14...Bxg5. White could have tried 16.Rxf5!? [ e x f5 ] 17.[ c x d4 ] instead but in any case black is already better which means white's choice of opening probably wasn't the best.
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ h3 ]  Dubious but necessary to bring a place for the dsb in case of Nh5.
 [ R x d6 ]  [ B x e2 ]  [ R x e2 ] , [ R c1 + ]  This shows it. Surely Charles will get out of check but ION has some nasty surprises here. For example he will win back the Queen for a piece after these checks. That's the beauty to some of this.
 [ R b7 + ]  [ K g8 ]  [ R e7 ] , [ R f8 ]  Now the black king is blocked on the 8th line white's situation is better than previously
 [ O-O ] , [ b3 ]  Allowing the d-pawn to continue it's march and possible suicide on d4...
 [ B x g5 ]  [ B x a4 ]  [ h4 ] , [ N e4 ]  To force an exchange of my Knight and his Bishop or win a pawn.
 [ B d7 ]  [ N a6 ]  [ g4 ]  [ N c7 ]  [ Q b8 ] , [ N c6 ]  27. Nc6?! Better was Na6!
 [ h4 ] , [ Q x g2 ]  This is a fairly brutal move. Forces white to set up a queen exchange. Anything else is mate. (or serious material loss)
 [ Q x b7 ] , [ B d4 ]  [ B e3 + ] drives the king further into a corner and permits [ N d2 + ] though the black knight's range of motion remains restricted by white's rooks.
 [ g6 ] , [ g3 ]  The main lines convert to a QP game by [ d4 ] or c4. I decided to go for a line that would go for [ e5 ] and then [ f5 ] by black
 [ h5 ] , [ N f5 ]  I resign because of h6! and now I must sake my knight for the pawn and I can't stop white form queening one of the b pawns now.
 [ R f d8 ]  [ B c3 ]  [ R d2 d1 ]  [ R f e2 ]  [ B e4 ] , [ K f2 ]  This is a funny looking position. If my bishop wasn't there he could play Rd8[ d2 ] and it would look HELL-AIR-REE-YUS.
 [ R x e7 ] , [ K x e7 ]  White's last piece is gone time to crush his pawns.
 [ R d2 ]  [ R e c1 ]  [ e3 ]  [ f x e3 ]  [ R x e3 ]  [ R f8 + ]  [ K b7 ]  [ R b1 + ]  [ K c6 ] , [ R c1 ]  free pawn
 [ e x d4 ]  [ B x d4 ] , [ e5 ]  Good by black. Now I am in little trouble. Fortunately (would you have said that?) my outpost is excellent...
 [ N c6 ]  [ d4 ] , [ e6 ]  out of the book i go i like this better he takes i develope
 [ R d c8 ]  [ R x c3 ]  [ R x c3 ] , [ Q d2 ]  looks like we are waiting for the draw...
 [ B e4 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ h3 ]  The last useful thing this pawn can do is open the g-file for a Black Rook. 24.g3?! might be worth a look though.
 [ Q f4 ] , [ Q h5 ]  Clever unpinning the queen and treatening the bishop but losing as it concedes e6. This game is becoming a real tour de force.
 [ K f8 ]  [ K b2 ] , [ K g8 ]  Black loses an important tempo with this move...the rest of the game could easily go into any endgame tome under the bishop vs. knight endgame literature...
 [ K h1 ] , [ N e3 ]  24. ..... Ne3!! - SPLAAT - this kills white stone dead. With this counter-sac white can take the knight with either the rook or the queen but Old Matey will still descend on [ g2 ] due to Fou Leblanc sitting quietly and innocuously on [ b7 ] but also attacking g2. White sees this and waves the white flag.
 [ R a g8 ]  [ R f3 ] , [ R g7 g5 ]  I don't understand this move.
 [ R d7 ]  [ N x d4 ] , [ Q x e4 ]  I didn't want to concede and played for more while accepting less. There was no doubt that White has a better ending but I hopped that I could secure good chances with two pawns for the Knight. My opponent must have been pleased with my decision.
 [ Q e3 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ O-O-O ]  [ R d e8 ]  [ N b6 + ]  [ N x b6 ]  [ B x b6 ]  [ N c7 ] , [ g3 ]  Now white can play N[ x B e6 ] and pick up [ Q x h6 ] in the exchange.
 [ B x c6 ]  [ d x c6 ]  [ Q x c6 + ]  [ K e7 ]  [ R d1 ]  [ Q x d1 + ]  [ K x d1 ]  [ R h d8 + ]  [ K c2 ]  [ h6 ]  [ Q x c7 + ]  [ R d7 ]  [ B x f6 + ]  [ g x f6 ]  [ Q f4 ]  [ R a d8 ]  [ c6 ]  [ R d7 d2 + ]  [ K b3 ]  [ e5 ]  [ Q x h6 ]  [ a4 + ] , [ K x a4 ]  I think you should have seen what was coming. 26.[ K c4 ] retains your advantage.
 [ e4 ] , [ N f6 ]  This is the Alkehine's defense (spelling?)
 [ B x f4 ] , [ Q x f4 ]  My queen is already out joined with a knight while black is undeveloped. Almost a death sentence.
 [ K g8 ] , [ K e5 ]  protecting the pawn
 [ R x c3 ] , [ R x b4 ]  In practice however this endgame is very difficult for both sides. Even in games on chessgames.com the strong side wins 35% of the time; Karpov defeated Van Wely with it as recently as 2003! I have 50 moves to either exchange his rook for my bishop win his rook outright or mate his king -- otherwise it's a draw.
 [ f4 ] , [ Q x g2 # ]  
 [ h x g3 ] , [ f x g3 ]  [ h x g3 ] would be extremely bad for me in the longer term.
 [ R a e1 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ R f8 ]  [ N x g6 ]  [ h x g6 ] , [ R e2 e7 ]  20. [ R e7 ] - a serious bone in the throat for black.
 [ d4 ]  [ g6 ]  [ c4 ] , [ B g7 ]  A Modern opening that soon transposes into the Grunfeld.
 [ R x e7 ]  [ B x e7 ]  [ K c7 ]  [ R f6 ] , [ B c4 ]  The final error.
 [ g x f3 ] , [ Q x f3 ]  Eek. Thankfully I have the initiative.
 [ f4 ]  [ B x c5 ]  [ B f6 ]  [ B d6 ] , [ R g8 ]  In this kind of position it becomes clear why a Rook can be a terrible defender.
 [ B f4 ]  [ Q f6 ] , [ Q e3 ]  Naturally White has no intention of exchanging Queens.
 [ R x g4 ]  [ h5 ]  [ R g7 + ]  [ K f6 ]  [ R x b7 ]  [ a5 ]  [ R a7 ]  [ R g8 ]  [ g3 ]  [ h4 ] , [ g x h4 ]  I have a three pawn advantage here...
 [ f6 ]  [ g x f6 ]  [ g x f6 ] , [ N c4 ]  This N threats a fork on [ d6 ] and [ K d2 ] blocks the d column for my R to help in the attack so sadly...
 [ e4 ] , [ c5 ]  to many pawn moves
 [ d3 ]  [ N b c6 ] , [ B h6 ]  This may seem weird to you. That is because it is a very bad move at first sight but analyse deeper. Because of the weak f pawn it's a interesting move.
 [ R x g8 ] , [ B x e7 ]  And exchange to keep the pawn on the h file. Still a scary pawn!
 [ h5 ] , [ Q x h5 + ]  About the only move that Black has
 [ O-O ]  [ R d8 ]  [ Q e2 ] , [ B e4 ]  Black Bishop feels the hit
 [ N g8 ]  [ d4 ] , [ e6 ]  More common are 5...[ c6 ] or 5...d6. The text makes [ f6 ] a dangerous hole just to allow ...Ne7; it's probably better to develop the Knight to [ f5 ] via [ h6 ] instead.
 [ K b6 ] , [ c5 + ]  [ c5 + ] Passer is on its way with a check!
 [ K f2 ] , [ R d e8 ]  ...and double on the e-file.
 [ N h6 + ] , [ K g7 ]  The only option here. [ K h1 ] would have lost the knight due to [ d5 ] and Ng4.
 [ N g5 ] , [ N x g5 ]  Forcing him to bring his queen into play.
 [ N g e2 ] , [ N d7 ]  I believe considering the [ g2 ] [ f3 ] [ e4 ] pawn chain the [ f6 ] knight had no future role on f6.
 [ c3 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ f x e5 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ B b4 + ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N b6 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ Q h4 + ]  [ K f1 ]  [ B x c3 ] , [ b x c3 ]  I felt removing the knight in exchange for my bishop was the best move
 [ h5 ]  [ f x e5 ] , [ B g4 ]  This Bishop is taboo [14 PxB??? PxP mate.]
 [ N c6 ] , [ Q d1 ]  here A[ b5 ] was the theoretical now I am ok.
 [ B x e6 ]  [ B x g7 ]  [ R f7 ] , [ B h6 ]  Now white may have a tiny advantage.
 [ R x d8 ] , [ B x d8 ]  Trade? With bishop x?
 [ Q d8 ]  [ N x f6 + ] , [ N x f6 ]  That was a mistake on white's side. Now the situation is the same but white doesn't have any knight to press f6. And black's pawns are still in their place.
 [ N g8 ] , [ B f2 ]  getting away from any tactics...
 [ h3 ]  [ Q d4 ] , [ h x g4 ]  From here on out things are pretty forced as far as I can see.
 [ h5 ]  [ Q b1 ]  [ h6 ] , [ K c6 ]  this was panic mode no ideas whatsoever.
 [ B e6 ] , [ B b5 ]  Hes threatening to double up my pawns but I ignore this and attack his knight
 [ g4 ] , [ N h4 ]  It is better to put the knight here than retreat it.
 [ N f6 ]  [ K c2 ]  [ B g6 + ]  [ K d1 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ b3 ]  [ N a5 ] , [ B h3 + ]  The computer says my best move here is [ b4 ] which I played next.
 [ Q d3 ]  [ Q g5 ]  [ f3 ]  [ a5 ]  [ R c b1 ]  [ B a6 ]  [ R e4 ]  [ h5 ] , [ K h2 ]  I tuck my King away as I have hopes of an attack.
 [ R c1 ] , [ R d2 ]  26. Rc1? may have been the beginning of white's undoing here. 26. [ B f3 ] or 26. [ K f1 ] look much stronger leaving white's rook on the 7th where it would do some good. Maybe white was planning ahead to a draw and decided to play ultra conservatively.
 [ e5 ]  [ d6 ] , [ N f3 ]  ? "White could have moved [ N [ c3 ] ] instead of [ N f3 ] supported his central pawns more efficiently with an early [ c3 ] and a host of other responses....but failed to do so. Why? Because he is only 1500 rated? No. That may be a small part of the reason but not all. Its because this player is unfamiliar with this opening and was forced to traverse down a dark alley in thick fog. Even a 1500+player knows the basics of more sound development but his mind plays tricks on him with sudden positions that surface from blacks King side development that are unusual. The hammer that shatters the glass usually occurs when a sudden central thrust from black occurs against whites central pawns or a multi attack occurs on both wings from black.....confusing white even more!"
 [ d4 ] , [ d5 ]  So he copies me.
 [ R c5 + ]  [ K b3 ] , [ K b1 ]  White's only other defense to the [ R d1 ] mating threat was 46.[ R c1 ] which loses quicker to 46...[ N c2 ] 47.[ K b1 ] [ N a3 ] 48.[ K a1 ] [ R a4 ] and White cannot stop the mate in 2 threats ([ N c2 ] [ K b1 ] Ra1#) and ([ N c4 ] [ K b1 ] Nd2#) without giving up the rook.
 [ K g3 ] , [ R g8 + ]  Black must move his rook before he can move his king across the e-file. Perhaps he should abandon that pawn to distract White while he works on moving over to the Queenside?
 [ a3 ]  [ Q a1 ]  [ a2 ] , [ h3 ]  And here I I give a Queen gift to my opponent but opponent resignation and Black won
 [ B b2 ]  [ B b7 ] , [ f4 ]  Classic strategy. White takes control of the black diagonal.
 [ B f5 ] , [ g4 ]  Drives the bishop away with tempo and prepares a wing attack if Black castles kingside.
 [ R a d8 ]  [ R d4 ] , [ B x e5 ]  ?! Giving up the bishop pair in an open position like this for no apparent compensation doesn't seem like a wise choice. However looking back at the position I notice that whites logical play so far has left white In a position where the pieces are controlling more space and the knight standing proudly on [ e5 ] leaves a nice impression he was also preventing black from doubling rooks and because of all this it is quite hard to suggest a good plan for black so I guess it's understandable that black wanted to initiate some exchanges leaving black with a less cramped slightly more manageable position
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ d3 ]  I think that [ f4 ] is also playable...
 [ R c2 + ]  [ K d1 ] , [ R x c3 ]  White's pawn are helpless and [ c4 ] pawn is another threat.
 [ B d6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N d7 ] , [ N g5 ]  This move looked threatening at first because of the weakness on e6. But I think the attack can be parried and here I prepare to do so.
 [ K f8 ] , [ B d1 ]  Perhaps this was the mistake allowing the black knight in at c5. What do you think dear reader?
 [ a5 + ]  [ K b3 ]  [ N f5 ]  [ R c1 + ]  [ K d5 ]  [ R c7 ]  [ N d6 ]  [ g4 ]  [ h6 ]  [ h4 ]  [ K e5 ] , [ R c6 ]  Here I think this was a mistake and so did Pete. Here's my commentary along with a note: I'm unsure here but it seems like you'll want to keep your N safe so I doubt you'll [ K [ f4 ] ] due to Rxd6. I would expect perhaps [ b5 ] or g5. Coaching note: playing [ a4 ] 1st would have made sure of swapping the pawn off My response because I honestly wasn't seeing it at the time: Hmmm... Doesn't that lead from f4+to [ K e4 ] [ R x d6 ] [ K x [ f4 ] ] and then the rest of my pawns? I looked at that as well and didn't see a good way to stop your K and fgh with just my R. Every way I looked you got all on mine and kept one of yours. Coaching note: no if i go for [ f4 ] pawn then trade my N for it i am dead. My N is the only piece i can harry you with so i must keep it. to [ f4 + ] i would play [ K d5 ] protecting the N and attacking your R.
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ a6 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ N g4 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ h6 ]  [ B h4 ]  [ g5 ]  [ B g3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ h3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ Q b6 ]  [ B b3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ h4 ]  [ g4 ]  [ N d e2 ] , [ N b d7 ]  An opening novelty. I've seen before 14... [ Q b4 ] followed by [ Q c5 ] and Nbd7.
 [ B e3 + ]  [ K e1 ]  [ B c5 + ]  [ K d2 ]  [ Q e3 + ]  [ K c3 ]  [ N d1 + ]  [ K b3 ]  [ a5 ] , [ N x c7 ]  He didn't see the mate.
 [ N c5 ]  [ B x c5 ] , [ d x c5 ]  Which White accepts.
 [ R f7 ]  [ B g5 ] , [ B f8 ]  So now to trade queens or not too. Again if I control the moment of exchange I can use it to my advantage.
 [ Q h3 ]  [ N d f6 ]  [ c3 ]  [ R c e8 ] , [ B x c4 ]  he was still looking at that pawn
 [ N x c4 ] , [ d6 ]  Freeing the c8-bishop for development. Black is not very concerned that White might take on b6. The double pawn is no serious inconvenience at all yet the open a-file might come in useful.
 [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d4 ] , [ N h5 ]  Trying to defend the extra pawn at the expense of falling behind on piece development is never a good idea. Even worse moving a piece twice; black would've been better off with something like 6...[ g5 ]  [ B x e6 ]  [ f x e6 ] , [ N e5 ]  ! This might seem like a simple knight exchange but accepting it wouldn't be a recommendable idea for black's position.
 [ K f7 ]  [ Q f8 + ]  [ K e6 ]  [ N g5 + ]  [ K e5 ] , [ f4 # ]  Alas poor Henry met his fate in the middle of the battle field. If only he had been more careful! Thank you for reading. Please R&C!
 [ B x c3 + ]  [ b x c3 ]  [ Q x f6 ]  [ Q d5 ]  [ a6 ] , [ R d1 ]  I guess opening files on the Queenside meant that much to him. Not a bad position because I cannot immediately coordinate a Kingside response. I will need to turn his doubled pawns into a liability.
 [ K d7 ]  [ R x a3 ]  [ R x c2 + ]  [ K b3 ]  [ R c3 + ] , [ K b2 ]  Forces the trade of rooks. Can St George's Rook beat the Dragon's knight???
 [ g3 + ]  [ K f3 ] , [ B e2 + ]  This isn't the quickest way to checkmate Black as both 16. O-O and 16. [ K f1 ] set up an unstoppable mate on the next move with 17. Nh2#. However Lasker's path to victory is much more pleasing to the eye.
 [ R b8 ]  [ R b1 ] , [ d5 ]  Opens things up for Black's dark-squared bishop. Now that the bishop has [ c5 ] there is no safety on the kingside since if the king goes to [ b1 ] he will be on the same diagonal as the queen. Black's bishops can take the g1-[ a7 ] and f1-[ a6 ] diagonals and rake White's kingside.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ d6 ] , [ B x c6 + ]  Ruy lopez exchange variation
 [ Q x e4 + ] , [ K f1 ]  I should have considered [ Q e3 ] but I still thought I was OK.
 [ N e4 ]  [ R c2 ]  [ N x d6 ] , [ b3 ]  35.[ b3 ] and Ion resigns. Finally I succeeded in winning against him. What else to say about this game?
 [ K h8 ] , [ f4 ]  further guarding [ g5 ]  [ Q x g5 + ]  [ f x g5 ] , [ R f8 ]  bringing in another attacker to the kingside
 [ R g8 ] , [ R g2 ]  24. [ R g2 ] - now there is a potential pin on Julia's light square bishop should I play gxh5.
 [ Q x e2 ] , [ B e6 ]  White resigns
 [ Q c2 ] , [ Q e6 ]  black have a space advantage
 [ B d3 ] , [ R f4 ]  Targeting the dark-square bishop.
 [ B e2 ] , [ d x c4 ]  and the seccond =]
 [ N g4 ]  [ b4 ]  [ f4 ]  [ h3 ] , [ h5 ]  offering my horse in exchange for left side opening to attack king
 [ b x c3 ] , [ B c5 ]  Moving the bishop to castle + threatening the [ f2 ] square.
 [ B d4 ]  [ N f5 ] , [ c3 ]  At this point the game looks to be fairly even. White may even retain an edge? What I notice about this position is that White seems to have more options for quickly developing pieces.
 [ B e3 ]  [ R f b8 ]  [ c4 ]  [ R b8 b7 ]  [ Q d1 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ f4 ] , [ B x f4 ]  ??? I have not idea what provoked this move.
 [ N d7 ] , [ N x d6 + ]  Black's knight on [ d7 ] blocks his rook's defense of the pawn on d6. Three to two time to pounce. I'm now up by two pawns so I feel a little liquidation is in order. Black will either recapture with his bishop or I will be free to take the bishop on [ b7 ] next move. Either way I'll trade this knight for a bishop.
 [ B x e7 ] , [ R e8 ]  Doing what he can to stay in which is why Dan attacks the center.
 [ b3 ] , [ N d6 ]  Hoping for 25. [ B x d6 ] cxd6. Black has to search simplifications and more with the b pawn pushed now [ c3 ] is a strategic goal.
 [ Q c2 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ N e2 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ N g3 ]  [ B c8 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ b3 ] , [ b5 ]  This move ultimately drops a pawn.
 [ N d2 ]  [ N d3 + ] , [ K e2 ]  10. [ K e2 ] - white is forced to move his king.
 [ N f5 ]  [ N x f5 ]  [ g x f5 ] , [ R c3 ]  resigns!! why? I'm going to go r[ g3 + ] and mate next move!! hope you liked it! please leave a comment or two and rate it on the star system thanks!!
 [ N c3 ] , [ d5 ]  Scandinavian variation of Alekhine's defense lets you avoid Vienna game or Sicilian.
 [ B x e6 ]  [ Q x e6 ] , [ Q e7 ]  Q in e6... what for? Well let's say that on order to activate my lsb without lose tempoes... (but a pawn!).
 [ b5 ] , [ K e6 ]  Now Black chases the other pawn!
 [ a5 ] , [ R x g2 ]  Threatening ... [ f1 Q # ] (or ... f1R#)
 [ c x d5 ]  [ c x d5 ] , [ c6 ]  ouch! i had lost the pawn on d5. i knew that defending it is a hopeless task...
 [ Q b6 ]  [ b3 ]  [ R x b7 ]  [ Q e6 ] , [ Q b4 ]  This makes things worse as 29. [ N x d6 ] gives White an overwhelming advantage.
 [ b x c3 ] , [ Q c7 ]  Classical Variation. Brings another piece to bear against the center developes the Queen to the 7th rank and defends the c-pawn. 6. [ N e7 ] is more common.
 [ e x d4 ]  [ c x d4 ] , [ d5 ]  A direct challenge to White's strong center and no doubt the best way to deal with the threatened d5.
 [ h x g4 + ]  [ h x g4 ] , [ R h6 ]  My guess is that white wants to exchange. But I don't know why as it appears to be more beneficial to akjoltoy.
 [ B x c4 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ d5 ]  [ B d3 ] , [ N d6 ]  Black now has decent control of the white central squares. My dark squares are somewhat weak.
 [ R x d2 ]  [ B x d2 ]  [ K x d2 ] , [ g6 ]  Now is very funny the way I have to try to cahs the WB for a pawn. I'll have to work a little. Will I get it at last? Can you say it from here?
 [ N g4 ]  [ R e f1 ]  [ R d8 ] , [ Q b3 ]  This game's been moving so slowly that I almost forgot my plan to play [ Q b3 ] (and it's probably the only move that doesn't lose). Now if he captures my bishop I can go ahead and take back and that gives me a discovered attack on his queen. And my queen's guarded by a pawn.
 [ K g6 ]  [ K e6 ]  [ K g5 ]  [ e5 ] , [ K g4 ]  My K will defend my pawn. We'll be on a drawish position!
 [ B f5 ] , [ a3 ]  ?! I don't think this accomplishes much.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ Q h5 ] , [ g6 ]  ????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
 [ R x b7 ] , [ R f5 + ]  A finesse that allows black to keep his [ g7 ] pawn but the position is still a draw. Black must lose the g-pawn soon without compensation meaning white can then sacrifice his knight on the a-pawn drawing the game
 [ g4 ]  [ R x f2 ]  [ R f1 ] , [ R f8 + ]  [ R x f1 ] [ K x f1 ] [ B x a8 ] another option
 [ N x c6 ]  [ b x c6 ] , [ Q f3 ]  So the white queen decide to move Qf3.
 [ e x d5 ] , [ B g1 ]  Always trying to surprise my opponent. I'm not sure the exchange would favour me but I'm aiming to a7...
 [ B g5 ] , [ h6 ]  I develop my DB out to [ g5 ] with the protection of knight at [ f3 ] and attacking the [ f6 ] knight. Black pushes his h pawn to [ h6 ] attacking my DB.
 [ N x e5 ]  [ f x e5 ] , [ B g5 ]  black has to trade rook for bishop
 [ B x d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N c e2 ] , [ O-O ]  first keep the king safe before you attack!!!
 [ Q f5 ] , [ Q x g7 ]  ! The winning move. Black's king is toast.
 [ f x e4 ]  [ f x e4 ] , [ N b5 ]  [ c3 ] looks good for you here and I may well lose the pawn in the center. but then again I have both flanks ... If only I can get rid of your troublesome knight your king wouldn't know wich way to turn...
 [ N b d4 + ]  [ K b2 ]  [ R b3 + ] , [ K a2 ]  out of reach...
 [ e6 ] , [ c x b4 ]  This exchange seems to lead to me getting pressure.
 [ R f g8 ]  [ K g3 ]  [ R x d7 ] , [ R x d7 ]  A pair of Rooks fall and I still control the Q-file. Black can do little that is useful.
 [ R a b8 ] , [ B c3 ]  Waited long enough...time to threaten [ Q g7 # ]  [ R x b7 ] , [ Q x d6 ]  Threatening [ Q x e6 ]  [ Q d8 + ]  [ R f8 ] , [ Q g5 ]  After 36 [ Q d8 ] [ R f8 ] I found a safe spot...additionally threatening [ Q x g6 ] if blacks knight moves
 [ N f6 ] , [ N f3 ]  Now Black can't drive this Knight with P-K5.
 [ f3 ] , [ N c5 + ]  [ N c5 + ] to gain a temp on the king.
 [ B e7 ] , [ c3 ]  Falling further behind in development. This square belongs to the knight.
 [ N f3 ] , [ R x c1 ]  And Sasha decides to exchange R's. I don't see the point because of what Joann can do.
 [ Q e2 ]  [ Q e7 ] , [ B b3 ]  The bishop retreats. It is now not advisory to capture it since that will give white and open a-file which can be used for quick mobilization of the rook and turned into an advantage.
 [ Q d4 ]  [ N x c3 ]  [ Q x c3 ]  [ B x g3 ]  [ h x g3 ] , [ Q d7 ]  Caruana is trading everything he can. He is telling Carlsen to prove his endgame skill. No GM in this level should lose in such a position. So I expect Caruana to go i nto game 8 tomorrow with the score 3.5 - 3.5.
 [ h x g5 ] , [ B x g5 ]  A strong move which can not be refuted by (38...[ Q g6 ] because of 39.[ B f6 ] [ Q x g2 ] 40.Rh8#) or (38...[ Q g6 ] 39.[ B f6 ] [ K f8 ] 40. [ R h8 + ] [ Q g8 ] 41.Rxg8#) but can be avoided by ...[ K f8 ]  [ Q x h2 ] , [ R d e8 ]  No moves can save the game for black now.
 [ O-O ] , [ e5 ]  A not well prepared and early e5. The move that is often kind of a decision in the game... Leaves the [ d4 ] pawn weak (in addition to g2)
 [ N d5 ]  [ N g4 ]  [ N f4 + ] , [ K h6 ]  Winning a tempo which gives White the option of doing a lightning-transfer of the knight to [ h3 ] from where it will shield all of his weaknesses.
 [ h6 ] , [ N x f7 ]  Getting something for the "desperado" Knight.
 [ Q x e3 ]  [ N f5 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ N h4 ] , [ f3 ]  Quin defend g pawn. 19. [ g3 ] is the worst move(19...Nf3)
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ] , [ N c3 ]  The Vienna Game -- a quiet opening whose strength often lies in the very fact that it attacks nothing -- quite often black will go for too much in an opening like this.
 [ R a7 ] , [ N d7 ]  I make sure some pressure remains on the queenside though.
 [ B x c3 ]  [ b x c3 ]  [ N f7 ] , [ N d2 ]  15. [ N d2 ] - over the last few moves two minor pieces have been exchanged and my queenside pawn structure is busted. I try and consolidate. Note that the a pawn is baited. If black takes it with his bishop it will become trapped with [ c4 ] and rounded up by Henry a few moves later.
 [ N x g4 ]  [ B x g4 ] , [ B x g4 ]  now the white king's weakness is obvious. Also. there is the fork threat.
 [ Q x h1 ]  [ R x h1 ]  [ B x f7 ]  [ R h8 + ]  [ K c7 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ B x a2 ]  [ b3 ]  [ B b1 ]  [ K d2 ]  [ d6 ]  [ N f7 ]  [ a5 ]  [ K c1 ] , [ B a2 ]  Bishop should probably have taken the pawn just to get something out of it.
 [ B c4 ] , [ Q x d6 ]  A mistake that cost him a rook.
 [ c3 ]  [ N b c6 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ Q e3 ]  [ R e4 ]  [ Q g3 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ f4 ] , [ B x e2 ]  ionadowman: To be honest this "looks" wrong to me though Black retains the edge. My first thought was 15...Nf5!? 16.[ f x e5 ] [ Q g5 ] 17.[ h4 ] [ Q h5 ] (-/ ) with a sizeable advantage. But a second look comes up with 15...Qa6! instead (16.0-0 Bxe2) and Black seems to have a winning game.
 [ B x c5 ]  [ Q x c5 + ]  [ K h1 ] , [ R d4 ]  Whoops! He left the back door wide open.......
 [ N c6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ] , [ e4 ]  3. [ e4 ] - trying to consolidate in the centre.
 [ B g5 ]  [ f4 ] , [ B h6 ]  ? The computer dislikes this and I'm inclined to agree. This Bishop no longer has any prospects from this side of the board--it ought to just retreat to e7.
 [ c x d4 ]  [ B b4 ] , [ N f d2 ]  to free the f pawn so that I can attack the knight better
 [ b x c3 ] , [ Q f2 # ]  
 [ N c3 ] , [ B c4 ]  Because she Kicks my Rook I am just going to protect it. Therefore I feel that she is still wasting time. Instead black already should have played ...[ N f3 ] so that she could castle.
 [ B e7 ]  [ B e1 ]  [ R g7 ]  [ R h c2 ] , [ B d8 ]  56. ..... [ B d8 ] - again I must attend to the weak backward [ c7 ] pawn.
 [ K d7 ]  [ Q x b4 ] , [ Q x d4 ]  It was a trade but since white is ahead trades are to his advantage.
 [ c3 ] , [ d5 ]  I thought this might un-double my e pawns if white should play 10. Pxd5. Not that he had to do it but I was hoping he might.
 [ R x f6 ]  [ g x f6 ] , [ Q x f6 ]  ..an exchange and pawns down...gone mad? Nope..Blacks only active piece is the queen..
 [ O-O ]  [ h5 ]  [ b3 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ f x e5 ]  [ R g6 ] , [ h4 ]  Black is intending to put pressure on [ g2 ] but I am not going to allow it
 [ c6 ] , [ K g5 ]  
 [ e6 ] , [ B d3 ]  (?!) Better is [ B e3 ] or Be2. 5. [ B d3 ] gets rid of White's crucial white squared bishop which is waay better than my own.
 [ R a d1 ] , [ N a c5 ]  Hopelessly trying to defend.
 [ B x g5 ]  [ N x g5 ] , [ B e6 ]  A good developing move defending [ f7 ] into the bargain.
 [ K h7 ]  [ Q h4 ]  [ R d6 ]  [ Q g4 ]  [ R f8 ] , [ Q e2 ]  Now it's time wasting moves..
 [ N c3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ B x e3 ] , [ Q x e3 ]  10. [ Q x e3 ] (over the last few moves we have got on with developing some more pieces and exchanged a pair of bishops)
 [ R h g1 ]  [ Q f7 ] , [ R a e1 ]  Well he can defend but I have all the aces.
 [ N c3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ c x d5 ]  It may be stronger to play 5.[ B g2 ] first but this move is coming sooner or later.
 [ f x e4 ] , [ N c3 ]  Black regains his gambit pawn in accordance with the main line of the Latvian Counter-Gambit. White's programmed response is 6. [ B e2 ] to enable early castling. This alternate line deviates a bit from the main line by developing white's other knight with a direct threat against the black pawn on [ e4 ] and also a two-move threat of 7. [ N d5 ] threatening the black queen followed by 8. [ N x c7 + ] forking the king and rook.
 [ N f6 ] , [ Q g5 ]  my next moove is Ra3...if he take it with bishop my queen go [ Q g7 ]  [ R a3 ] , [ h6 ]  there it is....a computer cannot resist such moove...so i already win one small battle....sum chessplayers refuse to take that rook...feeling sorrry for me...then i jst leave it there...by the way....my opponents rook at [ a8 ] stayed there the entire game...so why dnt get ridd of it while you can by taking his bishop that run on black diagonal?....
 [ Q g1 + ] , [ K h3 ]  I prefered the white queen on [ g2 ] so that if black's queen came back to attack the c pawn it coud do on [ c7 ] and being protected.
 [ N e5 ] , [ Q b7 ]  Black's queen was en prise. On [ b7 ] she supports the rook's attack against the white pwn on b2. But she also has a second thinly veiled threat.
 [ B x c3 ] , [ Q f6 ]  White is forced to care for [ f2 ] and if he does properly the game will come out even enough to be long and drawn.
 [ N g4 ]  [ B x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ d4 ] , [ f6 ]  If he take the [ f6 ] pawn I intend to take with the bishop enticing him to take on c5. If he takes I will triple his pawns with Bxc3.
 [ B x f6 ]  [ B x f6 ] , [ N d5 ]  I first I thought that Charles was trying to exchanging. But then I asked myself why he'd do that being his N is stronger then his [ B c4 ] in this position. I also at first didn't see the point being that 13.Nb6?? is unplayable because of my Q. However the real reason behind this move is because of what I play next. After which the N is not attacked so he doesn't have to worry about me taking off his stronger N.
 [ a x b5 ]  [ Q x b5 + ]  [ Q d7 ]  [ Q x d7 + ]  [ N b x d7 ] , [ O-O-O ]  my intention was to open up that side of the board and rid it of its main defender. there is more comfort in open field combat.
 [ N d5 ]  [ B g4 ] , [ N x f4 ]  With two pieces attacking the [ f4 ] pawn and only one defending white moves to restore parity.
 [ N f3 ] , [ e6 ]  There are ups and downs to this move I think. Im developing my dsb but my lsb is blocked.
 [ c3 ]  [ R b8 ]  [ Q f3 ]  [ c5 ]  [ R e2 ]  [ B e5 ] , [ Q g4 ]  ...white is moving to the right square...[ f4 ] is threatened and [ R a e1 ] might be coming soon...
 [ B f4 ] , [ N b d7 ]  
 [ N d8 ]  [ d6 ]  [ c x d6 ]  [ N a3 ] , [ B x f2 + ]  white can't capture the bishop due to [ N x e4 + ] wining it back
 [ e4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ e x d5 ] , [ N x d5 ]  Surrender of the centre
 [ Q c2 ] , [ N d6 ]  The plan is to restrict the light-squared bishop and hopefully trade it off when Black would have some winning chances due to the bishop vs knight situation with pawns on both sides of the board.
 [ O-O ]  [ O-O-O ]  [ b5 ]  [ Q e7 ]  [ a4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ B a5 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ Q d6 ]  [ f4 ]  [ h6 ]  [ B x f6 ] , [ g x f6 ]  Trading pieces
 [ e4 ]  [ c6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e5 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ O-O ]  [ h6 ]  [ N b d2 ]  [ N e7 ]  [ a4 ] , [ c5 ]  Alternative variation: 8... [ Q c7 ] 9. [ N b3 ] O-O-O $13
 [ g4 ] , [ Q d5 + ]  and a nice combination leads to resining
 [ b x c3 ] , [ N x e4 ]  Le chevalier noir jump in City centre to open field space
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ] , [ c5 ]  A crazy-looking move to a beginner's eyes (well it was to mine when I first saw it!) but the Benoni lines this move foreshadows are some of the most aggressive lines at Black's disposal.
 [ N c6 ] , [ B b5 ]  He attacks the pawn so I pin his knight to his king.
 [ Q e6 ] , [ f5 ]  An interesting solution!
 [ a4 ] , [ h5 ]  Provoking [ h4 ] which loses to ... [ N g3 + ]  [ N d2 ] , [ N x e3 ]  The most forcing continuation since the Queen is under attack.
 [ K f1 ] , [ c2 ]  I plan 42...B-[ N4 ] driving the White B off the diagonal and forcing the successful Queening of the Pawn. I also have the QRP in reserve if a second Pawn needs to be advanced to force one through.
 [ B x e2 ]  [ Q x e2 ]  [ Q c7 ] , [ R f d1 ]  I had considered [ Q b5 ] but discarded it because of a6. [ R f d1 ] looks better because I can even things out again once you [ Q x c6 ] due to my B at a3. I'm guessing since you're initiating the trade though that I've lost tempo somewhere. Coaching note: If you were going to play a R move then better was Rad1. It was doing not a lot on a1. The R on [ f1 ] was protecting the K and should have remained on that side. The reason i initiated exchanges goes right back to your f3. you have ended up with a bad pawn structure relative to mine so if i trade down to a K and pawn ending then i must have an advantage.
 [ B e6 ] , [ B h6 ]  Looking to avoid giving black the open f-file after I swap bishops
 [ f3 ]  [ N e6 ]  [ B x e4 + ] , [ K f6 ]  I can still lose a piece very easily if I am careless but if now I move the rook ([ R b8 ] say) to [ K f7 ] Bd5. Anyway my opponent resigned here. A pity for two mistakes. but over all an interesting game for my standards... :-)
 [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B b4 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e3 ]  [ O-O ] , [ Q c2 ]  one of my favorite moves:)
 [ Q c3 ] , [ Q f4 ]  There was no way to prevent Bc2ch followed by mate as black owns the c-file.
 [ N x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ h3 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ c4 ]  [ B e5 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ B x f4 ]  [ R x e8 + ]  [ K x e8 ]  [ g x f4 ]  [ K d7 ]  [ K g3 ]  [ K d6 ]  [ h4 ]  [ b5 ] , [ N a5 ]  I think this is whites best practical chance
 [ Q x e8 ] , [ Q e2 ]  Probably the only move. With the isolated pawn endgames are almost always unfavourable for the side possessing one but black's control of the e-file with his queen gives him good chances. White's pieces are controlling the penetration squares on the e-file but they are unfortunately passive. Take a look at the [ f1 ] and [ d2 ] bishops! White is practically wasting his bishop pair.
 [ c6 ]  [ c x d6 ] , [ Q d7 ]  16. ..... [ Q d7 ] - first blood to Yours Truly. If the BQ should recapture on [ d6 ] then the BQ and the knight on [ f6 ] will be caught in a pawn fork. As a result I go a pawn up and a passer at that!
 [ Q b3 ] , [ b6 ]  Developing the queen in defense of [ b7 ] either with ...[ Q c7 ] or the simplifying ...[ Q b6 ] is much more common. The text weakens the [ c6 ] square but it remains unclear how White can exploit this.
 [ Q x b4 + ] , [ N d2 ]  at first I had been going to play [ Q d2 ] to offer a liquification but after ...[ B x f3 ] would my bad pawns be better than keeping on queens? probably the pawns being centeral would mean being doubled would not be the end of the world however I still think this was best.
 [ Q g8 ] , [ Q e5 ]  This position is almost the same as on move 39 except that Black's queen has been forced to g8. Since White has forced Black to block a square from his king [ K h7 ] (played on move 39) is now met by [ Q h2 # ] Now Black's queen must move and depending on where Black moves the queen White will transpose into one of the positions discussed on move 39 because of this tempo gain.
 [ e x d5 ] , [ a3 ]  planning to follow up with [ b4 ] to hopefully clamp down on blacks intended [ c5 ] break. However in light of blacks response this may prove to be a pipe dream
 [ Q x e3 ]  [ d x e3 + ] , [ K e2 ]  Here I feel I am in a good position to promote a pawn before he can but I somehow blow it. Well somehow like by being a human being with a translated toad's brain in his head. I end up like him getting impatient maybe. But I just make a series of weak and bad moves now from which I can't recover later.
 [ d x c5 ]  [ B x c5 ] , [ B d6 ]  I can't resist anymore. The counterthreat black has is that after BxB QxB he can play [ N e4 ] kicking my Q away. But I can go [ Q b4 ] or [ Q h3 ] and it doesn't seem my Q is in inmediate danger.
 [ N g f6 ]  [ B d3 ] , [ B e7 ]  With blacks last move he choose a well know variation of the Old Indian Defense it is solid & a little passive. But I have used this option against players who are very aggressive!
 [ B x c8 ]  [ R x c8 ] , [ N e4 ]  And for the first time I give up for now on the pawn on c4. I'm down more material I think black was a bit surprised but handled it well. I'm hoping to jump into the outpost on [ f6 ] and try to cause a scene maybe fork something claim the open d file with the rook now on b1. Who knows.
 [ Q e4 ] , [ B f3 ]  Threatening the queen again
 [ Q b7 ]  [ R h e1 ]  [ R f b8 ]  [ b3 ] , [ Q b4 ]  18. ......... [ Q b4 ] - the Wicked Witch creeps closer and closer to Henry.
 [ d7 + ] , [ K d8 ]  In this position his only other option was 38...[ K e7 ] but then I promote right after 39.Rb8. So I basically achieved my goal of making him think real hard about the position. Note: He did take some time to come up with this move.
 [ b3 ]  [ a x b3 ]  [ a x b3 ] , [ K c3 ]  39. [ K c3 ] - king fork! Yes Wolfgang's bishop can still back it up along the a2-[ g8 ] diagonal but my knight will attack it on the next turn and then the black b pawn will be eliminated.
 [ K g7 ] , [ N g4 ]  or had it?? Before making my 26th move I had solved for mate after 26...[ K h8 ] (If I was playing the white pieces.) After my 26th move I solved for mate after Kg7. It's been so long I couldn't replicate it again if I tried but I know it involved 27.[ Q f7 ]  [ N g8 ] , [ R c2 ]  plans to bring in the troops
 [ R c6 ]  [ R x c6 ]  [ b x c6 ] , [ R a6 ]  If you have a space advantage heading into the endgame the rule of thumb is to exchange pieces not pawns.
 [ R d g8 ] , [ B d4 ]  ([ B x h8 ] is met with Rg1+)
 [ N c3 ] , [ B g7 ]  ..
 [ g5 ]  [ g3 ] , [ K g6 ]  He's planning to get around the pawns through h5-g4-...
 [ B x h3 ]  [ R x e7 ]  [ B x e7 ]  [ Q x c6 ]  [ Q x c6 ]  [ B x c6 ]  [ R c8 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ R b8 ]  [ g x h3 ]  [ B x c5 ]  [ d x c5 ]  [ R x b7 ]  [ R x d5 ] , [ R b5 ]  Sooo I don't know what my opponent was thinking when she played Bxh3. Maybe she missed that I can simply take back on [ e7 ] eliminating all counter play on her part and leaving me free to take c6. Regardless I was able to quickly trade down material with my opponents help when she played [ B x c5 ] which is a mistake. I think she wanted to make the position less complicated so she wouldn't miss something because she had less than 15 mins left on the clock at this time. She just wanted to get to the 40 move mark and get the additional 30 mins added to her clock. Unfortunately for her this left me with a rather simple endgame to play.
 [ Q x h5 ] , [ B d4 ]  Solid move--this attacks Pb2. If white trades he will need to move [ N c7 ] or lose P[ b2 ] to the black queen.
 [ R x f7 + ]  [ R x f7 ]  [ Q x f7 + ]  [ K e5 ]  [ N x b7 ] , [ g5 ]  As black I would resign here as now I'd feel that there's nothing else left to learn since Sue is too far down. But I can understand her intentions to stay in since I used to believe and thus would not resign until mate was forced which will happen here.
 [ K e1 ] , [ Q x c1 + ]  Ugg dead Bishop and check!
 [ B x e4 ]  [ O-O ]  [ h6 ]  [ e3 ]  [ B e7 ] , [ N h4 ]  And here did I a mistake was in thought that opponent would capture [ B g2 ] first and forgotted that opponent moved [ B e7 ] in capturing psition for [ N h4 ] which also went the nevt move.
 [ Q x d8 ]  [ N x d8 ] , [ K x d8 ]  The position looks dangerously close and it is not guaranteed that white can win by pawn promotion especially considering the proximity of the king to the promo squares and pawns but this is the chance I was willing to take and I had a plan which involved placing all the pawns on dark squares manuevering the king to a useful postion and with hope pushing a supported pawn to a win. I had thoughts of trying to get a trade of bishp for pawn also.
 [ R e6 e2 ]  [ g5 ]  [ R e2 e5 ]  [ Q c6 ]  [ B a5 ] , [ b6 ]  white bishop is threats me so i have to trap it
 [ e x d4 ] , [ B x f3 ]  I sieze the opportunity with this move to either mess up my opponent's pawn structure with [ g x f3 ] or win the pawn on [ d4 ] after the queen recaptures. (I hadn't thought of my doubly-attacked knight on [ d5 ] when I played this game. Oh well...)
 [ d6 ] , [ d4 ]  2.[ d4 ] - Michael has played the Pirc Defense and allowed me to get control in the centre.
 [ e4 ] , [ d x e4 ]  It's my opponent's mistake of not taking the Knight. I don't know why he did this move but I perhaps had no reason to play 11...[ e4 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ Q x e4 ] , [ f3 ]  That's reasonable... only for then.
 [ R h7 ] , [ N d4 ]  and here it is now black doesn't have [ R h6 ] any more so the e pawn is lost unless he defends it with the king
 [ N c6 ]  [ h x g5 ]  [ N x d4 ] , [ N f3 ]  swap off when you're up
 [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ e5 ]  [ d3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ g3 ]  [ B b4 ]  [ B d2 ]  [ N x c3 ]  [ B x c3 ]  [ B x c3 + ]  [ b x c3 ]  [ O-O ] , [ B g2 ]  And this is one of my favourite situations too. I still don't know why because it is not even clear white is or not better.
 [ h3 ] , [ N h2 ]  Now White can play the move.
 [ Q d7 ] , [ a5 ]  and I'll push my pawn a little further
 [ B g3 ] , [ a6 ]  slightly better is [ N d5 ] attacking the R
 [ R x b5 ] , [ N x b2 ]  Seems pawns are falling all over the board now and one more will yet fall.
 [ Q x f5 + ]  [ K h8 ]  [ Q g4 ] , [ e3 ]  And the mistakes keep coming GK recommends trading rooks and repositioning the knight but I may have tried to save my rook for a little longer this move essentially gives white another pawn.
 [ e3 ]  [ e6 ] , [ B x c4 ]  5. [ B x c4 ] - gambit pawn regained.
 [ a6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ R d8 ]  [ Q h3 ] , [ Q d7 ]  22... [ B c8 ] 23. [ Q h4 ] [ Q d7 ] 24. [ N e6 + ] [ Q x e6 ] 25. [ R x e6 ] [ B x e6 ] Survives a little longer.
 [ R a1 ] , [ R c2 ]  Inviting the other knight to move.
 [ R c4 ]  [ c3 ]  [ R e4 + ]  [ K d2 ]  [ R x e5 ]  [ R h e1 ]  [ R f5 ]  [ f3 ]  [ R f4 ]  [ K e3 ] , [ R c4 ]  Now Black is a pawn to the good still with some pressure on the open file. There is some urgency to exchange because White can pressure [ a7 ] if given time.
 [ K d7 ]  [ B e6 + ] , [ K e8 ]  With this move it became apparent that Black was either going to keep his K at [ e8 ] or we were going to draw through perpetual. No fun in that.
 [ a5 ] , [ f x e5 ]  ? Is this the losing move? Whites kingside and e-pawn are now very vulnerable indeed.
 [ K h3 ] , [ R h1 # ]  Checkmate! I hope you liked my annotation. It was meant to be humorous.
 [ R e5 ]  [ R c2 ]  [ K f5 ]  [ R c1 ]  [ R d5 ]  [ R c2 ]  [ R d3 + ] , [ K f2 ]  The computer also calls this a mistake. But the best alternative it gives (50. [ K e2 ] [ h2 ] 51. [ R c1 ] [ K e4 ] 52. [ R h1 ] [ R a3 ] 53. [ K d2 ] c4) is just as dismal. The computer now rates this position -8.75 against me.
 [ K e8 ]  [ N c7 + ]  [ K d8 ]  [ N x a8 ]  [ B e7 ] , [ h3 ]  he resigns here his Knight is toast no matter where he moves. he would be -6 after the N moves and I take.
 [ N b3 ] , [ h6 ]  another pawn move...
 [ N e2 ]  [ K b8 ] , [ f4 ]  I regarded this move as practically forced. My game notes... "So right now I am seriously worrying about the exposed state of my king. Well actually that has been a worry since move 5 or so! And I am considering what to do about it. His move could signal a desire to move the knight (probably to [ b4 ] possibly to e5) and I have to look out for queen traps then. And I learned early on in my chess career that castling to different sides meant the person whose pawns reached the king first would have a general advantage... So what to do? Well I would *love* to castle long even if that does mean that my one-pawn advantage is lessened a bit. But I don't think I will actually have the chance to do that. - 13.b2-[ b3 ] is a no-go on strategic grounds as he will just exchange the dark bishops and have an open avenue to my king. - 13.d2-[ [ d4 ] ] is blocked unless I prepare by [ [ [ [ c3 ] ] ] ] first. - 13.c2-[ [ [ [ c3 ] ] ] ] is also a no-go as it leads to the unravelling of my kingside. Main line: 13.[ [ [ [ c3 ] ] ] ] [ R [ [ [ [ d3 ] ] ] ] ] 14.[ N [ [ f4 ] ] ] [ R d8 ] 15.[ [ d4 ] ] [ [ [ g5 ] ] ] 16.[ N e2 ] [ [ f4 ] ] 17.[ N c4 ] [ f3 ] -/+ - 13.d2-[ [ [ [ d3 ] ] ] ] does not inspire a lot of confidence either I think. The only thing going for it is that it allows Bc1-[ d2 ] and I think I know who is the better after 13.[ [ [ [ d3 ] ] ] ] [ [ [ g5 ] ] ] 14.B[ d2 ] [ [ f4 ] ] 15.[ N c4 ] [ B x c4 ] 16.[ Q x c4 ] [ R e8 ] 17.[ Q e4 ] [ Q x e4 ] 18.[ d x e4 ] [ R x e4 ] - and it sure ain't me! However the GK analysis points to [ [ [ [ d3 ] ] ] ] as being the best option after all after 13.[ [ [ [ d3 ] ] ] ] [ [ [ g5 ] ] ] 14.f4! gx[ [ f4 ] ] 15.Qx[ [ f4 ] ] [ B g7 ] 16.O-O [ R h e8 ] 17.[ R f2 ] N[ [ d4 ] ] 18.Nx[ [ d4 ] ] Bx[ [ d4 ] ] 19.[ [ [ [ c3 ] ] ] ] [ B c5 ] with practically equal play.
 [ B g4 ] , [ h3 ]  There has been some very informative discussion in the comments to my last game about the advisability of [ h3 ] or a3. It seems to be a question of timing. In this position white has problems if black is able to play Ng4. So the provocation of [ b g4 ] looks to be timely.
 [ c x b6 ]  [ Q x g5 ] , [ f6 ]  i think i started to coast after this not making any particularly note worthy moves
 [ Q e2 ]  [ K e8 ] , [ K f2 ]  This is the mistake as the move needs preparation. Chessmaster preferred a6.
 [ N c6 ]  [ N b d2 ] , [ O-O-O ]  Bringing my rook onto the half-open file...
 [ b6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ f5 ]  [ B c4 + ] , [ K h8 ]  ? this just allows a fork do you see it??
 [ N d5 ]  [ g3 ]  [ R d7 ]  [ d4 ]  [ R a4 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ B a5 ]  [ B d2 ]  [ b5 ]  [ R e8 + ]  [ K h7 ]  [ B x a5 ]  [ R x a5 ]  [ R c8 ]  [ R c7 ]  [ R x c7 ]  [ N x c7 ] , [ N e5 ]  Good attack with my knight!
 [ Q d5 ]  [ O-O ]  [ Q e4 ]  [ Q x e4 ]  [ N x e4 ] , [ N d2 ]  ?!
 [ N f3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ h3 ] , [ B h5 ]  Keeping the pin eventually black might play [ B g6 ] to offer a trade of bishops.
 [ h x g6 ] , [ g3 ]  Advance pawn to protect the king.
 [ R g8 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ Q d4 ] , [ R a4 ]  trying to confuse the issue at hand; best is of course [ Q c7 ] (again: Botvinnik) or maybe Qa7...
 [ K e4 ] , [ N d6 + ]  This prepares for an advance of the c-Pawn a move which will improve white's chances considerably.
 [ b4 ]  [ B b6 ] , [ g4 ]  ok i know white trying to move my knight i don't want to allow white to do this so i move my prawn to [ h6 ]  [ h6 ]  [ d3 ] , [ d6 ]  open my prawn up a bit allow my bishop to see the whites prawn
 [ R a e5 + ] , [ K d3 ]  ? And suddenly I allow rook penetration lol
 [ K a3 ]  [ Q x b1 ] , [ h4 ]  [ B b2 ] would be a delaying tactic.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ] , [ f4 ]  The King gambit
 [ Q f7 + ]  [ K g4 ]  [ h3 + ]  [ K x f3 ]  [ f x e6 + ]  [ K e4 ]  [ K d2 ]  [ c1 = Q + ]  [ R x c1 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ R e1 + ]  [ N e2 ] , [ R x e2 # ]  Completing a pretty beautiful trap.
 [ Q c1 ]  [ R x b1 ]  [ Q x b1 ]  [ B d4 ]  [ Q b5 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ R c1 ] , [ B x a2 ]  This had been in my line of fire for several moves but now that my own "a" pawn has a guard I decided I could take it.
 [ R h f8 ]  [ d3 ]  [ R a e8 ] , [ B d2 ]  ? A blunder. White resigns because now the pawns begin to fall and there is a material deficit.
 [ Q e1 ] , [ Q d6 ]  no thanks i need her.
 [ Q d1 ]  [ c6 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ h3 ]  [ B x f3 ] , [ g x f3 ]  The bishop is stopped but the pawn structure is off.
 [ N x e4 ]  [ R e8 ] , [ N g5 ]  It's this move.
 [ K x e5 ]  [ R d7 ]  [ R f6 + ]  [ K e3 ]  [ R g6 ]  [ K f3 ] , [ c3 ]  passed pawns must be pushed.
 [ c5 ] , [ b x c5 + ]  The computer prefers 38.[ h4 ] but I would first stall White's kingside play and then play ...[ c x b4 ] manoeuvre the king to White's a-pawn take it and march up the b-pawn a simple and effective plan.
 [ N g3 ] , [ B d4 ]  Pinning his b pawn to his rook and keeping his bishop in [ c8 ] to defend his weak pawn.
 [ e x d5 ] , [ c x d5 ]  now mate in two moves
 [ a4 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ B g2 ]  [ R c8 ]  [ a x b5 ]  [ c x b5 ] , [ R x a7 ]  19. [ R x a7 ] - Mike regains material equality and gives me a bone in the throat - aaargh and double aargh!
 [ e4 ] , [ e6 ]  The French to which White's automatic reply is 2. [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ d4 ] , [ B d6 ]  A good aggressive posting for Black's B.
 [ R x b2 ]  [ a4 ]  [ R c8 ]  [ Q d7 ] , [ R b1 ]  Hoping for 29.Rxb1?? ... when Black mates in two. But I don't need to take the rook. Somewhat better was to double rooks along the c-file 29...[ R b c2 ] then pull back the advanced rook to defend Black's second rank: 30...R2c7.
 [ b4 ] , [ Q h4 ]  Trying to retake the initiative with threats against the pawns on [ h2 ] and c4.
 [ R b6 + ]  [ K c5 ]  [ R h6 ] , [ R x a2 ]  51. ..... [ R x a2 ] - white's final pawn drops. I now think that the WR and WK have far too much to do.
 [ O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ R e8 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ Q c2 ]  [ c6 ]  [ B x e4 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ f4 ] , [ Q d5 ]  after [ Q x e5 ] also Qd5...
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ c4 ] , [ c5 ]  Locking up the centre. I don't like this overmuch as once the action begins White will have the first chance to get his licks in. The less strategic scope there is the more likely (I believe) that Black will be thrown onto the defensive. If White's winning prospects happen to be slender how much skinnier would Black's be?
 [ N f6 ] , [ N c3 ]  normaly peaople play [ c4 ] so this will be something new and interesting
 [ h6 ] , [ B d3 ]  another standard move. I didn't really want to give up the B. but I planned to castle long and so didn't mind removing black's B lifting Q off back rank in the process.
 [ B e7 ] , [ Q c2 ]  Qb3!? trying to defend the b4-pawn for ezample 13 [ Q b3 ] [ a5 ] 14 [ a3 ] and white is ready to play [ c4 ]  [ a5 ]  [ a3 ]  [ R f d8 ]  [ R a b1 ] , [ a x b4 ]  White was threatening [ c4 ]  [ N g6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ Q d7 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ N h5 ] , [ R f d1 ]  20 Nxe5?! Nxg3! 21 [ N x d7 ] [ N x e2 + ] 22 [ K h1 ] [ R x d7 ] and Black is slightly better with three pieces against a queen 20 [ B x e5 ] [ N x e5 ] 21 [ N x e5 ] [ Q x d2 ] 22 [ Q x d2 ] [ R x d2 ] 23 [ B x h5 ] [ g6 ] 24 [ B f3 ] [ B f6 ] and [ b x c4 ] with some winning probabilities
 [ g5 ]  [ N e2 ] , [ g4 ]  22. ...... [ g4 ] - trying to deflect my f pawn away from [ e4 ] which will allow N[ e4 ] next move so Henry goes back to f2.
 [ Q g4 ]  [ R d7 ]  [ K g1 ]  [ e3 ]  [ Q c4 + ] , [ K f8 ]  Not [ K h8 ] which would allow perpetual check. Not [ R f7 ] which gives up too much mobility.
 [ d4 ]  [ e x d3 ]  [ e ] , [ p ]  AND EN-PASSENT FROM BLACK! So he did have something up his sleeve.
 [ h4 + ]  [ K h5 ]  [ N b5 ]  [ N x b2 ]  [ N x c7 ] , [ B d3 + ]  I take perhaps my longest think of the game here. Black is now poised to run connected passers down my throat. Can I survive the immediate danger and get my knight into an attack? I think so.
 [ B e7 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ R d7 + ]  [ K e6 ] , [ R x b7 ]  Material is even. I am playing a piece under in a 5/5 game against a much stronger than me opponent.
 [ K x h6 ] , [ Q x f4 + ]  55. ...... [ Q x f4 + ] - well there is no way I can lose this and now Bob waves the white flag. True he can bring his king to the g column but Henry will wend his way to the f column forcing the WK to the edge. Glenda will then move to the g column as far away as possible from the WK to avoid stalemate. Henry will then move opposite the WK with 1 square separating the kings. After that there is no way Bob can prevent Glenda from giving his king the Kiss of Death! Whew what a game!
 [ e5 ] , [ g3 ]  2. [ g3 ] - white usually likes to fianchetto a lsb on the kingside in the English Opening and Janet is no exception.
 [ B f7 ]  [ N e6 ]  [ B x h5 ] , [ c4 ]  Black tries to get some counterplay but this is really a nothing move I think [ N g7 ] was better
 [ f x g5 ] , [ N x d4 ]  My kingside looks scattered. At this point the only thing keeping me going is the few dozen Stonewall games I had played and even won a few. The board does not look all that alien to me now and for all practical purposes I could have started the game as a SW game. I am not confident but as long as I am in slightly charted waters I am a little okay. I did not like losing that pawn but I also feel it it not a necessary piece for now and I am about to lose bigger fish anyway as my next move is to sacrifice my LS bishop on H7.
 [ Q e7 ]  [ Q h5 ]  [ h6 ] , [ Q f7 ]  Whit's queen assumes a strong post. The imminent threat is exchanging queens which probably favors white more than black though black may welcome the riddance of white's most formidable piece. There is also a threat against the pawn on [ g7 ] which for now forces black to keep his queen home to defend it.
 [ b4 ]  [ Q c7 ] , [ N f4 ]  Very strong place for this Knight.
 [ R f2 + ] , [ K d1 ]  Forced.
 [ Q x g7 + ]  [ K d8 ]  [ N e6 + ]  [ B x e6 ]  [ Q f6 + ]  [ K c8 ]  [ d x e6 ] , [ Q x c4 ]  34. ….. [ Q x c4 ] - suddenly there is only one lonely white pawn on the queenside. On the kingside however there is a different story. There is 4 potentially lethal white pawns! Eeek and double eeek!
 [ O-O ] , [ Q c2 ]  preparing a battery after [ B d3 ] and a probable [ e5 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ B b4 + ] , [ N b d2 ]  Bogo-Indian defence Gruenfeld variation (E11)
 [ b x c6 ]  [ R x a4 + ]  [ K x a4 ]  [ B x c6 + ]  [ K a5 ]  [ f5 ]  [ K b6 ]  [ B e4 ]  [ c6 ]  [ B x c6 ]  [ K x c6 ] , [ g3 ]  ??????????????????????? I honestly don't know what possessed me to do make this horrible horrible move. [ f4 ] or [ h4 ] win easily. Must be the lack of sleep. :)
 [ Q c8 ] , [ B d8 # ]  This move was a bit cheeky to mate since any bishop move mates. Thanks for looking at the game I hope you enjoyed it!
 [ e5 ]  [ f4 ]  [ Q h4 + ]  [ g3 ]  [ Q e7 ]  [ f x e5 ]  [ Q x e5 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ d5 ]  !? Opens the position up but White is ahead in development.
 [ B e3 ] , [ b5 ]  Wasting no time in attacking the Queenside.
 [ R e1 ] , [ N g4 ]  Black does not want bishops in the Sicilian. They are generally too deadly.
 [ h5 ]  [ B c1 ]  [ N f6 d5 ]  [ B x d5 ] , [ N x d5 ]  27. ...... [ N x d5 ] - B for N trade. It will be interesting to see just which piece is better. Meanwhile Glenda decided to remind the BK that she is very interested in him when she is not tied down to defending - poor put upon Glenda!
 [ c x d5 ] , [ e x d5 ]  Both sides have isolated d pawns but White's is better defended.
 [ B e6 ]  [ R a e1 ] , [ N h6 ]  16....Nh6?? black has a very dangerous position and should move his queen (may be to [ d8 ] not [ f6 ] because of 17.[ B x d6 ] that will lead to easy game for white).
 [ R d8 ] , [ B d4 ]  29. [ B d4 ] - Fou Lenoir unites two of these pawns but I fear it will not wash in the long run.
 [ Q e2 ]  [ N x h1 ]  [ R x h1 ] , [ R f e8 ]  I did not see anything else of value that I could play. This move would provide extra firepower and enable me to launch my Q into battle.
 [ d4 ] , [ B b4 ]  This isn't exactly a book move for the Exchange Variation. But because the knight is here I'm developing my bishop a la Winawer. If he didn't block the pin I probably would have exchanged the bishop for knight to double his pawns
 [ K x g7 ]  [ B e5 + ]  [ f6 ] , [ B b2 ]  Getting to the end game; every Pawn is valuable.
 [ B d7 ]  [ R f d1 ]  [ Q f6 ] , [ e5 ]  good move by me
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ N c6 ]  I am not normally a Spanish game player but since it is what jsteven1 is familiar with I thought I give it a go.
 [ Q d2 ] , [ N h5 ]  It is possible to now play 12. [ B x h6 ] [ g x h6 ] 13. [ Q x h6 ] [ N g7 ] 14. [ R a d1 ] but it is not totally clear.
 [ B f4 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ B f3 ] , [ N b6 ]  The first "new" move.
 [ a6 ]  [ g4 ] , [ N f d7 ]  preventing the king's wing pawn storm with tempo...
 [ Q d8 ] , [ R x a6 ]  White now makes his move. He has delayed the capture to place Black's queen in a less influential position and to block movement of the two rooks. Note that Black could have placed his queen on [ b7 ] to stop the capture of the knight. After 19. [ R x a6 ] Black can capture with the queen and is winning easily.
 [ B x f6 ]  [ R g8 ]  [ R e1 + ] , [ K d7 ]  Or 17. ...[ B e6 ] 18. [ Q h3 ] covering the mate threat so I can take the self-pinned bishop.
 [ N c6 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ B x e5 ]  [ B x e5 ] , [ Q x e5 ]  A pawn for a minor piece leaves white down in material and black is threatening 20 ... [ Q x h2 ] mate.
 [ b3 ] , [ f4 ]  This was to produce 28. [ b x c4 ] e3. I somehow suspected that white would not see the mate.
 [ K e2 ]  [ N d4 + ] , [ K d2 ]  If [ N x d4 ] [ e x d4 ] and then the knight on [ g4 ] is immune due to hx[ g4 ] [ B x g4 + ] winning the queen
 [ R e1 ] , [ h4 ]  ...continuing the desperate push...
 [ h4 ]  [ R g h3 + ]  [ K g2 ]  [ R a g3 + ]  [ K f2 ]  [ R h2 + ]  [ K x g3 ]  [ R x b2 ]  [ R d5 ]  [ R b3 + ]  [ K g2 ] , [ R b4 ]  
 [ d x c5 ]  [ Q x c5 + ]  [ K h1 ]  [ b4 ]  [ B b2 ]  [ Q c2 ]  [ B d4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ R c1 ]  [ Q x a2 ]  [ B x c5 ] , [ e x f3 ]  [ f4 ] was threatened
 [ e3 ] , [ e5 ]  Amsterdam Attack. The main line continues 2. [ c4 ] [ d6 ] 3. [ N c3 ] [ N c6 ] 4. [ b3 ] Nf6.
 [ B g5 ] , [ d4 ]  8...[ B e6 ] is also possible but it was here I began to plan on meeting a capture on [ f6 ] with gx[ f6 ] opening the g-file for a kingside attack. This move provokes the capture.
 [ R g3 ] , [ R d7 ]  24. ........ [ R d7 ] - I decide not to move Fou Leblanc but to attack his dsb instead. If he takes Fou Leblanc I take his dsb establishing the Bone in the Throat on d7. If he moves his bishop out of the way I trade rooks on [ d1 ] which is even better!
 [ B a4 ] , [ N g8 ]  and the first piece he developed he puts back giving white a significant advantage.
 [ B e3 ]  [ B b6 ] , [ Q d2 ]  No use for 7. [ N x c6 ] [ b x c6 ] 8. [ e5 ] [ B x e3 ] 9. [ f x e3 ] [ N d5 ] 10. [ N x d5 ] [ c x d5 ] 11. [ Q d4 ] 0-0 12. [ c4 ] Re8...
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ B b4 ]  I played the Winawer variation.
 [ Q h3 + ]  [ K e2 ] , [ a5 ]  This seems to be somewhat slow as the knight is not needed here any more - the d3-bishop controls c2. But it is no big mistake since black can now play e6-with tempo.
 [ Q x c3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ b4 ] , [ a5 ]  A faulty plan since White ends up with a much more active rook. 13...[ R c8 ] aiming at the queen and the backward pawn on [ c2 ] was best.
 [ e3 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ B d2 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ f3 ]  I am guessing that White was trying to prevent [ N e4 ] but I think moving the f pawn here compromises the K's safety slightly.
 [ N g3 ]  [ d4 ]  [ B d2 ]  [ Q d5 ]  [ R g1 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ N d7 ] , [ h4 ]  I believe this to be a novelty. at least I didn't find it in my database. 16. [ B x g4 ] and 16 [ f3 ] are the most popular moves.
 [ R c1 ]  [ b5 ]  [ R x c6 ] , [ B b7 ]  Black figures he wants his fianchetto and will get it at whatever cost but foolishly wastes a pawn.
 [ g x f4 ]  [ g x f4 ] , [ N x f4 ]  My counter is: whatever piece retaked there is pinned. Now it's the other rook's turn.
 [ d5 ]  [ a4 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ a5 ]  [ e3 ]  [ a6 ]  [ K b8 ] , [ R f b1 + ]  I tried pushing up a pawn but....
 [ R f5 ]  [ N f1 ]  [ Q f6 ]  [ N g3 ]  [ K f7 ]  [ N x f5 ]  [ e x f5 ]  [ c5 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ c x b6 ] , [ Q e6 ]  a really horrible move
 [ e x d4 ] , [ N x d4 ]  Now it is White's knight that is centralized.
 [ R d7 x d2 ]  [ B x d2 ] , [ Q h3 + ]  Trying to peek in through the kingside
 [ h3 ]  [ f4 ]  [ K d3 ]  [ K e5 ]  [ K e2 ] , [ K d4 ]  Not the most accurate but it doesn't matter. Faster would be 44... [ K e4 ] 45. [ K [ f2 ] ] [ d4 ] 46. [ K e2 ] [ d3 + ] 47. [ K d2 ] [ f3 ] 48. [ K e1 ] [ K e3 ] 49. [ K d1 ] [ f2 ] 50. [ K c1 ] [ f1 = Q + ] 51. [ K b2 ] [ Q e2 + ] 52. [ K b1 ] (52. [ K c1 ] Qc2#) 52... d2.
 [ c4 + ]  [ K h1 ] , [ c3 ]  Black's first real mistake. The idea behind ..[ c3 ] was to attack with the doomed pawn and extract further benefits (e.g. ripping open the b or c file and activating the [ g7 ] bishop). It transpires that Black's compensation for this tempo is not complete if White continues accurately. Black is better off playing with pieces via ..[ N e3 ] (gaining the dark-squared bishop) or the tricky ..[ N d e5 ] forcing White to expend time to pick up the [ c4 ] pawn (and thereby place a piece on an undesirable square). The issue of how to return "dead" material (e.g. something you cannot hold forever) is highly complex and situation-oriented. [If interested in this subject I recommend studying the Benko gambit which arises from a Benoni structure where White has 3 playable alternatives - 1) accept the gambit 2) ignore the gambit and 3) expend an extra tempo sacrificing the doomed pawn hoping to push White's pieces offside.] Alternative variation: 20... [ N e3 ] 21. [ B x e3 ] [ Q x e3 ] 22. Bx[ c4 ] [ Q d4 ]  [ b x c3 ]  [ b x c3 ]  [ B x g4 ] , [ c x d2 ]  An alternative is 22...f5!? with complications that seem to favor White though there is plenty of room for either side to err. Check out the following variation: Alternative variation: 22... [ f5 ] 23. [ N c4 ] [ f x e4 ] 24. [ N d6 ] [ Q c5 ] 25. [ B e6 ] [ K h8 ] 26. [ B e7 ] [ c2 ]  [ B x d7 ]  [ N f6 + ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ Q e3 ]  [ R a2 ] , [ B b5 ]  Here the Black bishop finally exploits the weakness on [ b5 ] with tempo. Unfortunately it transpires that this square is not worth occupying - the d-pawn is too strong!
 [ B x e3 + ] , [ Q x e3 ]  somewhat better seems maybe [ N x e3 ] Qh4! ([ Q g5 ] [ R f3 ] [ N e5 ] Rg3) [ R c3 ] (against Ne5) Bc6...
 [ K f2 ] , [ g3 + ]  cold as ice...
 [ h x g2 + ] , [ B x g2 ]  Seems better to me than Kxg2.
 [ N x c3 ] , [ Q h4 ]  Optimism is a wonderful thing.
 [ e5 ]  [ B b6 ] , [ e6 ]  Better is d5. This move leaves the pawn vulnerable.
 [ N f3 ] , [ e6 ]  Still pretty much the main line here
 [ e x d5 ] , [ N e7 ]  All very natural moves by both sides. I have a slight worse pawn structure but a temporary superiority in the center.
 [ f4 ] , [ B b7 ]  here it is the bishop assuming the best position
 [ N c8 ]  [ N e f5 ] , [ f6 ]  24. ...... [ f6 ] - giving my [ e5 ] pawn more support guess I should have swapped off Fou Leblanc for that horsie right now.
 [ N x g6 ]  [ h x g6 ] , [ Q e2 ]  Holding the e-pawn but locking in the King's Bishop.
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ a3 ]  [ c5 ]  [ d5 ]  [ d6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ c x d5 ] , [ B f5 ]  It's not clear yet what is the best square for this bishop so better to continue with the development of the kingside with ...g6. Here's a game with a similar opening: 1.[ d4 ] [ N f6 ] 2.[ c4 ] [ e6 ] 3.[ a3 ] [ c5 ] 4.[ d5 ] ex[ d5 ] 5.cx[ d5 ] [ g6 ] 6.[ N c3 ] [ B g7 ] 7.[ e4 ] [ d6 ] 8.[ B d3 ] 0-0 9.[ N g e2 ] [ R e8 ] 10.0-0 [ a6 ] 11.[ f3 ] [ N b d7 ] 12.[ b4 ] cx[ b4 ] 13.ax[ b4 ] [ Q b6 ] 14.[ K h1 ] [ N [ e5 ] ] 15.[ N a4 ] [ Q d8 ] 16.[ B e3 ] [ B d7 ] 17.[ N b6 ] [ N x d3 ] 18.[ Q x d3 ] [ B b5 ] 19.[ Q c2 ] [ R b8 ] 20.R[ a3 ] [ N d7 ] 21.[ N x d7 ] [ Q x d7 ] 22.[ R e1 ] [ R b c8 ] 23.[ Q d2 ] [ B x e2 ] 24.[ Q x e2 ] [ f5 ] 25.[ B f4 ] fx[ e4 ] 26.fx[ e4 ] [ B c3 ] 27.[ R x c3 ] [ R x c3 ] 28.[ e5 ] dx[ e5 ] 29.[ Q d2 ] R[ c4 ] 30.Bx[ e5 ] Q[ f5 ] 31.[ B g3 ] [ R x e1 ] 32.[ Q x e1 ] Q[ e4 ] 0-1 Laengl M-Horvath G/Cattolica 1992 Line
 [ B g5 ]  [ c5 ]  [ c3 ]  [ h6 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ e3 ]  [ N h5 ]  [ B g3 ]  [ N x g3 ]  [ h x g3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N b d2 ] , [ B d6 ]  Also good are [ B e7 ] and a6.
 [ K d2 ]  [ Q x b1 ] , [ N d3 ]  White should have resigned but played on until he blundered his knight.
 [ K c7 ] , [ R f7 + ]  Done! I was already sure my opponent didn't realized that by doing so he gave me an one-move mate threat. If he doesn't mate me I win!
 [ e x d6 ]  [ d x c3 ]  [ d x e7 ]  [ Q x e7 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ c x b2 ]  [ Q x b2 ]  [ B x f3 ] , [ g x f3 ]  After grinding out 10 captures each side is equal on points. Here I would again credit baldvin2 with a positional advantage but apparently that is not the case.
 [ a4 ] , [ N x g6 ]  16. [ N x g6 ] - black tries to counter on the queenside with her pawn push to [ a4 ] - she does not know what I am going to unleash on her - although black is a piece down you would not believe that on move 15 she was going to cop Old Matey 4 moves down the line.
 [ Q h4 ]  [ R f2 ] , [ R f h8 ]  Mate in 5.
 [ B b2 ] , [ R d8 ]  Grab the open file. If he contests it I'll swap rooks grab the e-pawn and then aim to keep my pawns to the white squares.
 [ B x e6 + ]  [ K c7 ]  [ f3 ] , [ B f5 + ]  The fork removes white's last piece. Sure it double's the black pawns normally something I would avoid but in this case those pawns form a beautiful wall from which white's king has no escape.
 [ Q c8 ] , [ N b6 ]  If [ Q d8 ] then [ N d7 ] saves the Rook. I am not after the Rook however.
 [ N x e4 ] , [ f x e4 ]  Black now has quite the pawn chain extending. GameKnot scores this as -0.22 advantage Black. Fritz says the game is equal. I think I agree with Fritz at this point. Although Black has the nice pawn chain she also has doubled e-pawns. Then again Black's [ R f1 ] now has a half-open file. Chess can be confusing at times.
 [ N f3 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ d x c4 ] , [ B x c4 ]  6. [ B x c4 ] - smooth development so far.
 [ R h7 + ]  [ B f7 ] , [ R f x f7 + ]  Now white is only a pawn down but not winning by any means!
 [ f6 ]  [ Q a8 + ] , [ N c8 ]  Kind of late for a rook rescue. This sacrifice gives white both the knight and rook.
 [ K h6 ] , [ R h8 + ]  2
 [ Q e3 ]  [ Q h3 ]  [ Q f4 ]  [ N f5 ]  [ R a3 ] , [ Q h4 ]  Exchanging queens only helps black.
 [ R h e8 ]  [ B a5 ]  [ B c7 ]  [ B x c7 ]  [ K x c7 ] , [ R a e1 ]  The position is now roughly equal but in white's favor. I now try to activate my knight. Notice that doubled pawns actually do come in handy - the pawn on [ f6 ] prevents the white knight from making uncomfortable threats at [ e5 ] and g5.
 [ R a6 + ]  [ K f5 ] , [ B e7 ]  best was g4; for a little while now...
 [ R x g6 ]  [ R e7 ]  [ B a4 ]  [ R x c7 ] , [ R x g2 + ]  39. ........ [ R x g2 + ] - pawn trade.
 [ R e1 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ] , [ Q c5 ]  The only move with a slight advantage. Now 22. [ N f3 ] Survives just fine.
 [ N c6 ] , [ g4 ]  this is a strong move! my plan is to go qd2! winning his knight!!
 [ N e4 ]  [ B b2 ]  [ a4 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ B x d4 ]  [ e3 ]  [ B g7 ] , [ g4 ]  another white mistake
 [ R c7 + ] , [ K g8 ]  practically forced...
 [ N f6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ B e7 ] , [ e3 ]  Here we transpose back into "book"
 [ g4 ]  [ g5 ] , [ K b3 ]  What else is there?
 [ g x f6 ] , [ N d4 ]  Double hitting [ d5 ] and preparing to route the knight to [ b5 ] where it will assist with the White plan of invading on the c-file.
 [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ B x d5 ]  [ c x d5 ] , [ N b5 ]  15. [ N b5 ] - the black d pawn is isolated and hanging and is about to drop off.
 [ R x e2 ] , [ B x b6 ]  Although i'm down material wise I have a very strong attack and white has a semi-decent counter which could or could not work out.
 [ N f e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ b x c5 ] , [ Q x g8 ]  2nd castle gone
 [ Q x d3 ]  [ B x f1 ] , [ R x f1 ]  It was not the better outcome I could have organized but I'm still and exchange up. An unactive R waits for his moment.
 [ B x c7 ]  [ B c6 ] , [ N e4 ]  Threatening Nd6+. Perhaps exchanging was the wrong response but by this point I don't think it makes a massive difference.
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ B b5 + ]  [ B d7 ]  [ B x d7 + ]  [ Q x d7 ]  [ c4 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ g6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ N c2 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ f3 ] , [ R a c8 ]  hereabouts things get a little boring with a lot of manuevering especially with the knights.
 [ K c7 ]  [ R d x d7 + ]  [ K b6 ]  [ R d x b7 + ]  [ K c5 ] , [ R g6 ]  Indirectly putting pressure on the [ c6 ] pawn with the plan being 40.[ R c7 ]  [ e4 + ] , [ K d4 ]  Nothing is going to help black no matter what he does. Not even 41...[ K x e4 + ] Even after that black might as well resign. For example after 41...[ K x e4 ] 42.[ R b4 + ] [ K f5 ] 43.R[ b x g4 ] [ K e5 ] 44.[ K x f3 ] [ K d5 ] 45.[ c4 + ] [ K e5 ] 46.R4[ g5 + ] [ K d4 ] 47.[ R x c6 ] and black has nothing else except for his K.
 [ K f2 ]  [ N c4 ]  [ B x c4 ] , [ b5 ]  trying to gain back the piece with pawn fork
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ f6 ]  ...[ f6 ] is almost always bad as it weakens the light squares on the vulnerable kingside. Standard moves to protect the pawn would be ...[ N c6 ] (most common) ...[ d6 ] (Philidor's Defense) or ...N[ f6 ] (Petrov Defense).
 [ B c4 ] , [ d6 ]  A more forthright option was 4. ...[ g5 ]  [ d4 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N f6 ] , [ B x f4 ]  Recapturing the pawn
 [ N c6 ] , [ e x f6 ]  White attempts to block the f-file but now weakens his central grip.
 [ N f6 ] , [ h3 ]  I know this is called "a loss of tempo". Probably it is as this game shows. But it is the base for an early g4-[ g5 ] that makes always shake black's kingside if he is not familiar with the position.
 [ B d4 ] , [ Q h4 ]  The obvious threat of [ B h6 ] (hitting both Queen and King on same diagonal) gives Black time to put a Rook to a more active position - the cover of the d-pawn.
 [ N x f3 + ]  [ K e2 ]  [ N d4 + ] , [ K d3 ]  21. [ K d3 ] - the WK evades the knight's checks. Black creates a flight square by capturing the [ g6 ] pawn.
 [ N g e2 ] , [ O-O ]  Castle
 [ Q e1 + ]  [ N f1 ] , [ Q b1 ]  This probably closes down the game for white. Allthough better was [ Q b4 ] to allow [ R b1 ] and keep the Queen more active. Black probably wanted to exchange Queens here.
 [ B c3 ] , [ a6 ]  Not sure what the purpose of this was...
 [ N x d4 ]  [ e x d4 ] , [ N d5 ]  Moving up to a solid post on [ d5 ] expecting to open some space for my Bishop while preventing Black from advancing his doubled d-pawn and trading it off.
 [ N x e4 ] , [ d x e4 ]  ...and we do end up exchanging knights with me having doubled paws on the e-file after six consecutive knight moves. These pawns are relatively strong as my KBP is still in its starting position so they can potentially support it. My opponent's remaining knight is actually under attack from the pawn...
 [ f3 ]  [ B f6 ] , [ R f g1 ]  I put extra pressure on the [ g6 ] pawn.
 [ N b4 ]  [ K d4 ]  [ R x g3 ]  [ R a4 ]  [ N c2 + ]  [ K c5 ] , [ a3 ]  The white Pawn begins its long march to the 8th rank. Now the game is definitely showing signs of a long struggle.
 [ Q b7 ]  [ g x h3 + ]  [ B g3 ]  [ R d8 ] , [ Q b4 + ]  Black resigns. He must now lose both a Knight *and* a Rook.
 [ K h2 ] , [ R c6 ]  This is the one time when black gets time for a move in the defense so I'm tempted to think there must be better than this move but I see no defense to the following attack. Black hopes to play ...[ R x e6 ] ending the attack up a piece.
 [ g3 ]  [ f x g3 ]  [ f x g3 ] , [ N e3 ]  to stop my pawn advance in [ g2 ]  [ K f4 ]  [ b5 ] , [ e4 ]  The best move that I made. If we both promote our pawns to queen at least my king has a shield against the queen's check.
 [ c x b5 ]  [ a x b5 ]  [ B g5 ] , [ b4 ]  I actually would not mind trading my knight for his dsb but he chooses not to trade.
 [ Q c3 ] , [ d5 ]  And Stanley continues going for it by forcing an exchange of pawns. As that's the only way for me to avoid exchanging N's which I'm not ready to do yet either.
 [ d4 ] , [ c x d4 ]  Theory so far.
 [ N f3 ] , [ d5 ]  I have got a slight advantage here
 [ K d8 ] , [ R f7 ]  Now was a good moment to mobilize her last reserve the b1-rook who is feeling a little left out of the fun right now. After 18.Rb3! the Black Queen would have been trapped! The game might then have continued 18.Rb3! [ Q x b3 ] 19.[ a x b3 ] d6! -(not 19...Bxf6?? 20.[ B x f6 ] with a 2-bishop mate!)- 20.Rxd6ch [ c x d6 ] 21.[ B x h8 ] ... Although material would then be roughly level (Q for R and N) White's superior mobility - Black Q-side as yet unmoved - would probably have been decisive.
 [ B x e4 ]  [ f x e4 ]  [ B f8 ]  [ Q b8 ]  [ Q x a2 ] , [ h3 ]  at this point Black has already secured the draw: the unsafe position of [ K g1 ] can do a lot of damage; the other option was [ Q x e5 ] [ Q b1 + ] [ K f2 ] [ Q x b2 + ] [ K f3 ] [ Q a1 ] [ B d4 ] (threatening [ Q h8 ] mate) [ Q f1 + ] [ K g3 ] [ f6 ] and the order is restored: not to Whites' advantage...
 [ K d3 ]  [ f x e4 + ]  [ f x e4 ]  [ K f4 ] , [ f3 ]  Alternative would be [ K e5 ]  [ e5 ]  [ g4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ g3 ]  [ e7 ]  [ g2 ]  [ e8 = Q ]  [ g1 = Q ]  [ Q e4 + ] , [ K g3 ]  46......[ K g3 ] 47 Qg6ch No point in white trying to play a succession of checks. More central position of King is decisive
 [ N e4 ] , [ N x e4 ]  This tactical skirmish...
 [ N e7 ]  [ R e5 ]  [ R e8 ] , [ N f4 ]  I think at this point I have done a good job of tying up his pieces but I cannot find a way to capitalize and start winning back material. At a loss on this point I take up position on [ f4 ] as planned.
 [ e x d5 ]  [ Q c2 ] , [ b6 ]  Fianchetto preparation and my king is not ready to castle yet..
 [ B d7 ] , [ N d5 ]  white gets aggressive. Look out for that nasty forking maneuver.
 [ O-O ] , [ Q c5 ]  White castled leaving his bishop en prise for black to take at his leisure. I think I may have overlooked the free bishop here - who expects such a thing when it's been four or five days since I last saw this board? Instead black attacks the other white bishop and the white knight on [ d4 ] effectively forking three pieces.
 [ N x e4 ]  [ Q e2 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ a5 ]  [ K h7 ]  [ b4 ]  [ R a7 ]  [ N e6 ]  [ R a8 ]  [ N x f8 + ]  [ Q x f8 ]  [ B f2 ]  [ Q e8 ]  [ c4 ]  [ Q d7 ]  [ h3 ]  [ g5 ]  [ b5 ]  [ e6 ]  [ a6 ]  [ R b8 ]  [ a7 ]  [ R a8 ]  [ Q d3 + ]  [ K g8 ]  [ Q g6 ]  [ Q f7 ]  [ Q x g5 ]  [ K h7 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ B f8 ]  [ b6 ]  [ K g8 ]  [ c5 ]  [ d x c5 ] , [ Q g5 + ]  First check of the game. (He is bending to the pressure. )
 [ e5 ] , [ d5 ]  (4.03) (20... [ R f8 ] 21. [ B d2 ] [ B e2 ] 22. [ e x f6 ] Rxf6) is better
 [ d x e5 ] , [ B c4 ]  ?? And here I make a horrible blunder. I had probably forgotten that the exchange on [ e5 ] had also opened a line for Black... My idea of course was an attack on the f file and [ f7 ] in partiicular but that didn't quite happen.
 [ Q a3 ]  [ K b1 ]  [ Q b3 + ]  [ K a1 ]  [ Q a3 ]  [ K b1 ]  [ Q d3 + ]  [ K b2 ]  [ Q d4 + ]  [ K b1 ]  [ Q b4 + ]  [ K a1 ]  [ Q a3 ]  [ K b1 ]  [ Q x a2 + ] , [ K x a2 ]  Draw better than a lose. I let one get away...again. The truth is we BOTH let that one get away but I had the win first.
 [ d x e5 ] , [ B x f3 ]  getting the queen off the open d file but giving up the bishop pair
 [ d x c3 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ O-O ] , [ Q d2 ]  White prepares to castle queen side and launch a king side attack.
 [ Q h7 + ]  [ K g5 ]  [ Q x h8 ] , [ N x h2 ]  ({13:+12.37} 49. ... [ N x h2 ] 50. [ Q g7 + ] [ K f5 ] 51. [ [ c6 ] ] [ R f1 ] 52. [ Q d7 + ] [ K e4 ] 53. [ Q e6 + ] [ K d3 ] 54.

[ K b8 ] [ R b5 + ] 57. [ K a8 ] [ R d5 ] 58. [ Q e6 + ] [ K d4 ] +-)
 [ N c3 ] , [ Q d6 ]  [ N c3 ] was hoping to get him off the d rank yet he stays with his plan
 [ R f7 ]  [ e3 ]  [ K g2 ]  [ Q g6 ]  [ R f3 ]  [ Q e4 ]  [ R h1 ] , [ e x f2 ]  Black attacks relentlessly.
 [ Q d8 ]  [ b4 ]  [ B c7 ]  [ R e1 ] , [ f6 ]  Black tries to relieve some of the pressure but this will leave a backward pawn on e6. [ e5 ] will also become a square that can be used as an outpost.
 [ O-O ]  [ O-O ] , [ B d6 ]  not sure what he was after with this move.
 [ Q d3 ]  [ Q x d3 ]  [ B x d3 ]  [ R d8 ]  [ h3 ]  [ B h5 ]  [ f4 ] , [ f6 ]  ?? Turning point of the game. [ K d6 ] forces [ N x a6 ] etc.
 [ R c7 ] , [ N f7 + ]  ?? I have a tendency to overlook obvious things especially if I have calculated some moves ahead. This move is an example. I had already seen this when I played 25.Ne4. I thought: "It's check and he can't take with the Queen as it's protected by the bishop he can't take with the knight or move his king as the rook is attacked so this move wins." However I overlooked Black's obvious reply. A week before this game a very similar blunder (but in an materially equal position) cost me a full piece. Fortunately for me things are not so bad this time.
 [ B b3 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ h5 ] , [ b4 ]  Removing the first defender!
 [ Q a5 ] , [ a3 ]  Freeing the Knight from the defence of a2.
 [ K c6 ] , [ R e d1 ]  Again 31. [ R b1 ] probably causes black more problems. But here he figured the best way to proceed was to swap off which suited me.
 [ R f d1 ]  [ B g4 ] , [ h4 ]  White's only way to stop
 [ B x c1 ]  [ K x c1 ]  [ N b3 + ]  [ K b2 ]  [ N d4 ] , [ h5 ]  Black could play NxB.
 [ a5 ]  [ R x c6 ]  [ a x b6 ]  [ a x b6 ]  [ R b5 x b6 ]  [ R c5 ]  [ R b6 b7 ]  [ N f5 ] , [ R b7 b5 ]  I would like to keep rooks on but I have to exchange or I just lose the d pawn
 [ B g2 ]  [ N b d7 ]  [ O-O ] , [ B b4 ]  The Black development is finished they just need to castle in the king side.
 [ K x f2 ]  [ Q c2 + ]  [ R d2 ] , [ Q c3 ]  Black defends his bishop and attacks the rook on a1. He's a pawn behind in material.
 [ R e1 ] , [ O-O ]  I do not see how to fiancheto the LSB and castle long : if 11... [ b6 ] 12.[ c5 ] dx[ c5 ] and the d knight will be menaced black will need the LSB to protect it. So that castling short seems better.
 [ c5 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ a6 ]  [ a4 ] , [ Q a5 ]  At this point I thought that the queen came out too soon. So it was time for attacking the queen.
 [ R c8 ]  [ B b2 ]  [ B x e5 ]  [ N x e5 ] , [ N x d4 ]  Ok so [ c3 ] was pinned. Never a good idea to let an opposite rook and our queen on the same column.
 [ c3 ]  [ Q f4 ]  [ b4 ] , [ R e7 ]  there's no way he'll let me get my b-file rook over and own the e-file but if he does i'll hammer him. if not...well we continue with getting the b-file rook over to h.
 [ N x c3 ]  [ Q d4 ]  [ K f1 ]  [ Q x c3 ] , [ R a2 ]  "We were still in his preparation and maybe I was too optimistic. If my attack doesn't succeed I will have problems with my pawn structure; so I'm still fighting for equality."
 [ g6 ] , [ R g5 ]  this is going to be nice...
 [ R c8 ] , [ c4 ]  Perhaps I should have played [ b4 ] but after [ c4 ] I was hoping for [ B c3 ] [ d4 ] [ d5 ]  [ c5 ]  [ B c3 ] , [ b5 ]  he obviously is intending [ b4 ] so I thought my [ e1 ] Rook would be more effective if......
 [ Q x b6 ]  [ R x b6 ]  [ c3 ] , [ d4 ]  Played the sacrifice to get some counter-play.
 [ B h3 ] , [ Q a4 + ]  11. [ Q a4 + ] - getting Glenda out of a possible skewer situation. Henry is lined up perfectly with the square d1.
 [ B f2 ]  [ R b4 + ]  [ K h3 ]  [ Q c1 ]  [ B g3 ]  [ N x g3 ]  [ K x g3 ]  [ Q e1 + ]  [ K h2 ] , [ R h4 # ]  A good game to learn that when we are winning we shouldn't relax and stop thinking our rival will think twice more to try to save the game! A tip when we are winning far for material: Try to exchange pieces!.. with fewer pieces on board your material advantage will be noticed more.
 [ N c3 ] , [ g4 ]  The idea behind 7...Nc6.The d-pawn will be down a defender.
 [ R a d1 ]  [ B e7 ] , [ Q b3 ]  Attacks both the [ e6 ] (which is currently protected) and the [ b7 ] pawn. I am actually trying to set something up but it requires a few moves.
 [ Q d7 ] , [ R a d1 ]  12. [ R a d1 ] - now my rook stares down the BQ on the d file!
 [ Q f4 ] , [ Q g7 ]  Because of white's superior piece mobility and space advantage the queen exchange would be to his advantage so black rightly avoids it.
 [ R b3 ]  [ B f6 ]  [ R e h3 ] , [ N c5 ]  I feel that [ N c4 ] is a good outpost - N can't be chased by a pawn also forces a move by white
 [ R b1 ]  [ Q a6 ] , [ R x e7 + ]  Here comes the powerful blow....
 [ d x e5 ]  [ f x e5 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ c3 ] , [ O-O-O ]  In hindsight this should have been [ R d8 ] because this allows the [ c6 ] bishop to be pinned at a crucial moment. Computer eval shows black with significant advantage at this point.
 [ R x b2 ]  [ b x c5 ]  [ b x c5 ] , [ R x c5 ]  This allows White a tactic to remove the defender and win a piece.
 [ Q x c3 ]  [ R x e6 ]  [ R d8 ] , [ R e8 ]  Baiting Rxe8.. which leads to checkmate.
 [ B x e6 ] , [ N a6 ]  Black avoids the checkmate on [ g8 ] but his situation is hopeless
 [ Q b3 ] , [ R f e8 ]  That was a planned move and turned out to be critical. A one space rook move!
 [ N f6 ]  [ R x d6 ] , [ N e4 ]  Not even this worries me... can it be possible?
 [ h5 ]  [ f x g4 ]  [ h x g4 ] , [ Q f5 + ]  I was hoping the Black Rook undefended by a pawn would be on [ g4 ] when I made this move; but you work with whatever is there. The check gives Black an opportunity to go wrong.
 [ Q a5 + ]  [ Q d2 ] , [ b5 ]  At least I'll grab space!
 [ K x g7 ] , [ R a e1 ]  I was puzzled by this move at first since white is leaving the unprotected. I assumed that white just wrote off this knight as a lost piece not worth defending anymore. In hindsight I see it was a good move since two rooks side by side providing support for two pawns side by side is a really effective tactic. I've seen pawns and rooks working together like that to clear the file of opposing pieces or walk all the way to the last row.
 [ R x h7 + ]  [ K x h7 ]  [ B f8 + ]  [ R h6 ] , [ Q x h6 # ]  
 [ K x f4 ] , [ K d5 ]  Now either king has the potential to invade the other side and it is possible for both to achieve this.
 [ B e3 ]  [ Q d6 ] , [ N d2 ]  My center is worse but I have a slight lead in development. I will have to try to use it to get the material back eventually.
 [ d3 ]  [ B d6 ] , [ c3 ]  White can't find an armonious way to develop.
 [ N c6 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ Q d3 ] , [ B g7 ]  9. ..... [ B g7 ] - Fou Lenoir develops on the long a1-[ h8 ] diagonal.
 [ Q f4 ]  [ B b4 + ]  [ B d2 ] , [ Q x b2 ]  OUCH OUCH OUCH.... for black. White takes queen with discovered attack in one move. ready?
 [ O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ c6 ] , [ N h4 ]  Retrying the stonewall pattern
 [ Q b5 ] , [ R e1 ]  now im going to try to trap his queen.
 [ e6 ] , [ N f3 ]  this threatens n[ f5 ] with mate on f7.
 [ g6 ] , [ Q g5 ]  Perhaps sensing that I am gaining to much position white attempts to make his 2 point advantage decisive with a queen swap. If I take the Queen white also has a strong knight on g5. I want to keep the attack on [ b2 ] as it is essential to my plan! However I give him what he wants with...
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ] , [ Q f3 ]  Going for the old four move.
 [ N c3 ]  [ N e5 ] , [ N d5 ]  I ignore the threat to the bishop by attacking black's queen. If black does not move the queen white checks trading queen for knight and can move the bishop later. Black's best move here is [ Q d8 ] to protect P[ c7 ] from the classic K/R fork by NxP.
 [ f5 ]  [ N f8 ] , [ B x a7 ]  By point value material is even but I think I'm winning because my bishops are very strong attackers in this position plus I have a passed pawn now.
 [ d4 ]  [ g6 ]  [ e4 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ e5 ]  [ d6 ]  [ f4 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ f x e5 ]  [ f6 ]  [ e x f6 ]  [ N x f6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ b6 ]  [ B b5 + ]  [ c6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ N b d7 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B b7 ] , [ N g5 ]  This is where it gets interesting. I believe my opponent thinks I am going to move Nf7. My whole motivation is really to use [ B f7 ] just to stop the castle and keep the king struck in the center.
 [ R x a3 ] , [ R c3 ]  I can now win back the pawn.
 [ g x h2 + ]  [ K h1 ] , [ Q x f8 ]  [ Q f2 ] followed by [ N h4 ] is a strong idea. White prevents this.
 [ R e8 + ]  [ K g7 ]  [ c3 ]  [ Q x f4 + ]  [ K c2 ]  [ h4 ]  [ R a8 ]  [ Q e4 + ] , [ K b3 ]  Checkmate in 2 moves can you figure it out?
 [ K d7 ] , [ B b5 + ]  counter attacks has begun for white.
 [ a6 ] , [ N x c6 + ]  Black is in quite a worrying position due to the white's knights.
 [ h5 ]  [ B x d4 ]  [ N e6 ] , [ B e3 ]  The [ B e3 ] dominates the Ne6.
 [ B a6 ]  [ N h5 ]  [ K h8 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ N g6 ] , [ B g5 ]  14. [ N h5 ] and 16. [ B g5 ] exemplify Tal's concept of launching which he discusses in his magnificent book "Attack With Mikhail Tal" co-authored with Iakov Damsky. Tal writes "...in ice hockey this concept has existed since the game was born. The point of it is that the puck ends up close to the goal but no one knows what will happen with it next...when I 'launch' a piece close to the enemy king I never aim it at only one point...this is one version of concentrating force only without a clear and single aim planned beforehand" (1999 ed. p. 46). Tal is in accordance with Sun Tzu who said in The Art of War "...create changes in the situation by dispersal and concentration of forces" (7:12) and "The ultimate in disposing one's troops is to be without ascertainable shape...It is according to the shapes that I lay the plans for victory but the multitude does not comprehend this. Although everyone can see the outward aspects none understands the way in which I have created victory" (6:24-25).
 [ R e2 + ]  [ K d4 ]  [ R x f2 ] , [ R g1 + ]  Now white is lost. But see.
 [ c x d5 ]  [ Q d4 ]  [ R g8 ] , [ N x h7 ]  Clearing the way for the QB.
 [ O-O ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ B x d4 ]  [ B x d4 ]  [ Q x d4 ] , [ B e6 ]  12. ......... [ B e6 ] - so far db but now Ion takes me out of it with this move. I now take back with the wrong unit I think. Jury would you agree that [ N x f5 ] attacking the Wicked Witch of the West have been a better recapture?
 [ e6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ e3 ] , [ c5 ]  Normal position.
 [ B x d5 ] , [ B x d5 ]  With the disappearance of the protecting Bishop Black's Queen-side is ready to collapse.
 [ N c6 ] , [ c3 ]  to open an escape route for the bishop keeping the light squares bishop is white's main idea and to prevent both [ N d4 ] and [ N b4 ]  [ d6 ] , [ d3 ]  now further support on [ e4 ] and opens c1-[ h6 ] diagonal white pawn structure is cohesive although if black tires a [ d5 ] pawn break white might have some trouble due to the weakness of it's [ d3 ] pawn
 [ B h2 ]  [ c5 ] , [ c3 ]  Not really forced but black's countergame on the black squares can easily become dangerous.
 [ K f1 ]  [ O-O-O ] , [ N g1 ]  Wanting to play [ [ g4 ] ] to stop my opponent playing [ [ g4 ] ] I protect the h-pawn.
 [ Q x f4 ]  [ B x f4 ] , [ B a6 ]  oups two pieces alone
 [ Q c3 + ] , [ K h6 ]  Or 27...[ K f8 ] 28.[ Q f6 + ] [ K e8 ] 29.[ B f7 + ] [ K d7 ] 30.[ Q e6 + ] followed by 31.Qe8#.
 [ R x a1 ] , [ N f6 ]  offer trade
 [ B g6 + ]  [ K h8 ] , [ Q c1 ]  So... rather obvious now...
 [ K g2 ]  [ R h2 + ]  [ K g1 ] , [ K d2 # ]  A strange choice of move by Lasker as 18. O-O would have been so much more beautiful and dramatic. However his queen sacrifice earlier in the game and the subsequent moves are no less impressive. According to Lasker himself Thomas was very gracious in defeat and to be honest that's the name of the game. To appreciate that it is only a game however magnificent it is. If you wish to leave me a suggestion for an annotated game or want to leave me feedback please drop me a message. Your help is appreciated.
 [ d4 ]  [ f5 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ e6 ]  Black declared his intentions and his strategy. Now it's all about how to attack it. And as usual I'll got there by delaying my castling so winning tempoes.
 [ R x e7 ]  [ N x e7 + ]  [ Q x e7 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ N e f6 ]  [ Q d3 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ B x e5 ]  [ Q x e5 ]  [ R d1 ]  [ R e8 ] , [ a4 ]  At this point I became frustrated. In my mind I had developed reasonably but still couldn't prevent the outright loss of a pawn. Somewhere my philosophy had betrayed me.
 [ N c6 ] , [ R g1 ]  An innocent looking enough move right?
 [ Q f3 ]  [ O-O ] , [ B g5 ]  Develops and pins.
 [ Q d3 ]  [ B x b5 ] , [ a x b5 ]  I want to make the opened a-file Black's Achilles' Heel. The b- and c- pawns can gain much honour in the battle ahead.
 [ d6 ] , [ c x d6 ]  might as well... besides Doubled up pawns aren't always a good thing.
 [ N e7 ] , [ Q d2 ]  Too slow.19.[ a4 ] sticking to a plan of Q-side play was better.
 [ N f3 ] , [ d6 ]  Defending the e-pawn. First mistake - this move blocks my black square bishop.

 [ e5 ] , [ f4 ]  Starting point
 [ K g4 ]  [ K g2 ]  [ h5 ]  [ h3 + ]  [ K g5 ]  [ R d3 ]  [ R c2 ]  [ h4 + ]  [ K f6 ]  [ R d6 ]  [ R x c4 ]  [ R x b6 ]  [ R b4 ]  [ K f3 ]  [ K e7 ]  [ R b7 + ]  [ K f6 ] , [ K g2 ]  
 [ N b8 ] , [ b4 ]  Presumably Sandre is going for a pawn chain since he's not ready to bring his [ B c1 ] into play yet.
 [ d x c5 ]  [ d x c5 ]  [ a4 ] , [ c4 ]  As IM Malcolm Pein in the Daily Telegraph chess column said "Resigning was objectively best here but White must have been in shock. So that's where I'll leave it.
 [ N c6 ]  [ B b5 ] , [ B d7 ]  Unfortunately that knight I decided was going to have a really bad day.
 [ e4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ] , [ e x d5 ]  I think the exchanges on move 3 lose initiative for white
 [ R b3 ]  [ R f e8 ]  [ b x c5 ]  [ d x c5 ]  [ g4 ] , [ B d7 ]  Possibly allowing [ b5 ] later when [ c5 ] pawn won't fall to the white queen.
 [ e5 ]  [ d4 ]  [ d6 ] , [ f4 ]  Planning to overpower the e-pawn.
 [ c5 ] , [ N f3 ]  Nope.
 [ d x c4 ]  [ B x c4 ] , [ b5 ]  This is the last book move for the opening.
 [ Q b6 + ]  [ K h1 ]  [ e x f4 ]  [ R x f4 ] , [ R a e8 ]  this is mistake because his Rook on [ f8 ] and Bishop on [ e7 ] fully blocked 13..[ d5 ] is playable to breakout white's development
 [ e x f4 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ g5 ] , [ B c4 ]  I have played this line a few times and it has led to the Muzio Gambit. I haven't had a lot of success with it although gothicgirl has beaten me with it many a time.
 [ B x a2 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ R e7 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ R f2 ]  [ a5 ] , [ b3 ]  [ N x e5 ] can wait.
 [ K f1 ] , [ B x d4 ]  Note that [ Q b5 + ] [ Q d3 ] doesn't give anything to black. [ N c3 ] now is meaningless. So this was the natural move. It threatens [ R a1 ] with a discovered attack on the WQ that makes useless most defences (but Rb1). But white has a brilliant move to answer. Can you see it?
 [ b4 ] , [ b x c5 ]  How would 14;...[ a5 ] fare?
 [ B x f3 ]  [ g x f3 ] , [ R a d8 ]  23. ....... [ R a d8 ] - the vulnerable pawn on [ d5 ] is now about to drop and so is my pawn on a3.
 [ R d5 + ]  [ K e6 ]  [ R x h5 ]  [ R e4 ]  [ R h8 ]  [ K f6 ] , [ h5 ]  ! I see that I have a chance of still keeping all my pawns
 [ c3 ] , [ N g e7 ]  Blacks position is exteremely cramped. Young initiates a vigourous attack to exploit this.
 [ R e1 ] , [ B x e2 + ]  I never say no to a free Queen!
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ] , [ d4 ]  White opens up with the centre game - one I have never encountered much myself
 [ K f6 ] , [ B x a7 ]  I simply capture a free pawn after she recovers with Bxa7.
 [ N b d7 ] , [ b4 ]  an unnecessary pawn move that wastes time and also creates tactical opportunites for Black's dark-square bishop
 [ N g5 ]  [ Q h6 ] , [ N x f7 ]  
 [ Q x e3 ]  [ b3 ]  [ N x c3 ]  [ Q x d4 ]  [ Q x d4 ]  [ R x d4 ]  [ a x b3 ]  [ R c8 ]  [ N b5 ]  [ R b4 ]  [ N d6 ]  [ R c3 ]  [ R a8 + ]  [ K h7 ] , [ N f7 ]  following the wrong plan: trying to force [ R h8 ] mate which will not work with Bg7...
 [ Q x g4 ]  [ Q x f1 + ]  [ K d2 ] , [ Q f2 + ]  White resigns. Any other interference would have resulted in a loss of his Q P and R in that order.
 [ B a7 ] , [ B b7 ]  why did he do that he had a free pawn on [ b2 ]  [ Q x e5 ] , [ B x e5 ]  game over I take and he resined!!! : ) : ) :) :0
 [ B b7 ] , [ f3 ]  ! Even if computer analysis doesn't like this move I think it's a good move useful later as much in offense than in defense.
 [ B c2 ] , [ B e6 ]  Or [ d3 ] because it gets captured on move 33 and it's a valuable passed pawn.
 [ K f1 ]  [ Q x a4 ]  [ Q e3 ]  [ B b2 ]  [ R b1 ]  [ Q x a2 ]  [ K g2 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ Q c5 + ]  [ K g8 ]  [ Q x c7 ]  [ N x e4 ] , [ d x e4 ]  Excellent central pawns. Those bad boys are dangerous.
 [ a4 ] , [ N e6 ]  This move as now he's either going to lose his Queen for Knight or get checkmated.
 [ B x e4 ]  [ d x e4 ] , [ Q x e4 ]  Now white has no attack left but... has the material. Black has to develop now or never. [ N c6 ] is called for.
 [ B h4 + ]  [ K g1 ]  [ R a e8 ] , [ N d2 ]  Nd2?? This is an obvious blunder that hangs the queen. Other options
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ e3 ]  [ c5 ]  [ d x c5 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ B x c5 ]  Black has equalised already here.
 [ B d3 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ e x d6 ] , [ Q x d6 ]  I decided to capture with the Queen rather then the Bishop
 [ R f7 ] , [ R g1 ]  32. Rg1! But I can defend that pawn again with 32..Kf6!!
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ] , [ b4 ]  Left wing gambit alternative to the traditionnal sicilian answer.
 [ R c4 ] , [ R x c4 + ]  White resigned the game before waiting for Black's reply which would've been 49...Kxc4. Black's win is clearcut from this position. Black would advance his c and d-pawns with the support of his king. Then one of the pawns would promote to a queen and then Black would checkmate White soonafter. I hope any beginners or anyone for that matter learnt something from this game.
 [ N x c7 + ]  [ Q x c7 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ Q d7 ]  [ Q h5 ]  [ R c8 ] , [ B e3 ]  finally realizes that i have a killer attack on his king too little too late
 [ N x c6 ]  [ B x c6 ]  [ d x c3 ]  [ Q x c3 + ] , [ Q f6 ]  the position is dead and drawing after [ Q d4 ] [ R e4 ] [ Q x c3 ] [ b x c3 ] [ K f6 ] a4! so Black again tries to make complications with his first Queens' move in this game; which looks more intimidating than it really is because we voluntary choose a pin on the Queen... but obviously after something like [ K h6 ] [ B c6 ] is running into trouble and also f2... so White tries to make things easy for himself; falling right into the trap I set up a while ago: taking the c-file with some Rook and enter somewhere on the second row... thematic play for Black in any Sicilian where [ c5 ] is supposed to be a gambit pawn; look it up for yourselves...
 [ Q x e2 ]  [ B x e2 ]  [ K x e2 ]  [ Q x g3 ] , [ N a3 ]  Connecting his rooks.
 [ R h1 ]  [ R x e4 ]  [ R h7 ]  [ N d6 ]  [ R h6 + ] , [ K e7 ]  White fights tenaciously. Here he wins my Knight with a nice tactical maneuver.
 [ f x e4 ]  [ B x e4 ]  [ Q g4 + ] , [ K d2 ]  Right about now looking down the barrel of a triple attack on a singlely-guarded [ h7 ] and at the smoking ruin of his own attack Black has to be wondering how this game got away from him. Pretty basically the answer is that White played to give Black chances to go wrong and he obliged.
 [ K f1 ]  [ Q f3 + ]  [ K g1 ] , [ R x e4 ]  Cat and mouse. Black claims rook.
 [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ g3 ] , [ Q c7 ]  This was in order to break the natural lines. It invites [ N b4 ] and supports e5.
 [ K x h8 ] , [ R c f1 ]  Doubling the rooks.
 [ B a6 + ] , [ K d8 ]  [ R b7 ] would've lasted one move longer.
 [ N e7 ] , [ O-O ]  [ e5 ] was a better option here; follows [ d5 ] and exchange of the center...
 [ b5 ] , [ B d3 ]  He forced me to move and given his moves the [ d3 ] square is where I wanted this bishop anyways.
 [ K x f8 ]  [ R c2 ]  [ Q x b3 ] , [ R a c1 ]  I might be lost with Bg7[ x d4 + ] but now i have tempo
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ a6 ]  Never really played the Najdorf before but I need to have more of a repertoire than just the Dragon on my black Sicilian play.
 [ N f3 ] , [ c5 ]  Advancing the pawn. My guess is that Ted wants to reduce his doubled pawns. However Jack did get a little involved and advised him to try to do something with those doubled pawns as they can become a reliability. We will see that later.
 [ Q x f7 + ]  [ K x f7 ] , [ c3 ]  A quiet move. Black's Bishop is blunted and my King can come into play. Trying to win a pawn outright with [ N c7 ] would have given Black good drawing chances. For example 28. [ N c7 ] [ d5 ] 29. [ N x a6 ] [ B d6 ] 30. [ c3 ] [ K f6 ] 31. [ K c2 ] [ K [ g5 ] ] 32. [ K d3 ] [ K x h5 ] 33. Kx[ d5 ] [ B f4 ] 34. [ K d4 ] [ K g4 ] 35. [ N c5 ] [ K g4 ] 36. [ c4 ] bx[ c4 ] 37. [ N e6 ] [ g5 ] 38. [ a4 ] [ B d2 ] 39. Kx[ c4 ] [ K x g2 ] and Black is still hanging on. Lines like this show the dangers of pressing to hard and trying to win at once in the endgame. Don't rush if you can wait is a basic rule of the endgame. There is not point in compromising your position if you don't see a clear win. Just play solid moves and wait.
 [ d3 ] , [ N f6 ]  well i know that n[ c3 ] is not a good move here so i figure more pawn moves
 [ B b2 ]  [ Q c5 ]  [ d4 ] , [ Q x b5 ]  I get my Pawn back too.
 [ R g2 g3 ]  [ K g7 ]  [ R h3 ]  [ R g h8 ]  [ h x g6 ] , [ R x h3 + ]  More post-mortem analysis showed that 45 QxR would give White an easy draw. But again Janowski misses the move.
 [ B x g5 + ]  [ h x g5 ]  [ Q x g5 + ] , [ K d7 ]  And then the unexpected pawn advance.
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ d6 ] , [ d4 ]  Forcing [ e5 ] pawn to ge control on centre
 [ B x c3 ] , [ B b2 ]  If I were White I would have actually taken the bishop with my queen and at least offset some of the points that I win on the next move. (making it a +6 advantage rather than a +9)
 [ B x e5 ] , [ g3 ]  An interesting move. Black has to make a decision now to drive off the Knight with ....c6; or to play the Bishop back to [ d6 ] to guard the e-pawn and threaten ...[ e5 ] if White plays Bf4. The latter continuation is certainly the correct choice but I guess I wasn't in a mood for making "correct choices." And so ...
 [ b x c3 ]  [ N x c3 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N c5 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N x b3 ]  [ N x b3 ] , [ R x c3 ]  Black has won the game.
 [ Q c4 ]  [ K b7 ] , [ B x d5 ]  Another important move. He can't recapture with either his rook or pawn because both lead to mating patterns. See if you can figure them out.
 [ B g5 ]  [ Q a5 ] , [ B x f6 ]  Why should I care for that doubled pawn that does me no harm? On the contrary it opens me a column. I'm starting to like this game... :-)
 [ N x d4 + ] , [ K f4 ]  Defender gone. King in a mate net if something land on [ f2 ] while the black queen is adding his power to that square. So...
 [ h3 ] , [ B h5 ]  But the pin is not going to be broken easily. Believe it or not I spoke to Jack about 6...[ B d7 ] given that he is eventually going to attack and break the pin with g4. He said that because I did not make a blunder of placing the N on the rim (did not play ...Nh5) then I can just retreat with this move. So since I can play this he asked why not move here. Afterall it is a better retreat and outpost for my B then 6...Bd7. BTW this is the move that I was going to play anyway but I decided to speak with my opponent about the different possiblilties given that he is my favorite coach.
 [ N a4 + ] , [ K a7 ]  [ N a4 ] was expected so I continue as planned.
 [ e6 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ d5 ]  Trying to open the center.
 [ R h4 + ] , [ K g3 ]  Fortunately Rooks are left not Queens or this would be even worse for White as it stands White isnt looking too great
 [ N f3 ] , [ c5 ]  [ c5 ] is a classical move in the French against white's centre.
 [ h6 ] , [ N e4 ]  The pin with [ c5 ] is an illusion since white can play 11. Nxf6ch then move the queen or trade queens if black allows it.
 [ N e4 ] , [ h4 ]  To avoid the annoying Qh5. But I miss a tempo to prevent [ f6 ] so here it comes...
 [ B d3 ]  [ B e7 ] , [ B e3 ]  White develops and keeps the his center solid. Black is a bit behind.
 [ f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N g e7 ] , [ N e4 ]  Here White makes a minor mistake. Instead of [ N e4 ] I would either castle or push the queen pawn to c5. The knight can't do anything even though black's position is too clumped the knight can only take the bishop which as we'll see doesn't do much good.
 [ K x f7 ] , [ R f1 ]  My queen is my worst piece having to recapture the knight on c1. It is totally out of the game. If possible I want to arrange the rousing [ N e4 ] or Nf3...
 [ c4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ g3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B g2 ]  [ d6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ R b1 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ e3 ]  [ f5 ]  [ d3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N g e2 ]  [ O-O ] , [ b4 ]  Advancing the b pawn to gain space on the queenside.
 [ h5 ]  [ d5 ]  [ K e3 ]  [ K e5 ]  [ K f3 ] , [ d4 ]  I really can't see how he can stop me now.
 [ R e6 ]  [ K f3 ] , [ a5 ]  Maybe to prevent [ b4 ]  [ K f4 ]  [ R g6 ]  [ b3 ]  [ R e6 ]  [ K f5 ]  [ R c6 ]  [ B d4 ]  [ R d6 ]  [ K e5 ]  [ R d8 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ K c6 ]  [ h4 ]  [ R c8 ]  [ K e4 ]  [ R f8 ]  [ K e5 ]  [ R f7 ] , [ K f5 ]  Black wanted to capture f6.
 [ O-O ]  [ f x g3 ]  [ f x g3 ]  [ Q e7 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ Q e3 + ]  [ K h1 ] , [ f5 ]  GK recommends [ R b8 ] here
 [ K e2 ]  [ R a g8 ] , [ f3 ]  I believe the reason for this move was to prevent [ f4 ] from advancing.
 [ R e8 ] , [ N x d6 + ]  I expected black to capture with the c pawn where I would check with the queen at [ f7 ] ultimately getting out of my double piece attacked pickle.
 [ c5 ] , [ c3 ]  Denying the Sicilian Defence's more aggressive variants is both unexpected and little known by many players so here it goes.
 [ Q x c7 ] , [ O-O ]  Erika now decides to get her King to safety. It still works.
 [ R b1 ] , [ Q h5 ]  So now is MY queen blocking his pawn... I've never seen such a bind!
 [ B b5 ]  [ N g e7 ]  [ B g5 ] , [ Q c7 ]  [ Q c7 ] is a nice move to get some control back by targeting the [ e5 ] pawn after removing d4. But Savanna sees this as well and goes on the attack to gain tempo.
 [ R x f1 ] , [ f6 ]  Now I will go after his knight.
 [ a3 ]  [ R c6 ]  [ B b4 ]  [ R a6 ]  [ B c5 ] , [ R c6 ]  He attacks my bishop again and again!
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 + ] , [ K h8 ]  It's really all over now.
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ g6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ d5 ]  The game starts with the Gruenfeld Defence and my opponent chose a very sharp line that gave me quite a few headaches as the game ensued.
 [ N h5 ]  [ R g8 ]  [ R f4 ]  [ Q d8 ] , [ N f3 ]  (RC) If 26 R-[ [ N4 ] ] 26... Q-[ K B1 ] and White is no nearer a successful attack on the KNP. Now if 26... R-[ K1 ] 27 R-[ [ N4 ] ] wins but Black is not quite so gullible.
 [ B e6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ N e7 ]  [ c3 ] , [ B g7 ]  14. ...... [ B g7 ] - if [ N x d5 ] then Bxf5. This bishop will be very strong on that diagonal especially when black plays [ b4 ] at a convenient moment.
 [ d6 ] , [ R c5 ]  Played to stop a queen check on d5.
 [ B x c3 ]  [ B x c3 ] , [ R x c3 ]  I hate his exchange rate. :P
 [ N x d4 ] , [ N x b5 ]  I capture the [ d4 ] pawn with my knight and black moves his knight to [ b5 ] and captures my pawn. I should have seen he was coming back for that pawn!
 [ R x a8 ]  [ N a6 ] , [ B x c4 ]  with a little trap
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ B x c4 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ f3 ]  [ B b4 + ]  [ K f1 ]  [ O-O ]  [ a3 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ b4 ]  [ B d6 ] , [ h3 ]  [ N g4 ] was already protected against this pawn seems like a weak move.
 [ N a6 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ N c7 ]  [ c4 ]  [ B x f4 ]  [ Q x f4 ] , [ N a6 ]  my idea is to put my knight in [ c5 ] square pinning the white bishop and creating a double pawn for white for example white captured the knight I will attack both his knight in [ e2 ] and [ c4 ] pawn
 [ N f3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ c4 ]  [ c6 ]  [ e3 ] , [ a6 ]  White to play.
 [ c x d5 ] , [ e x d5 ]  not what was expected
 [ Q h6 ] , [ Q b4 ]  what did white mean to achieve by this move? I'm not sure
 [ Q x g6 + ]  [ K h8 ]  [ Q x h6 + ] , [ Q h7 ]  Blocking the check.
 [ b5 ] , [ a3 ]  first anticipate [ b4 ]  [ N c7 ] , [ N e5 ]  here we are !
 [ f4 ]  [ f5 ]  [ h3 ]  [ K g6 ]  [ g4 ]  [ h6 ]  [ B f3 ]  [ f x g4 ]  [ h x g4 ] , [ R c2 ]  trying to gain that one pawn totally overlooked the [ f5 + ]  [ f5 + ] , [ B x f5 ]  Looking back k[ f5 ] was better 31....K[ f5 ] 32 [ f x e6 ] [ f x e6 ] better pawn structure same lost bishop rook in position to acapture the [ c3 ] pawn+
 [ R b7 + ] , [ K c3 ]  Black has made progress in restricting White's rook to bad squares. Black's new mating idea is [ R h1 ] [ K a2 ] [ N b4 ] [ K a3 ] [ R a1 # ] so the only way White can defend the threat is 51.[ K a1 ] making room for [ R b1 ] 51.[ K a2 ] loses to [ N b4 ] where Black has [ R h1 # ] or [ R a8 ] next move.
 [ K g3 ] , [ Q g6 + ]  I suddenly see something...
 [ N x a7 ]  [ R x d2 ]  [ K x d2 ] , [ N f6 ]  Blacks' pieces are getting out of Whites' reach...
 [ N x e5 ] , [ d x e5 ]  Another early exchange opens up the board..
 [ R a1 ]  [ Q x h6 ] , [ Q x d1 + ]  Thank you friend! I'm looking forward to another great game!
 [ g6 ]  [ e4 ]  [ d6 ] , [ d4 ]  4. [ [ [ d4 ] ] ] - in response to Afro's hypermodern style of defense (putting pawns on [ g6 ] and [ d6 ] and preparing to fianchetto his KB at g7) The Champ puts up an impressive pawn wall on [ [ [ d4 ] ] ] [ [ [ d4 ] ] ] and c4. Will Afro be cramped for style? We shall see.
 [ g x f4 ]  [ e x f4 ] , [ e4 ]  But now I am ready to sacrifice! And the f pawn become a stunning attack force.
 [ R c8 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ f6 ] , [ a4 ]  I have been taught that the principle of second weakness is key to winning endings where one player has an edge in some way. I have the bishop pair but they need targets so I look to go [ a5 ] and weaken the black QS structure. Furthermore my 3 on 2 on the qs suggests I should aim for a passed pawn there
 [ d5 ]  [ N d8 ] , [ B g5 ]  White will use this pin to his benefit due to his advantage in development and will weaken Black's kingside.
 [ R d7 ]  [ B f6 ]  [ B x f6 ] , [ Q x f6 ]  Trade is over and my queen is at the right spot
 [ h3 ]  [ B h5 ] , [ K f2 ]  ?! This move was really unexpected at the time but it's actually a kind-of okay way of transferring forces over to the kingside to defend against Black's mounting assault assuming White uses the next several moves efficiently. I think 13.[ R f1 ] and eventual [ K h2 ] is more straightforward though. White's already committed to the kingside; he might as well try to get comfy there.
 [ B e3 ]  [ Q d7 ]  [ a4 ]  [ a6 ] , [ a5 ]  White gains ground in provoking weakness around the Black King.
 [ B a6 ]  [ h4 ]  [ R c8 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ B x c4 ]  [ Q b2 ]  [ R b8 ]  [ a4 ]  [ B d5 ]  [ a5 ]  [ N c4 ]  [ Q b5 ] , [ N x a5 ]  my poor play lead to even material and black positional advantage due to a passing pawn on [ B6 ]  [ Q d7 + ]  [ K g6 ]  [ N x e6 ]  [ B x e6 ]  [ Q x e6 ]  [ b5 ]  [ f4 ] , [ b4 ]  passing pawn is advancing yet [ f5 ] check (called as alsol the last hope of white) is comming
 [ c5 ]  [ B c7 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ h6 ]  [ B d2 ] , [ g5 ]  .....Black wanted to protect his king more with 8...Kh8....and then he moves two moves like [ h6 ] and g5....Debetable decisions.
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ N c3 ]  Do you see how you now behind by a full move now.
 [ B d2 ] , [ c5 ]  After much deliberation I decided to move my bishop to [ d2 ] to giving added support to my [ b4 ] pawn. My attack on the kingside seems to be fading fast. Black’s last move has me worried. I can see what is coming on the queenside. Remarkably all the pieces are still on the board. I think black has the initiative..... KO prefers [ h6 ] still trying to stir things up on the kingside. [ N x e7 + ] and o-o are other ideas..... Black plays [ [ c5 ] ] seeking to breakthrough on the queenside. I ran through several variations and they all looked dangerous for me. I have to be careful here. If Black breaks through on the queenside I have serious problems. KO endorses [ [ c5 ] ] as best. Another possibility is N-[ g5 ] attacking my queen. Black increases his advantage with every move.
 [ Q b2 ] , [ Q d1 + ]  .
 [ N x c4 ]  [ R x f4 ]  [ N e5 + ] , [ K b7 ]  24. ...... [ K b7 ] - more evasive action from Henry.
 [ B g4 + ] , [ K e4 ]  Well the black queen remains in danger. So white is only down one pawn. It isn't all that bad a trade.
 [ R e7 + ]  [ K f8 ] , [ R d7 ]  now [ d5 ] is well covered and the pawn is free to advance. Black resigns as he had quite enough in defending.
 [ B x f3 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ N a3 ]  For the most part I think it is usually best to have the knight on C3 rather than A3. The knight on C3 is much more powerful and can really impact the center of the board more efficiently.
 [ N b d7 ] , [ e5 ]  Trying to seize command of the game.
 [ h3 ]  [ K f8 ]  [ g3 ] , [ K g8 ]  43. ...... [ K g8 ] - white's position here is more active but should Freddy over-reach himself with the following ....... 44. [ h4 ] gx[ h4 ] 45. gx[ h4 ] [ Q f7 ] 46. [ R h5 ] [ R g3 ] 47. [ R h6 ] [ Q g7 ] 48. [ R h5 ] [ R g1 + ] 49. [ K h2 ] [ Q g3 # ] So Operation Joblock could finally bare its teeth - a lurvely 18 point chunk out of the Master Mater's rating! Freddy must take care.
 [ N d2 ]  [ N x d4 ] , [ e x d4 ]  At this point my knight is pinned I'm still probably going to lose the knight on [ a8 ] and I have to watch out for Nd3+. On the other hand Black's king is in the middle of the board.
 [ K x g1 ]  [ R e5 x e2 ] , [ Q x d6 ]  the queen is finally out but it's too late. Black has a free pass at the king and from here on out the queen and the rook will be useless to white.
 [ O-O ]  [ B e2 ]  [ N b d7 ]  [ O-O ] , [ c6 ]  I feel like my position's wide open with lots of room for maneuvering. His is cramped -- and he's done it to himself. I don't have any pawns on his side of the board and none of his pieces are pinned.
 [ d4 ]  [ N f4 ]  [ Q a6 ] , [ N g6 + ]  Bring the knight to the party
 [ e4 ] , [ c5 ]  Mini Tournament game I'm playing black and go for the Sicilian.
 [ K h4 ] , [ B f6 + ]  Now the continuation will be 32. [ K h3 ] [ R g8 ] 33. [ a4 ] [ R g2 ] 34. [ a x b5 ] (note that a reflexive 34. ... axb5??? by black stalemates white) Rxh2#.
 [ B g4 ] , [ B b2 ]  Both sides develop their bishop - White with a fianchetto Black with a pin
 [ N h2 ]  [ B x e2 ]  [ Q x e2 ] , [ e5 ]  ...but in the meanwhile I forgot about the [ e5 ] push blacks were preparing. And now this is really dangerous since I have a rook in front my queen and king.
 [ b x c6 ] , [ N c3 ]  Because Tom did not play the Berlin Defense I for the first time in a while thought about tipsyjouneyman told me in the Ruy Lopez. So I decided to hold off on castling for one move by developing another piece. This is a transposition of what I had considered and what's normally done. As I usually play 5.0-0 followed by 6.[ N c3 ] in this position. But the reverse happened here.
 [ B d3 ]  [ e2 ]  [ B x e2 + ]  [ K e3 ]  [ R h4 ] , [ K x e2 ]  
 [ Q f8 ] , [ B g5 ]  Now that his queen could retake on [ g7 ] I didn't like the bishop exchange very much anymore because Black could put the open g-file to use in a kingside attack.
 [ e x f5 ]  [ R c x f6 + ]  [ K g7 ]  [ R f x h6 ]  [ f x e4 ] , [ d x e4 ]  and there's my passed pawn.
 [ O-O ]  [ B f5 ] , [ B d2 ]  [ B f4 ] was more active.
 [ d5 ]  [ B b2 ]  [ f6 ]  [ d4 ] , [ e6 ]  The pawns and a White Bishop move out.
 [ N g3 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ Q d2 ] , [ g5 ]  Why are you moving this pawn? Generally you don't want to advance pawns unless you already have an advantage with pieces and activity. My first objective in this position would be to gain equality and then after that to gain the initiative.
 [ e4 ] , [ c5 ]  Team Match I'm playing black and reply with the Sicilian to white's Open Game. Interesting note I finished this game and my other match game against this same opponent within minutes of each other - I played my final move as white in that other game then switched to this game and entered a series of conditional moves. By the time I was done my opponent had resigned in the other game and logged out so I went to bed and woke up find this game had concluded while I slept. I like winning while I sleep; I think it sends me pleasant dreams...
 [ B c6 ]  [ b5 ]  [ g4 ]  [ b4 ]  [ f5 ] , [ K f7 ]  The immediate threat was 43.[ f6 ]  [ B a4 ]  [ a5 ] , [ K e5 ]  Renewing the threat of f6.
 [ K f2 ]  [ Q x h2 + ]  [ K e1 ] , [ N g3 ]  White resigns as the defense is futile. 42. [ R d2 ] [ Q h1 + ] 43. [ K f2 ] [ N x e2 ] 44. [ K x e2 ] [ Q f3 + ] 45. [ K e1 ] [ Q x c3 ] and so on.... The Queen is ready to inflict heavy damage.
 [ R x e7 + ]  [ N x e7 ] , [ Q x d7 + ]  This is the whole idea behind the Knight sacrifice on [ f3 ]  [ K x d7 ] , [ B f5 + ]  Double checks are dangerous the force the king to move.
 [ B c2 ]  [ N x d5 ] , [ Q x d5 ]  His horsy is gone! Alas the evil succubus has reared her head!
 [ B x b4 ]  [ N x b4 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ N x d3 + ]  14. Mistake here giving away your knight.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ a4 ] , [ a6 ]  Black seems to do well with [ N f6 ] according to the database. P[ a6 ] is not recorded.
 [ N f3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e5 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ B x d3 ]  [ Q x d3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B b4 ]  [ a3 ]  [ B x c3 ]  [ Q x c3 ]  [ N g e7 ]  [ b4 ]  [ O-O ]  [ a4 ]  [ b5 ] , [ a5 ]  White's queen is protecting both rook and forward pawn. PxP wouldn't have been bad.
 [ K e4 ] , [ K g6 ]  Now his pawn will fall.
 [ e x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ] , [ d6 ]  I can't afford to let him play [ d6 ] and lock in my bishop.
 [ a x b3 ] , [ d x c4 ]  Now Black allows me to get my pawn structure in order in addition to total dominance of the center and a piece to the advantage. I think 10. ... [ N c6 ] is better
 [ R x g6 ]  [ B x g6 + ]  [ K x f4 ]  [ K g7 ] , [ K g5 ]  The critical move. Fischer's King blocks access to the square Keres needs to reach to successfully draw.
 [ K d3 ]  [ K b4 ]  [ K d4 ]  [ K x a4 ] , [ c5 ]  44. [ c5 ] - material is even but the c pawn will crown first.
 [ N x e5 ]  [ N x e5 ] , [ d x e5 ]  A couple of trades...
 [ N f3 ]  [ g6 ] , [ d4 ]  Oups an open sicilian -> back to the good old dragon sicilian.
 [ N f3 ]  [ e4 ] , [ O-O ]  perhaps white didnt notice the pawn which is attacking the knight
 [ N c6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B g4 ] , [ e5 ]  White is not adverse to accepting the pin at this stage which may prove a mistake as the position can be made to swing around it. 11. [ B e2 ] was likely preferable as the pin on Black's KBP is relatively inconsequential.
 [ Q c1 ]  [ N e6 ]  [ f3 ]  [ e x f3 ]  [ B x f3 ] , [ B d7 ]  Finally developing the Bishop.
 [ R a f8 ] , [ Q f2 ]  Aiming for some kind of counter-action with [ Q x c5 ] although it's no real threat because black is heavily attacking my king's town !
 [ R b c8 ] , [ K g2 ]  Clearing the back rank.
 [ e4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ d4 ] , [ c5 ]  I'm not used to this variation of the french defense looks like a sicilian
 [ a3 ] , [ R d8 ]  Black misses the danger evolving here 16...[ R d8 ] 17.[ B c3 ] [ Q b3 ] 18.[ R x e7 ] [ B f5 ] 19.[ Q x f5 ] Qxc3. As shown above I think the better move was to sacrifice the Queen with g5.
 [ R h8 ] , [ R x h8 ]  And sacrifice for black total weakness
 [ Q a5 ]  [ N x f8 ]  [ Q x d2 + ]  [ K x d2 ]  [ R x f8 ]  [ a4 ] , [ b4 ]  smart move by black as it keeps my rook on the a file safely behind a pawn still
 [ K h3 ]  [ R d1 ]  [ R x a5 ]  [ R d3 + ]  [ K g4 ]  [ R d4 + ]  [ K g3 ] , [ R f f4 ]  Now White's king is locked out and the passed pawn has little chance of advancing. Any chances of a win for White depend on the kingside pawns.
 [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ N c3 ]  I have to protect the pawn.
 [ R x f3 ]  [ K g2 ]  [ R c3 ]  [ R d3 ]  [ R x c4 ] , [ Q b3 ]  a great black advantage. a piece up and lots of pawn running to the last row...
 [ h x g4 ] , [ h x g4 ]  h-column didn't seem to dangerous for now since I considered my own attack as faster than the eventual movements rook-king to occupate the free corridor.
 [ Q x f7 ]  [ R x d8 ]  [ N a4 ] , [ b3 ]  If 28. ... [ N x c3 ] there follows 29. Raa8. A splendid game by Alekhine.
 [ Q x d3 ] , [ b x c4 ]  i found no other moves to avoid losing the pawn
 [ Q c6 ]  [ R c1 ] , [ B g4 ]  Threatening to win the knight after dxc4. The problem is that the threat's easily thwarted.
 [ e5 ]  [ B g2 ]  [ d6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ c6 ]  He isn't as stupid as I had hoped.
 [ N a5 ]  [ f6 ]  [ g5 ]  [ R a c1 ]  [ N x c4 ]  [ R x c4 ]  [ c6 ]  [ N e7 ]  [ Q d7 ]  [ d5 ]  [ c5 ]  [ e5 ]  [ b6 ]  [ e6 ]  [ f x e6 ]  [ Q h5 + ]  [ K d8 ]  [ B x g5 ]  [ K c7 ]  [ b4 ]  [ b5 ]  [ b x c5 ]  [ b x c4 ]  [ c x d6 + ]  [ K x d6 ]  [ B f4 + ]  [ K c5 ] , [ d x e6 + ]  
 [ R f2 + ]  [ K e6 ] , [ g4 ]  gets the pawn out of the bishops scope.
 [ c6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ g3 ]  still standard i could have transposed to the queens gambit by going 4.[ d4 ] but i want to stick with the Reti.
 [ N f2 + ]  [ K c1 ]  [ N x h1 ]  [ h6 ] , [ g x h6 ]  17. ..... [ g x h6 ] - and now Charlotte being the equivalent of a whole queen to the bad now waves the white flag. Better luck next time Charlotte!
 [ c6 ] , [ N c7 + ]  and lost the rook
 [ N b d7 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ d x c4 ]  [ B x c4 ] , [ b5 ]  The Meran Variation. This is a very heavily analysed variation and both sides are following mainline theory until about move 14.
 [ R a e1 ] , [ Q e7 ]  White pins pawn. Black breaks pin.
 [ N b c7 + ]  [ K f7 ] , [ Q f3 + ]  (?!) 11.[ N x a8 ] was probably stronger ex: 11...[ e x f2 + ] 12.[ K x f2 ] [ Q h4 + ] 13.[ g3 ] [ Q x e4 ] 14.Bg2. But Morphy did not want to divert his sights from the enemy king and this presumptuousness allowed some counter-chances...
 [ R f7 ]  [ R f4 ]  [ B c8 ] , [ c7 ]  Black's pieces are now quite tied down and have limited mobility.
 [ R a f8 ]  [ Q x h6 + ]  [ K g8 ]  [ B x f5 ]  [ R g7 ] , [ e4 ]  In truth I do not like this move because my attack has stalled. In order to win I still have to solve the problem of my inactive knight. I had hoped for the manoveur Ne4-[ N f6 ] but the strength of blacks bishop rules this out. Other possiblilies would be Ne2-[ N f4 ] but that would open up ...[ B d5 ] for black which is not good for me. Black for the moment is staying alive and is hoping for a white blunder. There is no really opportunity for white to press in with the attack so by playing 27. [ e4 ] as respite is ok because it frees me to play ne2-[ N f4 ] without fear of ...Bd5. I however could not prevent all of blacks counter chances so...
 [ a3 ]  [ N e4 ] , [ Q d5 ]  this leads to some interesting play but to white's disadvantage.
 [ K h1 ] , [ B x f4 ]  Desperation.
 [ B x c6 + ] , [ b x c6 ]  ...I trade it for my bishop disconnecting the remaining queenside pawns.
 [ K g3 ] , [ N e4 + ]  Block his way back
 [ N f6 ]  [ g3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ B g2 ]  [ c6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B g4 ] , [ d3 ]  A sort of King's Indian Attack type move freeing the other bishop covering [ [ e4 ] ] and [ [ c4 ] ] preparing either P[ [ e4 ] ] or P[ [ c4 ] ] and preventing Black from playing ... [ N e4 ]  [ B h5 ]  [ g4 ]  [ B g6 ]  [ N b d2 ] , [ e5 ]  Now I can't play [ e4 ] immediately because the [ B g6 ] [ N f6 ] and P[ d5 ] outnumber my supporting pieces on [ d3 ] and d2. So I harrass the B again.
 [ R x c5 ]  [ R a6 ]  [ a4 ] , [ R f6 ]  (EL) 62...RxRP would be followed by 63 R-[ B6 ] ch followed by R-[ N5 ] ch and PxR.
 [ g3 ] , [ b6 ]  Now to make white's bishop fall back.
 [ N f3 ]  [ N a6 ] , [ O-O-O ]  the queen wont go anywhere
 [ B d3 ] , [ b6 ]  giving my bishop a line for development
 [ R h5 ]  [ Q h1 ]  [ R a h8 ] , [ N e2 ]  [ N d2 ] still leaves Rf nowhere to run.
 [ d4 ]  [ B b6 ] , [ N f3 ]  White has good development in compensation for the pawn and loss of right to castle.
 [ K e1 ]  [ N x a1 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ N x c2 + ]  
 [ N e5 ] , [ N x e5 ]  He choses to exchange it. Better thand [ N d6 ] useless while the pawn can retake supported by the B. The only thing I didn't comment: Here black seems to own the white squares and he does... but while my N is in [ d2 ] I have nothing to fear: a black N in [ e4 ] doesn't bother me too much I can go on attacking. If the B goes there I'll exchange it. That's in theory.
 [ Q x b4 ] , [ h4 ]  ?! -- Stymies the aforementioned attack down the h-file. But White has a pawnstorm rolling now and Black's King has few places to hide.
 [ Q d5 ]  [ R c1 ] , [ d3 ]  Again with tempo.
 [ N d4 ] , [ R e1 ]  i dont want him to take my f pawn and if he goes to [ f3 ] i can double stack
 [ e x d4 ] , [ c x d4 ]  5. ... P[ x e4 ] was very nearly a forced move. 5. ... [ B b6 ] would have allowed 6. [ d5 ] capturing the pinned knight at c6.
 [ g x f6 ]  [ R x f6 ]  [ R g f1 ] , [ B x f5 ]  I win the pawn but how do I respond to Bxe5? Will the resulting exchanges be favourable for me?
 [ f x g4 ]  [ B x g4 ] , [ h3 ]  White wants to keep her castling options open. :)
 [ R b2 ] , [ R c3 ]  Preventing [ c2 ] to move
 [ Q h5 + ] , [ K d7 ]  Now I looked and looked and I didn't see anything better than to win a rook. I feared I could have thrown it away and lose the knight.
 [ K c6 ] , [ K a6 ]  It's a matter of time.
 [ N g7 ]  [ Q d4 ]  [ N e8 ]  [ B e4 ]  [ R d6 ]  [ Q c5 ]  [ K e7 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ K d8 ] , [ K f4 ]  Black resigns and thanks rocason for this and the other nice games!
 [ B x c6 + ]  [ b x c6 ] , [ B g5 ]  Instead of castling right away I decide to take advantage by pinning her other N. In fact I said pins are very nasty. But unlike before there is a small problem which we'll see on her next move. Having said that best was 7.0-0 getting my K to safety at once.
 [ K h7 ] , [ R a f1 ]  Battery.
 [ d6 ] , [ Q e1 ]  releiving the pinned knight
 [ N f5 ] , [ g4 ]  Need to harass the knight to get my rook over to the H file. In the process I lose time and block the rook myself from heading to the H-file quickly. He obviously sees the threat and is trying to neutralize it.
 [ e4 ] , [ g6 ]  My opponent lead off with the standard [ e4 ] opening. I decided to lead off with something a little different than normal for me from this position. However it still fell in line with the opening sequence I wanted.
 [ B x d5 ]  [ B x d5 ] , [ R a d1 ]  Show move 14. ...[ K x e7 ] ?
 [ b6 ]  [ a x b6 ]  [ Q x b6 ] , [ R a6 ]  Well getting out of the pin but now I will not be able to use this rook on the king side.
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d5 ] , [ c3 ]  Too slow better is [ c4 ] attacking the centre and leaving the option of playing [ N c3 ] open. The text move really hurts white more than it helps.
 [ K d7 ]  [ Q f7 + ] , [ K c8 ]  
 [ N f3 ] , [ c5 ]  Over time I find I favor this move. Now the game has transposed somewhat into a French Defense only with the LS bishop freed. I saw this on a video by Dereque Kelley on YouTube. It opened my eyes to how lines of play are inter- connected at times. I knew that in a way but never saw it. Before.
 [ B b4 ]  [ N g e2 ]  [ N x e4 ] , [ a3 ]  ? White is too far behind in development.
 [ N a4 ]  [ Q b5 ]  [ b3 ]  [ Q f5 ] , [ N f2 ]  ?? This is the first move that the computer shows as a serious error. Now the Black Q can exploit the weakness of White's K position. Better was h3.
 [ Q c2 ] , [ Q f4 ]  Now the complications are over. If you think about it white could have had many options the past few moves. Moves like [ Q b3 ] [ Q b5 ] [ B b5 ] [ Q c2 ] were all possible. We had to calculate a few of these options and make sure they weren't bad.
 [ N f2 ]  [ N f3 + ]  [ K e3 ]  [ N g1 ]  [ N h1 ]  [ a5 ]  [ K f2 ]  [ h2 ]  [ K g2 ]  [ N e2 ]  [ N f2 ]  [ h1 = Q + ] , [ K x h1 ]  White has defended the h file successfully but for what a price. The black King and knight are bothcloser to the a file than White. A fierce fight begins. Black can check.
 [ f4 ] , [ K g7 ]  preparing to meet [ Q h2 ] by [ R h8 ] stoping white from using the h-file.
 [ B d4 ]  [ B e4 ]  [ N d2 ] , [ N d5 ]  ?
 [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ e5 ]  The signature move of the Sveshnikov Sicillian
 [ Q x d6 ] , [ B e5 ]  I harass his Q for bringing that out before being able to complete his development.
 [ B x f3 ]  [ B x f3 ] , [ f x g5 ]  thats the reason i took his knight previous move
 [ a6 ] , [ N a3 ]  '?' - This move is something of a blunder. White overlooked a forcing sequence for Black that wins material.
 [ Q b3 ]  [ Q c2 ] , [ Q x c2 ]  keeping the weakness on [ c2 ]  [ f x e3 ]  [ f x e3 ] , [ B x e3 ]  black are realizing a full pawn.
 [ N c5 ]  [ e5 ] , [ Q c6 ]  Black departs from theory (15 ...[ Q x e5 ] usually leading quickly to an endgame). The text is an idea of Shirov's virtually forcing [ f3 ] and clogging up white's lines of attack.
 [ K f7 ]  [ R c4 ]  [ Q c8 ] , [ g4 ]  Now my plan is to play [ f4 ] to make squares for my bishop to retreat to and then play R-d4-[ d8 ] to win!
 [ R x e5 ] , [ d x e5 ]  But now black's pawns are far more hopeless than before with none of them supporting any other. Black's three isolated pawns have to stand up to white's 4 connected pawns a tough assignment. Meanwhile the superstar is going to be busy with white's two passed supported pawns.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ Q h5 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ g6 ] , [ Q f3 ]  Threatening Scholar's mate again.
 [ R f8 ]  [ O-O ]  [ d6 ]  [ B x c6 ] , [ b x c6 ]  8. ..... [ b x c6 ] - this exchange is recommended in the db and it does disturb the black queenside pawns. Also when up a pawn it is desirable to exchange pieces when you can.
 [ N x g3 ]  [ h x g3 ] , [ Q f6 ]  Offering a pawn after the queens come off (18.[ Q x f6 ] [ R x f6 ] 19.[ R x d5 ] ...). Probably 17...[ Q g5 ] was the more promising protecting the d-pawn and eyeing White's g-pawn not to mention the White King.
 [ e x d6 ] , [ K g1 ]  I will soon trade away for the other rook recognizing that I wanted to get the king moving.
 [ Q x e7 + ]  [ K x e7 ] , [ R x d8 ]  I'd like another one please helps relieve pressure on my king side.
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ c4 ] , [ e6 ]  My opponent opted for a queens gambit declined. The next few moves are common book opening moves
 [ c3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ Q b3 + ]  [ K h8 ]  [ c4 ] , [ B e6 ]  This stops the threat on my pawn while developing a piece.
 [ g3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ a3 ] , [ N e4 ]  I consider this knight to be in a strong outpost because although white can drive it off by playing f2-[ f3 ] that would further weaken her kings position to a drastically bad one.
 [ B x a5 ] , [ Q a3 ]  I am threatening [ Q x a5 ] now
 [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ] , [ N x d4 ]  4. [ N x d4 ] - all standard Sicilian moves.
 [ f5 ]  [ g x f5 ] , [ R e5 + ]  ?? the immedaite [ R x f5 ] is better.
 [ e5 ]  [ Q g4 + ]  [ K h8 ]  [ Q h4 ] , [ K g7 ]  Probably inviting for a perpetual after 22. [ Q g4 + ] but White has good reasons to play on and a little tactical trick...
 [ N c6 ] , [ K f1 ]  24. [ K f1 ] - Henry begins his trek over to the queenside.
 [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ g6 ]  I've been playing the Dragon for some time now and I quite like it - maybe not the soundest approach but normally gives healthy counter chances.
 [ N x e4 ]  [ B x e4 ]  [ R e2 ] , [ Q g5 ]  blunder the black queen puts it self to very dangerous spot which you will see next a nice combination finishes the game for black .
 [ Q h6 ]  [ Q a4 + ] , [ c6 ]  A mistake. Now White can drop his Queen onto a diagonal that prevents Black from castling.
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ f4 ] , [ d6 ]  way too early to make a decision like this: one of the tricks in the Sicilian is to not cover c5; [ d6 ] is usually played after [ e4 ] [ c5 ] [ N c3 ] d6...
 [ K b3 ]  [ N x d2 + ] , [ R x d2 ]  ...And to win a pawn.
 [ N x c4 ]  [ d x c4 ] , [ B e6 ]  and from this stage of game. either of his rooks cant really move. i thought he would come with n[ d4 ] and that looks scary to my LSB
 [ R a b1 ] , [ N c4 ]  Nothing better for black as forseen.
 [ h x g4 ]  [ Q e3 ] , [ R f b8 ]  20 [ h5 ] g5! Ward; and the queen is locked out of the action
 [ a4 ]  [ K e4 ] , [ a3 ]  White can control [ a1 ] now but its defense makes the game easier for black. 49...[ B c3 ] fails to 50.[ K d3 ] when the black bishop gets tied to the defense of the a pawn.
 [ R e1 ] , [ R f7 ]  more [ [ e7 ] ] protection. eventually i want to push my [ [ e7 ] ] pawn to [ e5 ] for a good blockade.
 [ N g6 ] , [ R g x h7 ]  Trading into an easily winning endgame.
 [ Q d7 ]  [ Q c2 ]  [ b6 ] , [ N d4 ]  I decide to aggressively move my king's knight to [ d4 ] and attack my opponent's white bishop. This knight will play a major role in the course of this game and will forever be close to my heart.
 [ h3 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ Q g5 ]  [ Q h4 ]  [ Q x h4 ]  [ R x h4 ] , [ B c8 ]  Finally the bishop is safe having been in the same spot since move 6.
 [ c3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ N b d2 ] , [ Q c7 ]  Both sides are finishing their development. I thought white might try [ b3 ] here to force cx[ b3 ] and relieve the cramping effect of the black c pawn.
 [ Q x h7 + ]  [ K f8 ]  [ Q e7 + ]  [ K g8 ] , [ Q e8 # ]  So finishing off my dearest chess enemy with tactical measures which happens to be his ground gave me a lot of pleasure. Hope you enjoyed it.
 [ K f8 ] , [ h5 ]  Hurtling down the board almost as fast as his opposite did earlier in the game - but with deadlier purpose.
 [ N g e7 ]  [ c3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ B x c6 + ]  [ N x c6 ]  [ c x d4 ] , [ B g4 ]  My opponent was just busy and wasnt concentrated well to this move:). Well it wasnt still easy to win the game against such a good player.
 [ R x g5 + ] , [ R g6 ]  I wish he accepts.
 [ B d6 ]  [ c3 ]  [ c5 ] , [ B e3 ]  Even though the game should still end in a draw the momentum of the game has shifted. Now it is Carlsen who is the one to do the pushing and Caruana the one who is defending. Even within a game you can see the momentum going up and down.
 [ N e6 ]  [ R d2 ]  [ g6 ] , [ K f2 ]  38. [ K f2 ] - although the queens are still on the board Henry bravely decides to help hold things together. Critically Fou Lenoir is now doubly defended by my royal couple and is now only attacked by the BQ.
 [ B f3 ] , [ c6 ]  His knight is dangerous i cant kick it because [ f5 ] is covering [ e4 ] and it starts to be dangerous so i wanna change my worse bishop to his good knight.
 [ R a7 ]  [ N h6 + ]  [ B x h6 ] , [ B x h6 ]  Blacks king is in a closed position.
 [ O-O ]  [ g3 ]  [ c5 ]  [ c3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B g2 ] , [ B g4 ]  black now has all his minor pieces mobilised and he has castled so far then the theory behind the gambit for black is coming through
 [ Q f3 + ]  [ K g1 ]  [ Q f2 + ]  [ K h1 ]  [ Q f3 + ]  [ K g1 ] , [ Q f2 + ]  1/2-1/2
 [ B e6 ]  [ B x e6 ]  [ f x e6 ]  [ N x e6 ]  [ Q e7 ]  [ N x f8 ]  [ R x f8 ]  [ d3 ]  [ h6 ]  [ h3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ O-O-O ]  Castling short would be nasty here.
 [ Q f4 + ]  [ K b1 ]  [ Q x f5 + ]  [ K a1 ] , [ Q x f2 ]  Black feeding on a steady diet of pawns lets the position slip as white is gaining the upper hand positionally.
 [ h3 ]  [ B x f3 ]  [ Q x f3 ] , [ O-O-O ]  I castle to get my king away from battle and my rook near it.
 [ d4 ] , [ d5 ]  Hi everyone! At last I have a game of my own to annotate. It looked as though my game was going nowhere until after a queen trade my rooks somehow ended up on my opponent's second rank. To have just one rook there can be a bone in the throat to my opponent but two ....... well read on. Gameknot Analysis is provided for this game as follows:- http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=15155377&fb=1&rnd=0.7747064337826831
 [ B x e6 ] , [ Q x e6 + ]  ?! I feel that [ Q x e5 ] was better here
 [ B f5 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ B x d3 ] , [ R x d3 ]  Maybe not the right choice but I thought that a tempo in doubling rooks was interesting to unbalance the position... one side or another. Moreover I was looking hard at c4...
 [ c x d6 ]  [ B b6 + ]  [ K e8 ] , [ Q x b5 + ]  Well you might say that it isn't all that bad for me. I got equal material and decent enough pieces. But really my position is awkward now and black's situation is getting better.
 [ N c6 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ O-O-O ] , [ N e5 ]  Another variation is 10...[ Q a5 ] 11.[ B b3 ] [ R f c8 ] 12.[ h4 ] adopted by Dragon exponent Christopher Ward.
 [ B e7 ] , [ N e5 ]  I believe this cost white winning chances. Obviously offering up a trade for black's weak knight on [ d7 ] and eventually leading to the queen exchange and busted pawn structure that you will see for white in the next few moves. The intention was actually to strengthen my pawn structure kingside by moving the isolated d pawn to e file and after black castled launching a kingside attack. All of whites pieces are aimed that direction and ready to go just a simple miscalculation. Should have played 12. [ N x d5 ] [ B x d5 ] 13. Ne5... and continued with the same idea and I think I would have been ok.
 [ N e7 ] , [ a3 ]  I didn't understand this move. Probably he was planning to bring his knight to [ b4 ] via a2... I thought on [ a5 ] with the intention to follow with a4... and avoiding the white bishop to go to a6!
 [ R a6 ]  [ K d3 ]  [ a4 ]  [ K c2 ]  [ a3 ]  [ K b1 ]  [ a2 + ] , [ K a1 ]  perfect....i thought....so this guy ask me for a draw....i told him that i will but he must challenge again else i will play on.....so he didnt!!!! i went on-later i realized he cannot speak english...pmpl and crying sametime
 [ R g7 ]  [ Q b3 ] , [ b5 ]  Skilled almost effortless. Very proud of this move.
 [ g6 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ N d3 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ N x c5 ]  [ B x f3 ]  [ g x f3 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ B x e5 ]  [ R x e5 ]  [ R x e5 ]  [ B x e5 ]  [ R e1 ] , [ R e8 ]  Now the pressure is on my Bishop rather than his pawn.
 [ R x c6 ]  [ N e4 ] , [ R d c8 ]  doubled: this means although I am 2 pawns ahead I am defending again...
 [ Q b2 ] , [ R x e1 + ]  very nice don't You think?
 [ O-O ]  [ b3 ] , [ N b c6 ]  Too little too late? Black attempts a strong counter attacking the pawn on [ d4 ] but it's easily defended. Positioning is key in this game and black just doesn't have enough of it.
 [ O-O ] , [ O-O ]  11. 0-0 - both sides castle and now comes a little tactical melee which will result in a trade off of my advanced f pawn for the advanced white doubleton on the c column maintaining my 1 pawn advantage.
 [ R a b8 ] , [ N c4 ]  A shocking blunder. Black is hoping to remove the bishop and defend the square but Black can now infiltrate. 29. [ R b1 ] was best guarding the file. Black can win the pawn but White would have kept his small advantage.
 [ f x e4 ]  [ R d1 ]  [ e x f3 ]  [ g x f3 ] , [ R c x h2 ]  no need to carry on. the end!
 [ K d6 ] , [ Q x f6 + ]  11. [ Q x f6 + ] - Glenda forces an exchange of queens and I will be going into the middlegame two clear pawns up. Although the BK is well placed in the centre now that the queens are off the board I can feel confident of forcing a victory here. My opponent thought so and waved the white flag.
 [ d x c4 ]  [ N d x c4 ]  [ Q d5 ]  [ R a d1 ]  [ R f d8 ] , [ Q e3 ]  underestimating Blacks' possibilities: [ Q e2 ] is safer leaving [ N e3 ] open after an upcoming b5...
 [ N g4 ] , [ Q b6 ]  Attacking the pawn and thus bringing the rook into play with tempo.
 [ Q b3 + ]  [ Q e6 ] , [ d5 ]  Black probably now wishes he had eliminated this pawn. The queen has to move again but her safety options are quickly running out. Note the impending rook and queen discoveries on [ f1 ] and [ b3 ] are crushing.
 [ R e5 e7 + ]  [ K c8 ]  [ B x b6 ]  [ R g g2 ]  [ R c7 + ]  [ K d8 ]  [ R g7 + ]  [ K c8 ] , [ R e8 + ]  
 [ e x d4 ]  [ Q x d4 ] , [ b6 ]  I have practiced heavily against this move. I like the opening because the queen can be easily forced away.
 [ R a7 ] , [ Q b3 ]  planning qa4! stopping the push
 [ N f3 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ Q d1 ]  4 queen moves in the 9 first white moves ; that is the point black will try to point out. [ Q b3 ] have also been tried but [ Q d1 ] seems stronger. white have one pawn advance but all this is the main theorical line
 [ b4 ]  [ N a6 ] , [ N x e6 ]  I was wondering why white did not advance 15. [ b5 ]  [ f x e6 ]  [ a3 ]  [ B x e5 ]  [ B x e5 ] , [ N x e5 ]  Time to finally take the lone white e pawn & following exchanges. At this point I think the game is fairly even. Black's double pawn is not necessarily a significant minus.
 [ R x f1 + ]  [ K x f1 ] , [ K d7 ]  Maybe better 19. ... h6. But I thought that opening the 8th rank for the rook would accelerate the rooks development.
 [ B d2 ]  [ B x d2 ] , [ Q x d2 ]  Another exchange and now with the wood reduced even if he gains a space advantage I have nothing to be cramped.
 [ B e7 ] , [ a3 ]  Locking the Q-side Pawns and freeing his QR.
 [ B f3 ] , [ N x e4 ]  Thanks.
 [ B f5 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ R e4 ]  [ R x e4 ] , [ B x e4 ]  21. ........... [ B x e4 ] - but the pressure came down the e file and black allowed an exchange of a pair of rooks. This cuts down black's chances of a mating attack along the h file but I must still be careful.
 [ B c5 + ]  [ K g2 ] , [ N g5 ]  I am setting up attack with Knights and Bishop
 [ B x f6 ] , [ N c3 ]  Now the Knight's in a pin.
 [ K f8 ]  [ g7 + ]  [ B x g7 ]  [ h x g7 + ] , [ K g8 ]  Black's only feasible move.
 [ h5 ] , [ h4 ]  38. [ h4 ] - after playing this move black waved the white flag. If [ [ b5 ] ] I will then play b3. So here is a puzzle. Is black really in a zugzwang? If you were black would you play [ a5 ] [ [ b5 ] ] or move your king back to [ c7 ] [ d7 ] or e7? Answers on a post card.
 [ N x e5 ]  [ R x e5 ]  [ B x f3 ] , [ R f5 ]  This move traps the rook.
 [ B d7 ] , [ B f1 ]  Not sure what this move accomplishes. 15. dc bc 16. [ c5 ] is stronger but Black is still equal.
 [ c5 ] , [ N e5 ]  white was going to lose a pawn anyways.
 [ N f8 ]  [ N b3 ]  [ B c6 ]  [ c5 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ N g1 ] , [ K h8 ]  saves a tempo in case of [ B c4 + ]  [ e x f4 ] , [ g4 ]  this allows the bishop sacrifice (not 25. ... Ng7? 26. [ B x f6 ] +-)
 [ B f1 ] , [ c x b4 ]  I’m flustered as I feel things slipping away. Chess is as much as anything else a psychological game and I’m cracking here. B-[ f1 ] wasn’t the best move but I made it anyway…..KO prefers Q-[ d1 ] and R-[ c1 ] both of which protect my vulnerable pawn on [ [ c2 ] ] which is the base of my pawn chain..... Black captures my pawn on [ b4 ] and my queenside collapses. My [ [ c2 ] ] pawn is now wide open and waiting for black’s rook to swoop down and gobble it up.
 [ N x c5 ] , [ b x c5 ]  White crashes through and can threaten Qxf7.
 [ K d3 ] , [ R x d2 + ]  2 Sacrificing the Exchange!
 [ B x e3 ]  [ Q x e3 ]  [ Q g2 ]  [ N f2 ] , [ h x g4 ]  Here. A solid +2 pawn's advantage and a cramped position for white is all I need.
 [ K b7 ]  [ Q x g2 ] , [ R e3 + ]  It might have been better for Black to trade rooks here and allow a free queen in the backfield.
 [ N b8 ] , [ c5 ]  i don't do this too often but i was going for a good pawn push early (for some reason). You will find out later on it was the difference in the game/right decision
 [ O-O ] , [ B x c3 ]  Now that White has castled if I take this knight I can create a little center play where I go up a pawn at least momentarily.
 [ B e7 ] , [ e6 ]  28. [ e6 ] - threatening a bishop fork on g7.
 [ B b2 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B g2 ]  [ B e6 ] , [ N e2 ]  White hyperpassive play is difficult to handle.
 [ d6 ] , [ h3 ]  defend against your light bishop pinning my knight to my queen
 [ R a6 ]  [ Q b4 ]  [ R c4 ] , [ Q a3 ]  Pegged back but trying to keep the pawn defended
 [ c4 ] , [ N f6 ]  Playing [ N f6 ] is all pretty standard against Queens gambit... But I didn't play [ d5 ] yet...
 [ d x c5 ] , [ R x c5 ]  An isolated pawn structure should not bother black as long as he remains active as he is.
 [ K f2 ]  [ K f8 ]  [ Q x b8 + ]  [ K g7 ] , [ R x a1 ]  Greed will get you even 1700 players suffer from it.
 [ R g1 ]  [ R f e8 ]  [ Q x d2 ]  [ Q x d2 ]  [ R x d2 ] , [ B d7 ]  Back again! Now we have reached a positionally won ending for White. Far from being "draw-ish" the opposite colored bishops offer White incontestable control of the kingside dark squares! Black's king cannot move his rooks cannot occupy the queening square [ d8 ] and Black's only hope is to blockade on the light square d7.
 [ B d2 ]  [ Q f6 ] , [ c3 ]  Helping to protect the [ d4 ] pawn.
 [ R e6 ]  [ a x b5 ] , [ c x b5 ]  White continues to accumulate material advantage. In this kind of position I prefer to slowly accumulate a material lead instead of attempting a quick kill. That's not quite how it worked out here though.
 [ K x h4 ] , [ Q h2 + ]  so another check and thinking about some other plan of course not like move no. 16 di+
 [ R x e2 ]  [ R x e2 + ]  [ K x e2 ]  [ B b1 ]  [ a3 ]  [ h5 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ N b4 ]  [ a5 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ K g7 ] , [ K e3 ]  The White King appears fully able to penetrate the Queenside and capture the pawn island to force a victory rather quickly. The GK computer gives Black up for lost at 14...[ Q f6 ] but there is more to the position. Analysis of the game with a better chess engine might prove interesting.
 [ Q d1 ] , [ N e4 ]  If I took the [ f3 ] knight right away then if gx[ f3 ] my knight could no longer come to e4.
 [ d x e6 ]  [ B x e6 ]  [ R x f4 ] , [ B d5 ]  This is why I thought I was a little better then earlier. The reason being are those doubled pawns which are now passed pawns. And it's where I kept in mind that doubled pawns can be beneficial if one could promote and I also kept in mind that I had my LSB at this point defending both of them. But I overlooked the fact that his K effectively blocks both of my passers which is another reason that there's no hope left for white at this point.
 [ f4 ] , [ B e4 ]  Oh that's right I needed the [ f5 ] protection never mind.
 [ d x c3 ]  [ e ]  [ p ]  [ + ] , [ N c4 ]  too late... Notice that from this point to the end of the game My opponent made a large number of mistakes because of the psychological factor. I won't judge my opponent's mistakes as I don't have the right to criticize him because this game was still disputed. I'm going to show you just the computer analysis.
 [ B e7 ] , [ e3 ]  Opens up White bishop to move
 [ B g2 ] , [ N g4 ]  Tempting White to advance the h-pawn and weaken his King's defence.
 [ K h1 ]  [ B b2 ]  [ Q f5 ] , [ R e7 ]  At this move I was studying the possiblity of the sacrifice with Nf4. In the end I took my precautions and retreated my rook.
 [ c3 ] , [ B g4 ]  Leaving a hole on b7.
 [ Q f3 ]  [ Q x b2 ]  [ N x g8 + ]  [ K d8 ]  [ Q x f6 + ]  [ Q x f6 ]  [ N x f6 ]  [ K c8 ] , [ R e8 + ]  Knowing that being a rook & knight up esp. vs. a GM that there isn't much hope and Black resigns.
 [ B x c3 ]  [ B x c3 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ Q d3 ] , [ B f5 ]  I threat Ng3.
 [ Q x e6 ] , [ R d8 ]  Preparing for Rxf8.
 [ B g5 ]  [ e6 ]  [ f4 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ Q f3 ]  [ b5 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ g x f6 ]  [ a3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N x c6 ]  [ Q x c6 ] , [ O-O-O ]  this is standard for both sides i dont like to queenside castle
 [ e4 ] , [ f6 ]  1. ......... [ f6 ] - an unusual opening - this is called Barnes' Defense. This is very similar to Damiano's Defense but this opening is not as easy to exploit as it first seems.
 [ N x d4 ]  [ N g8 ] , [ B d3 ]  Black now has no developed pieces while White has three and an annoying advanced pawn. This isn't a fantastic square for the bishop but it is better than where it started and is safe from pawn attack.
 [ g x f5 ]  [ g x f5 ] , [ Q g2 + ]  ! Winning material taking back the initiative. So what if it didn't work out? I had a massive advantage out of the opening and in a closer game this would have been the kind of tactic that immediately flips the advantage entirely in white's favor. Credit where due.
 [ R b8 + ] , [ K a3 ]  
 [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ a6 ] , [ B a4 ]  Entering Ruy Lopez...
 [ Q x c7 ]  [ O-O ] , [ O-O ]  I finally castle. White has a near winning advantage.
 [ O-O ]  [ e4 ] , [ c6 ]  Too slow. Black's counterplay in the King's Indian Attack needs to come from swift queen side advances or exchanges in the centre. 6. ... [ c5 ] or [ d5 ] was better.
 [ h6 ]  [ R f h8 ]  [ Q x f6 ]  [ R d e8 ]  [ f4 ] , [ K a7 ]  P[ f5 ] means black loses Pd6.
 [ e x d4 ]  [ B g5 ] , [ B x e4 ]  I exchange Black's best piece.
 [ K f3 ]  [ Q f1 + ] , [ K g4 ]  It is better to move 39.[ K e3 ] Now the King will be stuck on the g and h files
 [ K g8 ] , [ Q c2 ]  ? -- Giving Black an opportunity to simplify which almost always helps the defender (though not in this case). White should have just played 32. [ R h7 ] [ R h7 ] 33. [ R h7 ] robbing Black of any counterplay.
 [ B b4 ]  [ N c4 ]  [ N b8 ] , [ Q e3 ]  I was looking for more options with the Q in the centre of the board
 [ h6 ] , [ e4 ]  White has an imposing center - Black will need to challenge it soon. The most frequent central pawn breaks in the Nimzo for Black are ...[ [ c5 ] ] and ...d5. In this case however the c6-Knight prevents ...[ [ c5 ] ] and the previous pawn move to [ d6 ] means that ...[ d5 ] does not come with tempo.
 [ B a4 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ d3 ]  old main line that avoids immediate tactics in favor for slow middle game build up. Don't let the position fool you white usually ends up having a very good game outside the berlin walls. This is one of the made reason why most top players prefer the berlin.
 [ h x g3 ]  [ a4 ]  [ B e6 + ]  [ K h8 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ a3 ]  [ e5 ]  [ f x e5 ]  [ R h7 + ]  [ K g8 ]  [ R c7 ]  [ B c3 ]  [ R a7 ] , [ R b a8 ]  Black will be happy to trade rooks.
 [ B x h6 ]  [ N x f2 ]  [ R x e8 + ] , [ R x e8 ]  I quite happily accept the rook exchange as it simplifies the situation further. My hands started to shake over my chessboard at this point as I felt that a win against my highest rated opponent ever was on the cards! At this point I see white's pieces in disarray. The Queen and Rook are in the corner exerting minimal influence over the game while my material is poised. I feel like I have control over the center of the board and I try to move quickly to capitalise and find a mate as soon as possible.
 [ Q f5 + ] , [ K b8 ]  Now that my king is safe I can finally take advantage of my lead in material
 [ a3 ] , [ c5 ]  An attempt to keep the White Q-side Pawns from steamrollering my position.
 [ B x d4 ] , [ e x d4 ]  In my opinion knights are stronger than bishops.
 [ c x b6 ]  [ Q x b6 ] , [ N e5 ]  This sets up a tactic against the black king.
 [ B x f8 ]  [ R x f8 ]  [ R f4 ]  [ R f f7 ] , [ R x f7 ]  Black resigned on grounds of more loss of material. I hope you enjoyed the game.
 [ O-O ]  [ N d5 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ R x d5 ]  [ R a d8 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ c6 ] , [ R d2 ]  Chases the rook.
 [ N f3 ] , [ e6 ]  A somewhat non-committal move as Black can still choose from many Sicilian systems such as the Scheveningen the Taimanov and the Kan variation. Nevertheless 2...[ [ d6 ] ] is more often seen which can lead to the hyper-sharp Najdorf and dragon variations. Another possibility is 2...[ N c6 ] which can lead to the accelerated dragon and the Sveshnikov. (Other transpositions are also possible) Another advantage of this move is that it discourages 3.[ B [ b5 ] ] as after 3...a6! the bishop has to retreat because 4.Ba4?? [ b5 ] 5.[ B b3 ] [ c4 ] loses it. This move (3.Bb5) is a good possibility against 2...[ [ d6 ] ] and 2...[ N c6 ] though.
 [ g5 + ]  [ K e7 ]  [ Q h4 ] , [ g6 ]  Now I feel a bit safer - but no so....
 [ N b4 ]  [ N x b4 ]  [ c x b4 ]  [ B d2 ] , [ a5 ]  I thought Knight trade was good choice because Black would make bad pawn position after trade. But now I'm having pressure by [ b4 ] [ a6 ] pawns....
 [ N a5 ]  [ B x e6 + ] , [ Q x e6 ]  26. ..... [ Q x e6 ] - Glenda is now forced to take over the blockading role. This is not good.
 [ R x b7 ] , [ R e4 e1 ]  Knowing what I did and seeing that my [ a7 ] is en-prise I go right after his R. Once he protects I exchange on h4. The idea is compromising Carl's semi open file. That plan however is going to fail. So was thinking along the wrong lines. As I thought it would work but I overlook a variation that it will make it fail.
 [ B e2 ]  [ N e7 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ Q e6 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ Q d7 ] , [ O-O ]  I am prepared to handle anything black throws at me and then some.
 [ Q d2 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ B e2 ]  ?! White misses something.
 [ B a4 ] , [ N g4 ]  At first glance I wasn't very worried about this attack that I considered too premature but keeping in mind the rating of my opponent and that I was playing a variation a didn't know I thought I should be prepare for anything.
 [ B x f3 ]  [ R f1 ]  [ B c6 ]  [ g x f6 ]  [ g6 ]  [ B d3 ] , [ N x d3 + ]  Ahead in material I am more than happy to exchange the pieces off the board this move also creates an isolated d-pawn which could become the point of an attack as it can be a serious weakness
 [ b x c3 ] , [ b5 ]  I think trying to save the c pawn in the Gambit Accepted is usually a dangerous idea.
 [ g3 ]  [ Q f6 ]  [ N e2 ] , [ h5 ]  Still trying to create gaps/weaknesses on that kingside.
 [ Q e2 ]  [ Q e8 ]  [ B c3 ] , [ K g8 ]  41. .... [ K g8 ] - more piece shuffling.
 [ N f6 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ a3 ]  [ h6 ] , [ B e3 ]  
 [ c x b3 ]  [ e ]  [ p ]  [ a x b3 ] , [ R x g7 ]  I thought of that and I liked the position cause I can join my other rook in the game.
 [ N f5 ] , [ g6 ]  With the white queen on the a8-[ h1 ] diagonal and the white knight guarding [ d4 ] my queen can no longer check the black king with a single move which means that I can't take my queen off the c file. Fortuantely the white knight is easy to bump.
 [ Q d7 ]  [ b x c5 ] , [ b x c5 ]  I have one big advantage theoretically: the clear white bishop which is necessary to the attack is blocked by the defense of e4. But white could easily poses the queen on [ c2 ] and free the bishop. I am surprised he never did that... On the other side...
 [ R x e7 ]  [ B a6 ] , [ R f f7 ]  I double on the seventh.
 [ c4 ] , [ B h3 ]  I don't know why I hoped to catch my opponent napping with this.
 [ Q x d6 ]  [ N g f6 ] , [ R d1 ]  I soon took over the D file But it was made so he also had it closed. I needed to break through some how.
 [ f5 ] , [ B d5 ]  Maybe White could have tried to take the e5+[ f5 ] pawns for its light-squared bishop trying to put Black's King into a mating net.
 [ K d3 ]  [ K d5 ]  [ a6 ]  [ e4 + ]  [ K c2 ]  [ d3 + ]  [ K c3 ]  [ K d6 ] , [ N d4 ]  52. Nd4!! - This move proves decisive. Henry's steed threatens to pick off the f pawn with check. But he also provides two other vital roles. Firstly he defends my c pawn. Secondly he prepares [ b6 ] which will entomb that dark squared bishop. Even if the black king were to move then at least Henry would not have to dodge a check from the dsb before I had a chance to entomb him. He decides to back up the f pawn with his g pawn. Now comes the coup de grace.
 [ N d3 ]  [ N x b4 ] , [ N x b4 ]  Instead GK suggested taking the Bishop would have been better. 25. [ N x e5 ] [ d x e5 ] 26. [ b3 ] ax[ b3 ] 27. Rx[ b3 ] [ R d8 ] 28. [ a x b4 ] [ R d2 ] 29. [ Q e3 ] [ f5 ] 30. [ R b b1 ] [ R c c2 ] 31. [ R b d1 ] [ R x d1 ] 32. [ R x d1 ] [ R x f2 ] 33. [ R d8 + ] [ K f7 ]  [ R x b4 ]  [ Q c2 ]  [ R c4 ] , [ Q d3 ]  another mistake I should have moved the Queen back to [ e2 ]  [ N x f2 ] , [ K x f2 ]  A desperate move but I thought if I had taken back with the Rook it wold have led to a devastating skewer...with his BSB to d4. GK recommended moving the Queen to [ f3 ]  [ R b3 ] , [ R f3 ]  Well I am helping out (unintentionally) Mate(6)
 [ K f2 ] , [ B d7 ]  releasing Ra8...
 [ Q a3 ] , [ Q x c7 ]  Here endali offered a draw which I accepted.However there is still a lot of play in this position.Black has a weakness on the back rank and the c6-pawn might be hard to stop.However White has to be careful not to allow perpetual check.I also worked lines out for this but that I will post later.All in all it was a very exciting game.
 [ N c5 ]  [ N d6 ]  [ c4 ] , [ Q c7 ]  I like P[ x c3 ] e.p. much better. White now has a pawn and bishop bearing down on poor little P[ d5 ] which black will kiss goodbye.
 [ B x c4 + ]  [ b x c4 ] , [ b3 ]  Although I will get something from the match somewhere here my opponent declared a mate in 4 and I was able to outsmart him and last a little longer!
 [ b5 ] , [ B x f6 ]  Now the change is suitable and black castling is not very safe
 [ N x e4 ] , [ Q d3 ]  The only move owing to the knight fork threat.
 [ d x e6 ]  [ Q d8 + ]  [ K e2 ]  [ Q d6 ]  [ R x e7 ]  [ Q e5 + ]  [ K f1 ]  [ Q f5 + ]  [ K e2 ]  [ Q e5 + ]  [ K f1 ]  [ Q f5 + ]  [ Q f2 ]  [ Q h3 + ] , [ K e2 ]  If capture the Bishop - 58.[ Q f7 + ] [ K h7 ] 59.Qxg7#.
 [ K e7 ] , [ N a7 ]  Controlling the queening square.
 [ B x g6 + ] , [ K h8 ]  Too late black sees that getting the King in the open is not a good idea (Qd3...) Les noirs réalisent que la sortie du Roi serait suicidaire.
 [ K h2 ] , [ B e6 ]  If ...[ Q x e1 ] Nf6#. ([ N e7 ] would also win were it not for the knight guarding it.) I think my opponent realizes this before I do but soon enough I catch on and my new objective becomes luring the queen off the f-file.
 [ B b7 ]  [ O-O ]  [ d6 ] , [ N d4 ]  (!) Discovering a threat on Black's g4-knight with an attack on Black's queen. If 13...[ N x d4 ] 14.[ c x d4 ] and White shores up his queenside spatial gains.
 [ K c1 ] , [ Q x b2 + ]  20. ....... [ Q x b2 ] (another pawn goes and my king now has to run for the hills!)
 [ N x d5 ] , [ Q x g7 ]  hmm thinkin got rook and knight!
 [ N c3 ] , [ N c6 ]  and thats always my 2nd
 [ e x f6 ] , [ N x f6 ]  Another big blunder. It was time Black plays ...Bd7. Now Black will lose his knight with 22.[ Q e6 ] and 23.[ Q x f6 ]  [ e6 ]  [ c4 ] , [ c5 ]  Black appears to be aiming for a Modern Benoni type position.
 [ K h8 ]  [ Q x e6 ]  [ Q x e6 ] , [ B x e6 ]  Here got rid of the Queens leaving only to attack the King. Another thing is Bishop is attacking the pawn at [ f5 ] he has to defend them. He can use the Rook for the moment.
 [ f6 ] , [ Q f4 ]  Seems like the best square since on [ d4 ] it can be chased yet again with 13...c5. (Yes it can be chased from this square with 13...[ g5 ] but that would needlessly weaken the kingside.)
 [ N d6 ]  [ K g2 ]  [ N e4 ] , [ N f5 ]  more pesky forks threatened so I cannot get the f apawn
 [ K b4 ]  [ R x b5 + ]  [ K c4 ]  [ R a5 ] , [ R e7 + ]  Very important or else I can't capture the Knight because of Rxa4+.
 [ R x f1 ]  [ R x f1 + ]  [ K c2 ] , [ f5 ]  Begin the pawn advance. Having connected pawns is a huge advantage in this end game.
 [ d5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ c6 ]  [ e3 ]  [ B b4 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ N b d7 ]  [ Q c2 ]  [ h6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ] , [ B d2 ]  until this move I'v found 14 games (11 w / 0 l / 3 d) black tried several moves but was never able to win!
 [ K d8 ] , [ N f7 + ]  ...and the rook goes bye.
 [ R a f8 ]  [ N x f7 ]  [ R x f7 ]  [ R h h1 ]  [ Q f2 ]  [ R h g1 + ]  [ K f8 ]  [ R d e1 ] , [ R e7 ]  now it's a matting pattern from here on in.
 [ e4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ d5 ] , [ N d2 ]  I really don't like when my opponent plays the french defense. That's why I joined the tournament "French battles". I hoped to discover the weaknesses of the defense by playing it. Recently I started to play the Tarrasch variation which at first sight is complex but actually is quite comfortable for the white.
 [ B x d3 ]  [ R a2 ]  [ R h e8 ]  [ b4 ] , [ Q g6 ]  What can White do? If [ R g1 ] [ R x e3 + ] 16. fe [ Q g3 + ] 17 hg Bxg3#. And if [ N h4 ] the same combination works equally well. White's choice however is no better. (White's only chance here was Nf1)
 [ B g2 ] , [ N x f2 ]  oh well I'll take what's on offer then ...
 [ B x d3 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ R x c5 ]  [ B x f3 ]  [ R a5 ] , [ Q e2 ]  ..i want to force off pieces as i am a piece up...
 [ Q d6 ]  [ B x c8 ]  [ R x c8 ] , [ Q b1 ]  i want to enter with the queen by [ Q a2 ]  [ B x a3 ]  [ Q a2 + ]  [ N c4 ]  [ R d c1 ] , [ B x b2 ]  the only chance to save the bishop
 [ K e4 ] , [ K f8 ]  Now 52. ... h5? 53. [ g x [ h5 ] ] [ K g7 ] is not possible because of 54. [ K f3 ] [ K h6 ] 55. [ K g4 ] and the white king is in time to defend the hS-pawn. The point of the text is that White is in zugzwang. His king has to stay on the e-file to be able to meet the threat of 53. ... [ h5 ] 54. [ g x [ h5 ] ] [ K g7 ]  [ K e4 ]  [ K d6 ]  [ K d4 ] , [ h6 ]  And here it is. Black takes the oppo­sition and the white king must give way.
 [ g x h5 ]  [ e x f3 ] , [ B x f3 ]  Now we have a BISHOP v KNIGHT battle but his pieces are all stuck while mine are all active. I-D-J To be honest I just started playing. I have been watching some videos with some good annotations and I have been picking up a lot of new things in a short period of time but still make some interesting moves (9.[ B e2 ] - !?IDK) but this was the first time I actually felt like I understood my plan and his plan and made him react
 [ N x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ] , [ Q x d5 ]  ?? This seems okay but this is what should happen now: Qxd5! [ e x d5 ] Bh5! wins bishop or rook for bishop.
 [ R x e1 + ]  [ Q x e1 ] , [ Q d7 ]  Keeping all entry points closed off.
 [ B e2 ]  [ R c2 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ R c5 ]  [ B e8 ]  [ R c8 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ R d8 ]  [ e5 ]  [ K f8 ]  [ R d6 ]  [ K e7 ]  [ B a4 ]  [ R x d6 ] , [ e x d6 + ]  I give up a pawn but advance the game. Conservative play is in order. I starting looking for trades.
 [ R e2 ]  [ R b a8 ] , [ R c2 ]  Although white has two weaknesses ([ a2 ] and c3) and black has got only one [ b5 ] along with the bad bishop I would say that the position is drawish. Black can hardly open the postion with [ K g7 ] and f6. It would give white also chances.
 [ Q e5 + ]  [ B e7 ]  [ B d5 ]  [ d6 ]  [ Q d4 ]  [ N x d5 ] , [ N x d5 ]  after taking the bishop here whith the knight o-o-o looks even better.
 [ b5 ] , [ a x b5 ]  else [ b4 ] looks bad for white ?
 [ f x e5 ]  [ f x e5 ]  [ Q h4 + ]  [ g3 ] , [ Q e4 + ]  a standard attack: but it will not hold...
 [ N c3 ] , [ Q x b2 ]  free pawn
 [ K c3 ]  [ Q d4 + ]  [ K d2 ] , [ Q x a1 ]  here I go for the rook and point advantage
 [ Q f5 ]  [ Q f3 + ]  [ Q x f3 ] , [ B x f3 + ]  White resigns. After 24. [ K c2 ] [ B x e4 + ] the [ [ h5 ] ] pawn will drop as well leaving Black a piece up; while if 24. [ K e1 ] [ B h4 + ] 25. [ K f1 ] [ B x e4 ] White must lose time (and again will not save the [ [ h5 ] ] pawn) due to the threat of Bd3#. Bad luck for White but a very dramatic and exciting game!
 [ O-O ]  [ O-O-O ]  [ d3 ] , [ Q g6 ]  The Queen comes to the Kingside for future use
 [ Q d7 ]  [ N e2 ] , [ R e7 x e4 ]  a big blunder that gives up a rook for very little in return.
 [ K e8 ]  [ Q e4 + ]  [ K f7 ]  [ Q f4 + ]  [ R f6 ] , [ Q x f6 + ]  ! And now Black has no hope - his king will not be able to stop my new set of three connected passed pawns!
 [ K e1 ] , [ f5 ]  ?! Black before pressing the white king further chooses to shut the queen out of the kingside and may have hopes for [ g x f5 ] to remove some of the building threat but this overlooks another alternative by white by enpassant.
 [ B x a3 ]  [ R e d1 ] , [ B c5 ]  [ R e8 ] makes it even easier for me not that it matters at this stage.
 [ c x d4 ]  [ e x d4 ] , [ N f e1 ]  I don't get this move relocating to c2? to [ g2 ] after g3? freeing up the LSB? Where would the LSB go? [ B f3 ] seems the only logical square but it gets countered by [ f5 ] and if [ B x e4 ] [ f x e4 ] I have an amazing center and the bisschop pair so that wouldn't be good and he'd have to find a square for his d3-knight to be able to play [ d3 ] and exploit the pin on my e4-knight. Plus the f1-knight really would have to go to c2. But well then there's the question: what else can he play? I don't see any decent moves...
 [ N x e4 ]  [ B x e4 ] , [ N f6 ]  Gaining a tempo while opening up the c8-[ h3 ] diagonal for black's LSB.
 [ h x g4 ]  [ f x g4 ]  [ B g5 + ]  [ K e8 ] , [ N c7 + ]  
 [ B e6 ]  [ K g2 ] , [ f5 ]  ...but this turned the game in my favour...
 [ Q f4 ]  [ K g8 ] , [ N g3 ]  restricting his counter play
 [ B e7 ]  [ B b5 + ] , [ N c6 ]  that is a blonder black loosing a bishop after 12.Rd1-Qa5.13.Bxf6-Bxf6.14.Qxf6.... better was 11...[ N b d7 ] but after 12.Rd1-0-0.13.0-0 it seems that black in very difficult situation .
 [ O-O ]  [ f6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ a6 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ R x c8 ]  [ R x c8 ]  [ e4 ]  [ N d5 b6 ]  [ g3 ]  [ R c3 ] , [ R b1 ]  22.Rb1? drops the N!
 [ g3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B g2 ] , [ N c6 ]  White fianchettoes his *other* Bishop while Black develops both Knights. This is a typical hypermodern setup with Black occupying the center directly and White attacking it from the wings.
 [ B g5 ] , [ B x d6 ]  Well gotta get the pawn anyway.
 [ B f2 + ]  [ K x f2 ]  [ R x h3 ]  [ Q x h3 ]  [ O-O-O ]  [ Q e3 ]  [ R h8 ]  [ B f3 ]  [ N b6 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ Q d7 ]  [ N e2 ]  [ N b d5 ]  [ Q a3 ]  [ a6 ]  [ B g3 ]  [ g5 ]  [ Q c5 ]  [ K d8 ]  [ B e5 ]  [ g4 ]  [ B x f6 + ]  [ g x f6 ]  [ B x g4 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ c4 ]  [ N f4 ]  [ R d1 ]  [ N x e2 ]  [ K x e2 ]  [ f5 ]  [ B f3 ]  [ K c8 ]  [ K d3 ]  [ Q d7 ]  [ K c3 ]  [ K b8 ]  [ b4 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ Q e5 ]  [ Q x e5 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ K c7 ] , [ a4 ]  38...B should lose this game but his only hope to draw is to keep the rooks on the bd. and trade down as many pawns as possible thus trading the Rook eases W's task but still W should win.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ] , [ Q h5 ]  Patzer opening. It is generally advised to avoid getting the queen out early in the game unless one is playing against lower rated beginners.
 [ B g5 ] , [ N d8 ]  Adding the Knight to the fire soon
 [ R g8 ] , [ B x g8 ]  Now I remove the rook giving me a foothold...
 [ N g6 + ]  [ K d8 ]  [ N x h8 ] , [ B d5 ]  I'm not exactly sure why she played but nothing stops me from castling here.
 [ N h4 ]  [ Q g5 ]  [ Q x g5 ]  [ h x g5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ f6 ]  [ h6 ]  [ g6 ]  [ h7 + ]  [ K h8 ]  [ e x f6 ]  [ N x f6 ] , [ N x g5 ]  Black is getting in trouble: after [ N x g4 ] [ N x e6 ] things become very unclear...
 [ a5 ]  [ R a e1 ] , [ a4 ]  And three black pawns menace my queenside.
 [ B h3 ]  [ N h4 ]  [ Q g5 ] , [ Q f3 ]  White is OK though as black is attacking with only two pieces and with black king yet uncastled.
 [ c x d5 ] , [ Q c5 ]  ?? In this position he should have responded with 10...exd5. That way everything would still be even. However I am now a point ahead in this position. In the meantime he still has a chance to win a pawn back but is he going to blow this chance? That will be answered shortly.
 [ B b7 ] , [ B d3 ]  at last king side is developing but look how many wholes there are and oppurtunities for me. as my defence is solid
 [ B e2 ]  [ O-O ] , [ N f3 ]  This is where Black decides which way to challenge the center. The c5-boost is usually better in lines where White makes kingside progress such as in the 4-pawns attack or Saemisch. In this line which is mainline King's Indian Black usually plays [ e5 ] but [ c5 ] is just as fine which can transpose to a Maroczy Bind or Benoni structure.
 [ B x d3 ] , [ Q x d3 ]  White is suddenly very cramped and inconvenienced with castling impossible.
 [ R h5 ]  [ K d3 ]  [ R x h2 ]  [ e5 ] , [ K g5 ]  And my King travels the dark squared road.
 [ c x d4 ]  [ c x d4 ] , [ e x d4 ]  This is quite clever from white because my pawn structure is worse than bad its non-existant. Five isolated pawns two of them doubled. I do though have a passed pawn which is often potentially dangerous. This game could go either way right now.
 [ a3 ]  [ N d3 ]  [ R c2 ] , [ a5 ]  Still Black refuses to activate her remaining pieces...
 [ R f6 + ]  [ K e5 ] , [ R f8 + ]  32. [ R f8 ] - another deadly discovery this time the rook on [ a8 ] is toast!
 [ b3 ] , [ Q d7 ]  The real blunder as last move the bishop could not take my pawn because I could take the b-pawn
 [ N a3 ] , [ N b4 ]  Hoping white will keep up her attack on [ [ f7 ] ] by playing 7. [ Q h5 ] allowing me to win a pawn and the exchange with 7. ... [ N x c4 ] 8 [ N x c4 ] [ N x c2 ] . Hope chess? Maybe but white had demonstrated an eagerness to hit me at [ [ f7 ] ] so I thought it reasonable to expect she might continue. Even so attacking the queen with the eventual threat of [ N x c2 ] still seems a worthy move no matter how white responds.
 [ R x h6 ]  [ N g6 ]  [ R x g6 ]  [ h x g6 ]  [ Q x g6 ]  [ Q e7 + ]  [ K d1 ]  [ R f6 ]  [ Q g4 ] , [ R e8 ]  White should play [ B h4 ] here
 [ B e8 ] , [ Q x c7 ]  
 [ f x g6 ]  [ B e6 + ]  [ K h8 ] , [ Q d7 ]  Going in for the checkmate. Looks like it is time for my final assault. Final because if it fails I lose immediately.
 [ O-O ]  [ N f6 ]  [ R a d1 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ f3 ] , [ N d6 ]  If 20.../[ R f8 ] White continues with [ Q h4 ] and if the Knight returns to [ f6 ] 21.[ N e5 ] can follow.
 [ g x h6 ]  [ R a d1 ]  [ R f d8 ] , [ f4 ]  I'm not sure why he gave up the [ d3 ] pawn without a fight.
 [ Q a5 ] , [ B b2 ]  My development of minor pieces is complete. I also considered [ N c4 ] but if 17. [ N c4 ] [ Q x c3 ] 18. [ B d2 ] [ Q d3 ] finding a safe square and attacking my rook at the same time. Maybe if I looked deeper into it there was a way of trapping the queen if it took on c3.
 [ K c7 ] , [ N x e8 + ]  If Black had played 34 ...K-[ Q1 ] [or ...K-Q2] instead he could have answered 35 NxR dis ch with 35 ...KxN and been only down an Exchange instead of a whole Rook. I still would have won but he could have dragged out his resistance longer.
 [ R x c2 ]  [ Q x c2 ]  [ N x c2 ]  [ R x d5 ]  [ N x e1 ] , [ N d6 ]  The dust settles and I did gain a pawn. He decides to make multiple threats rather than get a pawn immediately with Rxe5.
 [ Q x f6 ] , [ Q h7 # ]  
 [ N g4 ]  [ h5 ]  [ N h6 + ]  [ K h7 ] , [ N f5 ]  Opening the king's position should win...
 [ h x g6 ] , [ B x g4 + ]  ...... it begins again with a discovered check 26...... [ B x g4 ] another pawn goes!
 [ N x d5 ]  [ c x d5 ] , [ Q a5 + ]  but onli a horse
 [ B f6 ]  [ R x a3 ]  [ h5 ]  [ g x h5 ]  [ f5 ]  [ R b3 ]  [ B e5 ]  [ a3 ]  [ f6 ]  [ R e3 ] , [ f7 + ]  I might actually pull this off!!!
 [ R x f2 + ] , [ K x f2 ]  A fairly even exchange of material. Note that Black is now only down 2 points! The comeback is nearly complete!
 [ Q c5 ] , [ c3 ]  Starting a long forcing line.
 [ Q h4 ]  [ R c2 ] , [ R f6 ]  I think a passive move if not totally bad.The objective is to help the Queen in its plan to attack.[ R h6 ] is easily parried by [ h3 ] aside from leaving the back rank poorly defended.
 [ d x c5 ] , [ N x e3 ]  Removing the defender.
 [ d x c5 ] , [ R x e5 ]  ?? Now he can't stop me from promoting.
 [ g x h3 ]  [ R x e3 ]  [ f x e3 ]  [ Q g3 + ]  [ K h1 ]  [ Q x h3 + ]  [ K g1 ]  [ Q x e3 + ]  [ R f2 ] , [ B x d4 ]  
 [ N c6 ]  [ O-O-O ] , [ a5 ]  I think black should be trying to find a way to threaten the knight on [ f3 ] not wasting moves like this.
 [ R e7 ]  [ R x e7 ]  [ Q x e7 ] , [ Q x d3 ]  One passed pawn down another still to go.
 [ e x d3 ]  [ Q x d3 ] , [ g6 ]  ? [ d5 ] was necessary. [ N e5 ] is less dangerous than [ c4 ] Nc3...
 [ N g f3 ] , [ B g7 ]  With this move I am essentially offering a gambit in the form of my c-pawn since after [ d x c5 ] white can hold onto the pawn i.e. 7. dc [ N d7 ] 8. [ N b3 ] [ a5 ] (for instance) 9. a4. This was a conscious decision on my part because by snatching the pawn white would give me counterplay in the center following a space-gaining ...[ e5 ] and increased scope of my KB along the h8-[ a1 ] diagonal.
 [ K x f3 ] , [ R f8 + ]  Now if I make a move like 38) [ K g4 ] he will have the possibility of 38) ... [ R f2 ] winning either the a-pawn or the h-pawn.
 [ d3 ] , [ g6 ]  Bad blunder which I do make from time to time - trying to fianchetto with the opponent's bishop (or queen) already looking down the diagonal. Don't try to repeat this.
 [ R h8 ]  [ d4 ]  [ B h2 + ]  [ K h1 ]  [ B d6 + ]  [ K g1 ]  [ g x f3 ] , [ B x f3 ]  [ g x f3 ] leads to the same result. It seems is mate in 10 after trying to set up a puzzle using the gameknow engine.
 [ f x e4 ]  [ N x e4 ] , [ B f5 ]  Bunder overlooking [ N x f6 ] and hanging the bishop.
 [ N a5 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ Q f4 ] , [ R x a5 ]  good move white is continues to play well sacrificing an exchange with the idea to keep the powerful bishop pare drops the black bishop from the good diagonal a7-[ g1 ] and puts the black queen in dangerous position where she doesn't have good moves to retreat if she will be under attack the bishop pare are working hormonally when the BLS controls the [ c4 ] square while BDS covers the h4-[ d8 ] diagonal . if 23.[ B x f8 ] -Nxb3.24.Bxb4-Nxa1.. or 23.Ra4-Nxb3.24.Bxb4-[ R f e8 ] with unclear position .
 [ h3 ] , [ N d7 ]  Getting his piece's finally moving.
 [ Q e2 ]  [ B g4 ] , [ f3 ]  White will still be able to develop his knight to good effect and black is starting to lag behind in development.
 [ R b7 ]  [ R f8 ] , [ Q b5 ]  White looks for all the world to have been entirely committed to the Q-side all along. With the advanced outside passed pawn and the rook on the seventh White looks very well placed but Black's pawn couple has something to say to the matter and although very defensively placed Black isn't leaving many weaknesses to exploit.
 [ K d1 ]  [ O-O-O ]  [ B e2 ]  [ B x f3 ]  [ B x f3 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ Q c3 ] , [ f5 ]  Attacking the middle.
 [ b x c3 ] , [ a4 ]  wanting to move queen to [ a5 ] and put more pressure on. feel that so far the opening and attacking queenside is working for me.
 [ N g4 ] , [ N x g4 + ]  Giving White doubled pawns in front of his King but also allowing him to exploit an open h file so it's double-edged.
 [ O-O-O ]  [ K f1 ]  [ R h e8 ] , [ R e1 ]  ? Correct was Bc1.
 [ B d7 ] , [ Q c2 + ]  Not too accurate... After 30. [ g x h5 ] f5! 31. [ Q c2 + ] [ e4 ] white is somewhat better off...
 [ R d1 + ]  [ K e2 ]  [ R x h1 ] , [ B a3 ]  [ B b2 ] protects the remaining rook. Otherwise it stays trapped.
 [ K d7 ]  [ R g8 ]  [ g6 ]  [ R h8 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ B x e5 ]  [ b2 ]  [ B x b2 ]  [ R x b2 + ]  [ K e3 ]  [ R x h2 ]  [ f4 ]  [ h5 ]  [ R h7 ]  [ K e7 ]  [ e5 ]  [ R a2 ]  [ K f3 ]  [ R a3 + ]  [ K g2 ]  [ R a8 ]  [ K h3 ]  [ R a7 ]  [ g4 ]  [ h x g4 + ]  [ K x g4 ]  [ K f8 ]  [ R h8 + ]  [ K g7 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ R a1 ]  [ R e7 ]  [ R g1 + ]  [ K h4 ]  [ g5 + ]  [ f x g5 ]  [ K g6 ]  [ R c7 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ R c5 ]  [ R e4 + ]  [ K g3 ]  [ K x g5 ]  [ K f3 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ R c7 ]  [ R x e5 ]  [ R x f7 ]  [ R f5 + ]  [ R x f5 + ]  [ K x f5 ]  [ K e3 ]  [ K e5 ]  [ K e2 ]  [ K e4 ]  [ K e1 ] , [ K e3 ]  
 [ B d7 ]  [ B x d7 + ] , [ N x d7 ]  Capture with the queen is better. This inactivates the knight.
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ] , [ c4 ]  With 2.[ c4 ] White challenges Black for the center.
 [ R c1 ] , [ f6 ]  Forcing the removal of the advanced KP.
 [ N b d2 ] , [ B e6 ]  Normally one would expect [ f6 ] first to prevent N(f3)-[ [ g5 ] ] but his knight on [ d7 ] has blocked the influence of his [ B c1 ] on the [ [ g5 ] ] square. Interestingly I cannot find this Bishop move on any of the opening databases but I can't believe it can really be bad.
 [ K g8 ]  [ Q g6 + ]  [ K f8 ]  [ Q x h6 + ]  [ K g8 ]  [ R g5 + ]  [ K f7 ]  [ Q g7 + ]  [ K e6 ]  [ R g6 + ]  [ K f5 ] , [ Q f6 # ]  Ah ok.... tbh I didn't even see it myself (wasn't thinking about the [ f3 ] pawn at all see was just trying to make a nuisance of myself). The game disappeared and I panicked. And then a smile of disbelief probably echoed by curses from my opponent. Plans? Who needs plans. Sometimes sheer undiluted panic DOES work.
 [ O-O ] , [ B x e5 ]  here's the swap with black getting 1 pt advantage with the extra pawn kill
 [ B g7 ]  [ a x b4 ]  [ a x b4 ]  [ R b x b4 ] , [ R d2 ]  RxP[ d4 ] is not a serious threat because the bishop is cheaper than the rook. White should have played RxP[ a7 ] followed by [ B e5 ] some time to block black's pawn progress. Here black should consider P[ a6 ] or probably better--Ra4.
 [ e5 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ a6 ] , [ Q f3 ]  going for the quick checkmate.....can always still develop with [ N b3 ] if plan A fails.
 [ N g6 ] , [ h4 ]  A trap!
 [ N d7 ]  [ f4 ] , [ B b4 ]  I think here i made a mistake with time. I should first develop the knight and play [ h5 ] and after it to place my bishop on [ e7 ] square. And [ c5 ] would be a good idea too
 [ Q d7 ] , [ Q b3 ]  Controlling Qb5.
 [ R h5 + ]  [ B x h5 ] , [ N f5 # ]  Checkmate -- with the capped Knight.
 [ a6 ] , [ g3 ]  To
 [ Q c5 ] , [ B e6 + ]  vacating the g file
 [ B e3 ] , [ N x e4 ]  white did not defend the pawn so I take it. I decided to take with my knight because my bishop was more valuable.
 [ Q d6 + ]  [ K g5 ] , [ Q x a6 ]  Swindled. Black resigns.
 [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ d x c5 ]  Pawns away from the center. The show begins.
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B c4 ] , [ N f6 ]  The Two Knights Defense. This is a favorite of mine. I believe that it gives Black an early opportunity to seize the initiative. Al
 [ Q c6 ]  [ Q f3 ] , [ K e7 ]  ? There is no danger from 31 [ N g5 + ] [ K h7 ] only allows a queen trade which favors Black....
 [ h x g4 ] , [ N c3 ]  44. ... [ h x g4 ] 45.Nc3?? ... This blunder effectively ends the game. There is still plenty of fight after 45 [ R x g4 ] [ R f2 ] 46 Rf4! Rh2! 47 [ K e3 ] [ R h3 ] 48 [ K d2 ] Bh5! 49 [ N c3 ] [ B g6 ] 50 Ra4! [ R d3 ] 51 Ke1! Now the point here is that 51…[ R x c3 ] is met by 52 [ R x a6 ] which wins back the piece and forces a likely draw.
 [ B x f6 ]  [ g5 ]  [ h x g5 ]  [ f x g5 ]  [ B d4 ] , [ R g e1 ]  Other Rook moves may be better — [ R g4 ] or [ R g2 ] come to mind — but this move is perfectly adequate. [ B h7 + ] is tempting but I would hate to part with such a lovely attacking piece.
 [ N a x b5 ]  [ a x b5 ] , [ R x a3 ]  Here i thought he had to take with the rook and then i had [ N c2 ] but it doesn't really matter now.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ c3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ B b4 + ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B x c3 ] , [ d5 ]  9. d5- this is called the Moller Attack - a variation on the Guicco Piano. The first six moves were as per the Guicco Problemo Part 1 Game. The deviation here was that white interposed the knight instead of the bishop.
 [ Q b2 + ] , [ K f1 ]  35. [ K f1 ] - Henry now makes safety and the pawn on [ a2 ] lives because Ken must do something about his bishop. However he still presses for attack with [ R c1 ] but I worked out that I can safely remove the bishop on [ h3 ] and still have time to put Henry on g2. It is still not entirely safe but at least 2 out of the 3 of Ken's heavies are still on the other side of the board and I am now a piece up - this could prove decisive in the coming endgame.
 [ R x b4 ]  [ c x b4 ] , [ R e1 ]  There is still some opportunities for my opponent if I am not careful. For example [ R e3 ] followed by [ R h3 ] is still a decent try here.
 [ N a6 ] , [ B e3 ]  Again this is why I played [ [ e4 ] ] first.....I didn't know what to do with my dark-squared Bishop. Hence why I played [ [ e4 ] ] as I thought it looked funny in front of the Pawn as opposed to being "behind" the pawn...
 [ Q x d5 ] , [ N f6 ]  Now the fun begins.
 [ R a3 ]  [ R h c1 ] , [ B g7 ]  I sneakily add pressure to White's knight.
 [ N f6 ]  [ Q f5 ] , [ Q x d3 ]  Regaining material equally
 [ B e3 ] , [ B b6 ]  White threatens to win the black bishop with 7. Nxc6. It must move or be defended or the knight must be captured. This is the lesser of evils. I'm beginning to doubt that 4. ... [ B b4 + ] was half as good as I thought it was. This line is in the DB and according to the DB it plays very well for black but I'm thinking the DB has had a little too much Scotch... I would say white has the better of things right now.
 [ c x b4 ] , [ e4 ]  But I would not have exchanged here. Instead I would've attack [ b3 ] with 19...Qe6.
 [ N b6 ] , [ N x c8 + ]  This is helping black. 18.[ N c b5 ] was to be preferred but now black has the extra resource 18...[ N d5 ] since there is no rook on e1.
 [ f3 ] , [ d2 ]  29. ...... [ d2 ] ...... further and now my d pawn is just one square away from Glendadom.
 [ R a6 ]  [ R e1 ] , [ R x a2 ]  This is a game where pawns made the difference (and missed opportunities on my part). I resigned here but later analysis says I should have a gone a few more moves to sees black's plan. Who knows with a little help from black I may have salvaged a draw or better. Certainly my rook is better positioned to defend and block than block's.
 [ R a b8 ] , [ R b7 ]  Never trade when you're behind unless you have a plan. Black makes a nice series of moves and makes the game competitive again. I probably should have just moved my queen out of the way while protecting the knight i.e. Qc3.
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ e6 ] , [ d3 ]  I of course immediately get out of the standard variations. 3. [ d4 ] is considered more normal
 [ B x b4 ] , [ N b5 ]  And another.
 [ N x d5 ] , [ N x d5 ]  A few moves have been made without a discussion either up to my surprise. It was however the continuation of the exchange variations that was mentioned by ION earlier.
 [ Q b5 + ]  [ K c8 ]  [ Q d7 + ]  [ K b8 ]  [ Q c7 + ]  [ K a8 ]  [ Q c8 + ]  [ K a7 ]  [ c3 ]  [ K b6 ]  [ c2 ]  [ K a5 ]  [ c1 = Q ] , [ K b4 ]  My pawn gets promoted
 [ e x f4 ]  [ B x f4 ]  [ B x f4 ] , [ Q x f4 ]  Now that d-pawn is looking vulnerable and White has the file half-open to attack f7.
 [ B x d6 ]  [ c x d6 ] , [ e3 ]  Personally I think this move should have been played earlier. He could try 9. [ B d3 ] with a attempt to mimic me but I have a pawn on [ e6 ] protecting my bishop so I have no need to capture.
 [ c3 ] , [ R f e8 ]  preparing Ne3...
 [ h4 ] , [ Q d8 ]  Almost the only move not to lose the queen.
 [ d4 ]  [ B b6 ]  [ B x f4 ]  [ g5 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ N c e7 ]  [ e5 ] , [ N g6 ]  Bringing my knight to the King side for attack.
 [ e3 ] , [ N f6 ]  This move prevents my Q's entry into [ g4 ] or h5. Black needs it.
 [ R d1 ]  [ Q b6 ] , [ R d6 ]  Oh my!!! I can't belive my good fortune!! A free Rook!!
 [ Q e6 ]  [ R d8 + ]  [ K h7 ] , [ Q e4 + ]  Another accurate move.
 [ R d e1 ]  [ h6 ] , [ Q c6 ]  Willing to accept the doubled pawns to relieve the pressure.
 [ R d e2 ] , [ f6 ]  This puts the question to White.
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ e5 ] , [ N d5 ]  I gave valeriuzaharia the same treat and that worked...
 [ b4 ]  [ c x b4 ] , [ N x e5 ]  Exchanging knights first prevents [ N d3 ] after the Queen recaptures and the exchange creates a passed d-pawn and cedes some control over the c-file.
 [ b6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ B a6 ]  [ R c1 ]  [ N g6 ]  [ e5 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ b5 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ b x c4 ] , [ b x c4 ]  Black has gained the advantage of a passed QRP.
 [ N x e4 ]  [ Q c2 ]  [ N d6 ]  [ R x a4 ] , [ N e4 ]  The mistake my opponent did here is violating chess rules.The Knight is played thrice .[ f5 ] was supposed to have been played.You will see how it costed him later
 [ N x e5 ]  [ N x a4 ] , [ B x h4 ]  Now picking up the lonely pawn. This make black up by two pawns.
 [ N g4 ]  [ h3 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ N c3 ]  13. Nc3? - on second thoughts I wonder if it was this move which was the lemon. Would [ R c1 ] have been a better plan here? At least I would have bagged the c column first.
 [ N d4 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N x b5 ]  [ N x b5 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d3 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ N c3 ]  Saving a tempo.
 [ N e7 ]  [ R e1 ] , [ N e6 ]  and the canter is closed...
 [ N x f3 + ] , [ Q x f3 ]  white has h1-[ a8 ] diagonal under control and i'll need a few moves to free my bishop
 [ g x f5 ] , [ Q x d6 ]  
 [ Q d8 ] , [ g4 ]  Attempting to drive the Knight.
 [ Q a5 + ]  [ c3 ] , [ Q b6 ]  Smart! Now I should have played [ b3 ] and no problem after BxN. But I choosed
 [ c5 ]  [ K d5 ]  [ c6 ]  [ K d6 ]  [ f4 ]  [ K c7 ]  [ h4 ]  [ K c8 ] , [ R a7 ]  I decide to hem the king in here...
 [ N c3 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ Q b7 ]  [ N e5 ] , [ O-O ]  16. ...... 0-0 - Henry seems as safe as houses but Dongoodman will soon prove that his house was made only of sticks and will blow it away a la big bad wolf! That was another epithet that me and Bob Jacobs had for the Master Mater btw!
 [ N c3 ] , [ B b4 ]  Pinned another knight and developed another piece
 [ f6 ]  [ N g4 ]  [ K h8 ]  [ f5 ]  [ Q d7 ]  [ R e f1 ]  [ R d8 ]  [ R f4 ]  [ Q d6 ]  [ Q h4 ]  [ R d e8 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B d5 ]  [ N f2 ] , [ Q c6 ]  (EZB) Black with some moves to spare has marked time and has accomplished nothing with his Q side Pawns... ...All Black's pieces are now available for the defence and nothing stands in the way of the beginning of his advance on the Q side.
 [ Q h1 + ] , [ R g1 ]  One of 2 only moves
 [ K x d6 ]  [ N x h8 ] , [ N g f6 ]  NO! My B is also under attack! The tricker was tricked in return. No way out. That's blitz.
 [ Q d7 ] , [ B b5 ]  I always try to pin enemy pieces when i can. It restricts their options.
 [ R b c8 ] , [ B a4 ]  To potentially threaten with the b-file pawn
 [ Q c8 ] , [ N d5 ]  threat to mate an he doesn't want me to castle
 [ h6 ]  [ N g f3 ] , [ N e4 ]  After 18: [ N x e4 ] [ d x e4 ] 19:[ N d2 ] [ f5 ] Black has a huge bind on the white position .
 [ K f7 ]  [ K e4 ]  [ K e7 ]  [ N a6 ]  [ K d7 ] , [ K d5 ]  With my King now in a supporting position the Pawns can begin their advance.
 [ N f3 ] , [ N c6 ]  i decide to play this to throw him off. im pretty sure he expected [ c5 ] but i have plans for my c pawn and this prevents his knight from going to rest on the [ e5 ] square.
 [ f x e4 ] , [ R x e4 ]  black has 3 pawns for the piece and white's kingside is shattered.
 [ a3 ] , [ N b4 a6 ]  So as to allow the other knight to develop to [ c6 ] and also so as not to hinder the c-pawn. It's a horrible square for a knight though.
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B c4 ] , [ N f6 ]  Two Knights Defence always my favourite response to [ B c4 ] and an opening I've been playing a lot recently thanks to Freddy's mini-tournament on the Traxler variation (4. [ N g5 ] Bc5). Good fun but for this game I decided to go back to the more mainstream 4... d5. As Ion said in a comment on someone's annotation the great thing about the Two Knights is that all the variations can lead to exciting play :)
 [ B e5 ]  [ f4 ]  [ B x c3 ]  [ B x c3 ]  [ B c6 ] , [ N e3 ]  22 [ K g1 ] is more accurate 22...[ B x e4 ] 23 [ N e3 ] [ N g7 ]  [ f x g4 ]  [ h x g4 ] , [ Q b6 ]  Better would be 25...[ B c6 ] 26 [ B x f6 ] [ Q x f6 ]  [ R f2 ] , [ B d3 ]  Black could have kept an edge with 26 ... [ B c6 ] 27 [ B x f6 ] [ R x f6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ g6 ]  [ g3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ B g2 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ] , [ N c3 ]  So far a King's Indian Defence Fianchetto Variation with a slightly unusual move order.
 [ N e2 ] , [ a6 ]  chasing the ennoying bishop
 [ e5 ] , [ d5 ]  This move takes us (or at least me) out of the books. The move grabs space but takes a lot of pressure of [ e5 ] and Black's center. Another drawback is that White falls behind in development which can explode in White's face if he gets too aggressive and allows Black to detonate the center.
 [ B e2 + ] , [ K c1 ]  31....[ Q b4 ] is better. then 32.N[ d x e8 ] [ Q x d4 + ] 33.[ Q d2 ] [ Q x a4 + ] 33.[ Q c2 ] [ Q a1 + ] 34.[ Q c1 ] Bxf1!
 [ d x e5 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ Q x d8 + ] , [ K x d8 ]  White trades Queens to ensure Black can never castle. An exposed king in a half-open centre is likely to cause trouble for Black. Taking a pawn back at move 3 or allowing the pawn taken in move 4 to be gambitted could have prevented a lot of Black's trouble with the capture being probably slightly better.
 [ N d7 f6 ] , [ b4 ]  White dominates the dark squares on the fifth rank.
 [ R f1 ]  [ B x a3 ] , [ Q x a3 ]  White's advantage is slightly narrowed by invaded 7th rank.
 [ B d3 ]  [ c5 ] , [ c3 ]  I considered that in order to take some advantage of my superior developement it was a nice idea to... spend a pawn's move in order to "squeeze" white's position a little.
 [ R a b8 ]  [ B d1 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ R b2 ] , [ R c e8 ]  Where and how can Black break in the center? It needs to happen for Black to exploit the extra material.
 [ N f3 ]  [ Q e6 ] , [ d3 ]  From this moment the position is much better for white to and the continuation is just improving that.
 [ O-O ]  [ N f3 ]  [ c6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ B x d5 ]  [ e6 ]  [ B b3 ]  [ Q x d1 + ]  [ N x d1 ] , [ N x e4 ]  Clearly not the right plan for White: his space advantage is gone and his position is now two pawns down
 [ R b6 + ]  [ K x a5 ]  [ R x c6 ] , [ R e2 ]  My pawn must pass. He will have to lose his rook to stopping me from queening.
 [ K e2 ]  [ R h2 ]  [ d4 ] , [ N h6 ]  he should have taken my pawn with his rook i think because i couldn't take with my bishop
 [ a3 ]  [ R c4 ] , [ a2 ]  This move costs me the game. Much better is 38. ... [ B c3 ] 39. [ R a4 ] [ B b2 ] 40. [ K g1 ] [ d3 ] 41. [ K f1 ] [ d2 ] 42. [ K e2 ] [ B c1 ] which leaves me the King and one pawn on the Kingside against White's two pawns. There are a lot of lines but I think it is at least a draw for Black.
 [ R d e8 ] , [ R f e1 ]  Piling on to the pinned R.
 [ c3 ]  [ d x c3 ] , [ N x c3 ]  I like this variation. White has got a big hole on the left side but two pieces out against none for black.
 [ a5 ]  [ B a7 ] , [ B b2 ]  ? Very quiet this cedes initiative which white will never fully recover. White needed to keep the pawn storm coming finding support for a [ [ b5 ] ] push (16. c4?) or perhaps offering a sac by pushing immediately: 16. [ [ b5 ] ] ax[ [ b5 ] ] 17. [ a6 ] bxa6? 18. Rx[ a6 ] and black's king is exposed.
 [ R x d6 ]  [ Q x f3 + ] , [ R g2 ]  With no where to go Ken interposes with the Rook. But it doesn't matter because he is in much better shape. But Rotterdam's next move takes me by surprise. As I would not have given my Queen since there is no immediate if he is to leave it as it is at least to my perspective. With that I'm sure that there' something I'm missing. So the next move must be forced which allows Ken to get back the material he lost and then some.
 [ B d6 ]  [ N e6 ]  [ Q d7 ]  [ N x g7 + ] , [ K f7 ]  Once Ted gets out of check I decide to place my N on the rim because I'm organizing that with my other N and Queen. That's because of one variation where I might be able to deliver a devastating attack with these three pieces working together.
 [ Q h5 + ]  [ g6 ]  [ N x g6 ]  [ N x c2 + ] , [ K f1 ]  I moved away from the knight in hopes of sacraficing the inactive rook for another critical tempo.
 [ N e2 ]  [ f5 ]  [ e x f5 ]  [ B x f5 ]  [ B x f5 ]  [ R x f5 ]  [ N d2 ]  [ R f7 ] , [ N e4 ]  From now on [ N e4 ] is possible and powerful.
 [ B e7 ] , [ d3 ]  Supporting the knight and allowing development of the lsb
 [ R e8 ]  [ Q c4 ]  [ h5 ] , [ Q e2 ]  ! Currently hindering [ h4 ] which was the point of the queen maneuvre.
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ g6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ e4 ]  [ d6 ]  [ f4 ]  [ O-O ] , [ N f3 ]  Staying with the tried and true. In any case this development is so 'natural' it must be good eh?
 [ N c6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ d3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ h3 ]  [ B x f3 ]  [ g x f3 ]  [ Q d7 ]  [ B x d4 ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ Q e7 ]  [ Q e2 ]  [ B b4 + ]  [ c3 ]  [ d x c3 ]  [ b x c3 ]  [ B a3 ]  [ B b5 + ]  [ K f8 ] , [ c4 ]  My usual display of thud and blunder. My bishop has nowhere to go.
 [ g x f5 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ f x e6 + ]  [ Q x e6 ] , [ R d f1 + ]  The attack looks quite good but black finds a way to simplify.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ N f6 ]  i don't even know what the name of this opening is but i saw someone play it so i decided to try it!!
 [ O-O ]  [ N b1 ] , [ N e4 ]  Trying to stop deflect my plan. So I attack the N to continue. For once black retreats I attack at once figuring that the Queen will become trapped. I know that black doesn't have a lot of options but figured that he'd defend with 17...Qa6.
 [ h6 + ]  [ K h8 ] , [ B f5 ]  Blocking the B from the critical diagonal. Obviously Keres cannot trade as Fischer would easily win the ensuing King and Pawn ending.
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ a6 ]  [ B x c6 ]  [ d x c6 ]  [ O-O ] , [ B g4 ]  5. ......... [ B g4 ] - this is recommended as the strongest response to the standard book 5. 0-0. It is trappy. You try to drive black's lsb away with [ h3 ] but wait black plays h5. You really have to be careful about when you take that bishop because you as white may cop Old Matey on the open h file after the Wicked Witch of the West comes to h4!
 [ O-O ] , [ e5 ]  But first let's clear up the centre a little.
 [ K x d4 ] , [ a3 ]  57. .... [ a3 ] - just two more squares.
 [ K x f1 ]  [ B c7 ]  [ B b2 + ]  [ K h7 ] , [ e5 ]  My pawn's path to promotion is clear and it will promote soon.
 [ c4 ] , [ R f e8 ]  If I am going to do anything this game I must now involve my rooks. I have my eye's on [ h2 ] and [ g2 ] as possible attack points. Lets see how this pans out.
 [ a6 ] , [ N e3 + ]  would've been good to go a bit further but black doesn't really have much of a chance now. please leave some comments and tell me what you think. and check out my other annotated game with otherj which is probably a bit more interesting than this game. cheers. Alex
 [ R x e5 + ] , [ K x e5 ]  Now I know I have a draw with correct moves.
 [ K e2 ]  [ K f6 ]  [ K f1 ] , [ B d1 ]  Originally I played this to pin the king down to the defense of the f-pawn. But then I realized that the pawns are equal in the number of their potential moves on the h-file. This seemed a small fact but it made my next move possible.
 [ g x h6 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ Q e7 ] , [ R x d5 ]  the second piece sacrifice.
 [ N a2 ] , [ Q x d5 ]  this. So from even to plus 5 points because of one mistake. The board looks a lot different now and black will mount an attack from a stronger position.
 [ d6 ] , [ B d7 ]  ...i am thinking that the idea is [ B x a8 ] is a distant threat of [ Q x a8 ] looking at [ Q g2 # ] but this is easily met....
 [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ] , [ N x d4 ]  4. [ N x d4 ] - here are some pretty standard moves of the Sicilian Defense. Am I gonna get the Naijdorf or the Dragon? I have mixed results from both these systems.
 [ R a b8 ]  [ R x b3 ]  [ R x b3 ] , [ R d2 ]  clearly this is rapidly heading towards an end game so my intention for now was to keep the white king cornered in while I try to bring my king into the action
 [ f6 ]  [ R e2 ]  [ f x e5 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ N x e5 ] , [ R x e5 ]  21.dxe5? would make the pawn a lot harder to hold on to after 21...Rf5.
 [ g x f5 ] , [ g4 ]  There. I accidentally move the knight which was blocking my rook.
 [ B e4 ] , [ R h3 ]  This was the move I had in mind when allowing the B to take such a good outpost. Now my trap will work (black will not lose it of course it will end with the B on [ f7 ] which is the place where it could and probably should have gone for a solid game. Unless I play [ g5 ] first).
 [ d4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ e4 ] , [ f6 ]  ? what was the idea? why not to play a regular french? by that move it will be hard for black to develope his king side pieces.
 [ d x c5 ] , [ d x c5 ]  ?! Up until this moment we've stayed pretty firmly within the established theory (not that I'm that familiar with the theory as I mentioned) but this move from Black takes us off-book. The standard line is 8...[ N x c5 ] 9.[ B x c5 ] dxc5.
 [ K h2 ]  [ R g3 ]  [ N h3 ] , [ R d g8 ]  27. …… [ R d g8 ] - and put white in trouble!
 [ b3 ] , [ N b6 ]  White moves pawn to [ b3 ] to protect the bishop at a4. Black knight moves again attacking the bishop at [ a4 ] whilst the knght at [ e5 ] is taken care of by the LB at [ e6 ] should he decide to attack. DB is still waiting to fianchetto and black needs to castle.
 [ g x f6 ] , [ R x d6 ]  Important otherwise I would only be the exchange up.
 [ Q e2 ]  [ Q e7 ]  [ e6 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ h5 ]  [ B f3 ]  [ Q x e6 ]  [ B e4 ] , [ R e7 ]  At this moment we made draw. I hat had one pawn more but at that different ELO rate the draw was ok for me.
 [ B x a8 ] , [ c x b2 ]  As promised. My pawn is strategically placed on the 2nd rank allowing me to be a constant threat of gaining an extra queen. White is up in material temporarily but I think my position is much stronger. I've isolated white's pawns on [ a3 ] and [ c2 ] and left white with very little defense on the queenside.
 [ K c7 ] , [ Q d6 + ]  Ok now it's over.
 [ B f4 ]  [ N x f3 + ] , [ B x f3 ]  13. [ B x f3 ] - both knights now traded.
 [ h x g4 ]  [ h x g4 + ] , [ K x f4 ]  ?? This leads to checkmate. Better would have been (in my opinion which is probably wrong) 30. ... [ K f6 ] [ N d5 ] and the king can retreat to [ g7 ]  [ K g5 ] , [ Q d2 + ]  Step two: Elimate more escape routes and trap the king (feel free to offer more material =P)
 [ B d2 ] , [ K d3 ]  And now it's simply over.
 [ R h f8 ] , [ B e2 ]  20. [ B e2 ] - begone you Evil Besom! The Witch flies off to f5.
 [ R h1 ] , [ N g5 ]  attacking my N i think big battle will start soon
 [ K f8 ]  [ R h6 h8 + ]  [ K e7 ] , [ R f1 ]  If [ K x e6 ] there is nothing left for white.
 [ K g6 ] , [ c8 = Q ]  I know have a queen rock bishop--and a 9 pt lead!
 [ B e7 ] , [ O-O-O ]  I liked queenside because it puts my rook directly on [ d1 ] and the half-open file and I'm expecting black to go kingside which leaves open the possibility of pawn advances against his castled position.
 [ d x e4 ]  [ N x e4 ] , [ N d7 ]  4. ...[ N d7 ] is arguably Black's strongest defense. Although it does not offer much in the way of counter chances until the later stages of the middle game. Black plays this move so that he can develop his other Knight to F6 without fear of seriously weakening is king side pawn structure. This move also prepares for blacks major pawn breaks on [ e5 ] and c5.
 [ Q x e5 ] , [ R d c8 ]  ?? This move effectively costs the game. Black had two main options. One was the defensive 19... [ h6 ] which secured an average endgame albeit a pawn down. However the more aggresive and striking option was 19... Bg3! which would lead to complications for me in the centre and give Black a chance to win his pawn back with 20. [ Q c5 ] [ R x d1 ] 21. [ R x d1 ] [ Q f4 ] and strong play from Black would secure a strong endgame.
 [ K d1 ]  [ B x a5 ]  [ B x a5 ] , [ K a6 ]  Now another piece falls and I'm hopelessly behind in material at this point.
 [ N f6 ] , [ B g5 ]  Threatens my knight
 [ N x d3 + ]  [ R x d3 ]  [ a3 ] , [ b3 ]  ?? I thought about this move before but now with the R on [ e3 ] it is a fatal mistake that could have costed me the game.
 [ N h4 ]  [ Q g4 ]  [ f3 ]  [ B c5 + ]  [ K h2 ]  [ Q x h4 ]  [ g x h3 ] , [ R e6 ]  Well that skirmish dies down and leaves me with a slight advantage but nothing unassailable. White should try to take control of the g file.
 [ R x c1 ]  [ R x c1 + ] , [ N f1 ]  Seeing how it is and for the reasons outlined I resign. After this game all the negatives in this context went away. In other words I did not let it distract me after this game. What I learned is that right after getting over a bad experience in general it needs to become history right away. Or as the saying goes which should happen right away is "Let by-gons be by-gons". In other words you shouldn't let things go eventually. Sure things will be settled but you won't play as well. Instead it's better to let it go and start thinking about the positives immediately and have things calm down immediately. That way it won't distract in your games.
 [ K h3 ] , [ f5 ]  Black wanting to whittle down White's defence.
 [ Q h3 ] , [ K f2 ]  Now the rook on [ a1 ] will fall in a few moves.
 [ R x c2 ] , [ K x c2 ]  Here is where I was relatively certain that I had lost. But I heard freddy (easy19) tell me that I can learn more in a hopeless game than in a winning game.
 [ B e2 ]  [ Q b6 + ]  [ K h1 ] , [ Q e3 ]  Things are heating up! At this point I was wondering what the hell went wrong. I was expecting 15...0-0-0 on the next move with a fantastic assault commencing. And the pawns on [ f4 ] and [ g4 ] were starting to look like the twin fangs of a snarling dragon. Plus I was still down a pawn with no material or positional compensation.
 [ B x e8 ]  [ R x e8 ]  [ R x f5 ]  [ R x e7 ]  [ R x f6 ] , [ K g7 ]  At the end of which White has won a Rook a Bishop and a Knight for both his hard working Bishops and Knight.
 [ h1 = Q ]  [ R x h1 ]  [ R x h1 ] , [ e6 ]  I decided I won't even bother to stop him. I will win because I will take his last remaining pawn before he can take mine. His K will end on the [ e8 ] square and my pawn will be out of his reach.
 [ R a7 ]  [ R f c1 ] , [ N d6 ]  Heading for either [ c4 ] or e4.
 [ K e6 ]  [ B h6 ] , [ K d5 ]  Polugaevsky puts his faith in counterattack. Passive defence by 48 ...[ K f7 ] 49. [ B g5 ] [ B c5 ] should also be adequate to draw. It is worth noting that the game had been adjourned around move 41 so Polugaevsky was now following his home analysis. The fact that Larsen still managed to win the position even after his opponent had been able to analyse it at home is a remarkable tribute to his endgame technique and in particular his ability to continue to find ways to pose the maximum problems for Black.
 [ Q h6 + ]  [ K g8 ]  [ Q x g5 ]  [ K g7 ]  [ Q h5 ] , [ R h8 ]  black was planning this move while giving his knight on 36th move hoping to get the initiative.but there is a surprise waiting for him.
 [ R x d2 ]  [ Q g5 ]  [ R g2 ]  [ Q e3 + ]  [ K f1 ] , [ Q g5 ]  not good! the queen is much stronger on [ e3 ] for the moment. Black can try to win with h4!
 [ Q h8 ]  [ Q x h8 + ] , [ K x h8 ]  At this point I felt I had been close to pulling off a suprise result but it had started to slip out of my hands and that I needed to try to maintain my material lead in order to stand a chance of maybe getting a draw.
 [ g6 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ B g7 ]  i will play the modern defense not to much theory starts with those few moves i'm jazz player so i like when there is enought space for improvisation and freedom.
 [ N x f7 ] , [ Q c6 ]  Threatening mate.
 [ g4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N x e5 ] , [ Q h4 ]  :) Going for an early kill.
 [ e3 ]  [ g4 ]  [ K g7 ]  [ B g1 ]  [ R c e5 ] , [ f4 ]  Now White's K is also exposed and the [ f4 ] pawn is loose.
 [ R g2 ]  [ N f5 ]  [ B d3 ] , [ K h8 ]  Intending to recapture with the g pawn if white plays Bxf5.
 [ Q e7 ]  [ B a4 ] , [ R e c8 ]  Probably better is [ R f8 ] maybe preparing f5.
 [ B x e1 ] , [ R a8 ]  Black has been looking at capturing that rook since move 32 so he finally does. Now the black king can approach the white pawn but it's too late [ e8 ] is protected and the pawn will promote. Black must look for another way.
 [ Q g5 ] , [ f3 ]  The Bishop is in trouble. If it moves I have N-[ N6 ] dis ch winning the KR.
 [ K a1 ] , [ b3 ]  ...so I move up my pawn to keep the king boxed in on my bottom rank...
 [ B x d2 + ] , [ K x d2 ]  Now what? o-o is probably right but I wanted to be sure he won't grab so much space and action with his lsb so I dared to play...
 [ N f6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ c5 ]  [ e3 ]  [ Q b6 ] , [ Q c1 ]  5. [ Q c1 ] - protects [ b2 ] pawn.
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ e3 ]  locking in the bishop for no reason
 [ R c1 ] , [ a1 = Q ]  this is the game deciding move right here i can kill the queen and make the game knight and bishop vrs 2 rooks or i can kill the rook and make it rook and bishop vrs queen and rook. i know that killing the queen is the better move but i do not see any mates with one knight or bishop i also notice his king is still subject to back rank mate ideas i need a rook for those to work so that made my decision
 [ R e8 ]  [ R x a7 ]  [ R e2 ]  [ R b7 ]  [ R e7 ]  [ R x b6 ]  [ R g7 ] , [ R b8 + ]  White forces one of Black's Rooks off the board and with it any hope Black might have of even salvaging a draw.
 [ N x e5 ]  [ B d4 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ c5 ]  So far Reuben is doing fine. The computer marks this down on a mistake on black's part. [ B c5 ] is the computer's preference. Anyone care to take a guess why? I'm guessing it's got something to do with cutting off the diagonal for the bishop but this is a gap in my knowledge.
 [ B g4 + ]  [ K b8 ] , [ B f3 ]  My plan has been undermined. I don't want to lose my Bishop and [ g2 ] pin and I don't want to open up the board with a Bishop exchange.
 [ N f8 h7 ] , [ B d2 ]  i dont remember why this maybe just because i didn't knew what to do sorry for poor comments !
 [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ c5 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ b6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N a6 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ d6 ]  [ e4 ]  [ N c7 ] , [ N b5 ]  i offer an exchange of my knight because i love the position of my advanced pawns and his knights are attacking them
 [ B x e8 ]  [ Q h8 ]  [ Q g5 ] , [ b x c6 ]  I'd expected r-[ e1 ] which would have caused me some disquiet.
 [ Q e3 + ]  [ K b1 ] , [ e6 ]  And it's with this move since it will allow me to complete my development.
 [ e3 ] , [ N b d7 ]  6. ...... [ N b d7 ] - firstly my queen knight goes to d7. Must think of some other way to bring out Fou Leblanc.
 [ R a b8 ] , [ Q a3 ]  Only square for the queen otherwise it would have been 19...Rxb7#.
 [ R g1 + ]  [ K e2 ] , [ B g4 + ]  Black could also play [ R x h1 ] or Rd8.
 [ B b7 ] , [ R e1 ]  White is better developed at this point and I was looking for an attack.
 [ Q h6 ] , [ B x h8 ]  he retreats his queen and I cature his cornered rook
 [ Q f4 ]  [ R a c8 ]  [ R a c1 ]  [ R x c2 ]  [ R x c2 ]  [ g5 ]  [ Q g4 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ R c6 ]  [ N h6 ]  [ Q g3 ]  [ N f5 ] , [ Q e5 ]  Almost all of my play is dictated by having to protect the annoying d pawns. If I could figure out a way to jettison them while converting to some other useful feature I would!
 [ d x e4 ] , [ N x e4 ]  White takes the centre with his knight and appears to have a strong position. Black must stop that knight from getting to close to the Black king.
 [ N x f6 ] , [ f4 ]  ?? Ok Kamikaze tactics never really worked for the Japanese and neither does it in chess.
 [ B b5 ]  [ R c3 ] , [ B b4 ]  attacks my rook again and again
 [ B e7 ] , [ B b5 + ]  (?) Although this move looks perfectly natural I consider it to be a question mark move due to the reasons stated in my next move. The note above was previously input but on reviewing again I see you had no better choice here since 7. [ B b3 ] [ c4 ] 8. [ B a4 + ] [ K f8 ] leads to the same line we played.
 [ a5 ] , [ N b4 ]  Attacking the rook.
 [ O-O ]  [ O-O ] , [ d6 ]  a direct [ d5 ] is useless: [ e5 ] and [ d3 ] are both sound replies...
 [ N a3 ]  [ Q x b2 ]  [ N b5 ] , [ N d5 ]  I don't see how to really trap the black queen. Even so I can take advantage of things like [ N c7 + ] or Nd6+. Very complicated to foresee every move... I played the bishop in order to close the circle around the black queen but it didn't work.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ Q f6 ]  2. .......... [ Q f6 ] - the Greco Defence - slammed as a dodgy defence because it prevents the king knight from coming to [ f3 ] and the queen could be a target. However this opening has more to it than meets the eye!
 [ f5 ] , [ R c f1 ]  28. [ g x f5 ] [ R x f5 + ] 29. [ K g3 ] [ R g5 + ] 30. [ K f3 ] [ Q f6 + ] 31. [ K e4 ] [ B b7 + ] and white is pretty much finished
 [ g x f6 ]  [ e ]  [ p ]  [ + ]  [ g x f6 ] , [ O-O-O ]  A couple of R on f... and struggling for surviving!
 [ K x a8 ]  [ b x c5 ]  [ B b5 + ] , [ K e3 ]  now baco has a headache he drank too much and the situation is unclear. especially about his stomach.
 [ B f5 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ N c6 ]  [ f6 ] just seems to be asking for trouble at this point. This doesn't seem like a very clever move either though.
 [ N d5 ]  [ K d2 ]  [ h6 ]  [ g3 ]  [ b6 ]  [ e4 ]  [ N e7 ]  [ K d3 ]  [ f6 ]  [ e x f6 ] , [ g x f6 ]  Now it's six pawns apiece
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ] , [ N f3 ]  I generally open like this.
 [ Q b6 ]  [ b3 ] , [ N c6 ]  Still in charted territory although barely.
 [ g4 ] , [ R d8 ]  support the passed pawn
 [ N x e4 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ B f4 ] , [ N g4 ]  Too bad I couldn't fork with f3.
 [ N x e5 ] , [ N f4 ]  My opponent moves his N towards a more central location controlling the center of the board. I opted to make a move against his LSB to remove it from its perch.
 [ N d5 + ]  [ K c5 ] , [ K c3 ]  Shutting out the black king.
 [ a6 ]  [ K d7 ] , [ a7 ]  He can threaten my rook by going to [ c7 ] but then I queen. His only chance is to prevent that with his rook at the same time.
 [ K x d2 ] , [ R d8 + ]  Although I am still a rook up white's position is hopeless. [ N g1 ] and [ R h1 ] are still out of the game [ N a8 ] is not doing much while the [ B d1 ] is a goner. Where did I go wrong?
 [ b x c4 ] , [ R b8 ]  This forth and back looks a bit strange.
 [ Q f5 + ]  [ K b8 ]  [ R f h1 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ Q x h7 ]  [ Q f4 ]  [ B x c4 ] , [ d x c4 ]  Now my random moves were over my next move was to play [ Q f3 ] picking off the knight.
 [ N x e5 ]  [ R x e5 ] , [ f3 ]  White sees the value of his King side pawns.
 [ R x d8 ]  [ R x d8 ]  [ B g6 ]  [ B h3 + ] , [ f5 ]  I beginning to think even swaps will be better for me. Far enough ahead that clearing the board will help me.
 [ R x b7 ] , [ R b a8 ]  unexpected I must admit but still no harm
 [ g x f5 ]  [ Q x f5 ] , [ Q d1 ]  Remember [ Q f3 ] is mate.
 [ Q h4 ] , [ N f3 ]  He wants to mess with my Bitch here take a double!!!
 [ Q x g6 ] , [ R g7 ]  Ok that looked nice off with you bad queen. And do I see a pawn for me on g2?
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ B c4 ]  Hoping for 3..[ N f6 ] so white could play 4.[ N g5 ] (Fried liver attack)
 [ Q x c5 ] , [ K g8 ]  White takes a pawn and adds another attacker to [ f8 ] so forcing the Black king back. Black is nearly paralysed but what is the quickest finish?
 [ B d3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ B b7 ]  [ c3 ]  [ Q c7 ] , [ b4 ]  During the game I saw this as a strange plan but now I know it gives white an equal position
 [ K d7 ]  [ R x h6 ]  [ K e7 ]  [ g4 ]  [ f x g3 ]  [ e ]  [ p ]  [ h x g3 ]  [ K d7 ] , [ R x e6 ]  I've got three pawns so I may as well do that
 [ R e2 ]  [ b5 ]  [ R a2 ]  [ c5 ]  [ R x a6 ]  [ R g6 ]  [ R b6 ]  [ b4 ]  [ g4 ]  [ B c3 ]  [ R b5 ]  [ c4 ]  [ h4 ] , [ b3 ]  The Pawns are in position now to coast home to the 8th rank.
 [ b x a6 ]  [ B x a6 ]  [ K d5 ]  [ B b7 + ]  [ K c5 ]  [ B x e4 ]  [ a5 ]  [ K e6 ]  [ K b5 ] , [ K f5 ]  
 [ B b3 ]  [ N x b3 + ]  [ a x b3 ]  [ B b4 ] , [ B e5 ]  This move is not good. The reason I did this move is to defend [ N c3 ] and attack Nf6. The problem with this move is white loses a pawn: [ B e5 ] [ B x c3 ] 18. [ b x c3 ] [ N x d5 ] 19. [ R h e1 ] [ f6 ] 20. [ c4 ] [ f x e5 ] 21. [ R x d5 ] [ B x f3 ] 22. [ g x f3 ]  [ B x c3 ]  [ b x c3 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ R h f1 ]  [ f6 ]  [ B d4 ]  [ a6 ]  [ h3 ]  [ B h5 ]  [ c4 ] , [ N b4 ]  Here my opponent makes a big mistake because 23. Bc5! 22. ... [ N f4 ] is the correct move.
 [ K f8 ] , [ d4 ]  Blocking [ Q f2 ] and giving an exit for my bishop.
 [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ d6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ g3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ B g2 ]  [ N b d7 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ c5 ]  [ d5 ] , [ N b6 ]  until now i had no perspective but defense. Very classical. I was already thinking: this will end in a draw or I'll make a mistake.
 [ B x b8 ] , [ B x c3 + ]  12. ....... [ B x c3 + ] - this in-between move busts up Ken's queenside pawn structure before I take off his dsb.
 [ O-O ] , [ B b5 ]  preparing something that will come too late...
 [ e6 ] , [ R a d1 ]  10. [ B f4 ] is met with 10. ...[ e5 ]  [ B x e4 ]  [ N g f6 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ h3 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ B x e5 ]  [ c3 ] , [ N d5 ]  This destroys white because of all the fire power aiming at [ f4 ]  [ B e4 ]  [ O-O-O ]  [ Q e2 ]  [ N x e3 ]  [ Q x e3 ]  [ K b8 ]  [ a3 ] , [ g6 ]  Isn't 19. ...[ R e8 ] more useful?
 [ K e4 ] , [ R x e5 + ]  And the game is over.
 [ f4 ]  [ N d3 ]  [ h5 ]  [ h3 ]  [ N h7 ]  [ B h4 ]  [ B f6 ]  [ Q e1 ] , [ N g5 ]  And here Black plays for fork x-ray tactic.
 [ N d7 ] , [ K b1 ]  played to prevent an exchange of bishops but black now comes up with a pair of good moves back to back.
 [ Q x e7 ] , [ d3 ]  11. [ d3 ] - opens a line for white's dsb.
 [ K d1 ] , [ g3 ]  11. ..... [ g3 ] - a very dangerous looking passer makes an appearance in my arc.
 [ d3 ]  [ c7 ]  [ d2 ]  [ c8 = Q ]  [ d1 = Q ]  [ Q c4 + ]  [ K a1 ]  [ Q c3 + ]  [ K b1 ]  [ f6 ]  [ Q g1 + ] , [ K f8 ]  If the king moves into the h column a win will take much longer.
 [ N c4 ] , [ Q b3 ]  Other mistake here...better [ B c3 ]  [ B x c4 ]  [ B x f3 ] , [ g x f3 ]  I think here it was better to capture by the Queen even if strangely the computer didn't report mistake
 [ B x e4 ]  [ N d2 ]  [ B f3 ]  [ c3 ]  [ e4 ]  [ h4 ] , [ R a d8 ]  I bag the open file
 [ Q h4 ] , [ N x b6 ]  I remove the guard on Black's Knight. if 17... PxN 18 QxN will leave me up a piece for a pawn.
 [ K c1 ] , [ N c4 + ]  Now 30. [ K d1 ] [ N x b2 # ] so I tried the other king move.
 [ g3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ B g2 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ] , [ Q e8 ]  Via transposition we have reached the Leningrad Variation of the Dutch Defense arguably the sharpest and most theoretical of all the Dutch lines. I used to play it quite frequently before switching the Classical Dutch because after 8. [ d5 ] I played too many games where I suffered on blindingly light squares (Nosferatu hates the light). It still leads to enterprising chess.
 [ N f6 ] , [ h4 ]  I don't care about a possible Ng4. I know that the Dutch "must" be attacked soon and strongly. And that if black has some weak point it is the h column. The a2-[ g8 ] diag can be easily covered with e6...
 [ Q f5 + ]  [ K h6 ]  [ Q f6 + ]  [ K h5 ]  [ Q x f7 + ]  [ K g4 ]  [ Q g7 + ]  [ K h3 ]  [ Q h7 + ]  [ K g2 ]  [ Q b7 + ] , [ K g1 ]  My friend mikey45 asked here why white doesn't trade queens. I agree that would be the best try but black manages to stop b-pawn from promotion without losing a piece(just in time). Then it would be bishop+knight checkmate pattern.
 [ B x c6 ] , [ b x c6 ]  Both Kings are now somewhat exposed.
 [ e6 ]  [ f x e6 ]  [ d x e6 ] , [ N e7 ]  forced...
 [ N d2 ] , [ B b7 ]  15. ..... [ B b7 ] - develops and defends the knight on d5.
 [ O-O ] , [ B g7 ]  Black chooses the Cozio system in response to white's 5. c3. A good defensive position but not very strong against the deferred center system
 [ Q x d4 ]  [ Q x d4 ] , [ N x d4 ]  White is now a pawn up. In addition Black's development will be slowed by the centralized N. Black can't move the B with dropping the b pawn. And if the N moves to [ c6 ] the b pawn also hangs.
 [ N x c6 ]  [ d x c6 ] , [ h3 ]  Losing tempo... even under the guise of a kingside advance. Much better options available insomuch as completing development.. even the preemptive [ f5 ] would be better
 [ N g3 + ]  [ K g1 ]  [ N x f1 ]  [ Q x f1 ]  [ R f d8 ]  [ N d3 ]  [ a5 ]  [ Q f5 ] , [ f6 ]  This is a mistake by the opponent. The pawn on [ a5 ] is free to take. a4! would be a nice move.
 [ a5 ]  [ K e5 ]  [ a4 ] , [ B f7 + ]  Here white announced mate in 4 and entered the conditional moves starting with 36. Bf7+. However in revisiting this game I discovered there was a mate in 3 I could have played instead: 36. [ B e6 + ] [ K d8 ] 37. [ K d6 ] (any) 38. [ R c8 # ] or if black tries anything else for his 36th move 37. [ K f6 ] (any) 38. Rc8#. Oh well 3 would have been prettier but 4 worked well enough for the win.
 [ R a b1 ]  [ R a d8 ] , [ a4 ]  The computer analysis said that we were at a completely equal position. I guess I'd expect that much.
 [ B b4 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ e x d4 ] , [ Q x d4 ]  I will end up with a central advantage and a plus in development.
 [ K c7 ]  [ a3 ]  [ f5 ] , [ e x f5 ]  12. [ e x [ f5 ] ] - I decide to take on [ f5 ] in order to give Freddy an isolani.
 [ K h6 ] , [ g4 ]  35 g4?! was a move to make [ R h4 ] .The next move shocked me by black to stop the mate.OMGoshhhhh
 [ g3 ]  [ B h3 ]  [ R g1 ] , [ f3 ]  The king is trapped in the corner and black can breathe freely.
 [ e x d6 + ]  [ c x d6 ] , [ Q d5 ]  ! This move give a lot of opportunities and black must protect himself of Bb5.
 [ f3 ] , [ N c5 ]  didnot see [ f3 ] coming
 [ R x f1 ] , [ Q a6 ]  The queen finally gets the breathing space to get back to help the king-side. It seems that after 23.[ B d5 + ] [ B e6 ] easily defends. But matters are not so clear 24.Rf6! [ Q e2 ] [only move] 25.[ B x e6 ] [ N x e6 ] 26.[ R x e6 ] [ R c8 ] 27.[ K b1 ] Qd1+! 28.[ B c1 ] [ Q x c2 + ] 29.[ K a2 ] Qf5! =
 [ N d2 ]  [ Q x g5 ] , [ f4 ]  White now responds to this early loss of a piece with a frantic pawn push
 [ f3 ]  [ B e6 ] , [ b3 ]  This move may have been White's weakest point. Black clearly controls the game at this point with the following move being obvious to most. Further White has removed his [ c3 ] Knight's defence.
 [ g5 ] , [ a4 ]  !! a passed pawn
 [ N x f1 ]  [ Q x f1 ] , [ Q g5 ]  I think white's best move here is 12. [ e4 ] protecting the knight and readying [ d3 ] or d4.
 [ c6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N b d7 ]  [ Q c2 ]  [ R e8 ] , [ e4 ]  Preferable was [ a3 ] because white can then continue with [ b4 ] [ a4 ] and [ b5 ] weakening black's Queenside. Here white concedes a small portion of his/her central advantage by losing a key centre pawn.
 [ e x d4 ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ Q e7 ] , [ O-O ]  As the gain enables Joe to castle.
 [ K h6 ] , [ R x a5 ]  Black could still pose practical problems by 76 ...[ K b7 ] 77. [ R e7 + ] [ K a6 ] 78. [ R e5 ] [ R x f4 ] 79. [ K x h5 ] [ f6 ] although the tablebase confirms that White is winning with the transfer of his rook to the hfile by 80. [ R e3 ] [ K a5 ] 81. [ R h3 ] etc.
 [ d x c5 ] , [ Q x c5 ]  I have to capture (otherwise I will face for example 12.[ B x c6 ] [ b x c6 ] 13.b4) but capturing with the knight does not work: 11...[ N x [ c5 ] ] 12.[ N x d5 ] [ B x d5 ] 13.[ Q x d5 ] and I am much worse. If [ B x c6 ] then my plan is [ b x c6 ] (defends the d pawn and makes ...[ c5 ] a possibility). I’d like to finally castle. I have also analyzed 12.[ R c1 ] but it does not threaten anything (the [ [ b5 ] ] bishop is attacked) so I can then also safely castle. If 12.[ N g5 ] then either 12...0-0 or even 12...Ndxe5. I am also thinking about ...[ d4 ] to open up the diagonal for the [ e6 ] bishop and attack the defender of the [ [ b5 ] ] bishop (but it does not work after for example 12.Rc1).
 [ N f3 ] , [ h6 ]  This move only helps White decide what to do. Doubling Blacks pawns on [ f6 ] (6.Bxf6) was a threat since recapturing with the Q loses the [ d5 ] pawn i.e. 6.Bx[ f6 ] Qx[ f6 ] 7.cxd exd 8.Nxd5! but it is too early to know if the [ B g5 ] will be missed. After 5 ...[ h6 ] White doesn't have much choice.
 [ f5 ] , [ R d7 ]  Interesting. By changing the crowning's square colour it should be easier for me to stop his pawns.
 [ d x e4 ]  [ Q x e4 ]  [ f5 ]  [ e x f6 ]  [ e ]  [ p ] , [ + ]  10.[ e x f6 ] e.p. with Discovered Check as well ... is a fairly rare type of move to see made and is very strong here.
 [ e x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ h6 ]  [ B h4 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ B x e7 ]  [ Q x e7 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ O-O ] , [ f4 ]  I lost my Knight here.
 [ R d e8 ]  [ R e c1 ] , [ a4 ]  Still being down a pawn I was cautious towards playing 28. ... [ N x b5 ] 29. [ N x a5 ] [ f6 ] 30. Nb3. I'd rather the following sequence
 [ N e2 + ]  [ K f1 ]  [ N x f4 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ R d2 ]  [ g3 ]  [ N e6 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ N d4 ] , [ N e5 ]  Prior to this move I noticed a potential mate on the back row. I just needed the N to guard the [ f7 ] square and get my rook up there...So I let him take the [ c2 ] pawn so I can attack his N with my R. Hoping he'll just move his N and I go up for #
 [ f5 ] , [ N x d6 ]  Naturally I swap off more wood.
 [ c6 ] , [ h2 + ]  despiration move - for the pawn swap
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ e3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ c5 ]  [ c3 ] , [ Q b6 ]  My first aggressive developmental move attacking White's weak [ b2 ] Pawn. Must remember that my Queen is my only support for my Bishop on d6.
 [ d5 ]  [ c x d5 ] , [ e x d5 ]  Opening up the board more
 [ R b1 ]  [ R b8 ] , [ Q a4 + ]  This move allows me to capture a pawn on a7.
 [ N x e7 ] , [ R d1 ]  Threatening mate on [ d8 ] once again.
 [ N e7 ] , [ B e8 ]  Necessary to defend g6. White can draw by repetition maybe.
 [ f5 ] , [ e x f5 ]  I don't have much choice. Now I looked at the various possibilites following 43.[ g x f5 ] gxf5; should I head off up the h-file or win one of the pawns on [ c5 ] and b5? Can the f-pawn get to the Queening square first? And so on.
 [ N f3 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ B c4 ]  Four knights Italian variation. Black should be better after Nxe5.
 [ f6 ] , [ Q h6 + ]  25. [ Q h6 + ] - Glenda being on this square has usually spelt doom and gloom for my opponents. Can she do the biz here? We shall see.
 [ b x c5 ]  [ d x c5 ] , [ B f4 ]  Another good natural move from my opponent though from my earlier comment unexpected.
 [ R e7 ]  [ f5 ] , [ g5 ]  31. ...... [ g5 ] - Dave told me in a post-match pm that he thought that this was the move that threw away half a point. Not sure there. According to Gameknot Analysis it was an error-free game. Neither side had committed so much as an inaccuracy. Dave however thought that it had given me the chance to sew up the kingside. He is right on there but can he do something on the queenside?! We shall see.
 [ Q f4 + ]  [ K e7 ]  [ Q e5 + ]  [ K d7 ] , [ b x a3 ]  Taking here gives me initiative. and his king. bad combination.
 [ K f2 ] , [ O-O ]  The white king's men gather around him as the dragon is circling around and is about to smash through the castle gates.
 [ B e3 ] , [ N f6 ]  [ e4 ] is pressured now.
 [ B d6 ] , [ d3 ]  bluenoser: Castle? Would now be a good time a_random_guy: 8...0-0 Yeah it would be a good time to castle! ptitroque: 8.O-O We've got to castle short so let's do it now
 [ e5 ] , [ f x e5 ]  30. .......... [ f x e5 ] - was [ K f7 ] any better?
 [ K e6 ]  [ N f4 + ]  [ K f5 ]  [ R d5 + ]  [ K e4 ]  [ B c2 + ]  [ K f3 ]  [ B d1 + ]  [ K e4 ] , [ K g2 ]  Now very closed to the end. He did not realized that that would be the end. So thinking of move the Rook instead of leaving the game.
 [ d6 ] , [ N f3 ]  Now I develop my knight...
 [ f5 ]  [ h3 ]  [ h5 ]  [ K e3 ]  [ g5 ]  [ K d3 ]  [ a5 ]  [ b x a5 ] , [ b x a5 ]  37. .......... b x [ a5 ] - I have a passer but black has succeeded in breaking up my queenside pawns. I do not like the kingside much either. I am thinking about black having a possible pawn break sac which might lead to a passer on the kingside. Fortunately this does not materialise.
 [ N x d4 ] , [ c x d4 ]  White cannot afford to let the Knight live: after [ Q d1 ] - [ N e2 + ] is a disaster - might follow Nf5...
 [ K f3 ] , [ N f4 ]  After each move my barrier keeps getting tighter and White's king has less squares
 [ R b8 ]  [ b4 ]  [ R g5 ] , [ B e2 ]  This is where I feel the Bishop needs to be in order to help over on the Queenside although I am hesitant on removing it completly away from the Kingside squares which I am worried may soon come under some pressure due to the open g & h files. All Black may need to do is ...[ B f6 ] & ...[ K e7 ] in order to clear the way so that the Q and other Rook can swing over to those open files.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ B c4 ]  this is called Italian Game.
 [ K x b2 ]  [ K e3 ]  [ K c2 ]  [ K f3 ]  [ K d2 ]  [ K x g3 ]  [ K e2 ]  [ K x h4 ]  [ K f3 ] , [ g5 ]  Resigning would be the best move but perhaps a stalemate is possible.... You can not get a draw by giving up!
 [ N x f6 + ]  [ N x f6 ]  [ B x h7 + ] , [ K x h7 ]  white stands better.
 [ B a6 ] , [ N g4 ]  The whole idea behind this move and 12.[ Q f3 ] was because it looked like white was threatening a checkmate. But that's where I figured out that it was Tunnel Vision because of where the N is now placed in contrast to where I thought it was placed. So hyperfocus right on the [ f7 ] square which is why it's Tunnel Vision. As I thought that I might have a mating sequence. This would however be true if the N were on [ g5 ] and he didn't have the pan h6. So in disguise it was a good thing that this Tunnel Vision was there as otherwise he might have compensated and even wound up the equivalent to a pawn up as this would have been a free N.
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ g3 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ B h3 ]  Sorry for skipping the entire early game but honestly i find them to be really boring. Anyways daniel plays [ h3 ] instead of standard g2. Not quite sure could be his playstyle.
 [ N e7 ]  [ B e5 ]  [ N e g8 ]  [ R f e1 ]  [ R h7 ]  [ N f4 ]  [ Q h6 ] , [ Q c3 ]  Another move attacking c7.
 [ K d6 ]  [ R h8 ]  [ c4 ]  [ Q f6 + ]  [ K c5 ]  [ R c8 + ] , [ K b5 ]  and now i win cause if 42.d:[ [ c4 ] ] 42...[ K a5 ] 43.[ R a8 ] checkmate;42...d:[ [ c4 ] ] 43.[ R g5 ] checkmate
 [ R d b1 ]  [ c5 ]  [ c3 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ c x d4 ] , [ R b3 ]  After I played 18. [ R b1 ] Wayne put more pressure on [ d4 ] by playing c5. I played [ c3 ] and there was an exchange of pawns. Now comes the deadly incursion 20. ........ Rb3.
 [ N a c4 ] , [ b5 ]  '?' - Much stronger is ..Nxe5! when Black simply wins a pawn for nothing. Black's idea is to trap one of the White knights but he loses sight of the significance along the light squares. Now White is back in the game (if he finds the right moves!)
 [ N b c6 ]  [ B a3 ]  [ b5 ]  [ a x b5 ]  [ a x b5 ]  [ N b3 ]  [ Q d6 ] , [ N c5 ]  15. Nc5? - maybe Glenda should have gone to [ d2 ] - at least the pawn on [ b4 ] would have had some back up!
 [ e x d3 ]  [ h6 ] , [ B f4 ]  My piece now all mobile thank to my opponent. I think I have a bit of edge here even though my pawn is double on queens side.
 [ N c3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ O-O ] , [ N e7 ]  Even with his last two moves black is still playing very passively. There aren't really any weaknesses in his position though with the probable exception of the h-pawn. He's a good three or four moves away from castling queenside so I decide to pre-empt kingside castling with my next move (similar to my last annotated game actually)
 [ b3 ]  [ c x b3 ]  [ a x b3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ a6 ]  [ K e2 ] , [ B g4 ]  main motive for playing this move was to preserve the bishop pair if White played B-d3.
 [ R x e7 ]  [ Q x e7 + ]  [ Q x e7 ] , [ R x e7 ]  I felt better entering the endgame with this scenario. It isn't the best and certainly not as good as I was 10 moves ago but I might be able to work something here.
 [ B b7 ] , [ R a d1 ]  The rook takes the open file.
 [ K g4 ] , [ N g2 ]  (?) The black knight is trapped. [ N f5 ] or [ N g6 ] would be better.
 [ d5 ] , [ e5 ]  Perfect. Neither of his bishops have any offensive position at all and one of his knights can only move to the side of the board. Ten moves in and he's got nothing going.
 [ B e7 ] , [ B a7 ]  Giving away the [ f4 ] pawn but...
 [ N f1 ]  [ Q x f2 + ]  [ K x f2 ]  [ B c6 ]  [ R c7 ]  [ K f8 ]  [ h4 ] , [ R a3 ]  40...[ R d7 ] was simpler
 [ c x b6 ]  [ a x b6 ]  [ b4 ] , [ R f8 ]  ? Giving up the pawn. With White having three passed pawns on the queenside the game is probably technically lost.
 [ R e x f7 + ] , [ K g5 ]  Note that if Black moved his king towards the center bad things could have happened.
 [ K x g4 ]  [ h3 + ] , [ K h5 ]  If black did not want to prolong the agony for another move by 13... [ K h4 ] 14. [ g3 ] [ K h5 ] he should have settled for immediate [ K f5 ] 14. [ g4 ] mate!
 [ e x f6 ] , [ N g x f6 ]  Ngxf6- Black didn't want to trade bishops and didn't seem to want to open the D file. Possilby feared the Queen exchange and having to recapture w/ the King which would totally prevent future Castling.
 [ Q g7 + ]  [ K b8 ]  [ Q e5 + ]  [ K b7 ]  [ Q d5 + ]  [ K b8 ]  [ Q d6 + ]  [ K b7 ]  [ Q b4 + ] , [ K a8 ]  61. [ K a8 ] - a stalemate try here. If the black king tries to come to the Witch's aid then I will have no legal moves and therefore Gameknot will declare the game drawn for me. My opponent would have no say in the matter (he declined a draw offer on move 58).
 [ N d2 ]  [ a6 ] , [ R a c1 ]  threatening the queen
 [ K x f2 ]  [ O-O ]  [ c4 ]  [ B c6 ]  [ d5 ]  [ B b7 ] , [ Q c2 ]  Ok you are ahead 3 points. Watch out for QxPh7#. Like maybe g6.
 [ Q x e7 ]  [ N x e7 ] , [ N g5 ]  Again [ N g5 ] saves the day... After [ N x e5 ] g6! white loses his edge... We have to keep pushing; we are - technically - still in the opening stage of the game! Both sides are still not fully developed and allready at war... The following is - again - forced... Bc2/[ B g6 ] (to maintain control over h7) is met with [ N x e6 ] [ R f7 ] Nxg7/hxg7... After 25. ... [ B d5 ] (else Nxe6) 26. [ h x g7 ] [ R f6 ] (else Rxh7) 27. [ B d3 ] seals the fate of h7...
 [ R b8 ]  [ Q c2 ] , [ Q b6 ]  Creating short and long term threats. Eg ..[ c4 ] ..[ B c5 ] ..Nf6-[ g4 ] etc..
 [ R x h3 ] , [ R a8 ]  "Threatening [ B f8 ] mate amongst other nasties" Steve gives 44. [ R a8 ] two exclamation marks but Fritz prefers 44. [ B d4 ] (+3.03) and 44. [ R a8 ] as the second best move (+2.78)
 [ d3 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ B g4 ] , [ Q d3 ]  7. [ Q d3 ] - the witch must block the d file - otherwise Glenda will steam down to [ e1 ] delivering mate. I exchange queens and then castle queenside substituting the queen for the rook on the d file.
 [ O-O ]  [ R h f1 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ g3 ] , [ N b8 ]  Hmmmm. I was certain Black had move their knight to [ d7 ] in order to get onto [ f5 ] and really exert some force around the centre-kingside. Since it seems unlikely they are manoeuvering to post their knight way out on [ a6 ] their goal may well be Nc6. From [ N c6 ] it could leap to that troublesome [ d4 ] square. And a knight there could become a real knightmare! [ B a4 ] is the reply if I believe 21...[ N c6 ] is to be avoided. The downside for Black of their plan is the 3 movements of the same piece. In the 2 moves it will take to get their knight to its destination can I concoct a competent counterplay?
 [ c4 ]  [ f5 + ]  [ K f6 ]  [ R c5 ]  [ h5 ] , [ K f1 ]  This is now pretty much a draw! Great start! Great opening choice! Terrible decision making after reaching a huge advantage! What disappointment!
 [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ e4 ]  [ d6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ O-O ] , [ e5 ]  An early attack by white.
 [ B d7 ]  [ B x d7 + ]  [ N x d7 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N g f6 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N x d7 ]  [ Q x d7 ] , [ O-O ]  Castling short
 [ N c3 ]  [ K b6 ] , [ B e3 ]  12. Be3! - here Freddy's opponent castled. Freddy played a very strong move here developing a piece and exerting pressure on [ c5 ] in fact also lining up on the same diagonal as Henry!
 [ Q e7 ]  [ R d2 ]  [ N g7 ]  [ R e d1 ] , [ N e6 ]  22. ....... [ N e6 ] - heading for outpost on d4.
 [ N e2 ]  [ b6 ]  [ c6 ] , [ N f8 ]  24. ..... [ N f8 ] - luckily my knight has an escape square on f8.
 [ R f d8 ]  [ B a2 ]  [ B d5 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ B x a2 ]  [ R x a2 ]  [ B x d4 ]  [ B x d4 ] , [ R d6 ]  Analysis calls this a blunder due to … [ R d6 ] 24. [ R a1 ] [ R a d8 ] 25. [ c3 ] [ N d5 ] 26. [ Q e2 ] bx[ c3 ] 27. bx[ c3 ] [ N b3 ] 28. [ R a e1 ] [ f6 ] 29. [ N g6 ] [ N x d4 ] 30. [ c x d4 ] N[ c3 ] 31. [ Q e3 ] [ R x d4 ] 32. [ f5 ] [ R d3 ] 33. [ Q f2 ] [ R d2 ] 34. [ Q f4 ] [ Q c5 + ] 35. [ K h1 ] [ R b2 ] 36. [ Q g3 ] [ R c8 ] 37. [ R e3 ] [ R c2 ] 38. [ R f e1 ]  [ c3 ] , [ b x c3 ]  Analysis has this as a mistake too
 [ a x b4 ]  [ N e5 ] , [ R e1 ]  I attempted to pin his knight and then attack with my bishop on g3.
 [ e4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ d3 ]  [ d5 ] , [ N d2 ]  I have played a number of different lines against the French but the KIA is one of the easiest to play in blitz chess. It has a limited number of plans for white.
 [ R h8 ]  [ R h1 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N g8 ]  [ N b1 ] , [ N b8 ]  (d) An ingenious and beautiful début sometimes called the Pipeopener.
 [ e x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ] , [ B b4 ]  Adding pressure to the c knight in a pin against the king.
 [ O-O ] , [ N g f6 ]  I can't save the f-pawn so I develop my worst piece instead.
 [ Q x d2 ]  [ N x f6 + ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ B x d2 ]  [ a5 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ B x g5 ]  [ h x g5 ]  [ a4 ]  [ B d5 ]  [ R a b8 ] , [ f4 ]  20.f4! planning white's next move.
 [ N x c3 ]  [ Q x c3 ]  [ B x d3 ]  [ Q x d3 ]  [ a6 ] , [ a4 ]  The minority attack starts to roll.
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ d6 ]  There is that [ d6 ] again still not convinced about that reply.
 [ c x b6 ]  [ e ] , [ p ]  ...my brother tossed a spanner into the works with this move.
 [ B f6 ]  [ Q f3 ]  [ b5 ]  [ h4 ]  [ g4 ] , [ Q f5 ]  White now has a passed pawn to add to blacks' worries
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ d4 ]  The Scotch Game/Gambit you've all seen this before. For me this is my favorite opening.
 [ K h7 ]  [ a5 ]  [ R b6 b7 ] , [ N c5 ]  Knight is finally where I want it. Attacking that poor [ e6 ] pawn.
 [ R d7 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ R c7 ] , [ R d5 ]  preparing to advance the e pawn.
 [ b3 ]  [ a6 ]  [ B b2 ] , [ b5 ]  This is where my I start giving him pieces to insure my position. I could of traded his bishop but didn't want him to have an open file for his rook at my queen side. so instead....
 [ R x a6 ] , [ Q d1 + ]  A feeble check
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ N f6 ]  After many years playing the Philidor's Defense I decided on the Petroff.
 [ Q x e2 ] , [ R e1 ]  my queen appears to be trapped so attack his queen is my only response
 [ Q x e4 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d4 ] , [ N c6 ]  Black's trying to save a pawn.. clearly white dominates the initiative.
 [ R f7 ] , [ R e6 ]  ...black has to take...retreating only allows the pawn to adavance and threaten [ R e7 ]  [ R x e6 ] , [ d x e6 ]  ...black is limited to the square..anywhere on the 7th rank secures the pawn...Ill take with the bishop as the knight is paralysed...Black will suffer material losses to stay in the game but the result is not in doubt from here...
 [ g5 + ]  [ K g3 ]  [ f4 + ]  [ K h3 ] , [ K e5 ]  Now Black is better. White's K will eventually get forced away from the base pawn.
 [ e5 ] , [ d4 ]  2. [ [ d4 ] ] - this is the Centre Game. White makes an immediate [ [ d4 ] ] thrust following e4. Both bishop's diagonals are now clear. I decided to capture and the Wicked Witch of the West recaptures. This centralisation of the enemy queen is a double edged sword. Can I give her the runaround? We shall see.
 [ N x e4 ]  [ B x b2 ]  [ R b1 ]  [ B x d5 ] , [ R x b2 ]  OK he has decided to swap off my dark squared bishop. Pity it was a strong piece and now my dark squares are very weak around my king. I must now take the knight on[ e4 ] to level the material.
 [ g x f6 ]  [ N d5 ] , [ f5 ]  Black plays to unravel his pawns and get rid of the knight on d5. White can not stop the attack against his knight but he will try exact a even better concession from black
 [ d4 ] , [ B b6 ]  As foreseen. White can harass my B with c4-[ c5 ] but I would have [ B c7 ] as desired. BUT this move leaves white the chanche to occupy [ f4 ] with his DSB and this is to be avoided by Black if possible.
 [ N f3 ] , [ d5 ]  White's knight came to [ f3 ] and I moved pawn to [ d5 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ c5 ]  White's knight came to [ c3 ] and I moved c pawn out to [ c5 ] protected by DB at f8. I have allowed the pawns to protect themselves but must now start to move the pieces out.
 [ N f3 ] , [ c5 ]  if [ e4 ] we have a Sicilian
 [ d5 ] , [ c4 ]  I put my mind into full Queens gambit mode. I feel secure whether he takes or not.
 [ K g8 ]  [ R f7 ]  [ K h8 ]  [ e7 ]  [ K g8 ] , [ e8 = Q # ]  I was happy with my play in this game. I managed to gain an exchange and then through forcing play traded off all the remaining pieces allowing me to push a pawn and win the game.
 [ Q d7 ]  [ N e5 ] , [ Q e7 ]  Draw declared by threefold repetition. I have a gut feeling that I should easily have won this position...am I right? Anyway well played johnforteen6!
 [ N f6 ]  [ d4 ] , [ B f5 ]  I like the bishop here though [ B g4 ] is tempting too
 [ B c4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ b3 ] , [ d5 ]  White employs Bowlder Attack. I respond accordingly with [ e6 ] then later [ [ d5 ] ] clearing the center and giving me a tempo. [ B c6 ] is played before [ [ d5 ] ] to keep the king from being exposed to Bb5+.
 [ Q g6 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ B x f5 ] , [ B x f5 ]  Black chooses to exchange minor pieces.
 [ b2 ]  [ f x g6 ]  [ f x g6 ]  [ N g h5 ]  [ g x h5 ]  [ Q x h5 ] , [ Q x f2 ]  I thought he was going to do this and I think this pretty much breaks my attack. (Which indicates it wasn't sound - but at least it was fun.)
 [ B g4 ]  [ f5 ]  [ e x f5 ]  [ g x f5 ] , [ B h5 ]  That exchange ended not good for the opp. - was forced to move the bishop to [ h5 ] gave me tempo.
 [ R d4 ] , [ R e6 ]  If Black accepts the sacrifice he can not keep the material or gets mated: 21.../[ B x d4 ] 22.[ B x d4 ] and because of the threat 23.[ N h6 # ] Black is forced to play [ R x f5 ] or [ R e6 ]  [ R g4 + ]  [ K h8 ]  [ N h4 ] , [ R g8 ]  The alternative for Black was to play 23.../[ Q f7 ] then the game goes on with 24.Ng6+/[ R x g6 ] 25.Rxg6/[ Q x g6 ] 26.[ Q x e5 + ] and then depending on the black answer ([ K g8 ] or Qg7) White plays [ R x b7 ] or [ Q e4 ] (threatening Bd4) and is keeping initative.
 [ R f4 ]  [ Q h6 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ g5 ]  [ R f f1 ] , [ f4 ]  Loses a pawn which might be okay if a strong attack resulted. But the [ e4 ] N is easily exchanged and the Q is not very dangerous on its own.
 [ B f5 ] , [ h4 ]  Nimzowitsch liked this 3 [ e5 ] variation and would play here 4 Bd3. His most famous game with this line is sadly a loss a magnificent manoeuvring game against Capablanca from New York 1927. The most common alternative these days is 4 [ N c3 ] as played for example by Kasparov in a drastic win over Karpov at Linares 2001 which continued 4...[ [ e6 ] ] 5 [ [ g4 ] ] [ B g6 ] 6 [ N g e2 ] [ N e7 ] 7 [ N [ f4 ] ] [ [ c5 ] ] 8 dx[ [ c5 ] ] [ N d7 ] 9 [ [ h4 ] ] Nx[ e5 ] 10 [ B g2 ] [ h5 ] 11 [ Q e2 ] N7[ c6 ] 12 [ N x g6 ] [ N x g6 ] 13 [ B g5 ] [ B e7 ] 14 gx[ h5 ] [ N f8 ] 15 [ N b5 ] [ N d7 ] 16 h6. The latest try for Black is 4 [ N c3 ] a5!? as in Sebag-Chiburdanidze FIDE WCh Women KO Elista 2004. Black won in 33 moves after 5 [ B e3 ] [ a4 ] 6 [ a3 ] [ Q b6 ] 7 [ R b1 ] [ Q a5 ] 8 [ [ g4 ] ] [ B d7 ] 9 [ B g2 ] [ [ e6 ] ] 10 [ N g e2 ] [ [ c5 ] ] 11 0–0 N[ c6 ] 12 [ f4 ] h5. This 4 [ [ h4 ] ] line was tested repeatedly in the Tal-Botvinnik WCC match Moscow 1961 with generally favourable results for Black. The paths they followed are retraced below.
 [ g6 ]  [ R h3 ] , [ B d8 ]  Back to the annoying position for his bishop.
 [ N c3 ] , [ N a6 ]  Black develops a knight to the rim.
 [ e5 ]  [ e4 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ d3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ h6 ]  [ B h4 ] , [ N d4 ]  This is where I started grasping at straws although I did like the aggressive post of the knight and wasn't afraid to exchange.
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ B f4 ] , [ c5 ]  This is my testing scheme against such white's asset. No theory behind just the feeling (and some experience with the same asset with white pieces!)
 [ N f5 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ N x e3 ]  [ f x e3 ]  [ Q b6 ]  [ b3 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ O-O ]  [ f6 ]  [ a4 ]  [ a6 ]  [ e x f6 ]  [ g x f6 ]  [ a5 ]  [ N x a5 ]  [ d x c5 ]  [ B x c5 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ Q h5 + ]  up until now I was under the impression I was doing rather nicely against this 2350+ giant... but that would soon change...
 [ d5 ] , [ Q c7 ]  Making use of my new hole on the Q-side but I wasn't sure this was the right square given that White can quickly oppose it with his rook. ...[ Q b6 ] would have had the virtue of aiming at [ f2 ] and [ [ b2 ] ] simultaneously but I think the [ [ b2 ] ] pawn would have been fairly poisonous.
 [ B b3 ] , [ a6 ]  Accepting to hold the white push but avoiding the annoying [ N b5 ] pressure. It was better to open the way for my Q. After [ c6 ] my developement seems easier in spite of the pawn.
 [ d4 ] , [ c5 ]  This aims to undermines white's centre.
 [ K h3 ] , [ Q h1 + ]  Push him towards my knight and pawns
 [ d3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ B x d4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ h3 ]  [ O-O ] , [ Q f3 ]  A very complex and potentially problematic position for me. I believe his next intended move is O-O-O which brings his rook against my extremely weak d pawn where any further pressure whether through [ c5 ] or [ N b5 ] would cause it to buckle and making further problems for my queen which is currently its only defender and because of the future position of the rook also "safe" because of the rook. I believe my only reasonable move now is [ Q a5 ] followed by Rd1. Subsequently I can add defense to the d pawn by [ N b4 ] if necessary (not necessarily wise as it stands now).
 [ Q c1 ]  [ N x d3 ]  [ N x d3 ]  [ Q x d3 ] , [ N a1 ]  31. [ N a1 ] - trying to nab the c pawn but maybe Glenda should have moved to [ f1 ] here but I did need to stop that c pawn from crowning.
 [ a6 ]  [ N x d5 ] , [ N x d5 ]  I see what you're doing here ...
 [ O-O ]  [ d6 ]  [ R d2 ] , [ g5 ]  The center is under white's control and I have little play on the Queenside so I decide to go for a kingside pawn advance maximizing the strength of my Bishop's while limiting the usefulness of his Rooks.
 [ Q c8 ]  [ K g2 ] , [ B h6 ]  The bishop moves to a better diagonal.
 [ R d7 ] , [ f3 ]  And TA connects another chain of his pawns.
 [ N x d2 ]  [ Q x d2 ]  [ B x f3 ]  [ g x f3 ]  [ B x b4 ]  [ Q d1 ]  [ B c3 ] , [ R b1 ]  22. [ R b1 ] - after a plethora of exchanges Freddy has regained his pawn and busted up my kingside pawn structure. I try to defend my valuable [ a4 ] passer by attacking the witch and then placing Fou Leblanc onto [ b5 ] next move.
 [ Q h5 ]  [ h3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ R h2 ] , [ B d6 ]  i did not notice that this was a free piece. my bad
 [ f x e4 ] , [ Q h4 ]  Might have been better off locking up the queen side a bit more with b6.
 [ Q x e7 ]  [ R x h3 + ] , [ K g1 ]  Blunder i could of made a draw but here i lost a rook.
 [ B f4 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ R f d1 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ b3 ]  [ Q b7 ]  [ b x c4 ]  [ b4 ]  [ Q b3 ]  [ N f3 + ]  [ K g2 ]  [ N e1 + ]  [ K h3 ]  [ Q g2 + ]  [ K g4 ]  [ h5 + ]  [ K x h5 ]  [ Q h3 + ]  [ K g6 ]  [ R e6 + ]  [ K g5 ] , [ B e7 # ]  
 [ N f3 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ B g2 ]  [ O-O ]  [ Q d3 ] , [ N c6 ]  I complete minor piece development and I think white has equalized.
 [ N x e4 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ B x e4 ] , [ K h8 ]  Now white has proven his rooks to be placed well on the f and e files. Black has been pushed back a bit and his queen perhaps is a little awkward though so too is white's knight. I would assess this as about equal because of the bishop pair and the fact that both open files can still be contested easily.
 [ f5 ]  [ N x e6 ] , [ f x e6 ]  This continues to keep [ e7 ] from moving and keeps Black bottled up.
 [ Q x b7 ]  [ B x a1 ]  [ Q x a8 ]  [ Q x a8 ]  [ B x a8 ] , [ R x a8 ]  I don't really have a chance
 [ Q c6 ] , [ R c1 ]  Too late! The queen is back "home".
 [ R c5 ]  [ R b5 ] , [ R c c1 ]  This is an important moment. As stated above the more pieces remain on the board the less great will be the drawing tendency of the opposite coloured bishops. Andersson therefore keeps both rooks on.
 [ R g5 ]  [ R x g5 ]  [ f x g5 ]  [ R e6 + ]  [ K d2 ]  [ g2 ] , [ c4 ]  The queenside pawn rush begins.
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ d3 ]  I'm not used to seeing this. Wondering if my opponent's relatively low rating was deceptive or not.
 [ e4 ] , [ e6 ]  Now 2. [ d4 ] is the best choice.
 [ e5 ]  [ d5 ] , [ a5 ]  Didn´t think of this was kind of a surprise but it hampers somehow my idea to advance on the queen side. But it also seems to me that creates a weakness (that I did not exploit properly)
 [ K f7 ]  [ R x b8 ] , [ R c x b2 + ]  an in-between move that wins a extra pawn
 [ B d1 ] , [ N c4 ]  It would be crazy for anyone to suggest that Carlsen is happy with his current position with White. I am sure that it is a disappointment for him so far in this game and a draw will be good here for Carlsen.
 [ g4 ] , [ N f4 ]  Black's knight obtains an outpost on f4.
 [ R x g7 ]  [ c2 ]  [ R c7 ] , [ c1 = Q ]  relentless...
 [ R e8 ] , [ Q f3 ]  This hits both of his weak pawns ([ f5 ] and d5).
 [ B x c3 ]  [ R f g1 ]  [ R g6 ]  [ Q c2 ] , [ Q f4 + ]  Pushing his king into a corner.
 [ B d4 ] , [ B x d4 + ]  The bishop goes down...
 [ K f1 ]  [ R e5 ]  [ R x e5 ]  [ B x e5 ] , [ B x e6 ]  after this move White's King must stay to stop the h-pawn accordingly the [ b4 ] button will fall to the K+B. interesting game.
 [ N x c7 + ]  [ K d8 ]  [ N x a8 ]  [ Q x g2 ]  [ R f1 ]  [ B x h3 ]  [ Q f3 ] , [ N x d4 ]  I am thinking about resigning at this moment but the game is too alive for me to resign even though I am losing bad!!
 [ Q b3 ]  [ N e5 ] , [ B e4 ]  It's the difference between occupying a square and controlling a square. I couldn't defend it on d3.
 [ e4 ]  [ b5 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N b d2 ]  [ N g4 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N g e5 ]  [ N x e5 ] , [ N x e5 ]  12. ...... [ N x e5 ] - knight trade.
 [ b4 ]  [ Q b3 ]  [ a5 ] , [ B c4 ]  25. Bc4?? - this move condemns me to a Low Draw. Gameknot Analysis recommended cxb4. My opponent then threatens after a rook retreat to defend [ f7 ] a nasty check on [ e3 ] from the Wicked Witch of the West.
 [ K h7 ]  [ f x g7 ]  [ K x g7 ] , [ R f5 ]  White is winning...
 [ K b6 ]  [ g5 ]  [ N f3 + ]  [ K g2 ] , [ N x g5 ]  ...that now [ R g6 ] means I lose a piece and probably the gam.
 [ K x g7 ] , [ a3 ]  Limiting the mobility of black's knight on a6.
 [ B d3 ] , [ B g7 ]  11. ... [ B e6 ] appears to be the main line here. 11. ... [ f4 ] looks like an interesting alternative. From a 1.5 million game search I could only find 8 games. Results 4 3 1 (white wins black wins draws) A good point about 11. ... [ B e6 ] is [ e x f5 ] fails to Bxd5. IMO [ B g7 ] achieves little as it will be a long time before the [ h8 ] - [ a1 ] diagonal "opens up".
 [ Q f6 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ B x d5 ] , [ c x d5 ]  I don't at all mind exchanging minors.
 [ K e2 ]  [ R f5 ]  [ K e3 ]  [ R h5 ]  [ R x g4 ] , [ R x h2 ]  32.[ K e2 ] Rf5! 33.[ K e3 ] Rh5! 34.[ R x g4 ] [ R x h2 ] BCM9k has made steady progress although a win is still far from definite. I'd love to exchange that lame knight for Black’s active bishop here. If I could achieve that a draw would be a realistic possiblity. I was also interested in the usual defensive goal of exchanging off pawns. I felt that I will be able to achieve the classic Rook vs Rook Bishop endgame which is usually a draw although never easy ...
 [ N c7 + ]  [ K d7 ]  [ N a6 ] , [ e4 ]  Now the e-pawn decides.
 [ K d3 ]  [ B x d1 ] , [ R x d1 ]  [ R b1 ] saves material but the king becomes dangerously exposed after [ N b4 + ]  [ d5 ]  [ a6 ]  [ a4 ] , [ N f6 ]  So far my main task is simply to take the pawn on d5. However white has enough to defend it and so it looks like he has the advantage for the opening as I will have to plant my undeveloped knight on [ d7 ] and suffer spacial disadvantages.
 [ c6 ]  [ f4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ N g5 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ B g4 ] , [ Q x g4 ]  !! This sacrifice is very strong this time around. Due to the presence of the [ c6 ] pawn.
 [ O-O ]  [ a6 ]  [ B a4 ]  [ b5 ]  [ B b3 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ c3 ] , [ d6 ]  ? Oops the correct move-order would be 7 ... [ B e7 ] and then 8 ... d6. This allows a position reminiscent of the Two Knights defense.
 [ R d e1 ]  [ B x b3 + ] , [ K d3 ]  Mate in 1.
 [ e5 ]  [ a3 ] , [ N x e4 ]  3. ..... [ N x [ e4 ] ] - hmm this is gonna be like Damiano's Defense in reverse. The main line of Damiano's Defense goes like this. 1. [ e4 ] [ e5 ] 2. [ N f3 ] f6?! 3. Nx[ e5 ] - it is best to decline the sacrifice by playing the Macgregor-Chigorin line with 3. ..... [ Q e7 ] - otherwise if the sac is accepted then this leads to black either losing the exchange losing 5 pawns or Copping Old Matey - do you still wanna accept this sacrifice? Well with colours reversed the Dentist did just that!
 [ B h4 ] , [ Q e8 ]  the [ e7 ] knight can move now.
 [ Q x d8 + ]  [ K x d8 ] , [ c x b5 ]  captures away from the center
 [ R c1 ]  [ R c8 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ N c5 ] , [ O-O ]  castling under pressure...
 [ Q x e4 ]  [ d x e4 + ]  [ K c8 ] , [ R e1 ]  I am a Pawn ahead but winning won't be easy. I will need to centralize my King and keep my Rooks mobile.
 [ g5 ] , [ Q h5 ]  Black fails to find the right way: now the N is pinned.
 [ K a4 ] , [ K c4 ]  The only winning move. Other moves allow the king to escape into a drawn position.
 [ d5 ] , [ g5 ]  Forcing the Knight back to its original square.
 [ b5 ]  [ a x b5 ]  [ a x b5 ]  [ h5 ] , [ K g2 ]  53.[ N a7 ] was a little stronger.
 [ B b5 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ Q f5 + ]  [ K e7 ] , [ R e1 + ]  ...but being able to bring the other R into the game was very tempting.
 [ B d2 ] , [ B x d2 + ]  remy accepts again:)
 [ B x g8 ] , [ O-O-O ]  21. ........ 0-0-0 - black castles queenside but look at the a column I now have a plan of attack which black is completely oblivious to.
 [ B b5 + ]  [ B d7 ]  [ B x d7 + ]  [ Q x d7 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ B e7 ]  I get to keep the pawn.
 [ d5 ]  [ d3 ] , [ d x e4 ]  The opening of the queen's file is to White's advantage. But 9. ... [ d4 ] 10. cx[ d4 ] Nx[ d4 ] 11. Nx[ d4 ] Qx[ d4 ] 12. [ N c3 ] followed by 13. [ B e3 ] would also have involved difficulty for Black.
 [ N x f6 + ]  [ R x f6 ] , [ Q b8 + ]  A fork allowing White to pick up a pawn. However I think that this is a mistake since it leaves White's queen completely out of the game. Over the next few moves Black is able to create all the activity and set tactical problems for White largely because White's queen has become an irrelevance.
 [ N g f6 ] , [ e3 ]  Inviting black to exchange my good dsb for the [ N f6 ] at the cost of opening the h column for my rook. I'm planning to castle queenside. ([ N h5 ] [ B g3 ] NxB hxN).
 [ R x b2 ]  [ Q x b2 ]  [ Q x b2 ]  [ B x b2 ]  [ N x c5 ] , [ R d8 ]  However there is a good chance I will be able to gain the isoloni
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ Q f6 ]  An unusual defense of the KP.
 [ N f4 ] , [ K g3 ]  The decisive error. 32. [ d5 ] would have dropped a pawn but that's much better than the tactic that wins the game next move.
 [ B x f6 ]  [ Q x f6 ] , [ h3 ]  Whites afraid of Bg4.
 [ B x c3 + ] , [ b x c3 ]  8 [ Q x c3 ] [ e5 ] 9 also leads to equality.
 [ R f e8 ] , [ B c2 ]  Trying to weaken the area in front of the kingside while protecting the unprotected b pawn.
 [ b6 ] , [ Q c2 ]  freeing up the second rook and putting some pressure on [ h7 ]  [ R f d1 ] , [ N a5 ]  Attacks the bishop
 [ N x b3 ]  [ N x b3 ]  [ B x f3 + ] , [ K e1 ]  Alekhine's Defense can get tricky very quickly since it seems like such a dumb idea that many players don't run into it often. I don't really fault your lack of opening theory but always remember to develop a solid position rather than running after fleeting hopes. Although the enemy Knight can be attacked don't do it if the attack damages the gradual maturing of your own position. Although your pieces can be defended be willing to retreat if you are facing a substantial counterattack. And above all grasp hold and defend the center with pieces! Get your Knights out early and your Rooks centered. And of course be ever hopeful - in this world you will have tribulation but we follow One who has overcome this world. [John 16:33]
 [ B g5 ] , [ N c4 ]  I proceed to attack the weak black pawns.
 [ d4 ]  [ f x e4 ]  [ B c4 ] , [ N e7 ]  Probably better : 5 ... Qxe5.
 [ R d7 ] , [ N x d8 ]  I didn't want the Black bishop on [ f6 ] so I decided to simply exchange it.
 [ B x f5 ]  [ e x f5 ] , [ d5 ]  he want to control the center
 [ O-O ]  [ B c5 ] , [ R e1 ]  ? While this move does protect White's e pawn it weakens the [ f2 ] which I don't waste time attacking it...
 [ N h3 + ]  [ g x h3 ]  [ Q x e3 + ] , [ K g2 ]  after 19 [ R f2 ] black snags another piece with 19 ... [ f4 ] and ... [ g5 ]  [ Q x d2 + ]  [ R f2 ]  [ Q a5 ]  [ R e2 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ R a e1 ]  [ R a e8 ]  [ f4 ]  [ e x f4 ]  [ B x f4 ]  [ R x e2 + ]  [ R x e2 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ R x e8 ]  [ B x e8 ]  [ c3 ]  [ B c6 + ] , [ K f2 ]  after 28 [ K f1 ] [ Q b6 ] 29 [ b4 ] [ B x c3 ] allows black to win pawns at will.
 [ h6 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ g x f6 ] , [ g3 ]  going for bishop [ g2 ] [ h3 ]  [ R g8 ]  [ h3 ]  [ Q d6 ]  [ N b5 ]  [ Q d7 ]  [ Q d2 ] , [ N b8 ]  OK i admit it i was not even looking at his c pawn....
 [ B x f3 ]  [ N x f3 ] , [ c6 ]  ? What is black doing? His kingside is in trouble.
 [ B d7 ]  [ Q x e7 + ]  [ K c8 ]  [ Q x d7 + ]  [ K b7 ] , [ Q c6 + ]  An interesting match I feel with probably loads of lines available around moves 8 9 10. Please excuse the rather brief analysis. 3..[ N d4 ] looks an cool move for blitz games I may try it.
 [ B x g5 ]  [ N x g5 ] , [ B f5 ]  15. ...... [ B f5 ] - I now decided to force an exchange of lsbs to try and blunt Dave's mating attack still further.
 [ Q x h6 ] , [ b5 ]  I like this move - not only does it open up a path for the bishop it also threatens 10...b4! driving away the only defender of the [ a2 ] pawn
 [ a x b6 ]  [ B c7 ]  [ B d8 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ R a5 ] , [ B x c6 ]  The idea of losing the bishop pair is to make weak the [ c6 ] pawn.
 [ R d1 ]  [ R x d1 + ] , [ B x d1 ]  We exchange off again
 [ Q b3 ]  [ Q a5 + ]  [ N c3 ] , [ B d7 ]  I'm cooked here. If [ B b4 ] Rb8. [ K e7 ] is mortal after NxN bxN [ R b8 ] etc.
 [ B d6 ]  [ N e4 ] , [ B h2 + ]  I thought this was a very unusual attack he played.
 [ g1 = Q + ] , [ K b2 ]  [ N d1 ] would have been better. It is all downhill from here for my opponent.
 [ b5 ]  [ B b3 ]  [ b4 ] , [ N a4 ]  Now white has a huge penetration on my undefended king.
 [ b x a3 ]  [ e ]  [ p ]  [ R x a3 ] , [ a4 ]  Prevent b3. Here I considered my position ugly. The bishop is bad knights have no good square except [ b5 ] (a bit far) [ c4 ] and [ c5 ] are weak square no prospect on the kingside Rooks are disconnected. No harmony.
 [ Q x g1 + ]  [ K x g1 ]  [ R x e2 ]  [ N f1 ] , [ c3 ]  this pawn is now getting dangerous.
 [ Q x f5 + ]  [ Q x f5 ] , [ R x f5 ]  In this position I have a pawn for the exchange but the situation looks pretty bad for black.
 [ N e8 ] , [ B h2 ]  ? A slight inaccuracy blocking the K
 [ f6 ]  [ Q h5 + ] , [ K e7 ]  I thought he would play [ g6 ] but this suits me just fine!
 [ R a7 + ]  [ K d6 ] , [ e7 ]  White can afford to let the N go in the interests of Queening the pawn
 [ N d3 ] , [ Q e7 ]  Looking at this what do you think the best move is? It may not seem like it but there is a trap here to lure the opponent into a losing state.
 [ B c5 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ B b4 ]  Black has moved two pieces two times.
 [ N c3 ] , [ R g8 ]  Looking for a way to counterattack.
 [ b x c6 ]  [ Q h5 ]  [ Q d7 ]  [ B g5 ] , [ g6 ]  Up to this point it's been pretty much basic moves imo and somewhat previously used opening moves. 9. [ g6 ] was the first complete deviation from the Gameknot opening DB.
 [ N g4 ] , [ R e2 ]  23. [ R e2 ] - first the pinned [ f2 ] pawn must be guarded.
 [ b x c6 ] , [ N e4 ]  i saw a very nice trap here i hoped he would fall for [ b x e3 ] r[ x e3 ] [ Q g5 ] and i win the exchange.
 [ Q x g5 ] , [ R d6 x d3 ]  Black decides on a risky course 26 ... Rxd3!?. Simply 26..[ Q x a3 ] is better since 27 [ R a1 ] is met by ...Qb3.
 [ Q e4 ]  [ B b2 ]  [ R a b1 ] , [ B x c3 ]  but I am still down...
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ f4 ] , [ e x f4 ]  White opens with a kingside attack. Black responds by accepting and thus up a pawn. My common thinking here is that advancing the e and f pawns is risky because if white makes a mistake the king is vulnerable. If black makes a mistake black is down a pawn or maybe a piece.
 [ R a d8 ] , [ Q e2 ]  Taking my queen out of harms way.
 [ N b6 ] , [ B b3 ]  The experts recommend 4. ... [ c6 ] to prepare 5. ... [ b5 ] or 5. ... [ Q a5 ] . Alternatively 4. [ B e7 ] is also recommended though generally accepted as inferior to 4. ... c6. As played black's 4th move strayed from my limited opening library so it's off to uncharted territory I go. Well at least I don't have the chart...
 [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ d6 ]  [ e4 ] , [ g6 ]  Here is a basic Modern Benoni formation. Black will develop his "bad" bishop onto [ g7 ] where is exerts tremendous pressure on White's queenside. Then Black often continues with queenside expansion via ..[ a6 ] and ..[ [ b5 ] ] with tactical play along the dark squares. Sometimes Black offers the pawn sacrifice ..[ [ b5 ] ] to open queenside lines (specifically pressuring b2) and sometimes divert the [ N c3 ] from defense of [ e4 ] (allowing ..Nxe4). Black's main problem is space - White has most of it! The cramped nature of Black's position makes it somewhat difficult for him to develop his queenside minor pieces especially the [ c8 ] "problem" bishop ([ d7 ] is best reserved for a knight and [ b7 ] often interferes with a rook on b8). For this reason Black often hopes for an early ..[ B g4 ] pinning the [ N f3 ] to the queen (and preventing the powerful White maneuver Nf3-d2-[ [ c4 ] ] a key theme as a knight on [ [ c4 ] ] places tremendous pressure on Black's [ d6 ] pawn. Indeed so powerful is this plan that White plays an early [ h3 ] in many lines just to stop it!). White's plan is simple - use his massive space advantage to place his pieces on "ideal" squares and enforce the advance e4-[ e5 ] which often initiates kingside attacking possibilities. Black invariably meets this threat with tactics (really the only reason the Benoni is still playable) which make for a very exciting and double-edged game. A quick aside: a move deserving attention is 6..a6!? which prevents White's 8th move and thereby dodges the Flick-Knife attack. In light of White's healthy plus in the Flick-Knife this quirky move is probably worth further investigation. It would be an easy choice if not for White's speedy plan of 7.[ f4 ] g6? 8.e5! and White is crashing through. Alternative variation: 6... a6!?
 [ B e4 ] , [ b6 ]  not giving him any room to attack my pieces
 [ d6 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ Q g4 ]  Hoping to induce h2-[ h3 ] perhaps?
 [ Q a5 ]  [ f3 ]  [ R f c8 ]  [ b3 ]  [ a6 ] , [ N a4 ]  The proper time to offer the Queen exchange. The move ...[ a6 ] left a hole at [ b6 ] the knight threatens to fork the black rooks after the queens are exchanged so Black will have to spend a tempo to protect against the fork.
 [ R x f8 + ]  [ K x f8 ]  [ b7 ] , [ Q e8 ]  black decides not to take the bishop and let the white to make a queen
 [ e6 ]  [ a3 ]  [ N b d7 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ a6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ c5 ]  [ d x c5 ]  [ N x c5 ]  [ Q d4 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ b4 ] , [ e5 ]  attack instead of coming back
 [ c x b5 ]  [ Q g3 ]  [ R f7 ] , [ N f4 ]  woups nice shot.Viewing again [ g6 ] and h5.
 [ f3 ] , [ N f4 ]  ...and bring my knight on the attack...
 [ c x d4 ] , [ R e2 + ]  probably not the best but i knew if he did k[ f1 ] i would do n[ x d4 ] and alls good
 [ b3 ]  [ O-O ] , [ Q c4 ]  Pinning my queen but it doesn't do much.
 [ K x g7 ] , [ b4 ]  gains space with tempo and forces the knight to define it's location either on the king's side or on the queen's side...
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ] , [ c4 ]  Queen's Gambit opening! A tricky one for me personally...
 [ B x e6 ] , [ f x e6 ]  stil down a pawn
 [ c4 ]  [ f5 ] , [ g4 ]  This is the gambit move. It's not a "pure" Krejcik which properly arises after 1. [ d4 ] [ f5 ] 2. [ g4 ] so perhaps this specific configuration should be called the Krejcik Gambit System or (pardon the shameless self-promotion) the "Avocet Gambit." ;-)
 [ B a4 ] , [ b5 ]  This move the Caro Variation of the Ruy Lopez is quite O.K though no opponent against me has ever played it before.
 [ g6 ] , [ Q g3 ]  now the threat is h4-h5. 27... [ Q x d4 ] 28. [ B x g6 ] [ K h8 ] 29. [ h5 ] [ R g8 ] 30. [ Q f3 ] is clearly in white's favor
 [ K c4 ]  [ b6 ] , [ K d5 ]  And again advancing the king.
 [ O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ a3 ] , [ a5 ]  Black looks for queenside space especially for the bishop.
 [ K h8 ] , [ R e1 ]  The f2-pawn is lightly guarded so it looks like a potential soft spot. On the other hand the rook itself is unprotected on [ e1 ] perhaps I could establish control of the e-file. [ R e7 ] and [ R e8 ] both looked playable but I couldn't figure out what to do next so I settled in for a f-file showdown [23. ...[ N e4 ] 24. [ N x e4 ] Bxe4].
 [ N x f6 + ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ B e3 ] , [ B x h4 + ]  bxh4?! Black voluntarily opens the h file for white. White does not mind his king in the center because black has no attack.
 [ Q c2 ] , [ f5 ]  His best attempt to maintain the current position. He has transposed to the Dutch defence but has some problems. Primarily his night needs to be on [ d7 ] not [ [ c6 ] ] with the idea that it swings over to [ f6 ] to support the posted night (it is also preventing the c-pawn from reaching [ [ c6 ] ] where it needs to be).
 [ B g4 ] , [ N f6 ]  how about a 4th time with that bishop while i develope my knight.
 [ e4 ]  [ d6 ]  [ f4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ g6 ]  3. .......... [ g6 ] - this is the Pirc/Robatsch Defense. Black delays countering in the centre and decides to develop his bishop on the flank (g7).
 [ d6 ]  [ B x c6 ] , [ B g4 ]  Now I have an interesting dilemma. I cannot play the desired defence of [ f3 ] because of the pin from the bishop but can probably block with the knight for long enough to play [ d3 ] defending the [ e4 ] pawn and finally allowing my [ c1 ] bishop to get involved. It also leaves open the option of [ N c3 ] but after [ b x c6 ] the knight will have nowhere to develop further so I am not sure if this is a useful move at this stage.
 [ N g6 ]  [ B g3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ a6 ]  Again this is bad.
 [ B e6 ] , [ R x e6 ]  Did you see it? He cannot take the Rook due to [ Q x d7 # ] here the attack becomes unstoppable due to him not being able to defend with anything but his queen.
 [ B d3 ] , [ R f d1 ]  Better for white is: 17.[ R f e1 ] [ e4 ] 18.[ b4 ] [ B b6 ] (not 18. ... [ e x f3 ] which allows white to equalise after 19.[ b x c5 ] [ R d d8 ] 20.Re5).
 [ B e3 ] , [ N x e5 ]  A poor mistake for me to make - got to move the queen now either to [ [ e2 ] ] or f1. I chose [ [ e2 ] ] to leave my back rank open to my rooks if necessary and to attack the pawn on g4.
 [ d x e4 + ]  [ K x e4 ]  [ N f6 + ] , [ K e5 ]  after long and careful thought White came up with this: it is hard to find a better one because Black will have it his way in any variation...
 [ N e5 + ]  [ B x e5 ]  [ Q x e5 ] , [ Q d6 ]  Black offers exchange. I was ok with this but i wanted to make up the pawn defecit first.
 [ N c3 ]  [ Q c6 ]  [ Q e1 + ]  [ B e7 ] , [ R e2 ]  Now that I have the initiative again I tried to make this counterattack. However it wasn't as successful as I hoped. The bishop was well protected.
 [ B b2 ]  [ N x c5 ]  [ e3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B e2 ]  [ R d8 ]  [ O-O ]  [ b6 ] , [ N e5 ]  12.[ N d4 ] (aiming for b5) was much better.
 [ B e3 ] , [ R b7 ]  My opponent wanted to avoid the loss of the rook but in the process he allowed me to play.........
 [ K e7 ] , [ a5 ]  Having said that I now continue the advancement.
 [ R f e1 ]  [ B f8 ]  [ b x c5 ]  [ d x c5 ] , [ c4 ]  This gives White a "go" position ( a dead space at d4); clogs the middle.
 [ e x f4 ]  [ B x f4 ]  [ N d3 ] , [ R f d1 ]  the sharpest: the Queen sacrifice is correct; after Qxb5? [ N x f4 ] [ g x f4 ] [ B c6 ] [ Q c4 ] [ B b5 ] spells a lot of trouble for White...
 [ g4 ] , [ e4 ]  Expected b5. While this isn't exactly a Yugoslav it has enough similarities and his strength is the queen-side.
 [ N g6 ] , [ N f3 ]  Playable also: 10.[ N h3 = ] +/=
 [ Q x d3 ] , [ N x d5 ]  26. ...... [ N x d5 ] - this did not look too bad exchanged off white's dangerous lsb and got rid of my isolated d pawn and seemingly adequately defended Fou Lenoir but .....
 [ e5 ]  [ e4 ] , [ e x f4 ]  2. ...... [ e x f4 ] - the KGA accepted.
 [ c5 ]  [ c3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ B b5 ]  5.Bb5?! First move out of book. I was not prepared for this move. Does White want to trade the versatile knight in this closed position for his strong light bishop which normally goes on the [ d3 ] square? Only about a dozen players over 2100 have played this move. Definitely some advantage for black now. Two best responses are block pin with [ B d7 ] or continue with thematic [ Q b6 ] earlier than normal. I chose [ Q b6 ] thinking it would force the trade or bring more play to the queenside where I have a space advantage. I thought the line would progress 5...[ Q b6 ] 6.[ B x c6 + ] [ b x c6 ] with my side pawn toward the center which would soon continue to pressure d4.
 [ d4 ] , [ b5 ]  orangoutan as black !
 [ B h4 ]  [ N e7 ]  [ e5 ]  [ f x e5 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ B c7 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B e4 ]  [ B x e4 ]  [ R x e4 ]  [ Q e8 ]  [ N a3 ] , [ Q g6 ]  Moving the Q to [ g6 ] allows the [ e7 ] N to hang. Although the [ e4 ] R is also loose White strikes first.
 [ N f3 ]  [ N g e7 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ] , [ R b1 ]  I have seen this played at master level however unless you are 2300 I wouldn't recommend it. Strategically removing the rook from the long diagonal preparing to re route the Queens knight is a sound idea. However you have to be able to check Black's initiative in the center and Queenside at the same time preparing an attack on the Kings wing. In my book this is just too slow. The more popular main line with [ B e3 ] prepares a central advance and also prepares to swap dark squared bishops with [ Q d2 ] and Bh6.
 [ a3 ] , [ B x c3 + ]  White can't retake with the Queen due to the [ d4 ] fork and now his queen side pawns are in bad shape. White is able to get some strong play down the b file but eventually must abandon it to protect his K side.
 [ d6 ] , [ R d8 ]  Only move to prevent 24. [ d4 ]  [ N g5 ] , [ K g7 ]  To prevent 28. [ N f7 ]  [ d7 ]  [ R x d7 ]  [ N e6 + ] , [ K h8 ]  mistake but anyway black had no good choice.
 [ N x g7 + ]  [ K d8 ]  [ Q f6 + ]  [ N x f6 ] , [ B e7 # ]  A well played game and goes to show that material advantage means nothing in the game of chess. Until Black's severe blunders he had a good chance to continue the game maybe win with more solid play. Good effort from both sides though.
 [ R a b1 ] , [ B c3 ]  Pinning the knight.
 [ f x g5 ] , [ B x g5 ]  and attack the Black Queen
 [ R e1 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ N d5 ] , [ B f6 ]  Alekhine has a large spatial advantage. Capablanca however has no exploitable weaknesses.
 [ N f h5 ] , [ B a5 ]  31. [ B a5 ] - reinforcements on the queenside - I have [ B c7 ] in mind piling up on the [ d6 ] pawn. I also plan to put my other rook on [ a1 ] to add fuel to the fire. Dmaestro succumbs under this pressure by waving the white flag!
 [ R x a1 ]  [ N d8 ]  [ Q f6 ]  [ R f8 ]  [ Q g7 ]  [ h5 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ N d c6 ]  [ Q x g6 + ]  [ K d7 ]  [ Q e6 + ]  [ K c7 ]  [ B h6 ]  [ R f e8 ]  [ B f4 + ]  [ K b6 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ N g8 ]  [ Q g6 ]  [ Q b2 ]  [ N d2 ]  [ Q c3 ]  [ N c4 + ]  [ K a6 ]  [ B d2 ]  [ R x e1 + ]  [ B x e1 ] , [ Q x e1 # ]  The final combination simply appeared: but White was too busy trying to maintain an attack with insufficient material and could not watch his position. It would have happened eventually; any attempt to regroup would return the attack and the tempo to Black. Game.
 [ Q h7 ] , [ h3 ]  22. [ h3 ] - to stop Rxh2.
 [ b x a4 ]  [ R x a4 ]  [ N g6 ] , [ c4 ]  This weakens your pawn on b4. The best plan was still to activate the knight on e2. But before you can do that you must challenge Black's control of the f-file by playing your rook to [ f3 ] (via a3).
 [ B c1 ] , [ B f5 ]  Continuing development but relatively better is [ N f6 ] since we know the knight belongs there
 [ h x g6 ] , [ R x g6 ]  Now I'm up material and have plans of doubling rooks on the g-file to continue the attack.
 [ B x a2 ]  [ R x a2 ]  [ K f4 ] , [ R b2 ]  I have to sac my rook for the two pawns and be sure my pawn will queen. This pawn is farther than the d one but taking the latter would have got my rook into the action faster.
 [ b x a6 ]  [ Q d7 + ]  [ K b7 ] , [ Q x a4 ]  Goes forward with his plan now it's gonna be rough. Knight rook queen vs rook rook queen.
 [ a3 ] , [ B b7 ]  Now white is uneasy.
 [ B e8 ] , [ g5 ]  ?? Throwing away the game.
 [ R e1 + ]  [ K f2 ] , [ R e e8 ]  OK this took a bit of risk rem I new white would take my knight I was counting on it and I have hidden my true attentions that’s checkmate now I have the whites King where I want it YES :)
 [ Q e6 ]  [ Q d4 + ]  [ K h2 ]  [ Q b4 ] , [ Q e8 ]  47. [ Q e8 ] - still Glenda refuses to budge from the a column.
 [ Q f6 ] , [ N x c6 ]  White is threatening some mayhem with the possibility of Qh5+. Black would like to keep his queen on the kingside to defend against this threat. This seems like the perfect time to play with black's pawn structure open a file aimed at black's king and clear away a black defender. Besides white is about to be ahead in material so exchanges of pieces now favor white.
 [ Q b6 ] , [ b3 ]  Necessary to prevent queenside incursion.
 [ e4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ c5 ]  A DOUBLE-EDGED SYSTEM...
 [ N x c3 ]  [ b x c3 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ O-O ]  [ f6 ]  [ a4 ]  [ a6 ]  [ N h4 ]  [ f x e5 ]  [ Q h5 + ]  [ K e7 ]  [ N g6 + ] , [ K f7 ]  Here is where the deviation occurs. From this point forward it's almost over. Had 13... [ K d6 ] or even 14...[ K e7 ] then 15...[ K d6 ] I'm up in material but in analyzing the game later I couldn't find any clear and decisive victory as he artificially castles. My only option seemed to be to trade down and exercise piece advantage. Was glad for 14...[ K g8 ] as it effectively ended the game alot could have happened but he was running. What I'm interested is the best response to ...[ K d6 ] ...Kc7. Maybe it is to advance towards endgame.
 [ K f6 ]  [ c3 ]  [ K e5 ] , [ b4 ]  One queenside pawn will promote depending on how black wants to capture. Of course he can chase that pawn and even stop it but that will allow the e-pawn to promote instead.
 [ B x c6 ]  [ f x e3 ] , [ g4 ]  (?!)A very nice interesting idea which gets white the advantage if black does not find the right reply. Actually there are 2 replies of equal strength; black just needs to find the right idea. It is clear right now that both the rook and the knight are hanging but the knight is trapped. So by logic shouldn't we save the rook?
 [ h x g3 ] , [ B c6 ]  I won't break that fortress in two moves so I better defend my side.
 [ B x g5 ] , [ h4 ]  I don't like the black bishop there and I can develop the h-pawn with a tempo. After post-game analysis I think 16. [ B d3 ] would have been much better but 16. [ h4 ] is not a bad move.
 [ K e2 ] , [ B x g4 + ]  Here Black's advantage is +6.66... ;)
 [ K d8 ] , [ R d6 ]  Invading the heart of Black's position.
 [ B d3 + ]  [ K a1 ]  [ e4 ] , [ Q g3 ]  White needs to take action: not sure if this is helping...
 [ N h4 ]  [ Q h5 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ N g e7 ]  [ g3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N e4 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ B x d5 ]  [ R x b2 ]  [ K d2 ]  [ N b4 ]  [ B b3 ]  [ N x c2 ]  [ B x c2 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B c6 ]  [ R a2 ]  [ R b7 ]  [ Q d6 ]  [ f6 ]  [ B d1 ]  [ Q f7 ]  [ f4 ]  [ f x e5 ]  [ Q x e5 ]  [ R f b8 ]  [ K e1 ]  [ R b7 b4 ]  [ R h c2 ]  [ B a4 ]  [ N x a4 ]  [ R b4 b1 ] , [ N c3 ]  i am totally throwing away this game without even trying to
 [ K c2 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ N a5 ]  [ R g2 + ]  [ K d3 ] , [ B x f4 ]  Perhaps Black should bring his other rook and king into the action. Otherwise White sort of has a material advantage.
 [ d x e4 ] , [ R g6 + ]  Now a check and a pawn up.
 [ K f7 ]  [ R c1 ]  [ K e8 ] , [ g4 ]  gains space and blocks the light squares on the king's wing
 [ R b1 ] , [ Q b6 ]  i want to eye in on that f-file pawn.
 [ Q x d6 ]  [ K x h4 ]  [ Q f6 + ]  [ K h3 ]  [ Q x h6 + ]  [ K g2 ] , [ Q h4 ]  As I am well stocked up on tempo I can afford to give a little back in order to get my knight involved. Plus I still have the option of running my d pawn. My heart is pounding audibly.
 [ R h f6 ] , [ R g5 ]  
 [ R f c8 ] , [ N d2 f3 ]  also forced: the stage is set...
 [ R d7 x d3 ]  [ N x c5 ] , [ B b6 ]  (24... [ Q b6 ] 25. [ R x a5 ] [ Q x a5 ] 26. [ N x e6 ] White has a decisive advantage) (24... [ Q x c4 ] 25. [ Q x c4 ] [ B x c4 ] 26. [ N x d3 ] [ B b6 + ] 27. [ N f2 ] [ B x f1 ] 28. [ K x f1 ] White has a decisive advantage)
 [ B d5 ]  [ R b8 ]  [ e5 ] , [ e6 ]  Time to chase away a bishop.
 [ O-O-O ]  [ O-O-O ] , [ B b4 ]  That pawn on [ b3 ] leaves the dark squares weak. Because of this I abandon the [ f6 ] idea and get ready to move my pieces to the queen side for an attack.
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ d6 ]  Defends [ e5 ] and allows light bishop to develop; blocks development of dark bishop and loses some time as it is not developing a piece. Better [ N c6 ] or [ N f6 ] (Petroff's defense).
 [ N a3 ] , [ d5 ]  to be in the center.
 [ R x e5 ] , [ N g4 ]  ?? Kicking my Re5. I'm presuming that fatigue combined with tempo gain obsession led to this mistake. But this is yet another blunder as I'm going to win a piece. Just about anything else was better then this move. For me just that hyperfocus and fixation was enough to make a mistake like this. When however you add fatigue yes I'm understand where Ted comes from as I used to cope with that pattern. In fact the week before I played two games. The second one was annotated where I applied what I learned from the N+B mate. But in the game before my play was horrible and wound up making terrible mistake. Therefore I should not have won that first game. With best play I should've gotten a draw at best. I was very lucky that Ted didn't see the mistake and it was then that I was able to figure out and force a win. But the mistake was directly caused by only getting 6.5 hours of sleep the night prior. Not only that but I had a cup of coffee before the chess club and started getting tired shortly there after. This led to a mistake in the game after but was somehow able to find enough energy to apply what I learned about how to mate with N+B.
 [ N c6 ] , [ d x c5 ]  White gives up what remains of his centre but does he really want an isolated pawn on d4?
 [ Q d3 ]  [ c4 ]  [ Q f3 ]  [ c3 + ]  [ K e3 ]  [ K d7 ]  [ Q g4 + ]  [ N e6 ]  [ R h7 ] , [ R c e8 ]  Moving the rook here doesn't help protect the knight plus the rook will be lost by an [ N f6 + ] fork. White sees this on move 46.
 [ Q c2 ] , [ Q x f7 + ]  There was no way Black could've defended this.
 [ b x c3 ]  [ B x c3 ] , [ Q c7 ]  losing more tempo: White is a full light piece ahead...
 [ R x e3 ]  [ d x e3 ] , [ Q f1 ]  Black now have just two pawns more then white but white is lost in this position
 [ Q d5 ]  [ B x c6 + ] , [ Q x c6 ]  Th black queen is exposed but menaces [ g2 ] and h1.
 [ K d6 ]  [ N x g6 ]  [ K e6 ]  [ N f8 + ]  [ K e7 ]  [ N g6 + ]  [ K f7 ]  [ N h8 + ]  [ K f6 ]  [ K e2 ]  [ g6 ]  [ K d3 ]  [ K g7 ]  [ N x g6 ]  [ K x g6 ]  [ K e4 ]  [ B a7 ]  [ f4 ]  [ B x f2 ]  [ K f3 ]  [ B x h4 ]  [ f5 + ] , [ K x f5 ]  I was dreaming of victory. At this point I realised the truth. This is the wrong bishop. I need a light squared bishop. Whites king can never be forced out of the corner.
 [ N b5 ]  [ B x b7 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ Q x a6 ] , [ B x e5 ]  This is my plan to capture white's valuable knight and followup move my rook in [ g8 ] to help my queen
 [ Q a5 ]  [ R x c2 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ R b2 + ]  [ K a1 ]  [ f6 ]  [ R b1 ]  [ R d2 ]  [ Q a8 + ]  [ K h7 ]  [ Q a5 ]  [ B e5 + ]  [ R b2 ] , [ Q f1 # ]  
 [ N x a7 ] , [ g4 ]  The white knight has limited options and can then be threatened by my dsb
 [ d5 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ c5 ]  Black has a nice pawn duo in the center.
 [ R x a2 ] , [ R a1 ]  simplifying to give credit to my bishop
 [ R a6 ] , [ R x a6 ]  Up a pawn and with 2 B's vs. 2 Knights on an open board I'm definitely not averse to exchanging major pieces.
 [ N e2 ]  [ N h5 ]  [ g3 ] , [ c5 ]  further blockade of the center.
 [ N d5 ] , [ f x e4 ]  Expecting NxN QxN [ Q d5 ]  [ N x e7 + ]  [ Q x e7 ] , [ N d2 ]  Expectied [ Q d5 ] this retreat seems passive given the material deficit.
 [ N c5 ]  [ N c2 ]  [ f5 ]  [ e x f5 ] , [ B x f5 ]  Black has new hanging pawns: d6+[ e5 ] Alternative variation: [Instead of] 14... [ R x f5 ] 15. [ b4 ] [ N d7 ] 16. [ B g4 ] $16
 [ e x f3 ]  [ g x f3 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ d6 ] , [ N f d5 ]  
 [ N x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ Q x d4 ] , [ N c3 ]  At this point feeling pressured although game is fairly even still
 [ K g7 ]  [ K g3 ] , [ K f7 ]  Tightening the middle.
 [ h6 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ R a c8 ]  [ f3 ]  [ B h7 ] , [ g4 ]  Launching the pawn's storm. Without the Qs and the queenside closed it looks as a good attacking prospect.
 [ g4 ] , [ Q f7 ]  do not know what i was thinking should have went [ R b7 ] followed by BISHOP at [ d5 ]  [ N h6 ] , [ Q h5 ]  i am totally blind to winning moves not looking around
 [ B x a3 ]  [ R c4 ] , [ b5 ]  attacking the rook and creating more space for the King by closing the b-file
 [ K f2 ] , [ e5 ]  Creativity at full power: 21. e5! Although it may seem like a natural move to simply develop the LSB to [ e6 ] and connect the rooks there is a deeper more devious purpose to this push: 22...Qxe3! is now being threatened after which Black wins decisively even if the king retreats: [Dummy move 22. a5] 22...[ Q x e3 ] (23. Kxe3?? Bc5#)(23. [ K f1 ] Rd2!-+) 23. [ K e1 ] - and black can proceed with several plans: 23...[ b5 ] to open the queenside 23...[ e4 ] to open the center 23...B[ e6 ] to develop and threaten [ c4 ] etc. It's all losing for White.
 [ c x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ] , [ N x d5 ]  Bad move by me As it helps blacks development. Better was 8.[ B d3 ]  [ Q x f3 ]  [ Q x f3 ]  [ g x f3 ] , [ g6 ]  Bad move. All it does it not develop and weakens his black squares. [ B d6 ] was better
 [ c4 ]  [ d x c4 ]  [ d x c4 ]  [ Q x d8 + ]  [ N x d8 ] , [ N d4 ]  [ B x c4 ] is best where at least Black's queenside pawns are fractured.
 [ B h5 ]  [ g4 ]  [ B g6 ] , [ c4 ]  always a problem in the Alekhine: the Knight losing tempo...
 [ N e4 ] , [ B b4 + ]  [ N x e4 ] followed by [ B b4 + ] is a good alternative. So are [ B g4 ] [ B f5 ] and Be7.
 [ d x e6 ]  [ R x e6 + ]  [ K d3 ]  [ R d7 + ]  [ K c3 ] , [ R e2 ]  Now entering the second row for strong pressure. As we can see having the rook on [ b2 ] would have been strongly advantageous for white.
 [ B a3 ] , [ N a4 ]  I felt that 17. [ b x a3 ] [ R x c3 ] would leave me with more problems than I wanted.
 [ d5 ] , [ c4 ]  [ c4 ] is a good move.
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ a6 ]  [ B a4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B d6 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ O-O ]  [ c3 ]  [ b5 ]  [ B b3 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ d3 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ N b d2 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ N f1 ]  [ R b8 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ B x e3 ]  [ N x e3 ]  [ N a5 ]  [ N g5 ]  [ N x b3 ]  [ a x b3 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N f5 ]  [ h6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ Q x d5 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ R b d8 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ Q x d1 ]  [ R e x d1 ]  [ R x d1 + ]  [ R x d1 ]  [ B x f3 ]  [ g x f3 ]  [ R x e5 ]  [ R d8 + ]  [ K h7 ]  [ N e3 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ R d4 ]  [ R e7 ]  [ R d6 ]  [ R e6 ]  [ R d2 ]  [ g5 ]  [ h4 ]  [ g x h4 ]  [ R d4 ]  [ K g6 ]  [ K g2 ]  [ N g8 ]  [ R g4 + ]  [ K h7 ]  [ R x h4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ K g3 ]  [ K g6 ]  [ R d4 ]  [ N h5 + ]  [ K h4 ]  [ N g7 ]  [ R g4 + ]  [ K h7 ]  [ R f4 ]  [ f6 ]  [ R e4 ]  [ a5 ]  [ R d4 ]  [ R e5 ]  [ f4 ]  [ N f5 + ]  [ N x f5 ]  [ R x f5 ]  [ R d7 + ]  [ K g6 ]  [ K g3 ]  [ b4 ]  [ R d2 ]  [ R c5 ]  [ K h3 ]  [ h5 ] , [ K h4 ]  From here the plan begins to take shape. I have 2 options with the f and b pawns.
 [ e x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ B x d5 ] , [ Q x d5 ]  ...and I get the trade I was searching. I just hope I haven't developed her too early!
 [ e6 ]  [ e4 ] , [ B b4 ]  Playing [ a4 ] does create a hole on [ b5 ] which Black exploits.
 [ Q g4 ] , [ B e6 ]  Black is really going after that Queen. That black bishop either has a crush or a hatred! Things are starting to get a little heated for her now. She better watch out.
 [ R x c3 ] , [ B x c3 ]  26. ..... [ B x c3 ] - hmmph - I am now a piece ahead but Gameknot Analysis does not like [ B x c3 ] please refer to the link for further detail. I guess while white has a dsb and the queens are on the board there is a possibility of Henry being checkmated by [ Q g7 # ] so I must be a little careful here.
 [ N c3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N g5 ] , [ K e8 ]  [ B e6 ] could have been a solution but I didn't like my pawn structure at all after [ N x e6 ] fxe6. It's already time to think about the endgame.
 [ B x b2 ]  [ N d2 ] , [ d6 ]  Ok what? BxR! BxR! The rook is worth five (5) points the bishop a mere three. The reason is that the rook can cover the entire board while black's black bishop is blind to the white squares. In that respect a bishop is worth about half a rook. We give it 3/5ths the value.
 [ R g1 + ]  [ K f8 ] , [ B x e3 ]  The Black resigned. For me it was a very beautiful and rewarding game.
 [ K b2 ] , [ Q c3 # ]  Mate. I think the key mistake in this game on White's part was move number twenty when he moved the pawn to try and block my Bishop from leaving but which ended up allowing me to demolish the pawn defenses around the king and open up a path for my Queen and DSB to force a mate whilst supporting each other and my LSB to block the one escape route for the King in this situation whereas I was able to mate because I set up an advantageous position for myself by exploiting an opening in White's defenses.
 [ Q e6 ]  [ f4 ]  [ e x f4 ]  [ B x f4 ]  [ R x b2 ]  [ R x h6 ]  [ R x h6 ]  [ g x h6 ]  [ Q f6 ]  [ Q g4 ] , [ R x c2 ]  Attacking the [ a1 ] Rook and setting up an attack on white's King.
 [ d x c4 ]  [ B x c3 ] , [ B x c3 ]  white now has a weak doublepawn although he is still one pawn ahead. (5 exd5)
 [ N d7 ]  [ b4 ]  [ O-O ] , [ a4 ]  More space on the queenside. Now my opponent is gasping for air. Note that this position is not necessarily good for me as this position is so closed that I cannot make any progress.
 [ d x c4 ]  [ B x c4 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ B b2 ]  Retreating to [ b2 ] is preferable here as the bishop preserves his influence on the long diagonal. On 10.[ B g3 ] Black may consider exchanging his knight on [ f6 ] for it (after Nf6-h5xg3) which would immobilize White's kingside and weaken his center pawns.
 [ Q f3 ] , [ Q b8 ]  to bring the queen back in to the action
 [ B x a3 ]  [ Q x a3 ]  [ Q e2 ]  [ c x d3 ] , [ c x d3 ]  [ Q x d3 ] leaves a very weak pawn behind. While white might want to trade rooks this would of course be disastrous because [ R x a1 ] [ Q x a1 ] [ Q f1 ] ([ Q e1 ] [ Q x e1 ] [ N x e1 ] d2) [ Q x f1 ] [ K x f1 ] [ x c2 ]  [ Q d1 ] , [ N g4 ]  Getting the final piece involved in the attack while simultaneously covering [ e5 ]  [ Q c1 ] , [ Q c3 ]  The threat [ Q c8 ] could be countered with [ N e3 ] [ Q a6 ] or [ K h7 ] but each of these moves would give up some initiative as white's queen could become a menace behind black's pieces.
 [ h6 ]  [ N x f7 ]  [ K x f7 ]  [ B c4 + ] , [ d5 ]  Giving a pawn back for development.
 [ R d1 ]  [ R a d8 ] , [ K h1 ]  Partos has no good moves. Now Holm secures a decisive material advantage.
 [ R x a2 ] , [ c3 ]  There isn´t much to do. Ya no habia mucho que hacer
 [ B d6 ] , [ B g3 ]  ?!!? hmmmmmmm... i would take what about you?
 [ b4 ] , [ Q x b4 ]  I didn't expect him to give me a free pawn. At least he avoided any exchanges.
 [ N c3 ] , [ h6 ]  It's allright for Joe to play this as we saw in that lecture. But it will cause damage if the opponent doesn't develop. In fact TA as a moral to his Q sac said something that if they played foolish (which he means) undeveloping moves like him there will be consequences.
 [ K h7 ]  [ R c4 ]  [ Q h4 ] , [ g3 ]  33. [ g3 ] - shoo go away Wicked Witch of the West shoo! Nice if he could play Qxh2?? here!
 [ R b2 ]  [ Q a4 ]  [ B d1 ]  [ Q d7 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ N e7 ]  Getting another move involved in the offense while he's playing around with a defense.
 [ R c2 ]  [ a5 ] , [ b5 ]  37 ........... b5! - Ion rightly declines the exchange of his b pawn for white's isolani a pawn. This way Ion you can double up on the c pawn and if that falls you have two healthy passers on the b and c files.
 [ B d3 ] , [ R x d5 ]  Pinned bishop. This dance is really interesting and funny. A pity my opponen blundered here.
 [ g4 ] , [ d6 ]  building my defense up
 [ K e3 ]  [ R a2 ] , [ f2 ]  ?? Another blunder that makes this a hundred times more difficult to win if infact there exsists a win at all.
 [ B b5 + ]  [ B d7 ]  [ B x d7 + ]  [ Q x d7 ]  [ e x d5 ] , [ N x d5 ]  A couple exchanges liven things up a bit.
 [ a x b5 ]  [ a x b5 ]  [ R a7 ] , [ d4 ]  30. [ d4 ] - I have been contemplating getting rid of my backward doubleton on the d column for several moves only Fou Lenoir has been pinned on the e column. Now the rook moving to [ a2 ] has relieved it so some exchanges now take place.
 [ R c4 ] , [ R e c8 ]  24. ..... [ R c8 ] - defends Henry but this will fail later on.
 [ N g6 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ R x e1 + ] , [ Q x e1 ]  24. [ Q x e1 ] - the rooks have been traded off but it is difficult to see which player has the edge here.
 [ N c4 ]  [ B x c4 ] , [ b x c4 ]  ...dxc5?! 29. [ a x b5 ] [ c x b5 ] 30. d5! and White has a big initiative.
 [ N c3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N e5 ]  [ Q c7 ] , [ N b5 ]  '?!' - White harasses the Black queen. His knights give an imposing impression but are they really that dangerous? If the knights don't accomplish anything concrete or establish more permanent outposts (specifically the [ b5 ] knight) they will lose a tempo in retreat which may allow Black to improve his position with tempo. Also shouldn't White be worrying about his [ c1 ] bishop which is blockaded by pawns? It seems White has abandoned the natural freeing plan of e3-[ e4 ] (supported by pieces) in favor of this (dubious) knight-harassment scheme. A better plan is [ c x d4 ] followed by [ R e1 ] aiming at e3-e4.
 [ e4 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ B x e4 ] , [ Q x d1 + ]  Oops white just gave away a piece with 13. Bxe4?. Normally I don't like exchanging queens against a player significantly below my rating; I prefer to keep things complicated. But this gains a piece and combined with white's wrecked queenside which is sure to cough up at least a pawn it should be more than enough to begin simplifying and heading for a certain win.
 [ Q b6 ] , [ R x e8 ]  Or RxB NxR [ R h7 ] recovering the piece.
 [ N x h4 ]  [ Q x h4 ]  [ R a d1 ]  [ d4 ]  [ B x e6 ] , [ R x e6 ]  Bye bye light square bishops.
 [ f5 ]  [ g6 ] , [ N e2 ]  Now black's knight is in big trouble. White may be up 1 point after the exchange. I will stall white and try to gain position by capturing white's rook.
 [ N f3 ] , [ N f6 ]  Following the database.
 [ N h6 ]  [ Q g5 ] , [ f6 ]  Not sure about this move either.
 [ N c6 ] , [ Q x e2 ]  19. ..... [ Q x e2 ] - Glenda gleefully pulls that pawn minus back for me. The Wicked Witch of the West goes to [ c1 ] to defend her bishop but this allows Glenda to take a second pawn on d3. I am now a pawn up mwhhaaha!
 [ N c5 ]  [ K g6 ]  [ K g2 ]  [ R h4 ]  [ N d3 ]  [ K g5 ] , [ K g3 ]  I was not sure of the best way to proceed in these close quarters.
 [ d x c4 ] , [ B x c4 ]  This keeps material even and pins the [ f7 ] pawn. My d-pawn is isolated (no friendly pawns on adjacent files) and on a half open file of my opponent. I will need to generate activity and avoid minor piece exchanges (this is what the owner of an isolated pawn should be thinking) or move 7. [ c4 ] will prove to be incorrect.
 [ N b d7 ] , [ h3 ]  I opted for a slow London thematic building moves.
 [ e4 ] , [ e6 ]  this follows the French defence.
 [ B x f6 ]  [ Q x f6 ] , [ c x d5 ]  Winning a pawn and at the same time rapidly liquidating the centre
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ Q f6 ]  Horrible. 2... N-[ Q B3 ] or 2... P-[ K3 ] make much more sense than using the Q.
 [ N b d7 ]  [ e4 ] , [ N e5 ]  Making a show of the bad placement of the queen and looking to make threats to the king.
 [ h4 ] , [ N f6 ]  i did my horse there because that was the best move
 [ N x e4 ] , [ B b7 ]  Oops now what? The knightly fellow is tired of running which would have bee the proper choice of action.
 [ R x d1 + ] , [ K x d1 ]  Unfortunately there was no way to threat [ B g4 + ] (for RxR) because te R would be the B's killer.
 [ R e1 ]  [ N x c3 ]  [ b x c3 ] , [ Q f6 ]  13. ....... Qf6! My queenside pawns have been busted and the Wicked Witch of the West is homing in on them!
 [ e4 ] , [ N e8 ]  Black doesn't want the [ f6 ] knight pinned with [ B g5 ]  [ O-O ] , [ B a6 ]  Black brings pressure on the [ c4 ] pawn
 [ N b x d4 ]  [ Q d7 ] , [ Q b3 ]  14. [ Q b3 ] - oooh that nasty Witch! Yup the Wicked Witch of the West is eyeing up my [ b2 ] and [ e6 ] pawn. One of these will soon drop off.
 [ e4 ] , [ e5 ]  We each started off with a king's pawn opening
 [ Q g5 + ] , [ K f2 ]  I will shield my king and then you'll see...
 [ R e8 ] , [ Q g3 ]  G7 is not defended white applies alittle pressue
 [ Q x g3 ] , [ h x g3 ]  Looking at the position now I felt I was in with a chance. Although the material imbalance isn't too great black has three isolated pawns and his rooks are very limited in mobility his best chance is to open the h file but he can't force that. I have doubled pawns though I don't feel they are a massive weakness and my queen is nicely placed
 [ B x f1 ]  [ Q x f1 ]  [ Q x d5 ] , [ R x b4 ]  Now Black wants to put his Queen on [ e6 ] to keep the [ Q h3 ] threat going while clearing the square for d5. Even the position is somewhat equal I still prefer Black easier to play especially with limited time.
 [ R a1 ] , [ R c4 c2 ]  at this point White resigned: still having 1:41 on the clock; Black had 4:20 left...
 [ g6 ]  [ R f3 + ] , [ B f5 ]  This is closing up and I can't see it easy to win. I'm looking for something to alter the equilibrium... maybe...
 [ R b4 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ R b5 ] , [ R b1 ]  Preparing an [ a4 ] push gaining even more space and soon black will be drowning in it's own mess
 [ N x e6 ]  [ f x e6 ]  [ Q h5 + ]  [ K d7 ]  [ Q f7 + ]  [ B e7 ] , [ Q x e6 + ]  mate is on its way!
 [ d6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ d3 ]  Just wanted to play a simple opening and not a rip roaring open game.
 [ B g7 ]  [ d4 ]  [ d6 ]  [ h3 ] , [ h6 ]  White's position is already a bit cramped; black's king-side pawn chain is quite strong.
 [ c5 ] , [ Q f4 ]  !? [ R e7 ] is inevitable this move seeks to allow [ c x b4 ] in exchange for [ N e4 ] or even just [ Q x b4 ] should be fine.
 [ f6 ]  [ K e3 ]  [ K d6 ] , [ K d3 ]  Now for the key two moves ...
 [ N c4 ] , [ Q b3 ]  Queen pins the black queen or would lose the [ c4 ] knight.
 [ N f3 ] , [ B x e4 ]  ...which is what I do here. I decided that every pawn counts so I accept it to give me an advantage which proves to be crucial in the endgame.
 [ B e6 ] , [ R e2 ]  23. Re2. Looking to challenge the c file and at the same time defend my a pawn. - Joanne
 [ Q e3 ]  [ Q c8 + ] , [ K e4 ]  there is a lot of ways to go on ttacking searching the mate is [ R g4 ] the best ?
 [ N c6 ] , [ R a e1 ]  This move pretty much seals my fate as it loses my dsb
 [ N d5 ] , [ f4 ]  sacrificing one wing pawn to advance further my central pawns
 [ e6 ] , [ d4 ]  White is happy to build an advantage in space.
 [ B c6 ]  [ g x h5 ]  [ N x h5 ]  [ b4 ]  [ a6 ] , [ a4 ]  An admirable display of energy but after 22...[ B x a4 ] 23 [ R c7 ] [ B b5 ] 24 [ R x b7 ] O-O Black reduces the tension and gains counterplay. Taking the pawn could even be dangerous for White after 25 [ B x b5 ] [ a x b5 ] 26 [ R x b5 ] Ra2+. For this reason I prefer 22 [ K e3 ] restricting Black's knight and if 22...O-O then 23 [ R g5 ] [ g6 ] 24 [ R c g1 ] [ N g7 ] 25 h5! or if 24...[ K h8 ] 25 Bxg6! fx[ g6 ] 26 Rx[ g6 ] [ R f7 ] 27 [ N g5 ] and wins.
 [ g6 ]  [ Q c2 ]  [ N e7 ]  [ d x c5 ] , [ b x c5 ]  Trying to control the b or d file
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ a6 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N d e2 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ f3 ] , [ B e7 ]  Sicilian Najdorf 1. [ e4 ] [ c5 ] 2. [ N [ f3 ] ] [ d6 ] 3. [ d4 ] cx[ d4 ] 4. Nx[ d4 ] [ N f6 ] 5. [ N c3 ] [ a6 ] 6. [ f3 ] [ e5 ] 7. [ N d e2 ] [ B e6 ] 8. [ B e3 ] [ B e7 ]  [ O-O ]  [ a3 ]  [ b5 ]  [ f4 ] , [ B g4 ]  black offers a trade of bishop for knight here I am just looking to clear out the middle hoping I can activate my bishop and queen soon.
 [ K c7 ] , [ B x d6 + ]  The computer analysis doesn't really like this and prefers [ N e5 ] but it's one of those situations where there's a "technically accurate" best way of doing something and a "not so accurate but easy for a human" way of doing something the latter being less risky.
 [ B f5 ]  [ c x d6 ]  [ c x d6 ]  [ N b5 ]  [ B c2 ]  [ R x d6 ]  [ Q e7 ] , [ Q g6 + ]  a complete blunder this is bad
 [ B g4 ] , [ f3 ]  This is a poor move from white for a number of reasons. Firstly it pushes my bishop to [ h5 ] where I wanted it anyway secondly it weakens the kingside pawn structure if white castles on that side. Finally it restricts the movement of the [ g5 ] knight it's only safe spot is now [ h3 ] Better was [ B e2 ]  [ B h5 ] , [ g4 ]  weakens the white pawn structure even further
 [ N x h3 + ]  [ K h1 ]  [ R f1 + ]  [ K h2 ] , [ Q d2 + ]  This is where the game hangs in limbo...
 [ N c3 ]  [ d6 ] , [ N d5 ]  A very good move. The knight occupies an excellent square where it causes disruption to the movement of the black pieces. Note the influence on the squares that the black queen would have been able to use.
 [ R c b1 ]  [ B c2 ]  [ R b c1 ]  [ B b3 ]  [ R c b1 ]  [ B c2 ] , [ R b c1 ]  At this point I analyzed [ R c8 ] looking for some phantom to save me. But no. If NxN RxB ok. But if Nxb? [ Q b3 ] ok. But if [ N e2 ] I had nothing. Sad but true.
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ Q x d4 ] , [ N c6 ]  The previous game against a different opponent I hung a minor piece by pure Tom foolery. I didn't want to make that mistake.
 [ h6 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ Q x f6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ e3 ] , [ N d7 ]  I was afraid of white going for minority attack ([ a3 ] [ b4 ] then b5) and wanted to have the option of moving my knight to [ c4 ] after white played b4.
 [ f4 ]  [ N b3 ] , [ d5 ]  I hope everybody enjoy the annotation that I just made. Please feel free to make comments or send me a private message however you feel like doing. From here on out I'll let you play the rest of the game out and let you decide whether I should have play the game out or was smart of me to offer a draw. Hopefully my opponent would definitely look at this game and give his point of view as well.
 [ d5 ]  [ e5 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ d4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ B b4 + ]  [ B d2 ]  [ Q a5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N e7 ]  [ a3 ]  [ B x c3 ]  [ B x c3 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ h3 ]  [ B f5 ] , [ g4 ]  Too many pawn moves by White
 [ g x f4 ] , [ B d6 ]  A way to [ c1 ] and the other vulnerable chain.
 [ B g2 ]  [ c5 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ] , [ e x d5 ]  11. [ e x d5 ] - pawn trade.
 [ h6 ]  [ B x e7 ] , [ B x e7 ]  I think that ...[ N x e7 ] is better since it deals with the problem of a wayward knight and put immediate pressure on the white bishop
 [ b x c6 ] , [ f4 ]  Aah. the expected move is made. The double duty on [ f4 ] to be exploited.
 [ R x a2 + ]  [ K x a2 ]  [ g8 = Q ] , [ R x g8 ]  Forced.
 [ e5 ]  [ N h5 ]  [ B e3 ] , [ b5 ]  I did expect the bishop to move here so black could develop th knight via [ d7 ]  [ B d3 ] , [ a5 ]  Queen side storm am going to put my king away and complete my initial development
 [ f x e5 ]  [ Q h5 + ]  [ g6 ] , [ Q x e5 + ]  double attack!!!! only possible due to my space advantage. not possible if the knight were still on c6.
 [ e x d4 ]  [ N g2 ]  [ N g6 ] , [ e5 ]  Black has [ N g6 ] P[ d6 ] and [ Q f6 ] all ready and able to pounce on this piece protected only by Qh2. Why move it?
 [ N x e5 ]  [ f4 ] , [ N g6 ]  [ N e c6 ] is the mainline.
 [ c3 ]  [ R b8 ]  [ c4 ]  [ O-O ]  [ R f e1 ]  [ R f d8 ]  [ g4 ]  [ R b c8 ]  [ f4 ]  [ h6 ]  [ h4 ] , [ R d7 ]  The position is favouring me so far but you'll never know if I'll blunder!!
 [ b3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ B g2 ] , [ B b7 ]  I think [ d5 ] is better than wasting a tempo
 [ R x f6 + ] , [ e x f6 + ]  CHECK??? Blast!! Now he moves first and worse my King is stuck for mobility. Ahhhh my failure to see ahead clearly has cost me.
 [ N f7 ] , [ B g7 ]  If the Rmoves Qxh7. Maybe the sac was not completely unsound.
 [ N c1 ] , [ R f c6 ]  I focus my fire on the Knight.
 [ N c4 ] , [ Q x c4 ]  I take back with the queen because I'm not done pressuring whites king White has very little to defend with the pawn on [ c2 ] is more of a hindrance than a help.
 [ B e7 ] , [ f4 ]  This is more aggressive than and statistically slightly superior to 8. 0-0 if my memory serves me correctly.
 [ N x e3 ] , [ f x e3 ]  splitting my pawns into 3 groups of 2 and opening up the K defenses
 [ N b d2 ] , [ B b7 ]  Looking for play along the a8-[ h1 ] diagonal which is very common when playing b6. At this point I was going to go face the Queens Indian for sure.
 [ N x d4 ]  [ Q x d4 ] , [ O-O ]  19. 0-0 - Delta castles but now I bring myself back in the lead material wise by firstly initiating a queen trade on c3.
 [ K d7 ]  [ g4 ] , [ R a4 ]  Black's queenside pawns are untouchable because the follow-up Rook exchanges will end badly for me.
 [ O-O ] , [ B x d2 ]  Why the exchange? Black gets the opportunity to exchange of Bishop for Bishop rather than Bishop for Knight also the Queen's Knight will be less aggressively placed on d2.
 [ B g6 ]  [ c3 ]  [ c x d4 ] , [ N x d4 ]  maybe better was cxd4.
 [ e6 + ] , [ K x e6 ]  this again changed my plans but for the better... I was looking at the idea of the knight sac on [ g5 ] when I remembered an idea from the american grandmaster Nakumura... an clearance/attraction sac that opened lines on the king . As well it weakened the center and the queen side.
 [ d5 ] , [ e3 ]  I had annotated in the same time i played the moves. I don't move the pieces to work visualization i don't use a computer so all can be totally wrong. ______ About analysis the game in post-mortem i try to look : __1.opening Who know the most theoretical moves ? if not me i have to work the opening. __ 2. Middle game Did i seen the opponent threat on each moves ? Did i had a plan ? __ 3.Ending Did i had a plan ? Did i know the technique needed ? __ 4.Other Where is the/a turn of the game Find my mistakes (strategy ? tactics ? ) and study the weakness. ? Which move i would like to take back ?

 [ N c3 ] , [ R d c8 ]  Once again I move a rook to take over an open file and to scare the queen away.
 [ R x b3 ] , [ R a c1 ]  Strong - white wrenches the c file from me.
 [ R x c2 ]  [ R x c2 ]  [ R a3 ]  [ K e1 ]  [ K c6 ]  [ K d2 ]  [ e5 ]  [ d x e5 ] , [ f x e5 ]  White has no hope of holding the c pawn; he can only regroup and hope for a draw!
 [ b x c3 ] , [ B x c2 ]  thewrongreason: My vote is for 13.[ B e2 ] Even if we don't play that I think that getting our [ B f1 ] into play is very important. As I think that we should focus on castling short. Then we can focus on something like [ R e1 ] later on where the R will be in a dangerous spot. redfoxrising: few ideas [ b c4 ] protects p[ d5 ] to allow castling.... ------------------------------------ [ N e5 ] to attack the center for a better outpost position [ K d6 ] unlikely but … then [ N x f7 ] ch [ N e5 ] then I suspect her to reply [ N d7 ] opposed to [ N a6 ] on the rim. -------------------------------------- [ K d2 ] gets us closer to linking our Rooks if we decide not to castle and immediately attacks the LSB limiting it relocate to [ a4 ] [ e4 ] [ f5 ] g6. supersparksky: 13.[ K d2 ] for me Queens are off so best position for Kings are centre board thewrongreason: I generally wouldn't want to play something like this since it's not quite an endgame yet. And we haven't castled. But I change my vote to 13.[ K d2 ] because of what Dave just posted. redfoxrising: I agree with 13 [ K d2 ] my vote will be 13. [ K d2 ]  [ K d2 ] , [ B f5 ]  thewrongreason: Unless Dave thinks otherwise my vote for now is 14.Bd3. I feel that our [ B f1 ] is less then active then Janets [ B f5 ] since we're undeveloped. So my idea behind this move is to exchange which I feel would benefit us. redfoxrising: Move 14 suggestions few move suggestions... [ K e3 ] stay move up as our Queens are off the board! [ B d3 ] as Joe suggested will link our Rooks then get then to open files. Not sure if exchanging is a benefit to us at this point might lead to a draw. [ N e5 ] to get a better outpost supersparksky: Lets take charge of the e-file first 14.[ R e1 + ] archduke_piccolo: I'm easy... ... except that I'd rather keep the bishops on. So I'm not keen on 14.[ B d3 ] though it is quite playable. 14.Re1ch [ K f6 ] (say) 15.[ N e5 ] looks OK for White. But I'd be happy enough with 14.[ N [ d4 ] ] or Bc4. Even [ B e2 ] has its points. thewrongreason: Well I like to agree with ION but I would not object to 14.[ R e1 + ] due to what Dave mentioned. By I change my vote to 14.[ B d3 ] redfoxrising: I'll support 14. Re1ch Go for the e-file My vote 14. Re1ch thewrongreason: Wait I misread ION didn't say 14.[ B d3 ] actually. He said 14.[ N [ d4 ] ] or 14.Bc4. And of those 2 moves I'd say 14.[ N [ d4 ] ] which is my vote. If I didn't see the point I'd agree with Re1ch but bringing the N to [ d4 ] attacks the B. But having said that the only other move I'd take into consideration would be checking on e1. My real question is where do we go after checking with the R?
 [ K c2 ]  [ R x d4 ]  [ Q e5 ] , [ R c4 + ]  With many tactical possibilities coming up.
 [ b4 ]  [ Q d5 ]  [ Q c8 + ]  [ K h7 ]  [ Q g4 ] , [ Q e6 ]  at this point white resigns. apart from a few blunders it was well played by both players.
 [ R d8 ]  [ a3 ]  [ R d7 ]  [ b4 ]  [ g5 ]  [ Q c8 ]  [ K g7 ] , [ R x e5 ]  Winning another pawn through this tactic!
 [ N c3 ]  [ Q e1 ] , [ Q x e2 ]  Time to trade off all the material. He must take my queen or I will play 25. Qa2#. The only way to stop 25. [ Q a2 # ] is to play 25. [ Q d2 ] which results in 25. ... [ Q x c3 ] and once again he cannot take my knight due to the threat of 26. ... [ Q x h1 ] . His only other option is to play 25. [ N d2 ] which would have been his best choice since 25. ... [ Q x e1 ] 26. [ R x e1 ] and his pieces are at better places.
 [ N g5 ] , [ f4 ]  Still interested in my Ng5.
 [ d x c5 ] , [ B x c5 ]  This was the move black was waiting for. Black wanted the white pawn to take [ c5 ] so the bishop could recapture and pins a pawn near the white king. This crucial move allows for the final attack later in the game.
 [ K h2 ]  [ Q d5 ]  [ Q c2 ] , [ K f8 ]  starting the last phase of attack
 [ d5 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ d x c4 ]  [ N x c6 ]  [ b x c6 ]  [ c3 ]  [ B x e4 ]  [ R x e4 ] , [ e5 ]  Black is attempting to simplify to success.
 [ N d5 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ d3 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ N d4 ] , [ N d2 ]  10. [ N d2 ] opening the diagonal for white's light square bishop.
 [ f5 ] , [ c5 ]  ?Mistake number 2 this allows...
 [ R f7 ]  [ d x c5 ]  [ N x c5 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ R h e1 ] , [ Q a5 ]  So - the game is a ''draw'' in the centre: Black has his central pawns but they are opposed by considerable fire-power and their further advance is out of the question just now.
 [ N a7 ]  [ N f2 ]  [ K d4 ] , [ N g4 ]  47. [ N g4 ] - attacks h pawn.
 [ N g f5 + ]  [ e x f5 ]  [ N x f5 + ]  [ K f6 ]  [ B g5 + ]  [ K x f5 ]  [ g4 + ]  [ N x g4 ] , [ h x g4 # ]  
 [ N f3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B e7 ] , [ e3 ]  I remember being without the foggiest idea how control of the center would shape up. I just wanted to give my LSB a lane.
 [ R c2 + ]  [ K h3 ] , [ R e8 ]  ?? But this was the wrong way to do it! The colour of the square the rook is on coupled with Black's back rank weakness allows for the devastating 38.Bb5!!. Black can't play [ R x e7 ] because [ R b8 + ] will mate if he moves the rook away he loses the knight and if he plays [ R c8 ] he loses the exchange.
 [ e4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ B b4 ]  French Defense Winawer Variation. i play first time.
 [ Q x f3 ]  [ R x f3 ]  [ O-O-O ] , [ B x f2 ]  This move immediately gains a pawn but has the disadvantage of enabling a pin on the bishop. Of course Ra8-[ f8 ] will remedy the situation but then Rd1-[ d2 ] will prevent Rf3xh3.
 [ Q x b5 ]  [ N x b5 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ h5 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ g5 ]  [ N f5 ]  [ B f6 ] , [ h4 ]  This was a daring move but I calculated I could regain the pawn by attacking the Rook and King.
 [ Q h5 + ] , [ R h6 ]  my king is safe from checking now
 [ Q d8 + ]  [ K h7 ]  [ Q d3 + ]  [ g6 ]  [ Q c3 ]  [ Q d5 ]  [ a3 ]  [ Q d1 + ]  [ Q e1 ]  [ Q d3 + ] , [ K g1 ]  33. Qe2? loses a pawn at once after 33 ...Qb1+.
 [ Q c7 ] , [ N c3 ]  Finally developing the queen-side!
 [ R d b1 ]  [ Q c6 ]  [ R b e1 ]  [ Q b6 ]  [ Q h2 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ R e2 ]  [ B c6 ]  [ R b2 ]  [ Q a7 ]  [ Q e2 ] , [ R d3 ]  aggressive move to try and force open white pawns
 [ N f3 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ e3 ]  Letting out his bishop and developing
 [ R x d8 + ]  [ R x d8 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ b5 ]  preparing of white to castle and then 20. ..[ B c4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ g6 ]  The Sicilian Dragon: against which I have had limited success in the past.
 [ B e7 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f d7 ]  [ B x e7 ]  [ Q x e7 ] , [ f4 ]  And now black is getting in his own way with his knight on [ d7 ] blocking his LSB. But of course anyone playing the French very often knows to expect a little cramping.
 [ g4 ]  [ R x e4 ]  [ K c2 ]  [ R e5 ]  [ K d3 ] , [ f6 ]  [Black’s main problem is passivity of his pieces. Even though he is a piece up it is not being felt. and Carlsen just keeps on forcing pawn exchanges inching his way closer to a draw…]
 [ f x g4 ]  [ Q g5 ] , [ B h3 ]  This was a mistake but I thought that I would better have not trapped my queen. I didn't consider...
 [ B x e3 ]  [ h6 ]  [ N h3 ]  [ B x c2 ] , [ N b5 ]  I am attacking both [ a7 ] and [ c7 ]  [ B d6 ] , [ R a c1 ]  I didn't want to take the a-pawn because I thought taking the c-pawn would be better. I wasn't comfortable taking the a-pawn because it would oddly place my piece and I'm more concerned with completeing development and launching an attack
 [ Q d7 ] , [ B f3 ]  pinning the knight and queen.
 [ K d7 ] , [ Q x g7 ]  26. [ Q x g7 ] - I now snatch a pawn and am a full exchange up. However I must beware because there are still two major pieces and three pawns swarming around Henry at the moment. I must therefore at least ensure that the two black minor pieces are firmly pinned down. As an exercise for the Inquest Jury which two black pieces are pinned at the moment and what by?
 [ O-O ]  [ B e3 ] , [ c5 ]  The [ [ c5 ] ] break! It is a gambit if you will. I play 6...[ [ c5 ] ] against the Saemisch 100% of the time.
 [ R e g1 ]  [ N b d7 ] , [ R g2 ]  Planning to double Rooks
 [ c4 ] , [ R e5 ]  I just anaysed the buggery out of this move and then didn't save. The short version is I was planning a move [ b d1 ] (after the take and exchange) but it was crap but then I relised once the queen takes the bishop I can agress with bd3!! then swing my knight up and get some breathing space. This is a great game I am enjoying it.
 [ B b7 ]  [ N b3 ]  [ R a8 ]  [ R x a8 + ]  [ B x a8 ] , [ Q f3 ]  Preparing for e5.
 [ c5 ]  [ d4 ] , [ Q c7 ]  11. ...... [ Q c7 ] - still in book. Glenda is in her element here - she supports the [ e4 ] pawn X-ray style.
 [ O-O ]  [ B x c3 ] , [ b x c3 ]  White will control the open b file and his two bishops on the center are very dangerous.
 [ K h2 ] , [ R d g8 ]  Foolishly I failed to analyze the board before moving.
 [ N c6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ c x d4 ] , [ N f6 ]  Another good move would have been 8.- [ d5 ] and black have at least equal however this is much more in the sicilian style half-closed game with black playing on the queen-side.
 [ Q c1 + ]  [ K b5 ]  [ Q b2 + ] , [ K a6 ]  66. Ka6! - Henry was really tempted to gobble up that nice tasty juicy p(r)awn on a5. But he restrains himself from this because he realises that he can use this pawn as a human shield to shelter behind. Black cannot now check Henry from the front so he must now find another way.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ a6 ] , [ B a4 ]  The Ruy Lopez. my favourite.
 [ N d5 ] , [ O-O ]  Securing the King before embarking on an attack.
 [ R h3 ]  [ K g8 ]  [ R c1 ]  [ R e7 ]  [ B c3 ] , [ R c8 ]  25. ..... [ R c8 ] - getting the [ c7 ] pawn adequately covered is a good thing because my KR is needed to defend my weakened kingside position here.
 [ g4 ]  [ R e8 + ]  [ K f1 ] , [ Q x g5 ]  Pick up a free Knight.
 [ Q x h7 ]  [ R c6 ] , [ Q h6 ]  With this im going to try all sorts of nasty discovered checks on the king.
 [ K a2 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ K b3 ]  [ R d8 ]  [ h4 ]  [ R d4 ]  [ a5 ] , [ c4 + ]  The wrong advance. I thought about opening a route for my bishop in case I could have untangle it or should white have left it grip. But even if the pawn is safe there is no future in this advance. The rook has no place to go on the diagonal!!! [ R b4 + ] is with no use since the pawn that is going to crown is the a one.
 [ N x e3 ]  [ Q x e3 ] , [ c x d4 ]  The trap is to have white put his Queen and King on a diagonal.
 [ N f3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ c3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ Q e2 + ] , [ B e7 ]  first question: was this the best move. my other playable opeions are [ N e4 ] (which is not good at all in my oppinion) this [ Q e7 ] and what I wanted to do second most Be6.
 [ N x c3 ] , [ b x c3 ]  Very nice doubled pawns. Which will inevitably lead to an isolated center pawn for black
 [ c x b6 ]  [ e ] , [ p ]  I'm not sure this was the best choice but the truth is that even if blacks finally plays the [ Q x b6 + ] this is not a real concern for white.
 [ N f6 + ]  [ B x f6 ] , [ e x f6 ]  The leaves the pawn on an ideal square for mating by queen! Moreover it is difficult to attack and holds the black pawns in place.
 [ N b d7 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ a6 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ b5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ B b7 ] , [ O-O ]  Simple castle here continuing my development. Perhaps a bit premature plays like [ Q b3 ] or [ d4 ] were also playable but at this point I saw no need to rush.
 [ Q x a1 + ] , [ R f1 ]  So I have material advantage an open king and undeveloped rooks... this is a new game! How to proceed?
 [ Q x g7 ] , [ Q f4 ]  black must move king or queen or looses queen.
 [ Q x e1 ]  [ R x e1 + ]  [ K g2 ]  [ N x d3 ]  [ R d2 ] , [ N b4 ]  Positionally the game is extremely hard for White. Only 3 pawns sit on white squares greatly reducing the effectiveness of your bishop although your knight is very active and probably your best chance for any counterplay. With the e file gone to my rook and my knights in active positions it will be very hard to utilise your rook. E2 D3 E3 D1 C2 and A2 are all effectively removed from the Rooks positions making it impossible for the rook to get involved.
 [ g6 ] , [ N x g6 ]  The knight is immune from capture on account of [ h x g6 ] and Qxh8. The untouchable knight is also threating [ N x h8 ] with a discovery. But this situation is not as precarious as it seems.
 [ N a4 ]  [ Q g2 ]  [ R f1 ] , [ Q x e4 + ]  Bags a Knight.
 [ R x c1 ]  [ R x c1 + ]  [ K d5 ] , [ R e1 ]  Stopping the king encroaching on my kingside majority and also restricting the e6-pawn's movement.
 [ B d7 ] , [ N f5 ]  !? Forcing a weakness in the Black pawn structure and also complicating the position. My computer programme Fritz seems not to like it that much at first and considers 17.[ B c2 ] better but after analyzing a bit it says White has an advantage in this line as well.
 [ N g e2 ] , [ N e8 ]  Thinking about to do f5.
 [ B x f7 + ] , [ K h8 ]  [ K f8 ] [ B h6 + ] [ K e7 ] [ B x e8 ] and white is not bad off. [ K g7 ] [ Q g4 + ] [ K h8 ] [ B h6 ] leads to a good game for white.
 [ c4 ] , [ f5 ]  There will be considerably fewer annotations from here because as I mentioned my endgame is very weak. If anyone has comments on the moves please make them in the next available comment box they are always very helpful.
 [ N x f7 ] , [ K x f7 ]  My King would normally be called "exposed" but because White's Q-side pieces are undeveloped he cannot exploit this.
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ d5 ] , [ N f3 ]  The standard Indian Defence. My opponent could have played [ e3 ] or [ N d2 ] at this point to continue the lines.
 [ B x e5 ] , [ d x e5 ]  Not with the bishop that can be easily harassed with [ f6 ] ([ Q h5 + ] is not so dangerous now without the white knight) or simply allows black to develop N[ f6 ] then [ N c6 ] will kick or exchange the bishop.
 [ a x b5 ] , [ B b3 ]  bad very bad move.
 [ h6 ] , [ K e2 ]  Rooks connected completing development. Black needs several more moves to finish his.
 [ K x f7 ] , [ N c3 ]  7. [ N c3 ] - this move has been the best of the pick in the World DB. If that knight can move to [ d5 ] it can cause black problems should he try to shelter his king with his knight and then white castles kingside.
 [ R d2 ] , [ B b4 ]  resignation by white. He must like that pawn. he can't do anything to save the knight of control of [ d4 ] and lost all of his momentum early in the game with the queen's retreating.
 [ B b7 ] , [ g4 ]  If he can't force me to remove [ d4 ] I can play risky on the Kside (my standard plan is to castle Qside).
 [ d x e4 ] , [ N c3 ]  This move is better than the immediate 3. [ f3 ] because then black can try 3. ... [ e5 ] and he gets a better position.
 [ B f4 ] , [ N f6 ]  7. ...... Nf6?? - this move looked good just one move ago but now it is soooo baaad! Graham overlooked a very serious threat. Now black must give up his queen to avoid copping Old Matey. Here is what Gameknot had to say:- Blunder: +7.65 » … [ N f6 ] 7. [ N c7 + ] [ Q x c7 ] 8. [ B x c7 ] [ B b7 ] 9. [ [ e5 ] ] [ N e4 ] 10. [ B c4 ] [ R c8 ] 11. [ B x f7 + ] [ K x f7 ] 12. [ Q x d7 + ] [ N e7 ] 13. [ e6 + ] [ K g6 ] 14. [ N [ e5 ] + ] [ K f5 ] 15. [ g4 + ] [ K f6 ] 16. [ N f7 ] Best: +1.09 » … [ d6 ] 7. [ Q a4 ] [ B d7 ] 8. [ B b5 ] [ R c8 ] 9. O-O [ N b8 ] 10. [ [ e5 ] ] [ B x b5 ] 11. [ Q x b5 + ] [ Q d7 ] 12. [ Q x d7 + ] [ K x d7 ] 13. ex[ d6 ] [ K c6 ] 14. [ N c7 ] [ B x d6 ]  [ Q x c7 ]  [ B x c7 ] , [ B e7 ]  9. ...... [ B e7 ] - a developing move paving the way for castling but [ B b7 ] was suggested here. However with the material deficit so huge it can only be a matter of time for me to convert it!
 [ B h6 ]  [ R x f3 ]  [ R x f3 ]  [ N x f3 + ]  [ K g2 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ N d2 ] , [ g5 ]  
 [ N c6 ]  [ a3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B c5 ] , [ h3 ]  all major pieces out now......ready for a BIG battle
 [ B c6 ] , [ a4 ]  It is good to use the pawns on the queen-side but maybe better is to first move the knight from where it blocks the [ c2 ] pawn. Then the pawn advance [c2-c3] will support [b2-b4] to entice an exchange of [...cxb4] so the c pawn is undoubled by [cxb4]. And if black notices the plan and plays [...a7-a5] then there is the move [a2-a3] and white will be successful in the exchanges.
 [ N g6 ] , [ N c7 + ]  Winning the exchange and forcing Black's king out into the open.
 [ e6 ] , [ B e2 ]  clearing space to castle kingside i heard it said once castle early...not sure whether this is still thought of as a good idea. Ive also seen others wait until they see what happens in the opening game first then castle before the attack.
 [ N f3 ]  [ b6 ]  [ R a d1 + ]  [ K e7 ]  [ K x e5 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ g3 ]  [ R a e8 ]  [ N g5 ]  [ R h f8 ]  [ R f e1 ]  [ R f6 ]  [ K d4 + ]  [ K d7 ]  [ K c3 + ]  [ R d6 ]  [ R x d6 + ]  [ c x d6 ]  [ R x e8 ]  [ K x e8 ] , [ N x h7 ]  White has regained his pawn but having a knight is a drawback. Furthermore it's too far away from the center. White's pawn are better but black's passed pawn will conctitute a serious menace obliging white to use at least one piece to prevent his promotion.
 [ Q f6 + ]  [ K d7 ] , [ Q d6 # ]  I hope you enjoyed the game and the post-mortem thoughts.
 [ K x b7 ] , [ R x d7 ]  Now White's rook is on the powerful 7th rank too (I guess 20... [ K d8 ] would have lasted longer for that reason) already attacking a pawn Black is dead lost.
 [ Q h4 ] , [ Q d3 ]  Black tries to punch first with ...[ Q x c3 + ] but is behind by just one tempo. White has a stronghold on the position and can make effective use of active pieces. Black is almost playing 2 pieces down due to the bad bishop and trapped rook on a8. Neither of those factors are permanent but they exist now.
 [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ] , [ Q a5 ]  Getting the queen out this early in the game has some risks as it exposes the queen to enemy attacks.. Better continuation would be 5. ... Nc6..
 [ B a3 + ]  [ K b1 ] , [ Q b2 # ]  i was ok and my compliments to jet101 for a game i realy had to think and rethink for to win
 [ B b4 + ]  [ B d2 ] , [ Q e7 ]  Good move! If I initiate a bishop exchange his Queen can take b2. I could play [ b3 ] or
 [ N g5 + ]  [ K f5 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ K e6 ]  redfoxrising: 32.[ B e1 ] gives us 2 pieces attacking [ h4 ] pawn thewrongreason: I see why so 32.[ B e1 ] is also my vote unless Dave thinks of something better.
 [ K h2 ] , [ Q x c2 ]  Ironically this is roughly the same position that the game ended up going so you got there in the end. And as we both experienced this is a winning position for White. Good game.
 [ R h h1 ] , [ R b7 ]  29...Nxe5? 30. [ B d4 ] and my g pawn falls. Rb7gives me flexibility to double on either the f or b files and keeps his B "bad."
 [ O-O ] , [ B h6 ]  oh that's why.
 [ R e1 ]  [ K d6 ]  [ R x e4 ] , [ B h3 ]  That king is staying there.
 [ B x a6 ] , [ b x a6 ]  19. ..... [ b x a6 ] - doubled shattered pawns still no matter. That's another set of pieces off the board. Remember an extra rook (K + R v bare K) is enough to force checkmate in the endgame.
 [ Q f3 ]  [ c2 ]  [ K h2 ] , [ Q x a4 ]  43. ..... [ Q x a4 ] - Glenda now snaps off the a pawn now that only the Witch is attacking my [ f7 ] pawn.
 [ B e6 ] , [ K f2 ]  18. [ K f2 ] - hmm with the queens still on he keeps his king in the centre. Interesting.
 [ d x e5 ] , [ e4 ]  blocking the aforementioned fork (which is not actually threatened yet but would be if White's [ N d2 ] were to move) and potentially creating air for the dsb
 [ K f3 ] , [ K d2 ]  ...as my pawn has a clear run.
 [ K f2 ]  [ R a d8 ] , [ N d4 ]  I don't like this as it just isolates White's d-pawn (and there is nothing to gain from the open c-file for White). Moreover it proposes another exchange of pieces. I guess White was not aware of the fact that piece exchanges generally favour the side with extra material.
 [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ] , [ N x d5 ]  I'm not ready to exchange yet. But in this position there is no choice. As I considered 5...[ N g4 ] but if I did this would be a free pawn. And I was determined not to allow that because of Jack's advice of not giving anything away as I have also taught my students. In fact that's one of the most important things that I have emphasized to them.
 [ Q c7 ]  [ R f3 ] , [ R g8 ]  maybe 14...[ R f8 ] was better move however white could play .15.Bxf7+-Rxf7.16.Qg8+with powerful attack.
 [ B g2 ] , [ B e7 ]  Happy at this stage to develop quietly onto squares that seem most natural and defensively strong.
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ B b5 ]  The Spanish game (Ruy Lopez)
 [ R x e7 ] , [ R f b8 ]  Don't know why black does this it traps his other rook in the corner.
 [ R g6 ] , [ N f6 + ]  ...making space for the other knight to bring him in...
 [ R a8 ] , [ O-O ]  White completes development N [ e5 ] may have been better
 [ Q x d5 ]  [ B x c6 + ]  [ Q x c6 ] , [ O-O ]  This allows a dangerous attack at the White King.
 [ N a4 ] , [ B d5 ]  Heralding a mate in 5...
 [ O-O ] , [ Q d7 ]  I do not know why black brought his Q out this early. Better was to continue developing with 6...[ B e7 ] or 6...0-0.
 [ e6 ]  [ d4 ] , [ d5 ]  Opening position
 [ B e6 ]  [ N b d2 ]  [ Q c8 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ R e8 ] , [ b3 ]  13. [ b3 ] - considering a possible fianchetto for Fou Lenoir on b2.
 [ e3 ]  [ B b4 ]  [ B d3 ] , [ c6 ]  Black gets a Slav pawn in and both sides near completion of development.
 [ K e3 ] , [ K e5 ]  I am very happy my king is in the center. Now I am able to advance the c pawn to promote or gobble up the white pawns on the kingside if he abandons them.
 [ Q g7 ]  [ Q x g7 + ]  [ K x g7 ]  [ g x h4 ]  [ f6 ]  [ R g1 ]  [ R e g8 ]  [ O-O-O ]  [ K h6 ]  [ R d2 ]  [ R g7 ]  [ K b2 ]  [ R b g8 ] , [ K a3 ]  Black fights a three point deficit but here white makes the mistake of putting his king on the sideline.
 [ B x e2 ]  [ Q x e2 ]  [ N b d7 ] , [ g4 ]  The attack is launched but will it be too early. I thought black will be able to defend this if he plays correctly. But no one ever plays correctly. I thought that n[ x e5 ] was going to be find for white after be5.
 [ K b6 ] , [ R d b1 ]  preparing a discovered check
 [ N x e7 + ] , [ K f7 ]  !! i cant take why: if rxn then r[ c1 ] then r[ e a7 ] r[ c c2 ] holding
 [ Q f4 ] , [ B d3 ]  Bishop was trying to put pressure on the white King. But knight got captured some places around the King. So task is difficult.
 [ f x e6 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ] , [ b6 ]  Preparing a fianchetto TO pressure the kingside.
 [ Q x f7 + ]  [ K d8 ] , [ Q f8 # ]  My bishop on [ a3 ] is really what killed Black because it stopped him from castling to defend mate on f7. But it was Black's one faulty 3.[ h6 ] move that led to these complications because it gave me a lead in development allowing me to get an initiative in the centre driving Black's defensive pieces away. Just look at the knight on [ g8 ] which isn't even developed yet it moved 4 times in the game.
 [ N f6 ]  [ N b3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ Q e2 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ R d1 ]  [ Q b6 ] , [ a4 ]  So far book. Here Black does not forsee the strength of a5.
 [ e x f4 ] , [ B c4 ]  This is the bishops gambit variation
 [ B h2 ]  [ g4 ]  [ h x g4 ]  [ B x g4 ]  [ N b d2 ] , [ N d4 ]  Adding pressure to the knight
 [ e x d4 ] , [ N x d4 ]  Now my gut was 4... [ N x d4 ] 5. [ Q x d4 ] but I thought realised that [ B c5 ] would put me ahead in development and also kept his Knight into [ N d4 ] because of a [ Q f6 ] or [ Q h4 ] mating threat.
 [ B e4 ]  [ f3 ]  [ B g6 ] , [ f4 ]  The black LSB jumps forward to the attack but is driven back by the white pawn. Then the white pawn advances again. Will the black LSB jump back to the attack?
 [ N x h7 ] , [ N x h7 ]  Not 13.Qh5?? because of 13...[ N h f6 ] and black is fine.
 [ e5 ]  [ f3 ]  [ e4 ] , [ f x e4 ]  ?
 [ R c1 ]  [ h6 ]  [ B x b5 ]  [ N c5 ] , [ R x c5 ]  More and more pieces just waiting to be picked off.
 [ B f6 ] , [ Q c4 ]  A "High class" waiting move.
 [ c6 ]  [ h3 ]  [ Q g6 ]  [ h x g4 ]  [ N x g4 ] , [ Q x f3 ]  And now I've won back the gambited Pawn and evened the material. Now I can focus on generating my own attack.
 [ e5 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ Q x e5 + ]  [ B e2 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ Q e7 ] , [ O-O ]  I'm safe but i did not play well at the open...
 [ d5 ]  [ f4 ] , [ e x f4 ]  Here Mieses makes a small mis-step which his opponent declines to capitalize on.
 [ Q h5 + ] , [ g6 ]  Forced.
 [ N x e4 ]  [ Q x e4 ] , [ R a4 ]  "!" a nice move the rook is not takeable. ([ Q x a4 ] ?? Nc3+) it forces the queen to go to [ f3 ]  [ Q f3 ] , [ R b8 ]  clearly attacks [ b2 ]  [ R e2 ] , [ B x b2 ]  earning a full pawn without counter attack
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B b5 ] , [ N d4 ]  Bird's Defense. creative but not strong but not bad. an interesting surprise weapon for weekend tourneys or speed chess but in the online venue (with 3 day time control?) a very interesting choice.
 [ R e1 ]  [ N c5 ]  [ B c2 ]  [ N e6 ] , [ h3 ]  White's having trouble to find a good plan.
 [ N c3 ] , [ c6 ]  The most common response here is [ N f6 ] but [ c6 ] is decent too. C5 in the database shows interesting promise for black.
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ B d6 ]  This is the first sign of aggressivity from my opponent. Now the planned [ N [ e5 ] ] is just disastrous to [ f6 ] [ e5 ] etc.
 [ R f5 ] , [ R d6 ]  Rf45 threatened my rook of course.
 [ a4 ]  [ K g5 ]  [ R g3 + ] , [ K h4 ]  Now with the attacked h-pawn I can restrict the mobility of White's Rook.
 [ Q d5 ]  [ Q x d5 ]  [ c x d5 ] , [ R d1 ]  And with that I knew that it was still possible to win another pawn. I overlooked that Tom can and will protect with his next move. However upon overlooking that I realized that he can't keep [ d5 ] protected for long.
 [ B c3 ] , [ N e4 ]  Step two exchange off a set of pieces to make some breathing room.
 [ N d4 ]  [ f6 ]  [ R e5 e6 ] , [ B x d5 ]  Finally I take the lead as well as get that advanced pawn out of the way.
 [ f5 ]  [ Q x a7 ]  [ h3 ] , [ Q b8 + ]  31 Qb8ch enables white's queen to move to defend 32......[ K f7 ] would have been a better choice (nearer the centre)
 [ N d6 ]  [ N f5 ] , [ N b3 ]  after [ Q x c6 ] Qxd2: so this was to be expected...
 [ Q x g5 ] , [ Q x f7 + ]  Evidently black thinks he can survive the upcoming wild slug fest so he snarfed up the free bishop. Was it really free?
 [ K h7 ]  [ R g7 + ]  [ K h6 ] , [ R d7 ]  This important move threatens [ B f4 ] forced mate and White's only defense is to pin the bishop. White has to give up the rook to stop mate and Black wins easily.
 [ N f6 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ c6 ] , [ Q d3 ]  Better was Qd2.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ c3 ]  The first unusual move of the game. If followed up by P-[ Q4 ] White can get a strong center but the drawback is that it takes away the natural developmental square for the QN.
 [ R x b2 ] , [ N a4 ]  attempting n[ b6 ] to box the rook in
 [ R x d5 ] , [ R x c7 + ]  Alternative variation: 33. [ Q b3 ] [ R a a5 ] 34. [ R x c7 + ] [ K g6 ] 35. [ N c6 ] $19
 [ K e4 ] , [ b3 ]  Expecting 32 RxN BxR KxB K-[ B2 ] with a won Rook and Pawn ending.
 [ N c3 ] , [ R a7 ]  Another good reason for playing 18. - Rf7: Suddenly the Rook challenges Whites back rank.
 [ g6 ]  [ N x d6 ]  [ c x d6 ]  [ B h6 ]  [ R f e8 ] , [ Q g5 ]  So this is crushing - I saw all three threats but I can't stop them - I need to get the Q on the A1-H8 diagonal but there's no way to do it without losing the bishop or letting the pawn push. Even if I manage to prevent the mate threat via something like 21. [ Q g5 ] [ Q d4 ] 22. [ R f d1 ] [ Q e5 ] 23. [ R x d5 ] [ Q x g5 ] 24. [ B x g5 ] [ R a c8 ] 25. [ R x d6 ] I'm still down a full piece and two pawns.
 [ B c2 ]  [ Q e8 ]  [ Q x g7 + ]  [ Q f7 ] , [ B x f6 + ]  Anyway hope you enjoyed probably one of my most well executed methodical wins to date if you don't mind a always enjoy a couple of comments.
 [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ g6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ d5 ]  This is the Gruenfeld Defence. Black offers White the chance to create an imposing Classical pawn centre with 4.[ c x d5 ] [ N x d5 ] 5.[ e4 ] [ N x c3 ] 6.[ b x c3 ] but can then put terrific pressure on it with ...[ B g7 ] ...[ c5 ] and ...[ N c6 ] - this is the very sharp Exchange Variation. If White can maintain his powerful pawn centre however he can expect to hold a positional advantage.
 [ g x h4 ] , [ Q c5 ]  Continuing to bring my Queen to the kingside while limiting his options. If [ B x h4 ] then [ R x d6 ] giving him a firm hold of the centre
 [ Q x g5 ] , [ Q x c1 ]  Now I am 2 pawns ahead and no danger of losing a Rook directly.
 [ N e4 ]  [ B d2 ]  [ N x d2 ] , [ Q x d2 ]  I got rid of his Bpair I still have strenght on the dark squares and the B and white has to spend tempoes for developing just as me. It's not "his game" anymore.
 [ R e x f7 ]  [ R f3 x f7 + ]  [ R x f7 ]  [ R x f7 + ]  [ K x f7 ] , [ K f2 ]  Moving to the center.
 [ K h2 ] , [ N d7 ]  I can't help [ R e1 ] but I can take [ g5 ] so I better spend a tempo developing.
 [ B x d4 ] , [ N c6 ]  attacking his bishop.id like to keep mine and eliminate his
 [ K h8 ] , [ R e1 ]  seizing control of the e-file while preparing for operations on the light squares.
 [ a7 ]  [ b3 ]  [ N d1 ] , [ R a8 ]  The only chance to win. 79... K-[ [ N3 ] ] would be answered with 80 K-[ K3 ] KxP 81 N-[ N2 ] K-[ [ N3 ] ] 82 P-[ B5 ] K-[ B4 ] 83 P-B6.
 [ N x g6 ]  [ h x g6 ]  [ e4 ] , [ Q c7 ]  9. ...Qc7? black was unaware of whites "threat" to blizt me in the center [ e5 ] or [ e6 ] was neccessary!
 [ N e3 ]  [ B f6 ]  [ Q b6 ]  [ K h1 ]  [ h5 ]  [ Q g5 ] , [ N g4 ]  The knight makes it across the board to aid the King covering [ h6 ] from a White Queen invasion but ...
 [ g4 ]  [ R a3 + ]  [ K f2 ]  [ f6 ] , [ R h5 ]  Going for a forced line that leads to a drawn K+K endgame.
 [ f3 ]  [ N e7 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ N b c6 ]  [ N g e2 ]  [ R c8 ] , [ B b5 ]  And here I plan on ceding my two bishops and allowing black the two bishops. In an open game such as this the extra pawn usually doesn't give an advantage as the two bishops would equalize the position. However I was confident that I could force further trades and the black king is still centered. This as we will see becomes a problem for him.
 [ N x d8 ] , [ Q x c3 + ]  .. in exchange for the queen. It is important that the opponent is in check in this position or else [ R b1 ] would have led to checkmate.
 [ d x e5 ]  [ f5 ]  [ B g5 ] , [ d5 ]  Black probably forgot [ e x d6 ] e.p.+.
 [ h x g4 ] , [ N f6 ]  getting another piece in
 [ Q x d6 ]  [ R x d6 ] , [ R c1 ]  Setting up an obnoxious pin on the Bishop threatening [ R x b2 ] or Rxc3.
 [ R e7 ] , [ N f6 + ]  It was a good idea for black to move his rook to e7. He foresaw white's pawn on [ d7 ] and wanted to be on the correct side of the action. However this check is forcing black's queen into a very tight position.
 [ N d6 ]  [ B e5 ]  [ K c8 ]  [ B f1 ]  [ N d8 f7 ]  [ B b2 ]  [ R b6 ]  [ B c1 ]  [ B d7 ] , [ R f3 ]  A draw could have been agreed here. The players show good fighting spirit playing on.
 [ Q b5 ] , [ B x d2 ]  Well. I see. I have my chance to feel a little about the way Paul Morphy felt in his wonderful games... if you forgive me!:-)
 [ B g5 ] , [ c5 ]  3. ... [ c5 ] is not the most popular move here in the DB but it is played by the highest rated players and has the best success rate. It immediately strikes at white's center which though well defended threatens to invite white's queen out early and make a target of her.
 [ N b3 ] , [ d5 ]  Tring to open up the [ b8 ] [ h2 ] diagonal and create real threats..
 [ B g4 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ B x f3 ]  [ B x f3 ]  [ Q b6 ] , [ O-O ]  (?) This move loses a pawn.
 [ e4 + ]  [ f x e4 + ] , [ f x e4 + ]  Although this gives black a passed pawn It won't be easy to promote
 [ c4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ d5 ] , [ b5 ]  Black had no desire to get blown out in this game he plays the active and dangerous Benko Gambit. Black sacrifices his wing pawns to open files for his rooks to pressure white's game. It's one of the very few gambits where the pawn is not sacrificed for an immediate attack but for long term positional pressure.
 [ b5 ]  [ f4 ] , [ a4 ]  A waiting move? Maybe Black hopes to break through and create a passed pawn on the queenside but it's too late.
 [ Q x e5 ]  [ R x c4 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ R f4 ]  [ O-O ]  [ R h4 ] , [ g6 ]  As noted... Follows a - somewhat forced - continuation...
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ] , [ e5 ]  the Advance Variation.
 [ K g1 ]  [ N x f1 ]  [ R x f1 ]  [ K c8 ] , [ f6 ]  [ f6 ] White advances the passed f-pawn to cause black some trouble in the back ranks.
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ] , [ B c4 ]  I think this is premature and that White should have transposed his second and third moves. Had he played 2 [ N f3 ] I would have played 2...[ d6 ] when 3 [ B c4 ] would be a decent move.
 [ R e8 ]  [ B h6 ] , [ B h8 ]  !? Interesting move. Later as we see this move will cause black headache. That's why black played Re8.
 [ a5 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ B b6 ]  10. [ B b6 ] - a good placement for Fou Lenoir but alas it doesn't achieve much here.
 [ c4 ] , [ Q c2 ]  D[ d2 ] is not designed to prevent Sb[ d2 ] to
 [ B x a6 ] , [ Q x c6 ]  White doesn't seem to have any useful N moves to exploit the discovered attack on my Q
 [ b5 ] , [ h4 ]  The Classical Bishop Sacrifice attack runs [ B x h7 ] [ K x h7 ] [ N g5 ] . 13.[ [ h4 ] ] prevents ...Qxg5. [ [ h4 ] ] also comes in to the attack after ...Kg6.
 [ Q x d5 ] , [ B x c5 ]  In exchange for the knight black has gained excellent mobility a supported past pawn back rank threats and dominance on the queen side.
 [ B c7 ]  [ R x d8 + ] , [ B x d8 ]  trading down probably a bad idea because I was down on material
 [ b5 ] , [ B b3 ]  Black opts for The Wing Attack.
 [ K x g6 ]  [ Q d3 + ]  [ B f5 ] , [ R g8 + ]  ! I can cause problems now thanks to my rook! Keep in mind we were in time trouble at this point and so this was quite a saving move.
 [ R f d8 ] , [ R g2 ]  The game is over at this point.
 [ N d7 ] , [ O-O ]  Developpement almost completed.
 [ e4 ] , [ c6 ]  The Caro-Kann is my favourite defense to the king-pawn opening.
 [ R x a5 ]  [ R x f2 + ]  [ K b3 ]  [ R h2 ]  [ c5 ] , [ K d8 ]  On 32... RxRP 33 R-[ R7 ] ch K-[ Q1 ] 34 RxP RxP ch 35 KxP the Q-side Pawns hurtle toward a touchdown. The Bishop since it can control both wings at once is vastly superior to the Knight.
 [ O-O ]  [ B e2 ]  [ e5 ] , [ O-O ]  Decision time in the centre. I opt to maintain the tension for another move. Alternatives are the Petrosian variation (d5) or the (boring) exchange variation.
 [ N d6 ] , [ R d3 ]  ...and as the knight moves back I can bring up a rook onto the third rank hoping to exchange mine for my opponent's on a8...
 [ h x g5 ]  [ B x g5 ] , [ R x d1 ]  Getting out of a pin but giving me nice access to the d-file temporarily.
 [ e5 ] , [ B e7 ]  ?? Now he decides to break the pin. But as I pointed out this is a blunder. In that I told said I understand your intentions because it breaks the pin. In this position however best was 4...[ [ h6 ] ] and that also breaks the pin. The reason being is that was the only way to keep things safe and even because after that I have two choices. Either I exchange your N for my bishop so 4.[ B x f6 ] 4...[ B x f6 ] or 4...gxf6. Or if I don't want to exchange I could retreat back so after 4...[ [ h6 ] ] then this would happen. 5.[ B h4 ] [ g5 ] [ B g3 ] and everything is safe. That's because this move loses a piece for a pawn And I also stated that it illustrates just how an important a position is because believe it or not what you just played would have been best a move earlier. So the lesson here is that what was or might have been good a move earlier is bad only one move later. And that where there's more to a story then meets the eye. In other words "Be a spectator of your game." In other words look at the entire board and not just one or two things.
 [ B e6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ Q d7 ] , [ c4 ]  Taking control of d5.
 [ N x e4 ]  [ N x e4 ] , [ f5 ]  Slightly weakening but it relieves the pressure on d6.
 [ N e4 + ]  [ K e2 ] , [ a5 ]  Black now attacks whites now weak pawn on b4. I now wish I had left it on b2.
 [ R x d5 ] , [ R a c8 ]  Now black is threatening mate in one.
 [ B d6 ]  [ h4 ]  [ h5 ]  [ K f3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ g4 ]  [ h x g4 + ]  [ K x g4 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ f4 ]  [ K f8 ]  [ h5 ]  [ g x h5 + ]  [ K x h5 ]  [ K g7 ]  [ K g4 ]  [ f6 ]  [ K f5 ]  [ K f7 ]  [ e4 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ e5 ]  [ f x e5 ]  [ f x e5 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ b5 ] , [ R a8 ]  now there are 2 passed pawns marching deeper into Black's territory and unless white makes a mistake it will spell game over soon.
 [ R x d8 ] , [ B g5 ]  Better than 9.[ N x e5 ] Nxe4!
 [ K g2 ]  [ N g5 ]  [ f4 ]  [ e x f4 ]  [ R x f4 ] , [ N e6 ]  Mate is coming soon.
 [ B b5 ] , [ c4 ]  This helps advance white's pawns at the expense of black pushing the same piece again and again.
 [ d3 ]  [ h6 ] , [ c3 ]  [ c3 ] is normally played first as per the book moves after [ B c5 ] although castling is fine. This is very similar to the book position which just shows how natural this opening is to play as neither my opponent nor I knew this opening by book before the match.
 [ N f6 ] , [ B g5 ]  So you can tell what my plan is. I want my knight on [ d5 ] and because of that i wanna destroy his Knight.
 [ h x g4 ]  [ B a6 + ] , [ K c8 ]  Although the bishop is now protected white could pick off P[ e7 ] by exchanging bishops and playing Rd7+.
 [ K g2 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ c3 ]  [ R f3 ]  [ b5 ]  [ R x d3 ]  [ a4 ]  [ e4 ]  [ B x c7 ] , [ e3 ]  
 [ g5 ]  [ R d e1 ]  [ K d8 ] , [ K b2 ]  The game ends as white has finally unpinned his bishop and will easily out match black.
 [ f x e3 ]  [ N x f5 ] , [ B x f7 ]  A desperate move to stave off Nxe3...
 [ K x c7 ] , [ h7 ]  
 [ N c7 ]  [ a4 ]  [ K b2 ] , [ K c4 ]  remove the check on [ d5 ] also get closer to K-Side where my pawns will escape
 [ f6 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ c4 ]  [ N f7 ] , [ Q c3 ]  (RC) Defending his QNP and so freeing his other Knight for action.
 [ B e6 ]  [ Q a4 + ] , [ b5 ]  I half expected this
 [ Q x g4 ] , [ R h g1 ]  However while it was a blunder black taking the offending pawn does allow my to move my rook to threaten the G-file containing both black's queen and king.
 [ e5 ] , [ B b4 + ]  This is an interesting move but unfortunately bad too. Black gets some pawn for the piece but the compensation is inaquate as black will find it hard to complete his queenside developement. 4...[ N e4 ] is the normal move when white can play 5.[ Q x d4 ] or 5.Bb5!?
 [ R a d1 ] , [ R a d8 ]  Daring the pawn to advance.
 [ R e2 ]  [ R f e8 ]  [ R e3 ]  [ c6 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ b6 ]  [ b5 ] , [ B g5 ]  Black threatens rook on e3. Offers exchange.
 [ N c6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N d4 ] , [ B c4 ]  White's priority is on the pawn and he misses the knight fork.
 [ R x f6 ] , [ f x g3 ]  So we both get our passed pawns and my e-pawn gets its chance after all!
 [ K f7 ]  [ B x h4 ] , [ R e8 ]  Caruana can try to avoid trading Rooks but it should still be a draw.
 [ R e8 ] , [ N x e7 + ]  Removes a strong defensive piece..[ B f8 ] would have removed control of [ h6 ] for white
 [ N f3 ]  [ O-O ] , [ O-O ]  I bring out my other knight and both sides have now castled. Only two other games had reached this position in the GK database and two different moves - [ h3 ] and [ B e6 ] - were played with a win for White and a draw respectively. Black plays neither of these moves and plays...
 [ N c3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ g3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ B g2 ] , [ B g7 ]  So far every move has been quite natural. The mirror match up apparently turns bad for Black somewhere along the line but I didn't know this at the time of playing.
 [ N c6 ] , [ e3 ]  Note black still cant win back the pawn with 9...[ B x f3 ] because after 10.[ Q x f3 ] the knight cannot move on account of blacks rook which would be hanging.
 [ N x g6 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ B e6 ] , [ Q x h5 ]  From this moment i'll attack on h file
 [ N b4 ]  [ a5 ] , [ N d5 ]  I would have played 13. [ N d3 ] instead to at least win a pawn.
 [ R x b6 ]  [ R x e7 ] , [ a4 ]  ?? How am I supposed to defend this pawn against Ra7?
 [ d x c6 ]  [ b x c6 ] , [ B e2 ]  Another line is 8.[ Q f3 ] but I don't know much about that variation. This is the main line but he needed some time to think so I knew he was out of his opening theory.
 [ N f3 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ e3 ] , [ d6 ]  Both sides have played natural developing moves so far. This pawn prevents my N from going to e5.
 [ K h8 ]  [ K h6 ] , [ R c6 + ]  Black has two drawing strategies: the one played or 84... [ R a5 ] and Black's rook will just mimic the movements of White's being immune to capture because of stalemate.
 [ h3 ] , [ B d7 ]  The second step in preparing b5. This protects my knight from his LSB in case white plays e5.
 [ R c2 x c7 ]  [ R x c7 ]  [ R x c7 ]  [ Q x c7 ]  [ Q c2 ]  [ Q x c2 ] , [ B x c2 ]  The exchange of Queens seals the game's fate. After the Rooks were vaporized Miss L. pretty much conceded the draw.
 [ d5 ] , [ N e5 ]  Ducking forward. In general I'm trying to be less passive in my games.
 [ e x d5 ] , [ N x d5 ]  not the best: best is [ N a5 ] [ B b5 + ] [ c6 ] dx[ c6 ] bx[ c6 ] Qf3!...
 [ b6 ]  [ B d2 ]  [ Q g6 ]  [ b4 ]  [ a x b4 ] , [ a x b4 ]  26. [ a x b4 ] - the a file is open.
 [ N d7 ] , [ h4 ]  A move which baffles me.
 [ Q g5 ]  [ Q c5 ]  [ B x g7 ]  [ K x g7 ]  [ h4 ]  [ f6 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ h6 ]  [ g4 ]  [ B e6 ] , [ g5 ]  Alternative variation: 16. [ h5 ] [ g5 ] $17
 [ B c5 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N f6 ]  [ d3 ] , [ d6 ]  5. ..... [ d6 ] - Henry is ready to castle but I also open up the c1-[ h3 ] diagonal open for Fou Leblanc.
 [ N x d4 ]  [ Q x d4 ]  [ B e3 ] , [ Q e4 + ]  I look around looking for a mate.
 [ B a6 + ]  [ B d3 ]  [ B x d3 + ]  [ R x d3 ] , [ c4 ]  Not completely necessary.
 [ K d7 ] , [ Q e6 + ]  48. ...... [ Q e6 + ] - it is now mate next move and I set up the conditional move for my rook to deliver mate. Thankfully I only had a minute to wait. In fact only two days later I found myself in a position to annotate another won game which I will call Two against One so watch this space.
 [ B b5 ] , [ d6 ]  I knew him taking would screw up my pawn structure..
 [ g4 ]  [ N f4 ]  [ R g3 ]  [ N x b3 ]  [ g x h5 ]  [ g x h5 ]  [ R g5 + ]  [ K c6 ]  [ R f5 ]  [ N d2 + ]  [ K g1 ]  [ N f3 + ]  [ K f1 ] , [ N x e1 ]  My Knights have served their purpose.
 [ B x g3 ]  [ f x g3 ]  [ N g4 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ R a e1 ]  [ f5 ]  [ b4 ]  [ Q f6 ]  [ N d1 ]  [ d4 ]  [ B b3 + ]  [ K h8 ]  [ N f2 ]  [ N e3 ] , [ N g4 ]  White gives up another knight.
 [ b x c3 ]  [ Q a5 ]  [ Q g3 ]  [ Q x c3 ] , [ R f1 ]  Now some people might say"why didn't white take the pawn on h6? Black can't take back because he's pin down due to the Queen on c3" Well obviously my opponent saw what would happen if he took on h6. .....21. [ Q x a1 ] check 22. [ K f2 ] [ N e4 ] check and now I'm attacking his Queen and King at the same time.
 [ c x b3 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ R a c1 ] , [ R a c8 ]  Keeping a presence on the open file -- More than happy to have the file opened if necessary else looking at a possible [ Q c6 ] to threaten mate on g2. if [ N e4 ] then [ Q d5 ] seems strong.
 [ R f1 f4 ]  [ Q e6 ]  [ R f4 f1 ]  [ b6 ]  [ R f5 f7 ]  [ R e7 ] , [ R x e7 ]  ? - Perhaps stronger for white would've been retreating to f5.
 [ Q c5 + ]  [ R d4 ]  [ e5 ] , [ Q f3 ]  white becomes the victim of a relntless assult after this move
 [ B d2 ]  [ b6 ]  [ g3 ] , [ N c7 ]  22. ..... [ N c7 ] - improves position of queen knight and also provides a defense of [ e8 ] supporting major piece exchange on that column. As I am material up exchanges of the heavies would work greatly in my favour here.
 [ N c6 ] , [ B c4 ]  3. [ B c4 ] - transposes into the Bishop's Opening and threatens Old Scollie's Mate - a pet name of mine for Scholar's Mate. Black can play either [ Q e7 ] or [ Q f6 ] or g6. I choose [ g6 ] because I feel this is the smoothest way of developing my pieces.
 [ R h e1 ] , [ a4 ]  (?) Too far. White is fully mobilised and is now able to - and must! - attack.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N x e4 ] , [ N x e5 ]  ? This is the oldest mistake in the book. Now I win a piece.
 [ e x d3 + ]  [ K d2 ] , [ Q a2 + ]  White now missed an opportunity to get back into the game. 22...[ R f5 ] keeps a large advantage but White can fight on.
 [ B g4 ] , [ d x e5 ]  Black's bishop move allows white to insist on the weak exchange of bishop for knight if Black plays 4 ... P[ x e5 ] 5 [ Q x d8 ] [ K x d8 ] 6 N[ x e5 ] wins a pawn for white.
 [ N x e6 + ]  [ B x e6 ]  [ N x e8 ]  [ R x e8 ] , [ f5 ]  At this point in the game I am up the exchange and soon a bishop. Even though I have about 2:30 on my clock I have a 5 second delay and I usually get low on time. If I don't blunder my queen this game is won.
 [ K e1 ] , [ N e7 ]  ?? Black finally does something although this loses a pawn (and essentially the game). If his king was strategically placed at [ c7 ] or [ b7 ] white would of lost his rook if he left it there(see its mobility in the current position?) and the bishop would have to stop guarding the pawn ( to prevent K[ b7 ] if [ R b8 ] wasn't played) which could of been promoted with the rook support. What if... 33. ... [ K d7 ] 34. [ R b8 ] K[ c7 ] 35. [ R b2 ] c5. Black would be far better as the knight could then be moved to protect the passed pawn with drawing if not winning potential. If for move 34 white moves his king again (??) moves would follow as such: 34. ... K[ c7 ] 35. [ B a6 ] (to prevent K[ b7 ] saving rook) d3! with black probably winning as the king would have to block the pawn on [ d2 ] white's pieces tied off ( the rook completely unmovable save the bad exchange [ R x c8 ] with black either deploying the king or rook (not both; one needs to protect the knight). Nevertheless black has lost his game.
 [ B x c3 ] , [ b x c3 ]  This to stay active I suppose but the king-side is the probem.
 [ R c1 ]  [ B f8 ]  [ R c8 ]  [ K g7 ]  [ K h2 ] , [ B b4 ]  Driving off the knight (threatening Rxb1).
 [ h3 ]  [ N g e5 ] , [ B x e5 ]  [ B h6 ] was interesting for black. I'll have answered NxN and white must have accepted g2xN.
 [ N f3 ]  [ e4 ] , [ N d4 ]  don't want to go home [ g1 ]  [ N f5 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N g3 ] , [ B d6 ]  he allows me to breath now ;)
 [ K b7 ]  [ R f7 + ]  [ K c6 ] , [ N a7 # ]  That's what I get for not paying close enough attention!
 [ b6 ] , [ Q c2 ]  Looking down a nice diagonal into the kingside supporting a possible [ [ e4 ] ] (not ready yet). If that bishop had have been at [ d3 ] the [ [ e4 ] ] would seem better. Enough said about the bishop!
 [ B c2 ] , [ N c6 ]  The Knight move prepares [ e5 ] which White immediately prevents while completing the Stonewall formation.
 [ N b3 ]  [ B g4 ] , [ Q x d4 ]  possible due to the pin on the [ c6 ] knight
 [ B x f7 + ]  [ K d7 ]  [ B e6 + ]  [ K c6 ] , [ B x g4 ]  This is the best response for white.
 [ f4 ]  [ g6 ] , [ e5 ]  Interesting white offering sacrificing an exchange for very dangerous attack 14...[ B x h1 ] (which was played in the game) .15.exf followed by 16.Nxe6-Qxf6( 16..fxe ??.17.Qxg6#).17.Nxf8-Kxf8.17.Qd2-Rg8.18.g5-hxg.19.fxg -Qe7.20.[ Q x d6 ] with slight advantage for white .
 [ B x f6 ]  [ B x f6 ] , [ B x b5 ]  the brave move!
 [ B f5 ]  [ h6 ]  [ N h5 ]  [ K e7 ] , [ g4 ]  Now the black kingside weaknesses are fixed. Note too that by forcing the black king to occupy [ e7 ] White has shielded his e3-pawn from pressure down the e-file.
 [ B x a1 ] , [ Q f3 ]  clearly desperate: already [ f5 ] will cost a full piece...
 [ N c3 ] , [ R d e1 ]  White must defend against the royal fork
 [ B a3 ]  [ f5 ]  [ e x f5 ]  [ g x f5 ]  [ R c6 ]  [ f x g6 ] , [ R x g6 + ]  I was well aware since 22.[ f x g6 ] that [ R x g6 ] will not reduce my attack possiblities.
 [ a6 ]  [ N b d4 ] , [ Q x b3 ]  My usual style is to remove queens early probably better is [ Q c7 ] keeping whites pawns isolated.
 [ R g5 ]  [ K h2 ] , [ B f7 ]  Well his Bishop's finally out of the way but now his own Rook spoils the activation of Black's K-side pawns.
 [ a3 ] , [ R b7 ]  Defends my a pawn and creates the possibility to double my rooks on the important b file.
 [ f5 ]  [ N g3 ] , [ Q x e1 + ]  i replied with my knight cause i didn't want to lose my queen...
 [ K x g7 ]  [ h5 ] , [ R h8 ]  11. ... Rh8! the only option if 11. ... [ g x h5 ] 12. [ Q g5 ]  [ N g8 ]  [ h x g6 ]  [ R x h1 ]  [ R x h1 ]  [ f x g6 ]  [ N g5 ] , [ N d f6 ]  15. Nd-[ f6 ] ! good move preventing the white from [ R h7 ]  [ b6 ]  [ e5 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ f x e5 ] , [ N d5 ]  Surly [ N h5 ] is more logical
 [ N e5 ]  [ R x e5 ]  [ R c8 c7 ] , [ R x c5 ]  Funny for me to say this but I actually think [ R x c5 ] was a slight error. Not overly important still a winning move but I think [ R e1 ] was better.
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ c4 ]  i almost always open d4-[ c4 ] as white
 [ K x e8 ]  [ Q e5 + ] , [ K d8 ]  If black exchanges queens loses the rook so he can only hide. If [ Q b8 + ] after [ K d7 ] the black queen has no check anymore and white loses.
 [ Q x g4 + ]  [ K h1 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ R c1 ] , [ d4 ]  Putting an end to things quickly and driving the bishop off the c1-[ h5 ] diagonal so I can pick up the rook as well.
 [ R d6 + ] , [ K c2 ]  The best even if...
 [ a4 ] , [ g5 ]  white now moves forward.
 [ N c4 ]  [ Q d5 ] , [ h3 ]  White obviously doesn't want trades as in 22.[ Q f3 ] Qxf3.
 [ K f8 ] , [ N b6 ]  I don't care if he takes my Knight.
 [ Q b6 ] , [ Q c1 ]  It's true my kingside is blocked but I have plenty of play on the queenside.
 [ d x c5 ]  [ R f d8 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ B x g2 ]  [ R x g2 ]  [ b x c5 ]  [ R x c5 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ R x c8 ] , [ R x c8 ]  After all those exchanges we will see Anand having to retreat all his pieces into defensive positions
 [ N c6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e x d6 ]  [ e ]  [ p ] , [ B x d6 ]  The most common move though Gallagher regards [ Q x d6 ] as more accurate.
 [ R e2 + ]  [ K g1 ] , [ R d1 # ]  Simple mate finished me off. I guess we've learnt-don't do [ h4 ] as your opening please. If your opponent does-have a party!
 [ Q g6 + ]  [ K g8 ]  [ h4 ] , [ Q d8 ]  Stopping 29. [ g5 ] but allowing White to double rooks on the c-file.
 [ N g e2 ]  [ N b4 ] , [ d4 ]  [ d4 ] did not help white at all.
 [ B x c6 ] , [ b x c6 ]  I saw how important it was to recapture with the b pawn on [ c6 ] since white has to use one more tempo to recapture the [ B c3 ] black now prevents a passed pawn on the d file but even more importantly black will own the b file therefore he will be the one with the initiative in this double rook ending. The only problem was the clock. To reach time control at move 40 white still has 14 minutes while black has only 5 minutes (!)
 [ N f6 ]  [ R x g8 ]  [ K x g8 ] , [ f5 ]  hard to understand: a direct [ R g3 + ] - or better [ B e3 ] - would have been more effective...
 [ N g5 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ N b4 ]  [ c3 ]  [ N d3 + ]  [ B x d3 ]  [ B x d3 ]  [ N a3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ g3 ] , [ e5 ]  I now control the center!
 [ N g4 ]  [ Q f4 ]  [ Q x f4 ] , [ R x f4 ]  27. ……. [ R x f4 ] - the queens are now traded off.
 [ B x c3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ g3 ]  [ R e8 ] , [ Q d3 ]  attacking the castle thinking about breaking in.
 [ B g4 ]  [ B x g4 ]  [ N x g4 ]  [ N x g4 ] , [ Q x g4 ]  In oing this white is self-releasing me of the [ d5 ] threat not having the knight defending this square anymore.
 [ R c6 + ]  [ K a7 ] , [ R b6 ]  Now his king is caught on two squares and the pawns are free to adance.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ B d6 ]  unusual: let'ts keep it at that...
 [ a5 ] , [ N x d4 ]  Ok. Is it not a winning position? So what happened?
 [ f5 ] , [ N h3 ]  The Knight may be an fickle resourse in this Pawn's structure most of all if can be placed on [ f4 ] [ f2 ] or [ g5 ] but many things must happen first
 [ B d4 + ]  [ K b7 ] , [ B e6 ]  This restricts the c8-square and White is forced to allow Black to make progress.
 [ h x g4 ] , [ N f6 ]  White captures bishop on G4 Black retreats Nf6. At this stage White has regained control. Black is quite limited in options. Bishop rooks and Queen are locked in by pawns and white bishop is strategically positioned
 [ K e3 ]  [ f x g4 ]  [ h x g4 ]  [ g6 ]  [ K f3 ] , [ B c7 ]  Bishop gives the place for the king threats [ K d5 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ K d6 ]  [ K e4 ] , [ h5 ]  a passed pawn.
 [ Q b2 ]  [ Q d3 ] , [ R e1 ]  But not 29 Rd1? [ N f3 ] 30 [ g x f3 ] [ Q x d1 ] 31 [ K g2 ] [ R g6 ] 32 [ K h3 ] [ Q x f3 ] 33 [ K h4 ] Qg4#. Now however the threat of [ N f3 ] gains a tempo for Black's attack.
 [ Q c7 ]  [ K h1 ] , [ R f b8 ]  Rfb8? This move is a mistake which allows white to win the exchange with 19. Ba6! [ R b6 ] 20. [ B x b6 ] axb6. Which may well have been a decisive advantage in this game. Luckily for me my opponent also missed this.
 [ K e4 ]  [ g4 ]  [ K f4 ]  [ g3 ]  [ K g4 ] , [ g2 ]  White resigned. Mendez is now the highest-rated player I have won against but he also beat me in our other game in the same tournament.
 [ f x e5 ]  [ f x e5 ] , [ B e6 ]  The kingside is closed. Now Black can safely chop on the queenside and do damage to White's position.
 [ Q d5 ] , [ K f1 ]  and more why did I do this??
 [ B x f3 ] , [ R x f3 ]  13. [ N x f3 ] Nxe4. My rook can now maneouvre to [ g3 ] or [ h3 ] quite nicely.
 [ e4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ d5 ]  The French Defence
 [ B b5 ] , [ R e2 e4 ]  not better is [ R d2 ] [ B x e5 ] [ K h3 ] [ B g7 ] [ B x b7 ] [ R c5 ] [ b3 ] [ R c7 ] [ B e4 ] Rc1!...
 [ R c1 ]  [ R f d8 ]  [ N b5 ] , [ N b4 ]  In my inexpert opinion 13... N-[ B4 ] is the better move.
 [ R a e1 ]  [ N b6 ]  [ N b4 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ B d3 ] , [ a5 ]  I don't like this knight!!
 [ K x e2 ]  [ K c4 ] , [ h4 ]  Now this was truly my worst error (besides 13. [ N x e5 ] obviously). Before this move I actually had a won position (you can plug the position before this into a chess engine to make sure) even though I hadn't realized it. The best move would have simply been to go after the enemy pawns. Doing this I relinquish my pawns' ability to support each other and jump forward two squares. Even if the enemy king went for my pawns I could have simply played [ h3 ] or [ g3 ] and my opponent would only get away with one pawn leaving my other pawn to move up and join my king after I had killed his two pawns. After this move the position was drawn. Well I guess I learned my lesson.
 [ Q x g2 ]  [ Q x g2 + ] , [ K x g2 ]  And here I got struck by luck again and saw the possibilities.
 [ R x d6 ] , [ K e7 ]  Now Black really isn't threatening the White rook (which can simply move away) but the text does free the other Black rook. That said now look at the White kingside.
 [ e x f6 ]  [ d x c3 ]  [ B x c3 ]  [ g x f6 ] , [ B x f6 ]  At least I win the pawn.
 [ K h6 ] , [ R f3 # ]  However black moves its king and I move my rook across to [ f3 ] which gives me the game with a discovered checkmate from my dark bishop at [ c1 ]  [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ e3 ] , [ a6 ]  This limits the squares for White's B.
 [ a3 ]  [ B x c3 + ]  [ b x c3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B g5 ]  [ d6 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ N b d7 ]  Black has a trapped bishop
 [ R f1 ]  [ d5 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ R c c8 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N g8 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ B x c5 ]  [ b x c5 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ N e7 ]  [ R b1 ]  [ c4 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ N g6 ]  [ b3 ]  [ c x b3 ]  [ R x b3 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ f4 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ R x b7 ]  [ R x c3 ]  [ K d2 ]  [ R a3 ]  [ R f b1 ] , [ N c5 ]  Good spot for the knight - provides many options.
 [ B d3 ]  [ N x f2 ]  [ Q x f2 ] , [ f5 ]  Now I need to open the e and f files in order to activate my advantage in Rooks.
 [ Q x g4 ] , [ B c6 ]  There is no chance for black now but if there were it would be on this diagonal.
 [ K d3 ] , [ K x d5 ]  White is seriously on the defensive.
 [ Q b6 ]  [ B e3 ] , [ B b7 ]  finishing development...
 [ d4 ]  [ N d7 ] , [ B g5 ]  I made this Bishop thrust in part to provoke [ f6 ] which I believed weaken his Kingside. True it helps bolster his center and I lose a tempo but given the play thus far I felt I had a tempo to toss.
 [ Q a5 ] , [ B x h6 ]  Instead of taking the bishop what about white's b pawn? Sure white's black bishop could then pick off the rook but then white's a rook falls to the black bishop. Unless white moves the rook (Rb1) in which case black must respond with Bg7. KxB follows BxB. If white opts for the rook trade black makes out a pawn ahead.
 [ c4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ d5 ] , [ c5 ]  This move is so obscure it doesn't even have a name at least not one that I could find. The games I could find my database peak at around 2200 so that would explain the lack of popularity. But why is this seemingly natural move "bad"? White is gaining space on the Q-side and puts the c-pawn out of harm's way. Well here are a few basic reasons why this move is worse than almost anything else except for putting something en prise. White moves the same pawn a second time so he loses the first move advantage. He also releases the center tension to his disfavor since now Black has the straightforward plan of playing [ e5 ] and create a weak pawn on c5. There is also the other possibility of play with [ b6 ] like I did in the game and that is also just as good if not better.
 [ Q f7 ] , [ N h4 ]  ptitroque: 29... [ Q c7 ] ?! Gives us a strong menace : they cannot prevent us to play [ [ [ e4 ] ] ] and we have a mating menace. If they play [ [ [ f3 ] ] ] we can play [ Q g3 + ] and their knight gets it. Please gentlement check carefully for it's edge to edge situation bluenoser: Qc7? I was thinking [ Q c7 ] with thoughts of pushing our e5p to e4. with the threath of Qh2. Just taking a quick look at this so far. ptitroque: 29... [ Q c7 ] !? The more I think about it the better it seems. We might get an overwhelming attack roneshet: problems... if they move their knight to [ g6 ] after we do [ Q c7 ] we cam be in a great deal of trouble. 29. ... [ Q c7 ] 30. N[ g6 ] [ [ [ e4 ] ] ] Than what will we do? say they do f3... 31. [ [ [ f3 ] ] ] [ Q g3 + ] 32. [ K f1 ] We should not open our e column... It's dangerous!!! ptitroque: @ roneshed 29... [ Q c7 ] 30. N[ g6 ] [ [ [ e4 ] ] ] 31. [ [ [ f3 ] ] ] [ Q g3 ] 32. [ R d2 ] (forced) [ Q e1 ] chessmate
 [ N x f2 ] , [ Q d2 ]  Qd2...Her only square!
 [ f6 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ B h3 ]  [ B f7 ] , [ O-O ]  white allows the trade of bishops which should be avoided because he is down material
 [ R h f1 + ]  [ K e7 ]  [ d4 ] , [ N x b4 ]  There's one pawn
 [ N c6 ]  [ N e2 ] , [ a6 ]  !? There was no threat of a piece on b5.
 [ N d5 ]  [ Q x f2 ]  [ f6 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ f x g7 + ]  [ K x g7 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ B g6 ]  [ R h g1 ]  [ Q x f7 ]  [ R d f1 ]  [ Q e8 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ Q e6 ] , [ R x g6 + ]  Blasting through the defense with sheer weight of numbers.
 [ B e4 ] , [ d5 ]  This Pawn advances with tempo as White is forced to move his wandering Bishop yet again.
 [ B x e6 + ]  [ B x e6 ]  [ g3 ] , [ f x g4 ]  
 [ R x a3 ]  [ f5 ] , [ Q a4 ]  Avoiding the threat and putting more pressure on the [ a7 ] pawn
 [ R g1 ] , [ N e5 ]  whoops.
 [ e x f6 ]  [ R x e3 ] , [ B x e3 ]  I decide to recapture with the bishop. [ f x e3 ] might be more appropriate since it also defends my pawn on [ f6 ] but after [ B f5 ] that line is blocked anyway.
 [ Q d1 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ B x h6 ] , [ B x f6 ]  I think the knight take was better as it delivers check. He ends up saving both queen and rook by delivering check himself.
 [ K h2 ] , [ Q c5 ]  black did not kill white pawn if so white queen to [ f8 ] = mate
 [ d3 ] , [ d5 ]  And the fun starts.
 [ a6 ]  [ a3 ]  [ b5 ] , [ B b3 ]  A better deal for black on the trade but still not good enough. Why allow his knight to advance on the trade?
 [ N b d2 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B c2 ] , [ N x f2 ]  interesting move Botvinik shows some courage with this exchange however this move going to lead a very complicated game in the following of the game .
 [ h4 ] , [ a6 ]  his king is totally cut off now.
 [ K h1 ]  [ Q x c3 ]  [ d x c6 ]  [ B x c6 ]  [ b5 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ Q d5 ] , [ O-O-O ]  Very conveniently able to castle and protect both sides.
 [ N e4 ]  [ B b6 ]  [ N g5 ] , [ K e7 ]  Defending the e-pawn whilst accepting the loss of the h-pawn
 [ d x c6 ] , [ N e2 ]  Getting the knight out of harms way.
 [ B c5 ] , [ N a4 ]  The text move (?) is a nice forking attack but it allows black to free both queen and knight from danger. Better was [14.Bxc5] for an equal trade and material edge.
 [ B e5 ]  [ f4 ]  [ R h5 ] , [ f x e5 ]  The Pawn fork wins another piece but Black doesn't give up.
 [ B g2 ] , [ R h7 ]  Now that's just hideous
 [ e4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ] , [ N f6 ]  The most agressive line in the Scandinavian. It may be that this line should be considered ´incorrect´ but at my level I am unlikely to encounter opponents that can actually prove this and there are seceral lines that can lead to very agressive and tactically interesting games.
 [ B g4 ] , [ B e2 ]  Breaking the pin with an otherwise useless bishop.
 [ b5 ]  [ g3 ]  [ a6 ]  [ K g2 ]  [ b4 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ a5 ]  [ N e6 ]  [ B c3 ]  [ N g5 ]  [ h6 ]  [ N f7 ]  [ h5 ]  [ g x h5 ]  [ g x h5 ]  [ R c7 ]  [ N d2 ]  [ e5 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ g4 ]  [ h x g4 ]  [ h x g4 ]  [ a4 ]  [ g5 ]  [ R e6 ]  [ N h6 + ]  [ K f8 ]  [ N g4 ] , [ N e4 ]  Black's position is close to critical white is going to play 36.[ N f6 ] with mortal threat g5-g6-[ g7 ] (36. ... Bxe5? 37. [ B x e5 ] [ R x e5 ] 38.Nd7+). Black tries to prevent but without success. The best move for black would be 35. ... [ b3 ] 36.ax[ b3 ] ax[ b3 ] 37.[ R b7 ] (37.Rxc6? [ b2 ] and white has to give away the rook for the pawn b)
 [ Q d6 + ]  [ f4 ]  [ g x f4 + ] , [ N x f4 ]  having considered that [ e5 ] would not have been a real threat: [ N4 ] could have be gone to [ d5 ] or [ h5 ] with great comfort.
 [ a3 ] , [ f6 + ]  If Thomas plays 20...KxP 21 Q-N5ch is devastating.
 [ h x g6 ] , [ Q g7 # ]  33. [ Q g7 ] MATE!! - yup there it is Glenda in all her splendour is doing what she always wanted to do give the enemy king that kiss of death aaah. Now there is another player a certain Master that Glenda would just lurve to do this to - I will leave you to guess who!
 [ e x f6 ]  [ e ]  [ p ] , [ + ]  Without thinking!
 [ d6 ]  [ d3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N b d2 ]  [ b5 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ h3 ]  [ B e6 ] , [ N h2 ]  Starting to attack on the King´s side.
 [ R f d8 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ Q c7 ] , [ Q b2 ]  With the idea [ R b1 ] but actually it is not a very deep plan
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B c4 ] , [ N f6 ]  The 2 knights. Usually black either plays this or Be7.
 [ K h6 ]  [ g4 ]  [ f x g4 ] , [ R e6 + ]  ? This allows the Black King down to h5; better was to first restrain him with 29.hxg4.
 [ e x d5 ] , [ B g5 ]  Spielmann knows that the pin is mightier than the sword.
 [ O-O ] , [ h6 ]  Black's plan is to play f5-[ f4 ] and [ g5 ] to pawnstorm my kingside but he ends up overextending his position giving my forces access to his king.
 [ B d6 ] , [ R c d8 ]  Now I have two unprotected bishops lined up acknowledging my weak [ g7 ] bishop. There is bound to be an exchange but if my opponent wasn't careful he would have lost one bishop. Although he did conduct the exchange without error his real downfall comes afterward as you will see.
 [ d4 ]  [ e x d4 ] , [ Q x d4 ]  personally i dont like having a queen in the middle of the board so early on however it is a dangerous threat and in this game i ignored it. also look already how black is behind in development! due to not playing kings pawn openings enough myself as white i am a bit of a stranger to the tricks and traps.
 [ e6 ] , [ B d3 ]  the first major piece to move
 [ B e6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ Q d7 ]  Black is still hoping to castle Queen-side but White's pressure is relentless.
 [ N h6 ]  [ h x g6 ]  [ h x g6 ] , [ N e2 ]  The start of a long knight manoeuvre that nearly cost me the game. At this stage the aim was simply to attack [ g6 ] from f4.
 [ b x a6 ] , [ N a4 ]  19. Na4? - this will allow a combo that should win at least a pawn.
 [ R f b8 ]  [ b3 ] , [ c4 ]  I don't see what this does.
 [ K g2 ] , [ N d3 ]  I am trying to get out of the way of my own pawns. I have no grandiose ideas of winning the b pawn or anything else here. And I don't retreat the knight behind the pawns. I want to maintain some tactical threats down here if I can just to hinder white while I push those central pawns.
 [ g5 ] , [ N c3 ]  White completes development so more pieces are available to defend the kingside; a sensible decision.
 [ O-O ]  [ R e8 ]  [ a3 ] , [ B d6 ]  After a build-up phase White's game does look the better developed. But that +4 edge that Black has is hard to go past.
 [ R x d1 + ]  [ K x d1 ] , [ f5 ]  Now Black can win very quickly. Black's 5 kingside pawns will easily break through against White's 3 kingside pawns. White has a queenside pawn majority but it is immobilised by Black's perfectly placed king. If White moves his king to defend the kingside Black's king kills all White's queenside pawns and pushes his own queenside pawns home. If White's king tries manoeuvring Kd1-c1-b1-[ a2 ] in an attempt to push his queenside pawns Black plays ...[ K x c2 ] and then pushes his kingside pawns: White's plan is too slow.
 [ c x d4 ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ B x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ B x e8 ] , [ N b3 ]  This is the "smart" intermediate. It attacks the rook to get the knight out of the rooks' attack. What Black missed (and he did not see until post mortem analysis) is that white could play the identical intermediate 30. [ B d7 ] which wins the game.
 [ N c3 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ h6 ] , [ O-O ]  Nothing special happening.
 [ N x c3 ]  [ b x c3 ]  [ c x b5 ] , [ N g5 ]  Took me a while to rationalize this move. I felt that [ B e2 ] or [ B a3 ] may have been slightly better though this move doesn't have anything wrong with it.
 [ N h5 ] , [ B e2 ]  But that game had continued with 12...[ N e8 ] 13. [ B e2 ] [ N c7 ] etc. My opponent finds a more aggressive set up.
 [ c3 ] , [ N f6 ]  White tries Alapin's Variation not nearly as popular as 2. [ N f3 ] but still it's the 3rd most popular amongst the experts in the World DB and it does quite well for white. Black responds with the main line which invites some immediate abuse by white's pawns not unlike Alekhine's Defense.
 [ R d8 + ]  [ K h7 ] , [ f x e3 ]  44. [ f x e3 ] - that rook check has become little more than a spite check. Glenda now moves to [ f1 ] as mentioned in my previous note.
 [ N d7 ] , [ B d3 ]  I am trying to argue that Black has misplaced his knight.
 [ Q x b5 ]  [ B b6 ]  [ R b4 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ R d1 ]  [ Q x a2 ]  [ R a4 ]  [ Q c2 ] , [ R a a1 ]  
 [ d6 ]  [ d3 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ O-O ] , [ a6 ]  This forces the exchange right away.
 [ N x d4 ]  [ c x d4 ] , [ b6 ]  Desperately trying for safety of king with some counter attack with B diagonal.
 [ B x c4 ]  [ Q x c4 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ Q a2 ] , [ N b4 ]  second paw lost ...
 [ B g3 ]  [ Q a5 + ] , [ c3 ]  Now I started to look for more "funny" moves.
 [ N f6 ] , [ d4 ]  Always good move in this position breaking Black's center.
 [ B b7 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ B e4 ] , [ Q c7 ]  The natural end of the [ B e4 ] combination. I am fairly pleased with my position since 15 [ R f e1 ] [ c5 ] 16 [ B x b7 ] [ Q x b7 ] 17 dx[ c5 ] bx[ c5 ] leaves black with an isolated c-pawn and a marginally bad bishop.
 [ b6 ]  [ c x b6 ]  [ c x b6 ]  [ K f7 ]  [ R d1 ] , [ Q e4 + ]  The winning move! To be fair this move could probably have been played earlier with similar effect but my plan had been to win the weak d pawn so I didn't even consider it until I was forced to move my Q by Rd1. White obviously didn't see it either.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ d3 ] , [ d6 ]  I hate this opening...
 [ d4 ] , [ f5 ]  The Dutch!
 [ b6 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ N x e4 ] , [ R e7 x e4 ]  22. Re7xe4?! - why not capture with the rook on [ e1 ] maintaining the "Bone in the Throat?" My queenside pawns would have looked extremely edible to said white rook.
 [ d x e5 ]  [ R h3 ] , [ Q x g2 ]  black is now in trouble
 [ Q x e4 ]  [ B f3 ]  [ Q x f3 ]  [ R x f3 ] , [ B f6 ]  18. ....... [ B f6 ] - Fou Lenoir gets out of the [ f4 ] pawn's attack. This is a typical near endgame with black having a piece for pawn material advantage. Such a quiet peaceful looking position you would never believe that it had sprung from such a manic opening would you?
 [ R e f1 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ a4 ]  [ a5 ]  [ N c5 ]  [ B c8 ] , [ N g e4 ]  Trying to be more attacking this move leads to an almost fatal weakness.
 [ R f8 ]  [ R x a7 ]  [ R f2 ]  [ K b4 ]  [ R x h2 ] , [ c5 + ]  Now we can see the difference from the variation given in the last note. Here all of White's pieces are xcellently coordinated supporting the passed c-pawn.
 [ Q d3 ] , [ Q x d3 ]  Could not see anything better for him.
 [ Q d8 ] , [ B f5 ]  Now that I own the file I can reposition the bishop even deeper into his camp. Destination...e6.
 [ Q c2 ] , [ Q f6 ]  miscalculated... only saw the discoverd check...
 [ N x c6 ] , [ N f3 ]  try to get the queen to give my king some breathing room...
 [ a6 ] , [ B x c6 ]  a must. going back with the bishop seems to be bad.
 [ N c3 ] , [ d6 ]  A scheveningen type of set-up. I don't think it's black's best move but I don't think it's a mistake either. It makes the development of my dark squared bishop a little bit iffy but gives room for my light squared bishop to come and play. I'm planning on developing the dark squared bishop with a fianchetto.
 [ c6 ]  [ f4 ] , [ e5 ]  This move is rather poor in my opinion. It invites white to blast open the center and the f file.
 [ h3 ]  [ N f5 + ]  [ K g6 ] , [ N g3 ]  seems lost well actualy it doesn't its an obvious win for white
 [ Q x e6 + ]  [ Q e7 ]  [ Q x e7 + ]  [ N x e7 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ B h6 ]  [ b3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N c3 ]  [ c6 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N d6 ]  [ R f6 ]  [ B a3 ]  [ c5 ]  [ c4 ]  [ R x d6 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ R x d5 ]  [ O-O ]  [ e4 ]  [ N e1 ] , [ R f8 ]  Mm I thought the point of pushing the knight from defending P[ d2 ] was for RxPd2.
 [ N d4 ]  [ Q x f7 + ]  [ K d8 ] , [ K d1 ]  after [ B b3 ] [ Q x g2 ] so there is not much choice... [ B g4 + ] is a serious threat after [ f3 ] Bf5...
 [ R x c5 ] , [ Q e3 ]  Hopefully i can bully a mistake out of my opponent....
 [ B d2 ]  [ f x e4 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ N b6 ]  [ b3 ]  [ R a c8 ]  [ R a e1 ]  [ c4 ]  [ b4 ]  [ Q f7 ] , [ B e3 ]  ? Mistake. Apparently he forgot about his [ c3 ] pawn.
 [ K h8 ]  [ B x c4 ]  [ d x c4 ]  [ R f3 ]  [ R g8 ] , [ Q h4 ]  Intending at a minimum QxRP ch followed by QxBP winning back my two Pawns.
 [ a4 ]  [ K e2 ]  [ K d6 ] , [ g4 ]  24. [ g4 ] - to hold back f5.
 [ B c6 ]  [ B d5 ] , [ B x d5 ]  The only move. Letting the bishop live loses the rook on a8.
 [ K e2 ] , [ N e5 ]  White's kingside pawns will fall now. White should've kept them back.
 [ B f1 ] , [ K c7 ]  from now on I decided not to advance my c pawn any further as it restricts white's knight activity and so I need to get my king back on [ c7 ] a dark square were it controls [ d8 ] [ d7 ] and [ d6 ] releasing my pieces for attack purposes
 [ B x e5 ]  [ N x e5 ] , [ Q x e5 ]  Ok but at cost of my good bishop. Oh well...
 [ B d7 ]  [ Q d2 ] , [ a5 ]  ?! Risky and aggressive. The thought is to push this pawn all the way to [ a3 ] if possible with chances to life the Black Rook to any number of squares from which it can attack the White center from the side. It does create weaknesses on [ b5 ] and [ b6 ] though which White may exploit...
 [ B d3 ]  [ e6 ] , [ N g1 f3 ]  All of the previous moves are "standard opening theory" played in thousands of games before. Kasparov's next move came as a great surprise.
 [ a5 ]  [ f3 ]  [ B a6 ]  [ b x c4 ] , [ b4 ]  32. ……. [ B4 ] - mmmm crafty he does not recapture on [ c4 ] due to the fact that he can now pin my knight on e2. Nasty nasty!
 [ Q c6 ] , [ Q e6 ]  37. ..... [ Q e6 ] - Glenda is slightly more active but as she is tied to the defense of my [ d7 ] knight will this do any good? I hardly dare breathe.
 [ d x e5 ] , [ Q f2 ]  It is now Black's turn to threaten mate!
 [ N g6 ]  [ f5 ]  [ N e5 ] , [ B x e5 ]  Now I destroy the knight which is the last defense of the king against the f-pawns advance!
 [ R a2 ]  [ R d8 d2 ] , [ R a3 ]  36. Ra3? - I think that white would have done better to have exchanged rooks even if he is going to be an exchange plus pawn to the bad somehow I feel though that this will only prolong the game.
 [ Q d8 ]  [ R f1 f2 ]  [ Q e8 ]  [ R f2 f3 ]  [ Q d8 ] , [ B d3 ]  Because the queen is coming to [ e4 ] aiming for h7.
 [ Q c2 ] , [ d x c4 ]  Hard decision so many lines and threats... but the only one I was reasonably sure about was black's response after...
 [ d x e4 ]  [ N x e5 ] , [ Q g5 ]  Threatening my N. So I decide to exchange in order to avoid losing my N. I was hesitant but realize that there's no alternative. And I have to take with the B. Now I had considered 8.[ N x c6 ] with the idea of 8...[ b x c6 ] 9.[ B x c6 + ] to win that Rook. But after thinking about what Jack Stockel emphasized 10 days ago combined with it being a weakness I realized that it was a mistake. Therefore I asked myself what Jack said of why Terence would do that. Turns out that he would not because if I played 8.[ N x c6 ] 8...[ Q x g2 ] immediately follows. And if I try a discover check then ...Bd7! would immediately win a piece. Either my [ B b5 ] or [ N e5 ] which I didn't want to allow. So I decided that an immediate check was best. I'm still going down a pawn but it's better then losing a piece.
 [ N b6 ] , [ B b5 + ]  now I'm stuck. no initiative down in points. the B can't help because it just HAD to go pawn-grabbin.
 [ R d3 ] , [ Q f1 ]  Qf1. White steps into the forced mate. [ Q f1 ] leads to 28...[ Q x f4 + ] [ R g3 ] [ Q x g3 + ] [ K h1 ] [ Q h2 # ] and checkmate. White really should have taken the rook. It would have allowed white to get back into the game.
 [ N c3 ] , [ f5 ]  Alekhine variation here.
 [ R d7 ]  [ R f7 ]  [ R d8 + ]  [ R f8 ]  [ R d7 ] , [ R e8 ]  Game note: "33…[ R e8 ] he breaks the cat and mouse. I'm not looking for 3 move repetition just can’t figure how to move forward."
 [ R b7 ]  [ g4 ]  [ f x g4 + ]  [ h x g4 ]  [ K g7 ] , [ R e5 ]  This move has to be played in order to stop ideas like [ h5 ] that can happen after 35. Ke4?! h5!. More or less equivalent was [ g5 ] in my opinion.
 [ R d8 + ]  [ K e7 ]  [ R d7 + ]  [ K e8 ] , [ R x h7 ]  A precautionary capture as a prelude to [ R b7 ] (or Rb8). This highlights the power of a Rook BEHIND a pawn vs a Rook ahead of it. I even entertain the idea of my own pawn promotion!
 [ N x e4 ] , [ d x e5 ]  Rather unusual. I think [ B d3 ] is stronger
 [ R x c8 ] , [ Q f5 ]  I also would've played this. But the reason is because Erika is threatening mate. Having said that I'd follow up with a later ...[ Q h5 ] which would force white to move his [ R f1 ] to prevent mate or lose the Nf3.
 [ R x a8 + ]  [ B x a8 ]  [ N x b5 ] , [ Q b6 ]  I need to keep [ c7 ] defended and I'd like to chase this Knight far away with 16. [ N c3 ] [ Q b4 ] 17. [ N a2 ] Qa5.
 [ N f3 ] , [ N c6 ]  Typical so far.
 [ N f6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d5 ] , [ e3 ]  White has chosen a sort of Queen's gambit declined position to avoid the Nimzo. Do I play [ c5 ] myself ?
 [ K b6 ]  [ B d1 ]  [ K x a5 ]  [ K b7 ]  [ K b4 ]  [ K b6 ]  [ K c4 ]  [ h6 ] , [ K d5 ]  There I had to think deeply about how to win. At first the win seems pretty easy: I'm up one bishop for a pawn. Yet...
 [ e6 ] , [ e4 ]  [ e3 ] a mirror move of Black's [ e6 ] was my other move. I choice [ e4 ] was to be a little more aggressive. Tempting a pawn exchange knowing if 5... dxe4. 6. Nxe4. Black knight unable to take my knight because my bishop pinning his knight against his Queen. My hope is that he will turn down the exchange so I can advance my e pawn to [ e5 ] and pressure his knight.
 [ N f3 ] , [ R x a1 ]  i'm now winning on points
 [ R c8 ] , [ Q c1 ]  14. [ Q c1 ] - I do not like the Witch sitting in front of Henry so Glenda puts the question to her.
 [ Q g5 ]  [ N x g6 ] , [ Q x g6 ]  ? The final mistake.
 [ e4 ] , [ d x e4 ]  On the money. [ B e5 ] to threaten the back ranks.
 [ N c4 ]  [ Q c3 ]  [ Q b6 ]  [ Q b3 ]  [ Q x b3 ] , [ N x b3 ]  The end-game stage begins with the Queens now off the board.
 [ K a1 ] , [ B e6 + ]  Safely returning the bishop. Black will slowly build up on the a file with 2 rooks and the knight.
 [ B b2 ]  [ B e8 ]  [ B c1 ] , [ a4 ]  !
 [ Q x c4 ] , [ Q h4 + ]  and this leads to mate
 [ K g4 ] , [ R a5 ]  Protecting the h-pawn and allowing [ K h7 ]  [ c6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ d5 ] , [ e5 ]  The Caro Advance.
 [ R x f5 ] , [ R f e1 ]  Black won back a pawn and White sensibly avoids exchanging rooks which would have given Black a won game.
 [ B c5 ]  [ R x d8 ] , [ R x d8 ]  17. ...... [ R x d8 ] - now 1 pair of rooks is exchanged.
 [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ e6 ]  The game went a normal Icelandic gambit with white having played the good [ N c3 ] instead of c4.
 [ K e4 ] , [ h5 ]  The black king has finally gained access to the square [ e3 ] but it is now too late as the following variation shows: 59. ..K[ e3 ] 60. [ B c5 + ] [ K e2 ] (or 60. ...[ K d2 ] 61. [ [ h6 ] ] [ K x c2 ] 62. [ B d4 ] and the h-pawn promotes) 61. [ [ h6 ] ] [ f2 ] 62. Bx[ f2 ] Bx[ f2 ] 63 [ h7 ] Bd4. Now there follows the decisive break 64. b4! [ a x b4 ] 65. [ a5 ] and the bishop cannot stop both passed pawns e.g. 65. ...[ K d2 ] 66. [ a6 ] [ K x c2 ] 67. [ a7 ] Bx[ a7 ] 68. [ h8 Q ] [ b3 ] 69. [ Q h7 + ] [ K c1 ] 70. Qx[ a7 ] [ b2 ] 71. [ Q c5 + ] and White wins in standard fashion by forcing the black king i n front of the b-pawn and then bringing his own king closer.
 [ N x h5 ] , [ Q d5 ]  White threatens instant death at f7.
 [ R a6 ]  [ Q c4 ] , [ Q x c4 ]  Black is swapping quenns.
 [ b4 ] , [ c4 ]  Now black's plan is to bring the c and d pawn to the second line to oblige white to exchange pieces against pawns.
 [ N c3 ] , [ Q d6 ]  And that' when James prepares for the K side attack which is quite nasty for me. I need to be very careful but as with bhidragon I missed the overall picture here.
 [ R a8 + ]  [ K f7 ] , [ R a5 ]  Threatening the loose pawn at e5.
 [ R e2 ]  [ R f6 ] , [ a4 ]  Progressing a passed pawn.
 [ Q f8 ]  [ b4 ] , [ h6 ]  To prevent blacks DSB from attacking my knight.
 [ Q h7 + ]  [ K f8 ] , [ Q x g6 ]  At this point I'd had more than enough as mate is imminent. Thanks for reading please comment.
 [ B e7 ] , [ h4 ]  All king-side pawns are on the 4th rank. IMO it was too immediate to launch the attack. I'd prefer advancing the h-pawn further than rank 3 if Black castles in the king-side a typical line being [ B b5 ] (or more aggressive Bc4)/O-O/Qe1/[ Q g3 ] etc. to proceed with the 'steamroller' scenario.
 [ R d3 ]  [ K g2 ]  [ K h7 ]  [ h4 ]  [ B f7 ] , [ N f5 ]  Not so much supporting the d pawn as planning to move to [ e3 ] so that the pawn could advance to [ d5 ] at some point. One advantage of having the knight vs bishop is that the pawn is relatively safe as long as it is on a dark square however white needs to be careful whenever he attempts to push the pawn onto a light square that the bishop can reach.
 [ O-O-O ] , [ a6 ]  It seems Black wants to play ..[ [ b5 ] ] as soon as possible but his pieces are worryingly underdeveloped and it's not clear that ..[ [ b5 ] ] is all that powerful at this point. He should continue ..[ B d7 ] and ..[ N e5 ]  [ b x c6 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N h7 ]  [ g x h5 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ h x g6 ]  [ B x g6 ]  [ h4 ]  [ d x e5 ] , [ Q g2 ]  Trading queens helps the defender but Black should know better than to expect White to comply. White's queen now enters the kingside attack with tempo.
 [ a6 ]  [ B a4 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ O-O ]  Ordinary stuff so far. The Morphy Defense.
 [ Q e7 ] , [ N x e4 + ]  13. [ N x e4 + ] - the other central pawn drops off and I land another check.
 [ d6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B d2 ]  [ B g4 ] , [ h3 ]  Putting the question to the bishop!
 [ Q x a4 ]  [ N f5 ] , [ K f3 ]  decided to try to get my king to the right side as a time controller. i have to be careful if i go after his [ d5 ] pawn or when i attack with [ a3 ] and he replies with [ [ b3 ] ] i can see hes setting up a fork on [ d4 ] with his knight when my queen would be on [ [ b3 ] ] after taking his pawn
 [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ] , [ B c4 ]  I thought he was going to play [ N x d4 ]  [ N g5 ] , [ e6 ]  What I should have played was [ h6 ]  [ Q x d4 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ a6 ]  [ B x c6 + ]  [ b x c6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ c5 ] , [ Q e3 ]  I'm surprised he didn't play Re1.
 [ N d5 ] , [ Q h5 ]  I see the mate threat by Qxh2.
 [ K e7 ] , [ R b6 ]  There's nothing wrong with this move but if White were to play 41.b6! then there would be no stopping the pawns reaching promotion. If that had happened I would have resigned
 [ N e5 ] , [ N f6 ]  ?! perhaps [ B x f5 ] but the intruder is now immobile. This also protects the isolanti.
 [ N f3 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ B x e4 ] , [ N f6 ]  Developing his knight to a better square with tempo.
 [ K b6 ]  [ K f7 ]  [ K c5 ]  [ K f6 ]  [ K d4 ]  [ g5 ] , [ K e4 ]  54. [ K e4 ] - white manages to get his king back to the centre and as he does so offers a draw. Klaus accepts and despite being a pawn light Myevilluck has triumphed in the endgame. Kudos to both players for an exciting game! Kind regards - Joanne
 [ R g8 ]  [ Q f1 ]  [ N d5 ] , [ N e5 ]  18. [ N e5 ] - this move looked good at the time piling up on the [ f7 ] pawn and threatening to exchange on [ d2 ] to get rid of said light square bishop.
 [ B d2 ] , [ Q c7 ]  Black threatens the [ h2 ] pawn.
 [ K e6 ]  [ B g2 ] , [ c6 ]  I decide to single step my c-pawn in case my opponent pushes his d-pawn to check me.
 [ N d4 ]  [ B d5 ] , [ a3 ]  White does not have a clear plan so he places pawns on white squares allowing a good continuation to black.
 [ Q a7 ] , [ a6 ]  29. [ a6 ] - and again but this is how far the pawn gets.
 [ R x e8 + ]  [ Q x e8 ]  [ g4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ Q f4 ] , [ Q e7 ]  Now the knight can't go to [ d7 ] because the pawn on [ d6 ] was attacked. My position is getter and from this moment I'm only playing for a draw.
 [ e5 ] , [ f4 ]  Met with [ e5 ] I begin the lines for the King's Gambit; a line I've been experimenting with primarily in Blitz games. The King's Gambit involves the initial sacrifice of the white f pawn. The concept behind it being that off centering black's e pawn will give white an advantage in the game through center control and initiative. Black's best hope is to slow the pace of the game down and lock up the board as much as possible so as to stave off the early offensive and retain the advantage in material.
 [ R f2 ] , [ R e1 + ]  The beginning of whites' rapid deterioration.
 [ Q x c5 ] , [ Q f4 + ]  Now black renders in another check.
 [ B h6 + ]  [ K d3 ] , [ B a6 + ]  In the middlegame two bishops are usually strongest when controlling adjacent diagonals. In wide open games where control of precise squares is critical another technique of using the bishop pair is to criss-cross them since they take away a lot of squares from the enemy king White is forced to head closer to the edge on the queenside
 [ f6 ]  [ g4 ]  [ R e7 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ R h e8 ]  [ R e3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ g5 ] , [ N a5 ]  Black has no means of improving his position.
 [ e x d4 ]  [ Q x e6 ]  [ f x e6 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ R d a1 ]  [ R c c8 ]  [ N x e6 ]  [ R d3 ]  [ R a3 x a6 ]  [ R d x c3 ]  [ N x g5 ]  [ R c3 c6 ]  [ N e6 ]  [ B x b4 ]  [ R x c6 ]  [ R x c6 ]  [ R a8 + ]  [ K h7 ]  [ R a7 + ]  [ K g8 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ R c5 ]  [ N f5 ]  [ h5 ]  [ N h6 + ]  [ K h8 ] , [ g5 ]  
 [ N f3 ] , [ c5 ]  This lets me know he doesn't have any immediate plans to lose another pawn so I might as well release my good bishop.
 [ g4 + ]  [ K h4 ] , [ K h2 ]  ! keeping the black king out of g3. now i threaten mate.
 [ h6 ]  [ e4 ]  [ f x e4 ] , [ f x e4 ]  ...and we again trade pawns giving me a powerful hold on the 6rd rank: the only squares on that rank I don't control are [ h3 ] and [ g3 ] so the king would have to go the long way round to eliminate my pawn on h7...
 [ K g5 ]  [ Q x d5 + ]  [ K g6 ]  [ K h2 ]  [ f5 ]  [ R g1 + ]  [ K f6 ] , [ f4 ]  Allows [ Q e5 ] and limits Black's available moves.
 [ Q d8 ] , [ c x d5 ]  Clearing the center before the fireworks.
 [ g5 ] , [ N c4 ]  Applying the thematic pressure to d6.
 [ R b2 ]  [ R c3 ]  [ R b5 ]  [ R g3 ]  [ K e7 ] , [ R x g6 ]  64. [ R x [ g6 ] ] - finally the [ g6 ] pawn falls and so does the rest of black's kingside.
 [ N b d2 ] , [ O-O-O ]  Royal pieces aligned and I have a dsb...
 [ e4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ B d3 ]  Not the most favored move but a perfectly natural developing one and consequently it cannot be bad.
 [ h3 ]  [ B x f3 ] , [ Q x f3 ]  Black trades his lsb off for a White knight rather than give up his advanced bishop. 8. ... [ B h5 ] looks like a good option to maintain the pin and the tension since White can't really follow it with [ g4 ] without a horrible weakening of the kingside pawn cover and will struggle to protect the knight with something other than the g-pawn.
 [ Q f3 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ O-O-O ] , [ b5 ]  The point of the variation. Black gets in [ [ b5 ] ] one move earlier without Be7. 7...[ [ b5 ] ] (the infamous Polugaevsky variation) is also playable but that's another story.
 [ Q b5 ]  [ O-O ] , [ a3 ]  White's Knights are the main defenders. Let's get rid of them...
 [ N b d2 ] , [ N b d7 ]  6. ........... [ N b d7 ] - the position is still almost symmetrical but with my pawn on [ [ d6 ] ] and not d5. Would [ d5 ] have been better than [ [ d6 ] ] in retrospect?
 [ Q a7 ] , [ R b5 ]  Strategic retreat. From here on it's all a lot sequential.
 [ B g7 ] , [ B b5 + ]  The point. This innocent-looking move causes tremendous problems for Black. White keeps Black's king in the center with tempo plotting an early [ e5 ] (in most lines).
 [ e5 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ d4 ]  [ d6 ] , [ N f3 ]  Entering the so-called "Modern variation."
 [ B x e4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ B b4 + ]  [ c3 ]  [ B e7 ] , [ Q c2 ]  10. [ Q c2 ] - protecting the [ b2 ] pawn should Frere Lenoir wish to move somewhere else - Glenda is together with Frere Leblanc also eyeing up the [ h7 ] pawn. This will induce the following weakness.
 [ N c3 ] , [ R b8 ]  eyeing the undefended bishop I plan to discover check the bishop so to speak and win a pawn in the process.
 [ R b5 ]  [ a6 ] , [ R a5 ]  58. ..... [ R a5 ] - I anticipated this move. Now I did some calculating and worked out that the [ h2 ] pawn looking so innocuous on that square would spell Checkmate for Bob. The gist is - the rooks will be forced off the board. Bob's king would be diverted to the queenside to eat up my pawns in the meantime Henry would go over to the kingside and eat some nice tasty black p(r)awns and there would remain the h pawn. Here we go .....
 [ a5 ] , [ h4 ]  because Black has two separate pawn groups White
 [ B d3 ] , [ Q d5 ]  ? So there weren't many great options for the queen when it came to placement but this just lets me chase her around a little more.
 [ K x g8 ] , [ Q x e6 + ]  with check...
 [ Q f5 ] , [ c5 ]  I'm not sure of black's intention but I do know that I can simply retreat and now there are some more holes in black's position.
 [ B g4 ] , [ R a f8 ]  i was thinking about [ N e7 ]  [ b5 ] , [ N d4 ]  i was thinking pretty long before making this move two options: 1. [ N e7 ] - protecting from [ B f5 ] and closing the f file or 2. [ N d4 ] - exchanging knight for his DSB or if he doesn't take it exchanging it for his LSB with [ N f3 ] forking his king and rook and protect [ B f5 ] since option #2 includes option #1.....
 [ K g4 ]  [ K d4 ]  [ K h5 ]  [ K x c5 ]  [ K x h6 ]  [ K b4 ]  [ K g5 ] , [ c5 ]  But I see what Black is doing with this move I completely panic. The c-pawn is running interference for the a-pawn. The right thing to do is...well it's not TOO hard to figure out.
 [ d4 ]  [ d6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N f6 ] , [ N c3 ]  Pretty normal looking game so far. White has the lead in development.
 [ N c6 ]  [ Q a4 ]  [ Q x f4 + ]  [ R d2 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ R h d1 ]  [ R x d2 ]  [ R x d2 ]  [ R x h3 ]  [ Q d1 ] , [ e3 ]  The correct (?) move is [ R e2 ] but after [ d x f2 + ] there is no use.
 [ B x d4 ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ K x h4 ]  [ a1 = Q ]  [ K g4 ] , [ R g1 + ]  Creating a trap which white falls for.
 [ K d2 ] , [ f6 ]  ... and the answer is NO but white has another trick in his sleeve by playing [ N e4 ] since if KxB inmediately [ N x f6 + ] winning. Of course black just had to waste two more moves with [ R h8 ] RxB. But it was white's last chance of countergame (N agains the black's a b and c pawns).
 [ B a6 ]  [ B x a6 ]  [ Q x a6 ] , [ R a8 ]  I would have been tempted to let Her Majesty gorge herself on the [ a7 ] pawn in favour of fast development. But this caution is not in any way bad.
 [ K f8 ]  [ B d6 + ]  [ K g8 ]  [ Q a8 + ]  [ K h7 ]  [ B e5 ]  [ R b7 ]  [ Q a5 ]  [ K g8 ]  [ Q c3 ]  [ R d7 ] , [ Q d3 ]  [White has finally achieved a winning position. There is no defence against Qg6.]
 [ e4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e5 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ d3 ]  [ e6 ] , [ Q f3 ]  Strange move and I'd say it's no a good one. But I couldn't see the point in an inmediate [ N h3 ] for [ B g4 ] so I went on normally.
 [ R g5 ]  [ R c6 ]  [ b5 ]  [ K d4 ]  [ R g4 + ]  [ K e5 ] , [ b4 ]  With all this manouvering I have managed to connect my pawn so my other pieces are free.
 [ B d2 ] , [ N d4 ]  If we exchange queens I check and get the bishop
 [ O-O ] , [ B e3 ]  White really isn't worried about ...Bc3.
 [ B x f1 ] , [ B x f8 ]  At least worth considering: 20. [ Q x f1 ] Rfc8.
 [ Q f4 + ]  [ K g7 ]  [ Q d4 + ]  [ Q x d4 ] , [ c x d4 ]  central pawn king close... it is a classical final.
 [ a4 ] , [ R d8 ]  Not very consistent to [ N c8 ]  [ g6 ]  [ a6 ]  [ N a7 ]  [ B a4 ] , [ c6 ]  Trying to blockade against the White build-up but Black has lost all means of striking out against White by being passive over the past few moves and now White just needs to pick Black off at his leisure.
 [ Q f5 ]  [ d4 ]  [ N e7 ] , [ B g5 ]  This may be the best move of this game for black. The move attacks the knight and threatens to penetrate the black defence threatening the black bishop and the black rook.
 [ Q f4 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ Q g4 ]  [ N b4 ] , [ Q d1 ]  White might as well have tried Kd1!? ([ N d4 ] Qxg7) although then Nxc2! intends [ K x c2 ] [ N d4 + ] and Qxg4.
 [ d x e4 ] , [ N x e5 ]  This instead of 11. [ d x e5 ] to hopefully win the over-extended pawn on [ e4 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ N x c6 ]  [ B x c6 ] , [ B g5 ]  Pinning one of the defenders of that [ e4 ] pawn
 [ e6 ]  [ e4 ]  [ e x d5 ] , [ c x d5 ]  now his 2 connected pawns in the centre. my opponent plays smart.
 [ K h2 ] , [ b x a6 ]  Sad necessity. I will lose a minor piece leaving him the bishop's pair. But at least I had some mobility with my two rooks.
 [ Q f6 ] , [ N x f7 ]  I was debating between taking with the B since Perry's in check or taking this way. But this is where I applied what I had learned with my second lesson against Ken. The idea is mobility because what TA taught about the N visualization count. It can go in so many places and be a monster. And that's going to happen. What's more is that when this happens I'll be able to throw in a discovered check since Perry must protect his attacked R. This does mean however that will lose a second piece without compensation. Therefore I'll be up two pieces and three pawns which is the equivalent to a Queen. Consequently I'd call it a resignable position. In other words I'd resign were I black but Perry decides not to do that.
 [ b5 ]  [ b x c4 ]  [ b x c4 ]  [ R b1 ] , [ B g6 ]  Black has developed his lsb with a tempo and all his minor pieces are on the king side which are ready for defense.
 [ d4 ]  [ B e6 ] , [ B e3 ]  As Black has not pursued his attack on [ e4 ] White is free to try an attack of his own at d5.
 [ a3 ] , [ B e7 ]  18. ...... [ B e7 ] - Freddy decides to retreat his bishop after a3. Hmm maybe [ b4 ] was called for asap. Instead I decided to add another defender to the d pawn.
 [ Q x d7 ]  [ R x d7 ]  [ K g2 ] , [ R x e4 ]  Now Black will keep his 3P for the N (after the f-pawn drops). Though White's remaining pawns comprise only the isolated doubled b-pawns I was still a bit worried about White's active pieces especially once the a4-N came back into action. Probably the game is about even here but I was inclined to a pessimistic view. Normally I like having the pawns but propects looked unpromising here.
 [ e5 ]  [ R e1 ] , [ R f e8 ]  Strengthening my space and center advantage.
 [ d5 ] , [ c6 ]  I would've castled here but I like this move just as much.
 [ Q e2 ] , [ d x e5 ]  I'm not really sure how good of a trade this is for black. Maybe [ Q d7 ] would better and allow him to attempt to control the d file? I dunno.
 [ N x e4 ]  [ N x c4 ]  [ b x c4 ] , [ d x e4 ]  Black handled the blunder fairly well. Now I have an isolated pawn and I'm only up one point. However I still have the two bishops with one strongly placed while the Bishop on [ c8 ] is looking rather hemmed in.
 [ R x f8 ] , [ B x f8 ]  My two pieces will definitely be enough to beat White's three pawns now.
 [ R h1 ]  [ f4 ]  [ R e1 + ]  [ K d5 ] , [ R d1 + ]  just checking....
 [ K x b5 ] , [ K x e5 ]  It is now mate in 10 (with white getting mated) with optimal play from both sides.
 [ e6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B b4 ]  [ Q f3 ]  [ B x c3 ] , [ Q x c3 ]  Move 4 Took with Queen as i wanted to maintain my pawn formation.
 [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ g6 ]  Very standard Anglo-Indian.
 [ Q h4 + ]  [ K f7 ] , [ N e5 + ]  30. [ N e5 + ] - in commeth that rampant steed!
 [ R b c8 ]  [ B e5 ]  [ b x c4 ] , [ N x c4 ]  The knight is quite powerful here vying for [ d6 ] and b6.
 [ Q d7 ] , [ N b3 ]  White regains control of d4. White stands a little better because of having a ready 0-0 available and because no diagonal attacks can be applied against the king due to the position and because of better development. The only downside may be found after c5[ x d4 ] where black will have a little better pawn center - which may mean nothing more than offering protection of [ f7 ] or supplying support at [ d5 ] for a knight.
 [ c x b4 ]  [ a x b4 ]  [ B x b4 ]  [ Q b3 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ R a5 ]  [ B b6 ]  [ R g5 ] , [ N x h1 ]  He finally gobbles my rook
 [ B g4 ] , [ h3 ]  [ N c3 ] is better (and maybe the black fall for h6...)
 [ B x c3 ]  [ R x c3 ]  [ R a c8 ] , [ R b c1 ]  I really have to wonder why not b4? Two defenders two attackers. Tie goes to the defender.
 [ Q e4 + ]  [ K g3 ]  [ R g1 + ]  [ K x h3 ] , [ Q h7 # ]  I feel sorry for black since he had such a good game such a strong attack... and suddenly he was the crushed one. His queen kept isolated very near to my king... nobody would tell he'll lose. So be careful with strong attacks: they can revert against you. And I deserved to lose.
 [ B f4 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ N d2 ]  [ N x c3 ] , [ Q x c3 ]  I think this is best. If 12.[ B x b7 ] then 12...[ N x e2 + ] 13.[ K h1 ] [ R a7 ]  [ B x g2 ]  [ K x g2 ]  [ g5 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ f4 ]  [ g x f4 ] , [ g4 ]  I played this thinking that 15...[ g x [ f4 ] ] 16.[ B x [ f4 ] ] [ R x [ f4 ] ] 17.[ Q g3 + ] was much better for White because he wins back the rook. It turns out he wins back a bishop instead. 17.[ Q g3 + ] [ B g5 ] 18.[ h4 ] Rx[ h4 ] 19.[ f4 ] I think this is how the line runs. I haven't rechecked it so I'm analyzing it blindfold pretty well. Could be wrong. This might be a better option than what I played in the game but I have a ways to go developing still and my king is weak. Comments welcome.
 [ N b2 ]  [ R c7 ]  [ N d3 ] , [ R b7 ]  37. [ R b7 ] - some meaningless rook play before Ion lands the coup de grace. Ion and I agreed after the game that if only I had Glenda or the rook + Fou Lenoir again Ion's king would have been in danger of Copping dear Old Matey!
 [ c x d4 ]  [ Q x d4 ]  [ h6 ] , [ R e1 ]  At least the e-pawn is taken care of for the moment and the Queen can get off of the a1-[ h8 ] diagonal. The c1-Bishop has to come off of the back rank and end up somewhere constructive pretty soon ... [ B g5 ] would have been nice but that's off the table. (bigpeta suggested Rd1. There were other options as well)
 [ c4 ] , [ N c3 ]  now the knight goes to the side. Better was calmly [ N b6 ]  [ R d3 ]  [ N a4 ] , [ B a3 ]  Strong move to bring rook [ a1 ] to [ d1 ]  [ R f d8 ] , [ R a d1 ]  And now black must exchange
 [ d6 ]  [ N x e5 ] , [ d x e5 ]  18. [ d x e5 ] - knight trade.
 [ R x g7 ] , [ N g6 + ]  I force Black to blockade the queen's defense of [ g7 ] with his king
 [ R x d6 + ]  [ K c7 ]  [ R d1 ] , [ g5 ]  Preventing liquidation for now since my intention was in fact 14.Bxh6.
 [ B d2 ] , [ N x e1 ]  In expectation of capture of one of the pieces at [ c1 ] and [ e1 ] by the knight I move my DB to [ d2 ] so as to recapture the knight.
 [ R f2 ] , [ Q f8 ]  This move prepares for black's reply on move 22.
 [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ c3 ]  [ K e6 ]  [ e4 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ d x e4 ] , [ h4 ]  This helps White a lot!
 [ e x f4 ]  [ g x f4 ] , [ N b6 ]  Saves the piece. ...[ N f8 ] was also possible but less active.
 [ B c5 ]  [ b4 ] , [ B x b4 ]  ??? He takes the pond? o well. I wouldnt have done that.
 [ B f5 ] , [ R d1 ]  And I prepare to check and liquidate R's which will happen in a few more moves.
 [ R c6 ]  [ R x c6 ] , [ e6 ]  Now [ R x a6 ] or the very pretty alternative of 21. [ R c8 + ] [ Q x c8 ] 22. Rb8! [ B e7 ] 23. [ Q x d7 + ]  [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ a3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ c4 ]  [ d x c4 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ Q a4 + ]  [ Q d7 ]  [ Q x c4 ]  [ Q c6 ]  [ Q b3 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ e3 ]  [ a6 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ B d2 ]  [ b5 ] , [ R a c1 ]  so far I have played this game at blitz tempo not thinking at all. I now begin to struggle a bit....
 [ N c3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B d3 ] , [ N e5 ]  Blockading the pawn though probably not wise. I think I wanted to prevent white from opening the b1-[ h7 ] diagonal after I castled. If white had replied with [ f4 ] I would have traded pieces.
 [ K d1 ]  [ Q x d5 + ] , [ K c2 ]  My queen is in good position to protect the g pawn.
 [ B e3 ] , [ B e5 ]  avoiding the trade to keep the king locked up
 [ K e7 ] , [ h7 ]  
 [ Q e2 ]  [ c5 ]  [ a3 ]  [ Q b8 ]  [ R b1 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ N d5 ]  Non effective moves hard to move in this puzzle
 [ e x d5 ] , [ e x f6 ]  DON'T TAKE WITH THE QUEEN AND I WIN! LOL
 [ O-O ] , [ B a6 ]  Developing the bishop to an active diagonal. It also forces a resolution with the pawn on c4.
 [ R x e5 ]  [ g x f5 ] , [ R x f5 ]  While -2pts Im attacking Knight queen and putting pressure on [ f7 ] pawn
 [ g4 ] , [ O-O-O ]  OK?
 [ B b2 ]  [ R c1 + ]  [ R x c1 ]  [ Q x b2 ]  [ R c2 ] , [ Q b6 ]  I kind of like [ Q b1 + ] better. White won't interpose the rook and [ K e2 ] traps white's white bishop.
 [ K b3 ] , [ a5 ]  ? The draw opportunity for White was gone but Black gives it back to him. Nothing can stop the perpetual check (besides a ruinous sacrifice that is) after 44.[ B f6 ] [ Q f5 ] 45.[ R d8 + ] [ R x d8 ] 46.[ R x d8 + ] [ K f7 ] 47.[ R d7 + ] [ K e8 ] 48.[ R d8 + ] etc.
 [ d5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ Q a4 + ]  [ N c6 ]  [ Q x e4 ] , [ N f6 ]  the white queen is out early. it will be a pursuit center during Black's development.
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ c4 ] , [ e6 ]  I wanted to experiment with Queens Gambit as I am not nearly as familiar with QP openings as I am with KP. He declines the gambit. I was excited.
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ] , [ N a3 ]  an original approach. though white never did anything with the horse during the game it could have gone to [ c2 ] after [ c3 ] and went places from there.
 [ e5 ] , [ d x e5 ]  The Englund Gambit Accepted. White could have "opted out" with 2.[ e4 ] with a counter gambit offer (The Danish/Goring/Scotch Gambit complex). Interesting also is 2.d5.
 [ B x d2 ]  [ Q x d2 ]  [ Q x e5 ] , [ R e1 ]  QxR QxR RxQ and black picks up d & b pawns at leisure.
 [ e x d5 ] , [ R g5 ]  To free the Queen to attack the king.
 [ Q x e4 ] , [ R f2 + ]  ....seen this before somewhere..?!
 [ R x f7 ]  [ R x f7 + ]  [ K h6 ]  [ R x h7 + ]  [ K g5 ]  [ h4 + ] , [ K g4 ]  Ok white you have won. But now?
 [ N c3 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ b3 ]  back in the games i used to win i also pushed [ b3 ] and or [ g3 ] i got sick of losing so i did it again
 [ K e5 ]  [ Q f4 + ] , [ K d4 ]  Black makes a mistake and soon will be mated.
 [ R e7 ]  [ Q d6 ]  [ R c e8 ]  [ a5 ] , [ b x a5 ]  43. ..... [ b x a5 ] - Klaus has sacrificed a pawn. What is he up to?
 [ N b6 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ R e8 ] , [ R a c1 ]  Getting my rook off the long diagonal... Black has lined up his queen and rook and possible plans a later f5.
 [ R b c7 ]  [ R c2 ]  [ R c b7 ]  [ K b2 ]  [ R d c7 ]  [ K a3 ]  [ R c d7 ] , [ e3 ]  Getting another pawn off a light square and securing the post [ d4 ] for the bishop.
 [ B x f6 ] , [ Q d3 ]  Connecting rooks.
 [ O-O ]  [ N f6 ]  [ d3 ] , [ g5 ]  both ...[ B c7 ] and ...[ B e7 ] are better as they make ...[ d5 ] possible. this weakens the hiding place for Black's King. White has no weaknesses to call for this type of aggression.
 [ R d7 ]  [ N x c7 ]  [ R b8 ]  [ e6 ]  [ R e7 ]  [ e x f7 + ]  [ K f8 ]  [ B h6 + ]  [ N g7 ]  [ B x g7 + ]  [ K x g7 ]  [ Q d5 ] , [ R x f7 ]  I think I got off lightly there.
 [ B b5 ] , [ b3 ]  If he exchanges his dsb is almost out of the game and preparing...
 [ R x b2 ] , [ R a b1 ]  Continues the exchange white is probably hoping for [ R x b1 ] [ R x b1 ] [ d x c4 ] Nxc4.
 [ N g e2 ]  [ R h8 ]  [ N b5 ]  [ B x b5 ]  [ B x b5 ]  [ a6 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ N e6 + ]  [ K f6 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ R h2 ]  [ R d2 ]  [ R h3 ]  [ N x c7 ]  [ N x f3 ]  [ R d3 ]  [ R h1 + ]  [ R d1 ]  [ R x d1 + ]  [ K x d1 ] , [ N h2 ]  Having conducted the whole end game with great skill and accuracy herr von Bardeleben reaps now the benefit of his superior strategy. White has to give a piece for the passed pawn.
 [ e x f3 ] , [ R a d1 ]  At this point my focus remains tightening the grip on his King by bringing in as much of heavy artillery as possible.
 [ K x f4 ]  [ K c4 ] , [ K e4 ]  The closing phase has to be played carefully. This move keeps the white king from [ d5 ] and virtually forces the pawn advance d5.
 [ B g4 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ B x f3 ]  [ B x f3 ] , [ Q h4 ]  He tries a different approach...
 [ N e3 ]  [ B x f3 ]  [ g x f3 ]  [ Q x d4 ]  [ O-O ] , [ e6 ]  Stifling White's active Bishop though probably 16...[ N f6 ] would be more accurate.
 [ N x e4 ] , [ N x d5 ]  ?? This capture looks like Simon has gotten back a pawn. But this is loses as I am about to win a piece instead. I didn't say anything else at this point because he was two pawns down. When you get that far behind there's almost no good moves left as ION has illustrated. As archduke_piccolo has told me that you coach up until you're winning or have a clear advantage. But then it doesn't pay to coach anymore. Well I felt that I had a clear advantage because of what's to happen. It starts off by exchanging his good bishop.
 [ R x d8 ] , [ c6 ]  [ R e7 ] grants me the two black pawns and the game. But this is... well a mistake.
 [ B b4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ c5 ]  [ a3 ]  [ B x c3 + ]  [ b x c3 ]  [ N e7 ] , [ Q g4 ]  The main line and best line for white IMO
 [ B c6 ]  [ R x e8 ]  [ R x e8 ] , [ g5 ]  It's one way to go.
 [ h6 ] , [ B h4 ]  Alternative variation: 12. [ B x f6 ] [ Q x f6 ] 13. [ N c3 ] O-O $16
 [ B x c4 ] , [ g6 ]  From here on in I cannot remember what exactly was played but I know that some of these positions are going to be very similar to what we reviewed. In the meantime my goal is to fianchetto the DSB so that I can castle Kingside and Jack does not see anything wrong with this.
 [ c x d3 ] , [ N x f3 ]  [ R f1 ] is not possible because of Nd2+.
 [ O-O ] , [ N f3 ]  Looking at pushing my d Pawn forward.
 [ d5 ] , [ d4 ]  I went for the center to try and gain center control.
 [ B x b4 ] , [ Q x b4 ]  Black is now two pawns up and has the tempo since White's N is attacked.
 [ B x c6 ]  [ b x c6 ] , [ N b d2 ]  But since my c pawn hasn't advanced I'm sticking to those guidelines whilst completing my development. At this point I'm getting more and more confident since what I considered to be his strongest minor piece is a goner.
 [ N x f4 ] , [ d5 ]  This is a blunder for white though I of course didn't see that I wanted to avoid the pawn fork from n[ x e6 ] dxe6. The computer gives Blunder: +24.16 » 39. [ d5 ] N[ x e6 ] 40.

The computer gives mate in 11.
 [ B a3 ] , [ R e8 ]  No choice for black
 [ O-O ]  [ B x c3 ]  [ N x c3 ] , [ c x b3 ]  Now he takes the bait. In fact this was probably the best way of avoiding the loss of his extra pawn but he still has no positional compensation for my advanced e-pawn.
 [ R g f8 ]  [ Q x a6 + ]  [ K d8 ]  [ b x c5 ]  [ Q x c5 + ]  [ K h1 ]  [ K e7 ]  [ Q b7 + ]  [ K d8 ]  [ R x b6 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ d6 ]  [ Q x b7 ] , [ R x b7 ]  Got into a much better position still
 [ h5 ] , [ a3 ]  I have to open a square for my king out of the first row.
 [ B e8 ]  [ d6 ]  [ R d c8 ] , [ d x e7 ]  I've won a pawn but can I hold on to it?
 [ R h1 ]  [ f4 ]  [ g x f3 ]  [ e ]  [ p ]  [ g x f3 ]  [ B f6 ]  [ K a2 ]  [ B h4 ]  [ B x h4 ] , [ Q x h4 ]  Bishop accomplished. The White Q is a powerful attacking piece but doesn't have any good squares.
 [ B c6 ]  [ B e6 ] , [ f5 ]  ? obviously from an offensive player otherwise is bad as will allow an easy to drawn endgame if white captures the bishop I'll offer the draw
 [ Q c5 ]  [ Q e1 ]  [ g4 ]  [ R e7 + ]  [ K g6 ]  [ B f7 + ]  [ K g5 ]  [ B e8 ]  [ h5 ] , [ Q e2 ]  My next plan is to focus on that [ g4 ] pawn. That thing cannot move.
 [ Q x h2 ]  [ g x h2 ] , [ R x g8 + ]  the queen and the two rooks are gone and the black king is check
 [ Q a6 + ]  [ B b7 ]  [ Q a7 ] , [ Q x c7 ]  The only move that will spare the mate for black as far as I can see.
 [ e x d4 ]  [ c x d4 ] , [ B b6 ]  [ B b4 ] [ N c3 ] [ B x c3 ] [ b x c3 ] is good for me because I will have three strong pawns dominating the centre which would soon advance and crush Black.
 [ R c e8 ] , [ O-O-O ]  Short castling is better since Black can quickly build up pressure and White's move has immensely helped Black's Queen which just a moment ago seemed a bit out of play. Alternative variation: 17. O-O [ Q d8 ] [Needed to protect the [ Q d7 ] threat] 18. [ N x f4 ] [ N d4 ] 19. [ N e6 ] [ N x e6 ] 20. [ Q x e6 + ] [ K h8 ] 21. [ N e4 ] [And White is better instead +-]
 [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ N f5 ]  [ B f2 ]  [ N c x d4 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ B b7 ] , [ N f6 + ]  I don't know if Black saw this finesse but it stops all hope of Black mounting an attack on the a8-[ h1 ] diagonal.
 [ Q x f5 ]  [ Q x d4 + ]  [ K f1 ]  [ d x c4 ]  [ d x c4 ]  [ R c d8 ]  [ Q f3 ]  [ R x e1 + ]  [ R x e1 ]  [ b5 ]  [ c x b5 ] , [ a x b5 ]  creating the potiental for a past pawn after capturing [ b2 ] and b3.
 [ Q f6 + ]  [ K g8 ]  [ d7 ] , [ R x f6 + ]  Here Janowski misses his last opportunity to draw. Post-mortem analysis revealed that the only move to hold the position for White is 56 KPxR!
 [ K b1 ]  [ N b4 ]  [ Q b2 ]  [ Q x b2 + ]  [ K x b2 ] , [ N c6 ]  Queens exchanged but now the pawn on [ e4 ] is in danger and white is going to drive the knight away from [ b4 ] anyway so I bring it back for defense.
 [ e4 ]  [ d6 ] , [ f3 ]  4. [ B e2 ] [ h5 ] 5. [ h3 ] is also a common line but I didn't know that at the time and also was very content at the idea of controlling such a large center
 [ R d6 ] , [ R e7 ]  Maybe this isn't the right plan after some moves I realized that my R could have been more dangerous on the 7th rank than on the "e" column. Probably more coherent was 27. [ R b7 ] binding the Black Rook to the defense of the [ b6 ] pawn.
 [ B h3 ] , [ Q g6 ]  [ R g1 ] comes inmediately to mind but... which one? I wasn't sure. I wanted to keep an eye on the knight so I didn't want to go there with Rh. However I must have assumed he will exchange it with my bishop.
 [ N x d5 ] , [ B x e7 ]  White is a piece ahead and threatening to win the knight on d5. Moving the queen loses the exchange to Bxf8. The only move that saves the black queen and rook is 13. ... [ N x e7 ] which as demonstrated before still loses a piece for black.
 [ K f7 ] , [ f4 ]  My Rook is now supported.
 [ a3 ]  [ R x h7 ]  [ a2 ]  [ R a7 ] , [ B a3 ]  Setting up the blockade helped ensure I would promote my pawn.
 [ R b5 ]  [ h4 ] , [ h6 ]  45. ..... [ h6 ] - this move is played to create a bolt hole for Henry while the two rooks are on the board - it would help greatly if Henry was not subjected to annoying tempo-stealing checks from the enemy rooks.
 [ B d5 ]  [ B x d2 ]  [ R e7 + ]  [ K h6 ] , [ R e4 ]  RxP[ a7 ] would have been horrible. BxP[ f6 ] would also be bad. Why? Because [ R b1 # ] ends this game in black's favor. The king's castle door is broken. Any rook will gut him. Here [ R b1 + ] [ R e1 ] Rxe1#.
 [ e4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e5 ] , [ a6 ]  3...don't really see the point of this...wastes time...in this line B wants to get pressure on [ [ d4 ] ] and [ e5 ] through c5;nc6;[ Q b6 ] sometimes Bb4...in some lines though if B wins a pawn on [ [ d4 ] ] he has to worry about a discovered attack on the capturing piece by a [ B b5 + ] so maybe the idea is to avoid these tactical complications...still this is slow
 [ B c4 ] , [ R e8 ]  The most logical move
 [ B x e5 ] , [ N x e5 ]  While winning the exchange i also get a nice centralized knight
 [ g6 ]  [ b6 ]  [ h5 ] , [ a7 ]  54. [ a7 ] - and with this move black waves the white flag as he will in two moves be down a whole queen and Glenda will clean up those black pawns with consumate ease before netting the black king. An interesting endgame battle because in the final position just look at that impressive black pawn chain of Bob's! He just got pipped at the post. Hope you have had a good read. Bye for now. Joanne
 [ b4 ]  [ K d4 ]  [ h5 ] , [ K c4 ]  And here I blundered wait for it.
 [ B b5 ] , [ B b4 ]  I am following symmetry here but not for long.
 [ h x g6 ]  [ R h f1 ] , [ B g4 ]  Very few choices.
 [ R f e1 ] , [ N x e2 + ]  19th move and finally a little blood is spilled.
 [ R b5 b7 ] , [ R f7 ]  again 31 .. [ R b8 ] is possible preventing 32 [ R x c7 ] and offering exchanges favouring Black. The Kingside pawn majority might prove decisive in an endgame with the Rooks off.
 [ R d2 ]  [ R a1 ]  [ e3 ] , [ a4 ]  I had to move my rook over and protect my pawn but the enemy passed pawn just gets closer and closer. I decide that this is the best course of action so that at least my a pawn isn't lost for nothing.
 [ N x d4 ]  [ Q x d4 ] , [ Q f6 ]  On seeing this I assumed Black's purpose was to castle long. My initial reaction was that it was a weak move since 13 [ N d5 ] would force the Black queen to retreat right back to d8. And I went with that oblivious to the huge tactical threat of Black's move.
 [ h x g6 ]  [ Q x g6 + ]  [ K f8 ] , [ R g1 ]  Black resigned as mate could not be prevented.
 [ Q x g3 ]  [ c5 ] , [ Q h3 ]  19. [ Q h3 ] - the start of a subtle shuffle takes place.
 [ c3 ]  [ B d7 ] , [ Q c2 ]  8. [ Q c2 ] - more development - I can now castle both sides. I eventually go kingside.
 [ R a d1 ] , [ B f5 ]  Attacking my c-pawn. This is where things really get crazy.
 [ N h6 ]  [ e x f6 ]  [ e6 ] , [ Q e5 ]  On my next move I'm planning to do pawn to [ f7 + ] so that Black will be forced to break the check and I can take the Rook with the queen.
 [ B x d6 ] , [ c x d6 ]  I have created a passed pawn exploiting my opponent's blocked pawn formation.
 [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ N h6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ f6 ]  [ B x h6 ]  [ g x h6 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N b4 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ b6 ] , [ O-O ]  At this stage the board favors white who looks poised to secure a famous victory
 [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ e6 ] , [ d4 ]  This is one of 2 possible ways of activating the [ c1 ] bishop. The other alternative which is more cramping is b3. Note that [ d3 ] is not a good option due to the threat of b5.
 [ K f2 ]  [ R x f4 + ]  [ g x f4 ]  [ R h8 ]  [ K g3 ]  [ R g8 + ]  [ K f2 ]  [ R h8 ]  [ K g3 ]  [ R g8 + ] , [ K f2 ]  Am I going to play [ R h8 ] and draw NO!
 [ B b4 ] , [ Q f3 ]  And that's when Carl brought his Q out. It was to prevent me from destroying his K side pawn structures. But I have other ideas.
 [ O-O ] , [ B g2 ]  Wanting to castle...
 [ b x c4 ]  [ b x c4 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ R a b8 ]  [ R f c1 ]  [ h x g4 ] , [ f x g4 ]  fxg4? Maybe [ h x g4 ] was better even if it's not a crucial move.
 [ f x e4 ]  [ N x e5 ] , [ Q g5 ]  4. ................ Qg5? - this move is a bad move. I played this because the Poisoned Pawn Variation is a recognised spur of the Latvian and it did have a good win percentage in the Expert's database but not so in the Gameknot database. The drawback to this variation is as you will see Glenda and Henry will be the only pieces to move in the entire game!
 [ K g6 ]  [ R e3 ]  [ R b6 ] , [ R e5 ]  I try to maneuver my King and Rook to win the Black KRP.
 [ B a5 ] , [ B d8 ]  Black tries to simplify to improve the rook's effectiveness.
 [ b4 ]  [ N d7 ] , [ B e3 ]  Hoping to break through [ c5 ] I suppose but it is too late.
 [ e5 ]  [ Q b5 ]  [ B x b7 ]  [ Q x b7 ]  [ a4 ]  [ N b c6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ g3 ] , [ Q c7 ]  Black is breaking up the center...
 [ O-O ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ N b d2 ] , [ e5 ]  Attack in the centre.
 [ e4 ] , [ d5 ]  This is the first time we have played so I didn't know what to expect. I like the Center Counter against an unknown opponent as it is safe and easy to play. The drawback is that it doesn't fight for a win like the Sicilian but I am content with my endgame skills. If I can win a pawn I will trade down and try to outplay my opponent in the endgame.
 [ R g8 ] , [ B b5 + ]  Now the [ B b5 + ] in order to exchange and begin developing my untouched queenside.
 [ d x e4 ] , [ B g3 ]  This deserves ??. Unfortunately for White 9. [ a3 ] ... was the best move.
 [ K x g2 ]  [ Q b7 + ]  [ K f1 ]  [ Q f3 + ]  [ K e1 ] , [ Q f2 # ]  A lesson for everyone. Make sure your defence is solid before you attack. No defence blinkered going forward with no concrete mate insight chucking pieces in the general area with no real plan left myself wide open.
 [ N b d7 ] , [ B c4 ]  6. [ B c4 ] - developing to defend my [ d5 ] pawn at the same time.
 [ N x e5 ] , [ O-O ]  4........ 0-0 - black castles and is threatening a skewie by playing 5.... Re8. I decide to play [ d3 ] backing up the e pawn but the drawback of this move is that it leaves my [ c3 ] knight in a pin.
 [ e6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N g e7 ]  [ c3 ]  [ a6 ]  [ B a4 ] , [ b5 ]  6. .......... [ b5 ] - this kinda resembles a Ruy Lopez. Frere Leblanc does have the foxhole [ c2 ] to escape the queenside pawn roll avoiding the Noah's Ark Trap.
 [ R e8 ] , [ d4 ]  again you have little choice
 [ K x g2 ] , [ N e f4 + ]  Better might have been moving the knight on [ h5 ] as that would take it off the rim.
 [ g6 ]  [ Q h3 ]  [ f5 ] , [ N x g5 ]  Take the bishop and hoping for a capture so I have access to the king on the h file.
 [ R x d4 ] , [ R c1 ]  ? I had a good long think here and choose the path of greater mobilty. I should have just traded rooks.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ d6 ]  Of all the defenses I play against I think I like this one least. Although the potential for play with 3. [ B b4 ] is there it never leads to a clean game merely a muck.
 [ Q x e6 ]  [ Q x e6 + ]  [ f x e6 ]  [ R x e6 ]  [ B x f4 ]  [ R x e7 ]  [ h6 ] , [ R f7 ]  22...h6? 23.Rf7?? now we both made mistakes but mine was bigger. This game was equal but after these moves black gained advantage. 22...[ R d g8 ] 23.[ R e2 ] [ R h4 ] would have keeped this game equal as 22...h6? should be followed by 23.[ h3 ] [ R g3 ] 24.[ B a5 ] [ B e3 ] 25.[ R x e3 ] [ R x e3 ] 26.[ B x d8 ] [ K x d8 ] 27.[ R x f5 ] and white has clear advantage and should win this game by accurate endgame.
 [ N x g5 ]  [ h6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ g5 ]  [ K x a4 ] , [ g4 ]  now it is a matter of time. Can the knight hold out and let the king get over there?
 [ B g7 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B d3 ]  [ N a6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ c5 ]  [ d5 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ B c4 ] , [ N c7 ]  Standard book moves
 [ e x f4 ]  [ d4 ] , [ Q h4 + ]  Yes I know chess theory well at least as far as early queen moves aren't a good idea.
 [ B d3 ] , [ B e7 ]  [ B e7 ] was played getting ready to castle king side.
 [ e5 ] , [ Q e6 ]  White pushes his pawn to [ e5 ] and I block the pawn with queen to e6. White could take my pawn at [ d6 ] but I could recapture with the queen.
 [ e6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ a6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ b5 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ O-O ]  [ c5 ]  [ d x c5 ]  [ B x c5 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ B x e3 ]  [ f x e3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ h3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ Q e2 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N b d2 ] , [ N h5 ]  ?? attacking with only 1 bit.
 [ N x d7 ] , [ b4 ]  locking up Nc5...
 [ Q x h7 ] , [ Q x e6 + ]  Black has at least taken my e pawn. He is relieved from its pressure and has put me in check.
 [ h4 ]  [ R g8 ] , [ R h2 ]  Not just threatening the g pawn but preparing the R for action.
 [ R d7 ]  [ f5 ]  [ B c4 ] , [ K f2 ]  the will be placed very good on [ c5 ] allowing the rooks to move free on the board.
 [ R f e8 ] , [ N g5 ]  funny game chess . on move 25 i am angry with my earlier sloppiness. suddenly as if through a mist i see some opportunity and 4 moves later it is over. hope you enjoyed. PL COMMENT FREELY
 [ c x d4 ]  [ d x e4 ] , [ R c2 + ]  I couldn't resist but it really useless except for a strange idea it came to me. I couldn't focus it very well but I went on.
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ N f6 ]  the petrov's defence.
 [ R x d7 ]  [ R x d7 ] , [ R e7 ]  If instead 26...[ Q x e5 ] then 27. [ Q h7 + ] ends it quickly.
 [ K g7 ] , [ R b7 + ]  now I'll give some checks either on [ b7 ] and [ b8 ] and if white plays [ R g7 ] or [ R g8 ] I'll play [ R b1 ] to defend the pawn from behind
 [ B g4 ]  [ Q c2 ] , [ g6 ]  Black is in some serious trouble here. Moving his pawn to [ [ g6 ] ] will allow me to sacrifice my white bishop for both of his kingside pawns making his king very uncomfortable after Bxg6...hx[ [ g6 ] ] Qx[ [ g6 ] ] . In black's defense the chess engine thinks 14...[ [ g6 ] ] is as good a move as any.
 [ N x a4 ] , [ B x f7 + ]  Looking to close the net.
 [ N x e5 ] , [ d x e5 ]  this forces black to surrender the h pawn.
 [ a6 ]  [ a5 ] , [ B a7 ]  Now 8... NxRP could not be countered by 9 RxN: 9... BxR 10 Q-[ R4 ] ch P-[ Q N4 ] 11 QxB PxB.
 [ h x g5 ] , [ Q x g5 ]  It's now just a matter of decide how to kick the queen in the right way.
 [ K g6 ] , [ K f3 ]  Now it's less good both because Black's king is better-placed to hold White's back and because White's own f-pawn takes up a vital square. Black must however be careful not to fall into the trap of 44... Kf5?? 45. g4+.
 [ Q h4 + ]  [ K f1 ] , [ b5 ]  Bryan's Counter-Gambit. Named for American ameteur Thomas Jefferson Bryan who studied it extensively in Paris and London in the 19th century. It aims to gambit a pawn while harrassing white's light squared bishop. This kind of play is WAAAAY over my head. I think most of us would agree that black needs to accelerate his development. But what do I know?
 [ Q x c4 ] , [ N b6 ]  21. ..... [ N b6 ] - re-opening the pin line onto the knight on [ f3 ] and putting pressure on [ c4 ] and a4.
 [ e4 ] , [ N d4 ]  9. [ N [ d4 ] ] - my knight evades the pawn thrust and finds an outpost on d4. Black put his bishop on [ e7 ] next move of course if he tries to drive my knight off [ d4 ] with c5? then he will drop the [ b5 ] pawn. After this move which prepares castling for black I decide to create a flight square for the knight with [ e3 ] - it stops that e pawn in his tracks!
 [ N x f6 + ]  [ B x f6 ] , [ R x f6 ]  is it quiet better to exchange a Rook for a Bishop?? It is good move. white thinks to open black's 'g' file for attacking
 [ N f8 ] , [ f6 ]  This undermines the [ h6 ] knight.
 [ N x d4 ]  [ e x d4 ] , [ O-O ]  Black has now completed the development of the minor pieces and castled while White has exchanged the only minor piece she developed. Still the the centre closed and no open files to operate on White has still a reasonable position except being a pawn down.
 [ f5 ]  [ e x f5 ] , [ N f6 ]  The Fred (1.[ e4 ] [ f5 ] 2. ex[ f5 ] Kf7) with the more solid 2...[ N f6 ] is often called 'The Hollyrock Gambit'. - Palliser.
 [ B x e6 ]  [ f x e6 ]  [ N x e6 ]  [ Q e7 ]  [ N x f8 ] , [ N x f8 ]  White has two pawns and a rook for the bishop and knight. Black retakes with the knight - it can now reach the inviting [ d4 ] square via e6.
 [ Q c6 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ B x d3 ] , [ Q x d3 ]  One pair of Bishops has been exchanged and now White can be a little more relaxed. Black has to either exchange the dark squared Bishops or reroute to a less active diagonal. I can't blame him for choosing the latter.
 [ R d6 ]  [ N x a5 ]  [ b4 ] , [ N c4 ]  Aha! White fell into my trap but he missed the other outcome namely that his doomed pawn at [ b3 ] was required to remain home and suffer the consequences because it prevented this fork. It's not the deadliest fork since white can avoid losing material with 29. [ R d3 ] [ N x a3 ] 30. [ R x a3 ] but black has just won a pawn extending his lead and now exchanges knight for bishop liquidating more material.
 [ R x c2 ]  [ Q x c2 ] , [ Q e3 + ]  ..white resigns in view of mate to follow (Qg3)..spotted that a while back ...! If nothing else this game is an example of what happens when you do not develop......
 [ K g8 ] , [ d3 ]  Controlling the [ e4 ] and making way for the B
 [ Q x d4 ] , [ Q g7 ]  Already Black is worse with three heavy pieces aiming diagonally at his exposed King.
 [ B e2 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ B x e2 ]  [ Q x e2 ] , [ B d6 ]  exchange would maintain your structure it may not be that big deal but since you already played [ a6 ] having double pawns would waste its effort exchange holds the same "tempo" since the move you develop will go to waste anyways on [ d6 ] (bd6). so instead 8...[ N x e5 ] 9.[ B x e5 ] 10...B[ d6 ] might look better.
 [ e x f5 ]  [ B x f5 ]  [ B x f5 ]  [ R x f5 ]  [ Q e3 ] , [ R a f8 ]  Every piece is in good use unlike whites pieces. Also the pawn position looks worse with white.
 [ e3 ] , [ e6 ]  28% to 28% with 42% draws now for what it's worth. Not that any of this DB analysis means too much but it still is somewhat valid. These are games from experts masters GMs IMs and even world champions in this DB but nobody less than Expert. So they probably know what they're doing and probably know what works and the outcomes of 1 2/3 million games builds a strong case of which lines tend to lead to what outcomes. Of note despite preparing for [ b5 ] to defend [ c4 ] bleck declines to try to save the pawn. Doing so usually leads to superior white development.
 [ O-O ] , [ R d1 ]  another interesting move...
 [ B g2 ]  [ B e6 ] , [ B e4 ]  White tries to retain material equality since the [ c4 ] pawn was not defendable.
 [ Q x c4 ] , [ R x b8 ]  he gains the material
 [ c5 ]  [ c3 ] , [ c4 ]  ?! A dubious move releasing all of the tension in the center and allows White to do as he pleases.
 [ Q d6 ]  [ a3 ] , [ a6 ]  restricts whites light colored bishop.
 [ N c5 ]  [ B x c5 ] , [ R x c5 ]  This simplifies my material advantage.
 [ c x d4 ]  [ Q x d4 + ]  [ K g8 ] , [ R e1 ]  ! Good using all of the pieces.
 [ R x d4 + ]  [ B d7 ]  [ Q g5 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ R d1 ]  [ R c8 ]  [ a3 ] , [ R f8 ]  Discovered attack
 [ B c5 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N g4 ] , [ B x f7 + ]  If 8. [ K x f7 ] 9. [ N g5 + ] ... 10. [ Q x g4 ] with great menace on black's kingside and the black king cannot castle
 [ N x h2 ] , [ Q f6 ]  i want to position my queen activly on the kingside but i don't choose a very good spot
 [ N d3 ]  [ R e3 ]  [ N x c1 ] , [ R x c1 ]  Black now has the bishop pair and will force white to open the king side with b-[ h6 ]  [ B h6 ]  [ f4 ] , [ B g7 ]  Black is threatening a pin
 [ K f2 ]  [ d4 ]  [ g3 ] , [ d3 ]  I guess I better try to address that pawn... the writing is on the wall DV just needs to play a patient game and this game will win itself.
 [ Q x d3 ]  [ B x d3 ]  [ h x g3 ] , [ R f f7 ]  Not what you want to see as the black king.
 [ d3 ] , [ h6 ]  White advances pawn to d3. Black responds with h6. This may seem like a wasted move for black I thought about it for a while before making the move as my black bishop has no chance in development now however what it does do is eliminate any significant advancement of white's bishop to attack [ N b f6 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ g5 ]  [ B e3 ] , [ R g8 ]  Black supports pawn with Rg8. If you look at the board now white is in serious trouble and quite limited with options. The game is pretty much won for black now. Do you agree? What would your move be for white at this stage?
 [ R e x e6 ]  [ R a1 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ K f1 ]  [ K g2 ] is probably better.
 [ B c2 ] , [ e6 ]  Would [ b g6 ] have been better? Or simply [ B x c2 ] ? The bishop is now shut out from Q side which is what I' was trying to avoid. Still at least my [ f8 ] bishop can move.
 [ c3 ] , [ d5 ]  This would have been stronger the previous move.
 [ Q b6 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ R f b8 ] , [ a3 ]  closing the queenside
 [ B g4 ]  [ O-O ]  [ Q d7 ]  [ Q e1 ]  [ O-O-O ]  [ N g5 ] , [ d x e5 ]  If now 12 NxBP Q-[ Q5 ] ch 13 K-[ R1 ] QxB 14 NxKR and Black virtually has 2 pieces for his Rook. The best line for White was the simple 12 B-N3.
 [ K d2 ] , [ R d8 ]  interestingly he doesn't take the pawn but decides to protect his pawn with his rook. Probably a better move.
 [ K f4 ]  [ K e7 ] , [ b6 ]  Rxb6? [ N d5 + ] wins. Of course Black played carefully and didn't fall for any cheapos.
 [ O-O-O ]  [ c5 ]  [ b5 ] , [ a4 ]  15. [ a4 ] - like this!
 [ g3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d3 ]  [ B g4 + ]  [ K e1 ]  [ K d7 ]  [ h3 ]  [ B f3 ]  [ R f1 ]  [ R e2 + ]  [ K d1 ]  [ R f8 ]  [ R x f3 ]  [ R x f3 ] , [ K x e2 ]  ...but manage to relieve some of it.
 [ K f6 ] , [ h4 ]  So that the black king is trapped in the corner. And if black plays the pawns they will be taken. Black submits here
 [ K f8 ]  [ R x c7 ] , [ R c6 ]  A simple challenge but it does not prevent wholesale pawn demolition.
 [ N f3 ]  [ N g f6 ]  [ h3 ] , [ c6 ]  Too passive and black becomes squeezed.
 [ K g2 ]  [ h4 ]  [ f4 ]  [ h3 + ]  [ K f1 ]  [ B f6 ]  [ B e4 ] , [ B d5 ]  I thought he was better to just protect his d-pawn.
 [ e3 ]  [ c x d4 ] , [ e x d4 ]  I didn't mind the exchange. It allows for my dark squared bishop to get into the action.
 [ e5 ]  [ a3 ]  [ B b7 ] , [ e3 ]  Preparing the breakthrough at the center.
 [ R d5 ]  [ K h5 ]  [ a4 ] , [ K h4 ]  going to promote my g pawn.
 [ N f6 ]  [ N d2 ] , [ N g4 ]  Threatening to go for the [ f2 ] pawn again.
 [ e x d5 ]  [ B x d5 ]  [ c x d6 ]  [ Q x d6 ] , [ f3 ]  (?) Hard to say how I could have missed 21. Qc5! [ Q x c5 ] 22. [ R x c5 ] [ c6 ] 23. [ R x a6 ] and Black will lose a huge amount of material.
 [ Q x c3 ] , [ R d d1 ]  Whites only move that doesn't lose
 [ K x g3 ] , [ B x e5 + ]  Ok maybe I am crazy. But now I AM threatening Rf4! so the king cannot go to h4. The only other move is exB. After which [ Q g4 + ] [ Q g5 ] (forced: if [ K h3 ] Rf3#) after which I MUST exchange the queens (if I allow [ K x h5 + ] surprisingly... I WOULD BE MATED IN FEW MOVES!) and then I will win with my pawns (and his king so far... curiously if he checks me [ R g8 ] HE goes mated in few moves... can you see this?). But... is there anything better? 38. [ Q x e5 + ] 38. ... [ K h3 ] 39. Qe3+! [ K x h4 ] (forced unless black wants to interpose the knight) 40. [ R f4 + ] QxR (forced) 41. QxQ+ [ K h3 ] 42. QxN and [ R g8 ] doesn't help because of 43. [ R g7 ] RxR 44. QxR [ R e8 ] 45. Kf2! and white mates in few moves! 38. ... Kg4. If I take the knight I get stalled in perpetual checks with care not to lose a tempo or I can try 39. [ Q f5 + ] [ K h3 ] and we are in pretty the same position I just analyzed it with the big difference that I cannot play the winning Qe3+! So I have to look for another move after Kg4. Maybe 39. [ R g7 ] [ R c8 ] 40. [ Q x g4 + ] and mate. Since I cannot see any other good move by black I think I have won the game... Let's see if it is true.
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ N c6 ]  I do vary my openings a little but I'm most comfortable with good old ...[ N c6 ] and that's especially what I'm most likely to play when my opponent's rating is lower than mine as here.
 [ N x b4 ] , [ Q x a4 ]  OK black is clearly ahead by a pawn but this position is still almost a certain draw. Bad play by white might give black a chance to win but so far white has only blundered once in 50 moves. So I'm estimating a 2% chance for black to turn this into a win...
 [ B g4 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N c6 ]  [ c3 ] , [ Q c7 ]  The DB gives this as only the second most common move after 7... [ e6 ] but again the two lines are likely to transpose into each other.
 [ a4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ d3 ]  [ e5 ]  [ e4 ]  [ d4 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ b3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ c3 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ B a3 ]  [ B x a3 ] , [ N x a3 ]  Trading bishops
 [ R g2 ] , [ R x h3 ]  and i'm going to win an other : [ e3 ] or [ g4 ] maybe...
 [ Q c2 ] , [ a6 ]  Preparing to attack the white pole bishop with [ b5 ] following by [ c4 ] and strong position
 [ R b7 ]  [ R x b7 ] , [ a x b7 ]  Eh? When I look back at this move I wonder what I was thinking. Did I just think it advanced the pawn to the 7th? Clearly the Rook must be taken by the Bishop so it's still covering the Queening square and Black will be forced to give up the Knight for the resulting Queen. Then I would have a Bishop to help stop Black's passed pawns and a pawn majority on the K-side. It probably might have been enough to win. This way it all goes awry. I later wondered how Black managed to get a draw and the answer is probably here.
 [ R x h4 ]  [ N x h4 ] , [ N x d4 ]  And he starts to grab them.
 [ N e6 ]  [ N x e6 ]  [ B x e6 ] , [ e5 ]  forces N to move and then two pawns will be pinned.
 [ N x d2 ]  [ Q x d2 ] , [ c6 ]  Other move is 7...O-O 8. [ a3 ] [ B e7 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ O-O ]  [ d x c4 ]  [ B x c4 ]  [ N b6 ]  [ B b3 ] , [ N d5 ]  Other than Black have to played 11... O-O here 12. [ a3 ] [ B e7 ] 13. [ Q c2 ] [ a5 ]  [ e4 ] , [ N f6 ]  12...[ N x c3 ] is playable
 [ R g4 ] , [ R x g4 ]  ...and no one will know how this nice endgame would have been :-(
 [ c x b4 ]  [ c x b4 ]  [ O-O ]  [ Q b3 ]  [ R b8 ]  [ a3 ] , [ c5 ]  ! White can no longer keep his blockade.
 [ B x h4 ] , [ R x h4 ]  It is always dangerous to risk a rook that way but I felt I colud succeed in saving it if ever attacked by the black pawns.
 [ R c1 ]  [ Q b4 ] , [ a3 ]  Black prepares to seize the long diagonal with... B-Kt2.
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ e5 ]  [ d5 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ B x c6 ] , [ b x c6 ]  These are book moves so no real comment here. By the way the reason black retakes with the pawn and not the bishop is because he realizes the imbalance of white's kingside majority vs black's queenside majority. Therefore it makes more sense to get the pawns "rolling" rather than recapturing with a piece and blocking the pawns.
 [ R g2 ]  [ Q h1 + ]  [ K f2 ]  [ Q h4 + ] , [ K f1 ]  Mission accomplished. As a bonus with the Queen on [ h4 ] White can no longer play [ B x f4 ] to relieve some of the pressure. Now with plenty of time and tempo Black can bring additional forces to bear.
 [ B g5 ] , [ h6 ]  Finally White's long awaited Bishop is developed. Black do not want his knight to be pinned for long and hence White's Bishop is attacked by h6.
 [ e6 ]  [ a3 ]  [ a6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ b5 ]  [ B a2 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ d3 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ h3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ Q e2 ] , [ B b7 ]  We've developed into a closed style structure. I'm looking to attempt to possibly break with d5.
 [ O-O ] , [ e5 ]  Establishing a strong central presence and probably hoping I'll take e.p.
 [ N x f4 ]  [ Q g7 ]  [ K b1 ]  [ N e7 ]  [ R x d6 ] , [ N c8 ]  Just here I'm still hurumphing over the loss of my queen and wondering how I can fork her and nab hers. When summat occurs to me....
 [ N x d3 ]  [ c x d3 ] , [ B x f3 ]  ??
 [ N e4 ] , [ O-O ]  Good time to O-O ! Before the storm ...
 [ Q x d4 ] , [ N e7 ]  need 1 more attacker to take out the central pawn out for good
 [ K e7 ] , [ B f6 + ]  the funs not over sucker come away from the rook
 [ Q x c3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ Q c2 ] , [ N d4 ]  Forks the Q and the pawn on [ e2 ] which cannot be defended. White's back row is in disarray and Black's knights are dominating the whole board.
 [ h3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ B d3 ] , [ d5 ]  Nature Says Bishop on [ d3 ] must play [ d5 ] to not transpose this with [ e4 ] to a Kingside attack(30 moves later)
 [ R e1 + ] , [ K d7 ]  A sign Black has messed up in the opening. Black has to concede a piece and leaves white materially equal and with a devastating position and attack.
 [ g x f4 ] , [ N x f4 ]  20. [ N x f4 ] - pawn trade.
 [ N x d7 ] , [ R x d7 ]  Keeping the presure on the d column preparing doubling Rs...
 [ d4 ]  [ a4 ] , [ d3 ]  
 [ O-O ]  [ d6 ]  [ d3 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ N b d2 ]  [ Q f6 ] , [ b4 ]  white wasting no time clearing space for the b file by offering the pawn.
 [ B a2 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ B x h4 ] , [ N f4 ]  i was hoping for nxh4.
 [ R x d3 ]  [ B x d3 ] , [ Q c7 ]  ! Stronger than the immediate R-B fork by 25...[ Q d6 ] as this will pick up a pawn as well.
 [ c5 ] , [ B c4 ]  belatedly trying to control the a2-[ g8 ] diagonal and potentially block Black's attack on [ b2 ]  [ R h e1 ]  [ Q f4 + ]  [ K b1 ] , [ B f6 ]  Now [ b2 ] is the target in earnest. My Q cannot defend from c3. 18. [ Q d2 ] might defend followed by [ c3 ] but the B would be hanging. Perhaps I should attack the Q with 18. g3. After the Q moves I can play 19. [ Q d2 ]  [ Q x e3 ]  [ R x e3 ] , [ e x f3 ]  A whole piece and two pawns down there's no point carrying on. Perhaps rather than criticise others' efforts I should concentrate on removing errors from my own game.
 [ B x f8 ]  [ R x f8 ]  [ Q x b2 ]  [ c5 ]  [ d x c5 ]  [ b x c5 ]  [ Q x b7 ]  [ N x b7 ]  [ a5 ] , [ d6 ]  This move let slip all of my work to this point and gave my opponent the edge and an opening to the endgame. However....
 [ N c6 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ N x e5 ] , [ O-O ]  White has completed his development except for the queen. His pieces are a little limited and Black is about to gain counterplay in the centre but White is in good shape if he can move his forces into action.
 [ R x c1 ]  [ Q x c1 ]  [ R c3 ]  [ Q d1 + ]  [ K e4 ]  [ Q x g4 ]  [ R c6 ]  [ Q g2 + ]  [ K e5 ] , [ Q d5 # ]  
 [ c3 ]  [ b5 ]  [ a x b5 ]  [ a x b5 ]  [ R x a8 ]  [ Q x a8 ] , [ B d3 ]  It's hard to miss how completely undefended the light squares are for black.
 [ d4 ] , [ e x d4 ]  White tried to get tricky threatening 24. [ d5 ] with a pawn fork against black's bishop at [ e3 ] and knight at c3. However white's bishop is still en prise and black can exchange in the center making sure that white's knight is not on [ d4 ] when black plays [ N x e2 ] thus gaining a piece.
 [ b4 ]  [ Q d8 ] , [ N d6 # ]  And its mate with all the pieces on the board !!!
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ] , [ c5 ]  The Benoni system
 [ h x g6 ] , [ c4 ]  Starting the pawn advance.
 [ B b1 ] , [ f5 ]  The white pawn on [ e4 ] is pinned might as well attack it.
 [ B g5 ] , [ B c7 ]  Preventing Bishop-[ d8 ]  [ B h4 ]  [ h6 ]  [ a4 ] , [ N c8 ]  Avoiding; a5...Knight move; a6!?
 [ Q b2 ] , [ a5 ]  Not sure about this either. I seem to have become determined to attack on the q-side where all White's pieces are rather than the k-side where they weren't. Doesn't seem logical in retrospect. White is gradually re-centralising his pieces while Black gains space on the q-side.
 [ N g6 ] , [ R c4 x c7 ]  White now owns an open file and has a positional and material advantage. However there is still a whole game to win.
 [ N f3 ] , [ N f6 ]  the petrov's defence. Most opponents played [ N x e5 ] and after [ d6 ] they could play 4.[ N f3 ] or 4.Nxf7!? After 4.[ N f3 ] [ N x e4 ] the most common move is Nc3. The move I hated to see was the very dull 5.d4.
 [ b x a4 ]  [ b x a3 ]  [ a x b3 ]  [ a x b3 ]  [ B x b3 ]  [ f4 ]  [ K e7 ]  [ f5 ]  [ B d5 + ]  [ f3 ]  [ R b8 ]  [ K g3 ]  [ R b3 ]  [ K g4 ]  [ R x f3 ] , [ a4 ]  Black now has mate in five
 [ N d7 ] , [ K h2 ]  Once you use a repertoire long enough its ideas creep into your play even when you are trying to play an interesting new game. The move accomplishes two things. It provides a waiting move and it sets the stage for a potential kingside assault. I do not really know if I want to fully commit to the kingside thrust yet.
 [ N c6 ] , [ B g5 ]  Apparently I'm supposed to play 0-0 [ h3 ] [ B e3 ] and work towards d3-[ [ d4 ] ] all of which begs the question 'Why not play d2-[ [ d4 ] ] in the first place?'
 [ d x e4 ]  [ B c4 ] , [ e3 ]  Threats now abound in the king's quadrant - [ e x f2 ] Bxh1...
 [ Q e4 ] , [ B x f6 ]  White try to attach [ B x f6 ] but I attach [ g x f6 ] next.
 [ K f8 ]  [ K e2 ]  [ K e7 ]  [ K d2 ]  [ K d6 ]  [ K c3 ] , [ K c5 ]  Now that the passed pawn is protected how can I put White into Zugzwang.
 [ Q x d2 ]  [ B g3 ]  [ R c c8 ]  [ Q x b7 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ Q a6 ]  White still has a chance with his free pawn on c.
 [ N x e5 + ] , [ f x e5 ]  good move by black but too late
 [ N d5 ]  [ Q h7 ]  [ N f6 + ]  [ K e7 ]  [ N x h7 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ B d4 ]  [ K d8 ]  [ B x e5 ] , [ d x e5 ]  Should have taken with bishop.
 [ N e4 ] , [ N g f6 ]  And now my development is almost complete. Notice that white has a space advantage his pieces are fairly coordinated but there is not yet great pressure on black's king.
 [ B x c1 ]  [ R e x c1 ] , [ N e8 ]  exposing the weakness of [ f2 ]  [ b x c6 ]  [ b x c6 ] , [ Q c2 ]  ?! Alternative variation: 22. [ N d1 ] [only move] 22... [ Q f6 ] 23. [ Q c3 ] [ N c7 ] 24. [ R c2 ] [ N e6 ] 25. [ R d2 ] [ N g5 ] 26. [ N f e3 ] [⩱]
 [ O-O ]  [ h3 ]  [ B h5 ]  [ B f4 ] , [ N a6 ]  15. ..... [ N [ a6 ] ] - a poor square for my knight on [ a6 ] but that knight does become a vital defender to that square [ c7 ] where a white knight will threaten a fork for many moves to come.
 [ B f5 + ] , [ N d7 ]  19. ... [ R d7 ] 20. [ R f d1 ] might be better for Black but results in unfavorable trades at the end of which White's Queen will rule the board.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ Q h5 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ Q x e5 + ]  [ B e7 ]  [ Q b5 ]  [ O-O ]  [ e5 ]  [ N e4 ] , [ d4 ]  Here I like [ d3 ] better as it pretty much pushes the knight to [ c5 ] where [ B e3 ] pushes it again helping white develop.
 [ Q c2 ] , [ Q e8 ]  Three threats to [ a4 ] versus two defenders. There are five potential attackers.
 [ Q x f3 ]  [ B x e5 ] , [ Q b3 ]  attacking the b pawn
 [ K x f4 ]  [ b4 ]  [ a x b4 ]  [ K x b4 ]  [ h4 ]  [ a5 ]  [ h3 ]  [ a6 ]  [ h2 ]  [ a7 ]  [ h1 = Q ]  [ a8 = Q ]  [ Q x f3 ]  [ Q d8 ]  [ Q e4 + ]  [ K c3 ]  [ Q e5 + ]  [ K c4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ Q d2 + ] , [ K f5 ]  
 [ Q c2 ] , [ R f e8 ]  ...and double up on the e-file lining up a potential checkmate...
 [ R a d1 ] , [ Q x d3 ]  At this point I decided enough was enough ... he was slowly getting pieces into play and I was still trapped. Trading the queen off (he'd pretty much have to take with the pawn) would buy me some time to try and unlock my e pawn and have my rook get to that file to eventually try and dislodge the bishop.
 [ N c2 + ]  [ K d1 ]  [ N x a1 ] , [ e x f6 ]  I finally "win" the knight on [ f3 ] but at what cost!? LOL.
 [ R x e6 + ] , [ K x e6 ]  ...then we exchange rooks.
 [ R x d1 ] , [ B x d1 ]  redfoxrising: 24. [ K x d1 ] [ K x e5 ] 25.[ R x b7 ] thewrongreason: Unless the other commentators think otherwise I will also vote for 24.Kxd1. archduke_piccolo: There is... ... an alternative in 24.[ N x f7 ] but I don't think that it gives us much: 1. [ N x f7 ] [ B f3 ] 2. [ R x b7 ] [ h x g4 ] 3. [ h x g4 ] [ B x g4 ] 4. [ N d6 ] Ke5! Not 4...Bxf5?? as then 5.Ne8ch will win material for White. But White would have to move the knight somewhere: [A] 6.Nc4ch [ K f6 ] or [B] 6.[ N e8 ] [ N d7 ] Both lines seem to hold for Black. So I'll vote for 24.Kxd1.
 [ Q g1 + ]  [ N b1 ] , [ Q x b1 + ]  You know you are winning when you see a move like this made in desperation.
 [ Q g3 ] , [ a5 ]  Instantly aiming to open up the black kings defences and maybe create threats of my own I can't let my opponent gain control again!
 [ N f6 ] , [ d3 ]  It's always very gratifying when you lose an exchange and still manage to prevail.
 [ a3 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ d x c4 ]  [ B x c4 ]  [ B e7 ] , [ B f4 ]  i don't want to exchange my bishop. Because it is at active position.
 [ b4 ]  [ N x c4 ]  [ d x c4 ]  [ B b6 ]  [ Q c1 ]  [ K g8 ]  [ B x h6 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ h5 ]  [ Q f6 ]  [ h x g6 ]  [ Q x g6 ] , [ g4 ]  Here my oppenen has a slight edge if I were scoreing this I'd put this as a (1.50) for white
 [ Q e4 ] , [ B c8 ]  Manoeuvring the bishop round to [ b7 ] to attack the queen.
 [ R c d8 ]  [ a5 ] , [ N d4 ]  Expected ... and brutally effective.
 [ O-O ] , [ f5 ]  (!?) See next move by Black...
 [ N d5 ]  [ B x d5 ]  [ Q x d5 ]  [ Q x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ b5 ]  [ O-O ]  [ g4 ]  [ B g6 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ c6 ]  [ a4 ]  [ f6 ]  [ N x g6 ]  [ h x g6 ]  [ B a3 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ B c5 ] , [ B x c5 ]  20..... [ N d7 ] ?!. 21 [ B x b6 ] Nxb6. 22. [ b x c6 ] bxc6. 23 0-0 leaves white with options. The played 20.... [ B x c5 ] will follow with [ d x c5 ] and makes that pawn vulnerable there instead of being a strong center pawn. I think this will give black more options also because the black rooks will work together quicker than white can bring in his second rook.
 [ N f6 + ]  [ K d8 ]  [ B x b7 ] , [ c6 ]  ! This cuts off the Bishop from the corner and threatens mate.
 [ d x e2 + ]  [ Q x e2 ]  [ N x a1 ]  [ f4 ] , [ B f5 ]  Setting a little trap. My opponent didn't consider it and the game is over.
 [ b x c6 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ d x c5 ] , [ b x c5 ]  This is a mistake: why not Bxc5? He probably wants to make pressure on the center and use the a and b columns for attack but he is making my a pawn free.
 [ Q d3 ]  [ c6 ]  [ N e3 ]  [ Q d7 ]  [ N x f5 ]  [ Q x f5 ]  [ Q x f5 ]  [ N x f5 ]  [ N e2 ]  [ h6 ]  [ B f4 ] , [ B x b2 ]  A cheap material snatch.
 [ B g4 ] , [ O-O ]  "Please change knights while opening my defence" says White.
 [ R x g5 ] , [ R f6 + ]  Another attempt at checking the king to delay the inevitable.
 [ B f5 ]  [ K d2 ] , [ R a2 + ]  get back in there
 [ B g4 ]  [ Q d3 ]  [ B x d1 ]  [ Q x d1 ]  [ Q d7 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ Q e7 ]  35. ......... [ Q e7 ] - now it is my turn to b****r about. I think I should have got in my [ g5 ] move here instead of next move. To lose one tempo can be costly. Thankfully not here.
 [ f5 ] , [ g x f5 ]  To develop the lsb is ok but 1) it leaves unguarded [ b7 ] and 2) Taking with the N is a step forward for both my Q and N way to h4.
 [ B b3 ]  [ N e3 ] , [ B c3 ]  White is losing a piece now. After 30.[ N f1 ] black will snack on the q-side: [ B x b4 ] and [ B x a4 ] and the d-pawn is still a pain in the ass for white
 [ N f3 ] , [ R b2 ]  Threatening [ c2 ] to reget my lost pawn.
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ O-O ]  [ d5 ] , [ B b5 + ]  not quite sure this is correct. Until this move i think it is theory and the pawn lost on move 3 is not essential
 [ e5 ] , [ N f3 ]  My usual move...
 [ d x e4 ] , [ N g5 ]  White's other option [ N e5 ] doesn't attack anything so this move is slightly more preferred.
 [ B e7 ] , [ R e1 ]  But it enables me to pin his Be7. The pin although not serious yet is a burden for Loyd and increases the pressure.
 [ N c8 ]  [ Q f1 ]  [ N g4 ] , [ B g5 + ]  Black resigns. if 21... QxB 22 RxBch!! forces mate.
 [ B d3 ]  [ N g4 ] , [ N d1 ]  Not falling for those easy traps.
 [ R a6 ]  [ d x c4 ]  [ b x c4 ]  [ g4 ] , [ N g3 ]  [ g4 ] had to be the biggest blunder. The knight has infiltrated and I have made many weaknesses.
 [ R e b1 ]  [ R h8 ] , [ h3 ]  Trying to remove the pressure on h2.
 [ f x g4 ] , [ R b d1 ]  I'm setting up Black for [ Q x c5 ] [ N d7 ]  [ Q c3 ]  [ a x b5 ] , [ K a7 ]  Opening the a-file is too dangerous for Black.
 [ B x c6 + ]  [ b x c6 ] , [ c4 ]  Now the more traditional [ c4 ] to match the [ d4 ] pawn move... just the 12th move instead of the 2nd.
 [ N c6 ]  [ O-O ] , [ g6 ]  I wanted to contest the d4-square and keep the c8-[ h3 ] diagonal open for the LSB though I bet there's nothing against the more passive looking development with ...[ e6 ] ...[ B e7 ] etc.
 [ R c7 ]  [ Q f3 ]  [ B g6 ] , [ R c b1 ]  Going to push some pawns. I dont want them in my half of the board.
 [ R a c1 ]  [ Q f5 ] , [ R c7 ]  A decision to attack aggressively almost cost me in this game. I have chosen the [ f7 ] Square to focus my power and Black chooses f1.
 [ N d8 ] , [ B c4 ]  Continuing development - Black is very cramped now.
 [ R f7 + ]  [ K e6 ] , [ K g7 ]  threatening Rf6+: White resigned...
 [ B x c3 ] , [ Q d3 ]  ? He should have recaptured.
 [ d5 ] , [ d3 ]  My opening is considered unorthodox because I have blocked both bishops but I want to develop my bishops to [ d2 ] and e2. A lot of people say that it is a passive setup but I don't think playing agressive in the opening is necessary unless your opponent makes a mistake.
 [ K f2 ]  [ K f6 ]  [ K e3 ] , [ K e7 ]  32. ..... [ K e7 ] - here I decided to put the question to Dave in the form of a Draw Offer. I thought I had done enough to keep him out. Dave thought so too and accepted my Draw Offer. After the acceptance of the Draw Offer I did request Computer Analysis. Gameknot assessed the position as: Score: -0.64 which meant the position was slightly in Dave's favour so the Draw Offer was a good call. Interestingly enough Gameknot did not flag up either side's moves in yellow - so no blunders mistakes or even innaccuracies - this was certainly very encouraging for me! Soon it will be my turn to play against the Petrov against Dave and it will be very interesting to see how I get on there. Anyhow - time to bask in this latest success - cheers and bye for now - Joanne.
 [ f4 ]  [ N b6 ]  [ f5 ] , [ N c4 ]  Another pawn goes...
 [ e4 ]  [ g6 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ a4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ b3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B c4 ]  [ c6 ]  [ Q f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ h3 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ B a3 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ Q d3 ]  [ R d8 ]  [ B x e6 ]  [ f x e6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N a6 ]  [ N g5 ]  [ Q d7 ]  [ Q c4 ]  [ N c7 ]  [ O-O ]  [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ Q e2 ]  [ Q f5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ R d e8 ]  [ d3 ]  [ e4 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ Q d7 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ e x d3 ]  [ Q x d3 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ N c e2 ]  [ c5 ]  [ B b2 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ B x d4 ]  [ B x d4 ]  [ Q x d4 ]  [ N e6 ]  [ Q e3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ Q f3 ]  [ Q f7 ]  [ R a d1 ]  [ N g5 ]  [ Q d3 ]  [ R a d8 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ N e6 ]  [ N x e6 ]  [ Q x e6 ]  [ f4 ]  [ d4 ]  [ f5 ]  [ Q e3 + ]  [ K h1 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ Q c4 + ]  [ K g7 ]  [ R f3 ]  [ Q g5 ]  [ R x d4 ]  [ N d2 ]  [ f6 + ]  [ K h8 ]  [ R x d8 ]  [ R x d8 ]  [ Q c7 ] , [ R g8 ]  After 41. ... [ R g8 ] here is the move sequence I saw as advantageous for White:
 [ N c3 ] , [ N c6 ]  Both moves have been good centralising ones.
 [ e x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ] , [ Q d6 ]  Another bad move. Now [ c7 ] becomes a huge target.
 [ B c8 ] , [ N g3 ]  ? changed plans -- now I planned [ N f6 ] and after [ B x f6 ] [ e x f6 ] I can play [ N e4 ] -- or that was the plan
 [ d4 ] , [ K f4 ]  42. [ K f4 ] - Henry has caught the smell of his favourite nosh! P(r)awns! He wants them with piri-piri sauce today!
 [ Q g3 ] , [ f5 ]  The Pawns are sweeping forward in an inexorable Black wave pushing aside everything in their path.
 [ K g8 ] , [ B x b5 ]  he got a pwn for his discovery. whew
 [ B x e4 ]  [ B x b2 ]  [ B x h7 + ]  [ K h8 ] , [ B f5 ]  The reason this line is playable white gains a tempo attacking the queen in which white can use to move the rook to safety.
 [ R f e1 ] , [ Q d7 ]  ????????
 [ K e8 ] , [ R d6 ]  Black looses queen or bishop and rook
 [ R x d8 ] , [ R x d8 ]  Black regains the open file now
 [ f5 ]  [ c4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ g3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ B g2 ]  [ c6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ Q d7 ]  End of thematic
 [ K x c7 ] , [ B x c8 ]  Having avoided piece exchanges up until now suddenly it's just pawns.
 [ R x d1 + ]  [ R x d1 ]  [ R d8 ]  [ R x d8 + ]  [ Q x d8 ]  [ B x a8 ]  [ Q x a8 ]  [ N g5 ]  [ g6 ] , [ N x f7 + ]  Comment: (apastpawn) Was reevaluating this move while the automatic moves were being made. This is stronger than Qxc7. As [ c7 ] will still be there. After receiving this comment I resigned on the grounds of ruinous loss of material as I am already 2 pawns down and am about to lose at least another so time to throw in the sponge. Back to the issue of king safety regarding castling. I think it is a case of knowing when and when not to move that h pawn. In this case I feel the h pawn should have been moved. This would have made the king much safer. Just look at that final position and look at how horribly exposed the black king is now!! So I feel I have been well and truly given an Expert Lesson in King Safety.
 [ c x d4 ]  [ Q x d4 ]  [ R e8 ] , [ f4 ]  Only one left I think. N in [ e5 ] is centered but fixed also.
 [ R x c6 ]  [ Q x c6 + ]  [ K b8 ]  [ N d6 ]  [ R c7 ] , [ Q b6 + ]  Luckily seems that White has nothing better than a perpetual. If he tries something different it may backfire because Black has [ R c1 + ] and the pawn on [ d4 ] can easily become strong.
 [ B f6 ]  [ N c2 ]  [ R d6 ]  [ N e1 ] , [ R f d8 ]  Now I plan to use the Pawn as a battering ram.
 [ b x c3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e x d6 ]  [ e ]  [ p ] , [ Q x d6 ]  A show of confidence... White has 3 pawn islands to Black's 2 and no immediate way of attacking the Q
 [ N f3 ] , [ c5 ]  black will want to attack on the queenside so he makes space there.
 [ a x b4 ]  [ a x b4 ] , [ R x d2 ]  After W recaptures I intended ...[ R c4 ] defending the d-pawn and threatening the b-pawn.
 [ Q e7 ]  [ K x g2 ]  [ B e6 ] , [ R a f1 ]  Lange's plan is to chop away the King's defenses with his other pieces before moving the Knight in for the kill.
 [ R f7 + ] , [ R c7 ]  ? This falls for a devastating fork.
 [ N d7 ] , [ Q x b7 ]  May better was Qxd5. Anyway this move will cost white a lot in developement thanks to the queen's chase that will follow.
 [ Q c2 ]  [ R b2 ] , [ Q g6 ]  :)
 [ N x a3 ]  [ B c6 ] , [ Q b3 ]  This way I can continue to advance my pawns and continue to threat f7.
 [ K c5 ]  [ R e3 ]  [ b8 = Q + ]  [ K f3 ]  [ R x e3 + ]  [ K x e3 ]  [ Q g3 + ]  [ K d2 ]  [ K c4 ] , [ K c2 ]  I realize he won't resign so I try to find the fastest mate.
 [ R b6 + ] , [ K a7 ]  Mate in 2.
 [ B x f3 ] , [ Q x f3 ]  I didn't want to double my KB-pawns with PxB.
 [ Q e7 ]  [ Q x e7 + ] , [ B x e7 ]  And from here the game is downhill.
 [ B g2 ] , [ N e4 + ]  ... so now my knight is protected by the rook and the bishop...
 [ e4 ] , [ R b8 ]  supporting the pawn charge
 [ N c3 ] , [ d5 ]  Then I change my mind Lets do the thing..
 [ B x a4 ]  [ B x a4 ]  [ R a5 x a4 ]  [ R b2 ] , [ R a4 a2 ]  the rook is pinned I need only exchange to a winning endgame. the outside passed pawn should win.
 [ Q x b1 + ] , [ B c1 ]  White played this move then resigned. She realised that she would still have to interpose with her queen and that would have been the end of her counter-play in the e-file. White had so much going for her in this game (apart from the overlooked checkmate at move 10): fine quick development solid centralised position more space gains in time here and there some good decisions - all spoilt by a miscalculated counter-attack at the close.
 [ R e8 ] , [ f5 ]  Pushing back his bishop.
 [ R e g1 ] , [ B c5 ]  Kosteniuk is falling behind on the clock which showed only 10 seconds left and Anand might have pinned his hopes on the clock.
 [ Q d7 ] , [ Q x d7 + ]  to prevent the castling
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ N c3 ]  Petrov's Three Knights' Game. This can easily transpose to an equal (if perhaps dull) Four Knights' Game with 3...[ N c6 ] or stay the Petrov line with 3...[ B b4 ] (where Black will get his e-pawn back without much trouble if White cares to take it) and fighting chances.
 [ B x c3 ]  [ B x c3 ]  [ Q h4 + ]  [ g3 ]  [ N x g3 ]  [ h x g3 ] , [ Q x h1 ]  I've done this thousands of times.
 [ b3 ] , [ R c4 c6 ]  White wants to kick out my rook and I have the place for him. Perhaps white is going to the other side to try and constrain my movements.
 [ b x c5 ] , [ B x f4 ]  My dark bishop is "good" but his knight is better an the doubled pawns on the f file will slow him down.
 [ g6 ] , [ Q x c5 ]  He'll probably move his King's Pawn now so his bishop will attack my queen so I'll move my queen to a more protected area so he can't just develop his pieces by attacking my queen.
 [ N f3 + ]  [ K d1 ] , [ N x e1 ]  Gobble thanks for the rook.
 [ f x g5 ]  [ h4 ] , [ R h8 ]  hxg isn't possible because of the pin.
 [ B e7 ]  [ h x g4 ]  [ B x g5 ]  [ B x g5 ]  [ R x g5 ]  [ R x h5 ] , [ R d g8 ]  but here Black goes wrong. Much better was 19...[ R x h5 ] 20.gh [ Q f4 ] putting White under real pressure. I didn't play this because I missed that [ B x h7 ] can be met by [ N f6 ] with a big advantage rather than the obvious Rh8.
 [ Q x b5 + ]  [ Q d7 ] , [ N x f6 + ]  Computer analysis: Best: +9.87 » 15. [ N x c7 + ] [ K e7 ] 16. [ R x d7 + ] [ R x d7 ] 17. [ N d5 + ] [ R x d5 ] 18. [ e x d5 ] [ N c d7 ] 19. [ B x f6 + ] [ N x f6 ] 20. [ Q b4 + ] [ K e8 ] 21. [ Q x b6 ] [ N d7 ] 22. [ Q c6 ] [ K e7 ] 23. [ R d1 ] [ K e8 ] 24. [ Q c8 + ] [ K e7 ]  [ R x d7 ]  [ R x d7 ] , [ B x f6 ]  Threathening the Rook and taking pawns.
 [ K g2 ] , [ R f6 ]  Increasing the scope of the rook still further.
 [ c x b2 ] , [ Q b3 ]  This move is forced to prevent both pawn promotion and [ R d1 + ]  [ R a1 ] , [ Q c2 ]  Hort allows the re-arrival of the Black queen...
 [ R x e4 ]  [ B d3 ] , [ R e8 ]  Black has achieved his aim and that b-pawn is under a little pressure . But he's still way behind.
 [ N d7 ]  [ R g5 ] , [ Q e4 ]  This is good enough for a minor advantage but no more. If only I'd looked a little harder before 20 [ N d7 ] I would have seen 21. [ f4 ] [ R f5 ] 22. [ N x f8 ] [ K x f8 ] 23. [ R f1 ] which wins the exchange outright as initially planned.
 [ N f6 ]  [ f3 ]  [ B d6 ] , [ e5 ]  Drop it like it's hot (hot) drop it like it's hot (hot) And when a b--ch gets an- oh sorry I really don't have much to say about this schtuff. I figured a favorable pin was in store since I was feeling a threat in the middle so i figured that snatching a pawn or knight for a pawn was very good. Especially the bishop since it wasn't protected.
 [ B d7 ]  [ K b2 ]  [ R h8 ]  [ K b3 ]  [ B c8 ]  [ K a4 ] , [ Q e8 + ]  (o) Mr. Endon not crying 'Check! ' nor otherwise giving the slightest indication that he was alive to having attacked the King of his opponent or rather vis-à-vis Murphy was absolved in accordance with Law 18 from attending to it. But this would have been to admit that the salute was adventitious.
 [ Q a5 ] , [ N c2 ]  I want to trade equal material so that in the end game I have a bishop for 2 pawns usually a won game.
 [ c5 ]  [ R c6 ] , [ R d3 ]  40...Rd3? The plan to advance the b Pawn is understandable but considering the current situation it would have been better to forgo attacking the [ b3 ] Pawn and instead attack with 40...[ R d1 ] and later 41...[ R h1 ] or 41...Rg1.
 [ h x g5 ]  [ R e5 ]  [ R g8 ]  [ N x d5 + ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ R x d5 ] , [ K x e6 ]  White is a pawn down however it is a rook endgame so he has drawing chances.
 [ f x e3 ]  [ O-O ] , [ O-O ]  His pawn is pinned. My bishop is too kind of since once I move it he'll move [ c5 ] and put me in check. Unless I get that queen off that file. Also I can't quite kill that pawn since the queen is protecting it too! arg.
 [ c4 ] , [ Q e2 ]  ? I thought I would eye the knihgt on [ h5 ] however this allows white next move.
 [ N f6 ]  [ R x e4 ]  [ R h7 + ]  [ K e6 ] , [ h6 ]  Trying for promotion.
 [ K g8 ] , [ R d7 ]  And the e-pawn is insanely powerful.
 [ R f e1 ] , [ R e8 ]  It makes sense to exchange material.
 [ f3 ]  [ h5 ] , [ N f1 ]  19. [ N f1 ] - freeing up Fou Lenoir and adding a defense to my pawn on g3.
 [ d x e5 ] , [ B c5 ]  ??? if three question marks where possible this move certainly would deserve them all! Here i spent some time looking at the position to discover if this sacrifice was justified. No way. This is a blunder black can't attack with just two pieces (bishop and queen [when he takes on f6]) so let's accept the sacrifice...
 [ R d f1 ]  [ Q g6 ]  [ b3 ]  [ R f7 ]  [ N c2 ] , [ N g5 ]  Black has let it slip away Alternative variation: 27... [ R a f8 ] $11 [would save the game]
 [ c4 ] , [ g6 ]  He indicates a King's Indian Defence or Grunfeld.
 [ g x f6 ]  [ R e1 ] , [ K f8 ]  I have no problem with this set-up. The g file is open and the extra f pawn is useful in pressuring the center and keeping knights at bay. The downside is a loose king position and an isolated h pawn.
 [ O-O ]  [ R g1 ]  [ f6 ]  [ e x f6 ]  [ R x f6 ] , [ N g5 ]  Planing to exchange of knight for bishop. My reasoning is that it will open up the position a bit and two knights do not work quite as well together as a bishop and knight.
 [ K e8 ] , [ Q x c7 ]  ...and removes the c7-pawn...
 [ f x g5 ]  [ h x g5 ] , [ O-O-O ]  17. 0-0-0 - castling on the opposite side and preparing a line up of rooks on the h column perhaps?
 [ N e7 ] , [ N h7 ]  Clearing the square...
 [ b x c3 ] , [ d5 ]  If Black had played [ d6 ] then I'd still play my ninth move.
 [ K e7 ]  [ R b7 + ]  [ K d8 ]  [ R a8 + ]  [ R c8 ] , [ R x c8 + ]  Now with the rook gone the game is mine.
 [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ] , [ B b5 + ]  3. [ B b5 + ] - this is the start of the Nimzovich-Rossilimo Attack - this is about as aggressive as I get!
 [ N f3 ]  [ B d7 ] , [ B h6 + ]  ? What for?
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ c4 ] , [ N f6 ]  The Queen's Gambit Declined Marshall Defence.
 [ R x g1 ]  [ N x g1 ] , [ a8 = Q ]  But so does white.
 [ O-O-O ]  [ Q b6 ] , [ B c4 ]  Black is way off the pace here - he really needs some pieces to join his queen on the open board!
 [ R f e8 ] , [ e4 ]  ! Right in the nick of time. I realise that I need to lash out and this is an excellent way to do that. now my main intention is to undermine blacks control over the centre and take away blacks dynamic potential. The other very important point is that I open up the [ c4 ] square for use of my pieces and weaken the black pawn structure I also give my DSB the chance to develop to [ f4 ] and open up the d file for use of my pieces. After this very strong sacrifice I think white really takes over the flow of the game and now it's white who holds all the positional trumps in the position.
 [ Q x f6 ] , [ c3 ]  Developing the knight would have been easier to meet the threat and to continue development and to not hamper the position
 [ N x g4 ] , [ Q f3 ]  The queen is lined up...
 [ R x f4 ] , [ a6 ]  This is a complete inaccuracy White has a much more favourable position after 16. [ e5 ] [ N d7 ] 17. Qe2.
 [ N x e4 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ d5 ] , [ N x e5 ]  Still playing the main line of the Steinitz Attack.
 [ e6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ d5 ] , [ B d3 ]  Not good according to theory because this gives black a lead in development.
 [ e5 ] , [ Q c2 ]  2. [ Q c2 ] - unusual but in the db it favours white.
 [ N b5 ] , [ B a6 ]  now he is in danger
 [ K f8 ]  [ f x e6 ]  [ Q x f4 ]  [ e7 + ]  [ K x e7 ]  [ N x d5 + ]  [ K f8 ] , [ N x f4 ]  Black should have resigned by now.
 [ Q g3 + ] , [ K h1 ]  Forced.
 [ R x c5 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ Q a7 ]  [ N b5 ]  [ Q b6 ]  [ a4 ]  [ B x f3 ]  [ g x f3 ]  [ N h5 ] , [ R g1 ]  Notice that white struggles but he has given up the dark square bishop what would "control the dark squares" and now black is in-effect a piece to the good since white cannot compete on this color complex!
 [ O-O ]  [ N b d7 ] , [ d4 ]  Strong and normally enough to win.
 [ B f2 ]  [ B f8 ] , [ R c7 ]  I decide to go for a counter attack on the queen's side. My rook is here partly to scare black but also to keep the black king restricted
 [ N c3 ] , [ N x d4 ]  His Knight retreated and I thought this attack was a pawn up exchange. It was too soon to attack. I should've developed my other Knight first. [ N f6 ] or to [ e7 ] both look playable and then possibly centralised my h rook before launching my attack.
 [ N g4 ] , [ h3 ]  So just push it back
 [ Q a5 ] , [ B d2 ]  I think that 7. [ Q d2 ] was better.
 [ R a a8 ] , [ R h4 ]  Perhaps a rather pointless chasing of the Queen which now has escape via [ c1 ] anyway. The Black Rook can't leave the defence of the d-pawn so maybe keeping my own Rook on the g-file was a better idea.
 [ R b8 ] , [ g4 ]  Still hoping for a kingside attack perhaps? I was almost expecting White to play 30. [ B x f6 ] [ Q x f6 ] 31. [ R e8 + ] to pin my knight and make it difficult for me to activate my pieces but presumably White felt he couldn't afford any further exchanges.
 [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ g6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ e4 ]  [ d6 ] , [ f3 ]  The Sämisch variation. The f3-pawn supports the e4-pawn and the square [ g4 ] so that the black king's knight cannot go there to kick a bishop on e3. The minus is that white's g1-knight cannot go to his favorite square [ f3 ] and the development of white's kingside is "going to be rather clumsy." (J.Gallagher)
 [ f6 ] , [ N x g6 ]  Black capitulates. I'm quite sure my good buddy Caesar is relying on his endgame experience advantage. I'll continue to sip the Kool Aid.
 [ K b1 ]  [ N d7 f6 ] , [ c4 ]  Now life is going to get interesting
 [ N x e5 ]  [ f x e5 ] , [ Q h4 + ]  Now while the defender of [ h4 ] square removed black's queen can freely start to attack.
 [ d6 ]  [ B x h6 ] , [ B e6 ]  blocks the threat and forces the white queen to get out of Blacks face.
 [ N c3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ] , [ O-O ]  Still nothing to write home about.
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ N f6 ]  The Petroff Defence...as I have stated before this can lead to disappearing queens for both sides if beginners are playing...but these players aren't beginners.
 [ Q f2 ]  [ b4 ]  [ R f c1 ] , [ a5 ]  isn't that strong enough to compensate the piece? let us see... The two white rooks are completely passive and mine will have all liberty to attack from now. The only advantage he has is the bishop
 [ N b c6 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ g5 ]  [ N x c6 ]  [ N x c6 ] , [ N d2 ]  I did not trust [ Q h5 ] [ g x f4 ] 0-0 [ B g7 ] [ B x f4 ] Qb6+! [ R f2 ] 0-0-0...
 [ a6 ] , [ e5 ]  And there goes white. Very good very aggressive movement. Threatens to weak [ d6 ] after the exchange.
 [ a4 ]  [ K e5 ]  [ K f3 ] , [ K d5 ]  I thought his best chance was to stay back on [ e6 ] or maybe [ f6 ] but I'd still figured out that I could swing around to the queenside and eventually get in that way.
 [ N d7 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ O-O ]  [ h4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ B x d4 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ B b3 ]  [ b6 ] , [ O-O-O ]  I'm not sure if this is still theory but it can't be far off...
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ] , [ d4 ]  Playing for the Danish Gambit.
 [ f5 ]  [ R h4 ] , [ R f6 ]  22. ..... [ R f6 ] - organising his defense.
 [ N c6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ] , [ Q e2 ]  I didn't like [ Q c2 ] because although it's a direct threat my queen will get harrassed when Black doubles his rooks on the c-file.
 [ a4 ] , [ h7 ]  The pawn is still protected on [ h7 ] but black is running out of options.
 [ Q g7 + ] , [ R f7 ]  ?? Normally this is an ideal so I wouldn't play it normally. But what's normally good is a very serious blunder here. In that he accurately said "DANG fell for that.should went Ke7-Ke8". And my response was That's what I would have said to. Normally this move would be ideal because it usually attacks the Q so that black would have more time to develop attacks against the Q. But in this position best was 17...Ke8. Another option was also 17...[ K d6 ] but that move would not be much better because it leaves the K exposed. This move however loses the R. The lesson here is that what might appear good can be bad. So you don't if a move is good unless you know what makes it good. That's the reason that why is the most common chess question.
 [ R c8 + ]  [ K b3 ]  [ R c x c3 + ]  [ K a2 ]  [ R c2 + ]  [ K b1 ]  [ R b2 + ]  [ K c1 ]  [ R x h2 + ]  [ K b1 ] , [ R d1 # ]  ...but could do nothing else but delay the inevitable.
 [ Q x c6 ] , [ Q x e2 ]  Now that the bishop at [ c6 ] has met his quietus his lay brother at [ f3 ] takes over his duties...
 [ e4 ] , [ c5 ]  Sicilian. A basic one for me.
 [ a6 ]  [ B a4 ] , [ Q b4 + ]  Dropping the piece. Ouch. But I have excellent central expansion and control as compensation.
 [ h x g4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ R h1 + ]  [ K g8 ]  [ g5 ]  [ N h7 ]  [ Q h3 ] , [ Q x g5 + ]  what?
 [ Q d7 ]  [ N e1 ] , [ N g6 ]  The only way to get the bishop out.
 [ g x f4 + ]  [ K x f4 ]  [ R x c7 ]  [ N x c7 ]  [ K x c7 ]  [ R a b1 ] , [ b4 ]  It is too late anyway.
 [ d4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ f5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ b6 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ e3 ]  [ B b4 ]  [ Q c2 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B d3 ]  [ Q e8 ]  [ a3 ]  [ B x c3 + ] , [ Q x c3 ]  10.[ b x c3 ] is probably better so that White can keep control of e4.
 [ a7 ] , [ g4 ]  Now black wanted to fool me... well I'll fool him:
 [ b x a3 ]  [ B x a3 ]  [ Q b3 ]  [ R a1 ] , [ O-O ]  26. ..... 0-0 and I castle even later!
 [ e x f5 ]  [ Q x f5 ] , [ R e f1 ]  ? The only downside is that Stanley now has a threat against my K side. It starts to become overwhelming. So with only 2 minutes I only look for a good move which is this. With more time though I would've remembered what's important which is something that Ken emphasized in the form of a chess quote. "When you find a good move look for something better." Unfortunately there's no time to look now but had there been I would've played 22.[ f4 ] and would've been ready to exchange in order to prevent what's about to come. This my first mistake because as I'm about to discover it's going to lose a pawn without compensation.
 [ N d x e8 ] , [ R a5 ]  Misses ...[ Q b4 ] and the subsequent threat of [ Q e1 + ]  [ N x g7 ]  [ Q b4 ] , [ B c3 ]  this and [ N f5 ] are about equally good.
 [ Q x d2 ]  [ R x d2 ] , [ R a1 ]  I am forced to go defensive with the rook. I have to get my king into the centre before he gets his there
 [ Q x d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ Q x d5 ] , [ Q x d5 ]  Perhaps he feared the isolated queen pawn.
 [ K d5 ]  [ N a7 ] , [ K c4 ]  I expected both moves I had a plan.
 [ e x f6 ]  [ e ]  [ p ]  [ g x f6 ]  [ N h4 ]  [ N x h4 ]  [ B x h4 ] , [ f5 ]  I loved this move attacking 2 pieces at once. I really thought that at this point I had gotten out of a bad jam.
 [ O-O ] , [ N c6 ]  ... or maybe it is a good candidate for castling after all.
 [ b3 + ]  [ K d5 ]  [ R d1 + ] , [ N d4 ]  Since Tom's N is pinned I considered and had almost played 27.c3! As that would've won a piece for pawn. It took me a minute or two to figure out that 27.[ c4 # ] is mate since his K has nowhere to escape. And upon that I played it right away.
 [ c4 ] , [ e6 ]  if you can identify black's opening please do.
 [ Q f3 ] , [ e6 ]  better would have been 9. . [ N c6 ] threatening to take the [ e5 ] pawn forking the white queen and bishop.
 [ R x a4 + ] , [ K x a4 ]  
 [ e x f3 ]  [ e ] , [ p ]  To my delight he takes.
 [ B x d6 ] , [ N x e5 ]  ...but this is even worse. My Q is not completely lost but obviously the game will be his soon. So I planned a crazy crazy idea being sure he won't have fallen for it... (Alternative moves were: 23... BxN 24. BxB o-o!?...
 [ B h2 + ]  [ N x h2 ]  [ Q x h2 + ]  [ K f1 ]  [ N e4 ] , [ N x e4 ]  I had forgotten that K
 [ O-O-O ]  [ e x d5 ] , [ B x d5 ]  I am now dominating the centre.
 [ B e5 + ]  [ K g8 ]  [ Q g4 + ]  [ K f8 ]  [ Q f5 + ]  [ K g8 ] , [ N f6 + ]  Having manuevered the Q to support the N this check is fatal.
 [ e x f5 ] , [ Q e2 ]  Cramping black's position even more and putting pressure on the open column.
 [ B b5 ]  [ B d7 ] , [ B x c6 ]  White takes on [ [ c6 ] ] forcing an exchange and preventing [ [ c6 ] ] unless I decide to lose a tempo.
 [ R f c1 ]  [ N e c6 ]  [ a3 ]  [ R f7 ]  [ N x c6 ]  [ N x c6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ N a5 ]  [ Q a2 ]  [ N x c4 ] , [ Q x c4 ]  Black drops the rook back
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ d4 ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ c3 ] , [ d5 ]  I'm not familiar with this opening and was already out of my book.
 [ d x e5 ] , [ N g4 ]  can it be saved?
 [ B f6 ]  [ g5 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ h5 ]  [ e6 ]  [ R c5 ]  [ K f7 ] , [ R c7 + ]  I am after that bishop's head.
 [ N f6 ]  [ N d3 ] , [ N e4 ]  Looking to fork with [ N d2 ] on next move
 [ N d f6 ] , [ B x h6 ]  SMASH! The nutcracker.
 [ N c6 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ e6 ]  In the current position both players have four pieces in total near the center.
 [ B x e4 ]  [ B x e5 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ Q x e4 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ R a b1 ]  [ Q c6 ]  [ Q e2 ]  [ f5 ]  [ R f e1 ] , [ R a e8 ]  Blacks king is rather open there at the back. This was the main point of the spite check. Although i could't plan for this position I was rather happy to find his king hanging in limbo.
 [ N g3 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ B a2 ] , [ B b7 ]  This bishop is well-placed as will be shown later on in the game.
 [ c4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ g3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B g2 ] , [ b6 ]  If I was willing to surrender the diagonal [ B x c6 ] would certainly mess with black's queenside fianchetto.
 [ R a e8 ] , [ Q d3 ]  I didn't like that rook on the e-file so I moved my Queen to [ d3 ] to put some pressure along the d-file and also attack the Knight rather than the bishop because I know that would be the first piece my opponent would have to move first. Obviously my opponent saw that coming so he moved it out the way.
 [ f6 ] , [ N g3 ]  Essential preparation-- refering to white's move but 13...[ f6 ] is probably a mistake as it weakens the black kingside and allows white to continue with a kingside attack. He may be unduly concerned with white playing dxe5. At any rate I agree that the central test seems better suited to [ d5 ] because he has the ability to hold the square.
 [ d4 ] , [ B f2 ]  Safeway chooses to reinforce the corner-fort
 [ R f d1 ]  [ O-O ]  [ a3 ] , [ d5 ]  [ e5 ] fails for queen [ e x d5 ] gives chance of [ e x d5 ] followed by [ d4 ] with the discovered queen attack; [ e4 ] looms anyway...
 [ b3 ] , [ c5 ]  The fiancetto is a long-term threat; for now Black takes the middle.
 [ B d2 ] , [ g5 ]  Black just keeps pushing on the king side. The main problem for him is that this "push" is unsupported.
 [ e4 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ e x d5 ] , [ e x d5 ]  And black is left with this isolated d-pawn. It looks like it may be difficult to defend and I have to decide whether to try to hold on to it and for how long.
 [ N x e4 ]  [ f3 ]  [ N d6 ] , [ a4 ]  Little if anything is gained by the [ a4 ] push. White should have used this opportunity to develop the knight on [ b1 ] or perhaps push the b pawn to [ b3 ] in preparation to [ c4 ] which would allow the castle. White would then have a strong center. This move allows black to continue the attack.
 [ N h4 ]  [ Q h7 ]  [ N x f6 ]  [ Q h8 ] , [ N x g8 ]  Now White has a technically easy win.
 [ N h5 ]  [ B g3 ]  [ N x g3 ]  [ Q x g3 ] , [ O-O ]  Yeah this is what I sweared I wouldn't do in this scheme. The idea is to castle queenside hold the attack against my king and be ready for a countergame mainly on the black diagonal aiming to a2. But with this move I found no compensation with o-o-o [ Q x g2 ] K[ x K e5 ] d4[ x e5 ] and the bishop has to retire to [ c5 ] or [ b4 ] then he has one precious time to defend Rd8-[ [ g8 ] ] Qmoves [ R g6 ] Qmoves Rh8-[ [ g8 ] ] and my main attack line the black diagonal is closed.
 [ O-O ]  [ f3 ]  [ b5 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ N h5 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ N g3 ]  [ Q f2 ]  [ B h4 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ f5 ]  [ R e d1 ]  [ f4 ]  [ B f2 ]  [ Q g5 ] , [ N c7 ]  Threatening a fork on blacks rook and queen in the next move! Advantage for white!
 [ a7 ]  [ Q d3 + ]  [ K b2 ]  [ Q d4 + ]  [ K x b3 ] , [ Q x a7 ]  From this possition I stopped notating. I had only 3:12 secconds left. I am amazed if you look at the USCF rating change. It ended up a draw. I was 2 1/2 out of 5 games for the tournament. My rating went up 142 at the end of the tournament. Goodbye for now Joshua. P
 [ b x c3 ] , [ Q x c3 ]  25. [ Q x c3 ] - forced as my [ b2 ] pawn is pinned.
 [ R f6 ]  [ R x f6 ]  [ K x f6 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ K x g5 ]  ...and I can say that white wins.
 [ d4 ] , [ e5 ]  Already out of openings book but seems fine to me.
 [ B e2 ] , [ Q g5 ]  Thats 4 Q moves. Striking at the undefended g pawn.
 [ e6 ]  [ Q b6 ] , [ R b1 ]  a bit stupid: but what can u say?
 [ K h7 ]  [ R b7 ] , [ K x h8 ]  It was mate either way but thinking that I now had the opportunity that I missed earlier to get the N I take it once and for all. This would've been better much earlier. But by playing this Nathan has a mate in 2 which he will take advantage of and will even announce checkmate at the end of it. At first I didn't think that his very last move but it is since it's a mating as the K is trapped and will have no way out.
 [ N x c6 ] , [ b x c6 ]  7. ...... [ b x c6 ] - I am quite relieved therefore to see the back of one of those white steeds.
 [ N h f6 ] , [ Q f4 ]  19. [ Q f4 ] - here comes Glenda!
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ N f6 ]  Usually the response is Nc6. But swindon went for the Petroff Defense. Otherwise known as the 'Russian Game'. Black is simply trying to keep things equal and nullify the advantage of White's first move and achieve simple equality.
 [ K x d8 ]  [ Q a5 ] , [ N e7 ]  I know I know. If I had had this knight here protecting [ f5 ] earlier I would not be having these troubles. But I thought it important to be sure this was better than [ N h6 ] for covering the key square f5. I did consider [ N h6 ] at many points. Yet Obviously I've chosen [ e7 ] wrongly and now my game deteriorates.
 [ N x h2 ] , [ R x h2 ]  Exchange bolsters my material advantage.
 [ e4 ]  [ a6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ b5 ] , [ b4 ]  I never even considered what the computer post-analysis gives Best: +1.59 » 4. [ e5 ] [ b4 ] 5. [ e x f6 ] [ b x c3 ] 6. [ f x g7 ] [ B x g7 ] 7. [ b x c3 ] [ c5 ] Doesn't look that great to me esp ...c5.
 [ Q a6 + ]  [ K d7 ]  [ R d2 + ]  [ K c7 ]  [ R c2 + ]  [ K b8 ]  [ R c8 + ] , [ R x c8 ]  57. [ R x c8 ] (forced)
 [ Q e8 ] , [ Q h7 + ]  Ah how obvious. Now there are a lot of weaknesses in my position.
 [ Q x h6 ]  [ B e7 ] , [ R c1 ]  Anything could happen. Both sides have good attacking prospects though I would give Black the edge.
 [ R e c2 ]  [ b5 ] , [ g3 ]  and not 28. cxb6? [ R x c2 ] 29. [ R x c2 ] [ R b1 + ] 30. [ N e1 ]  [ g5 ]  [ K g2 ] , [ R c6 ]  I begin the slow painful process of manuevering my rooks into attacking position.
 [ B d2 ] , [ N x e4 ]  do not try this at home: best is [ B x d2 ] [ N x d2 ] 0-0...
 [ K f3 ] , [ K f6 ]  I must not let White get to my queenside becuase my knight is the only thing stopping his passed pawn.
 [ d5 ]  [ c4 ]  [ c6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ e6 ] , [ B g5 ]  And we enter the amazing world of the botvinnik. White has a very powerful pin on the [ f6 ] knight.
 [ g3 ]  [ Q x d5 ]  [ Q x d5 ] , [ B x d5 ]  18. .... [ B x d5 ] - now here we go. We are almost in an endgame. White's queenside is still undeveloped and I have the bishop pair plus a 1 pawn advantage. Now I must capitalise on this and convert this to victory. Unfortunately the path to victory is not as easy as it looks and white has no intention of waving that white flag ..... yet ....
 [ Q x d6 ] , [ Q x d6 ]  My blunder has had another negative side effect: Being down in material I wanted to steer the game into drawish channels as soon as possible. Exchanging queens seemed to fit the bill. But now I see 18. ...D[ a7 ] 19. [ Q g3 ] [ a4 ] 20. [ B c4 ] [ R x b2 ] was a better option. I was afraid of the aggressive image of white given after 21. [ e5 ] [ B e7 ] and then 22. Ne4!
 [ d x c5 + ]  [ B x c5 ] , [ R c3 ]  (?) The final mistake. Perhaps best was 29. [ B a5 + ] [ K x a5 ] 30. [ R x c5 + ] and 31. [ R c2 ] when it's not easy for Black to make progress.
 [ R f6 ] , [ R h1 ]  !
 [ N x c5 ] , [ B a3 ]  ...leaves me a Pawn behind but has opened up the board for me to attack.
 [ e x d6 ] , [ N x e3 ]  BTW I anticipated this move. So it was conditional and with that being said I would've responded with 12...[ Q x d6 ] first followed by this move to prevent what I'm about to do.
 [ N c3 ] , [ g6 ]  4. ....... [ g6 ] - Ion is preparing to fianchetto his king bishop to [ g7 ] which will facilitate castling and strike at the squares on the [ a1 ] to [ h8 ] diagonal.
 [ N c3 ] , [ R x a7 ]  Or 30. [ R x e5 ] Qxe5; when probably 31. [ Q f4 ] is best allowing Black to exchange Queens into an easily won ending. Any attempt to keep Queens on seems to allow a mating attack beginning with 32. ... [ Q e1 ] and 33. ... [ R f2 ] etc. White resigned leaving me to wonder if he'd noticed that 30. ... [ R x e1 ] was Check.
 [ K d7 ]  [ N e5 + ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ d x e5 ] , [ N e4 ]  As this knight protects [ d5 ] black is encouraged it take it so he can play Qd6.
 [ B x h6 ] , [ R f e8 ]  First I have to dodge White's B.
 [ Q e7 ] , [ Q g4 ]  Maybe he should play [ Q b3 ] here and defend the pawn advance but I think if he does that he's doomed eventually as the pawns can move forward without worrying about any counterplay from white
 [ B g6 ] , [ Q h6 ]  Qh6!! Final Nail to the coffin for black!! Mate cannot be stopped... ;) Hope you enjoyed the game! Cheers!! :D
 [ f x g6 ]  [ Q x g6 + ]  [ K h8 ] , [ Q h6 + ]  And he resigns. The game is over after 27 ... [ K g8 ] 28. [ R g1 ] [ B g2 ] 29. [ R x g2 ] [ Q g3 ] 30. [ R x g3 ] [ K f7 ] and 31. [ Q g6 ] . In this game I have been able to take advantage of the space my opponent gave me to launch a powerful attack on his king. The key to this attack was my powerful knight in [ d6 ] which ultimately led to his demise. So hope you liked it. Feedback would be appreciated!
 [ Q c8 ] , [ Q x d5 ]  The d-Pawn suffers for this!
 [ B g4 ] , [ K e2 ]  A final blunder. Even if white plays optimally instead of this blunder heavy loses are unavoidable.
 [ O-O ]  [ a3 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ Q d3 ] , [ N e4 ]  Might as well take advantage of e5.
 [ R b1 ]  [ Q c7 ] , [ N g e2 ]  The plan was to exchange of the [ c5 ] Knight by playing [ N c1 ] Nb3. Now I realised that black can play [ b5 ] and I can lose my bishop pair
 [ Q x g5 ] , [ Q x g5 ]  White captures my bishop and I recapture with my queen.
 [ B b7 ] , [ N b d2 ]  Just in case BxN.
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ B b4 ]  Colle opposes Menchik's QP opening with a Nimzo-Indian Defense.
 [ O-O ] , [ e5 ]  Oho white prefers to lose the exchange rather than lose a pawn. But first a zwischenzug gaining a stronger presence in the center with a tempo by discovering an attack against white's queen.
 [ e4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e5 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ Q b6 ]  [ B x c6 + ]  [ b x c6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N e7 ]  [ b3 ]  [ N g6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ N a4 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B b2 ]  [ B a6 ]  [ Q c1 ]  [ R a b8 ]  [ N d2 ] , [ R b4 ]  I thought he moved that Rook down so he could run it over to the other side for an attack.
 [ Q d3 ]  [ N b7 ]  [ b4 ] , [ R c4 ]  a powerful positional move which slaps a bind on white
 [ f x e5 ]  [ B c6 ] , [ R g3 + ]  SInce I have a material advantage now I only need to worry about some clever attack by his Rooks and Bishop. I can force trades to eliminate his offensive capabilities which will leave me to methodically drive forward to a win.
 [ N x e2 ]  [ B x e2 ]  [ a x b4 ]  [ K e7 ]  [ K f2 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ g4 ] , [ B b5 ]  With a pawn disadvantage on the Queen-side Black must maintain equality on the other side: 43. [ f x g4 ] was necessary.
 [ N a3 ]  [ N h6 ]  [ N h3 ]  [ N a6 ]  [ c3 ]  [ c6 ]  [ d3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ e3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ f3 ]  [ f6 ]  [ B d2 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ K e2 ]  [ K e7 ]  [ B e1 ]  [ B e8 ]  [ B f2 ]  [ B f7 ]  [ K e1 ]  [ K e8 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ Q d7 ]  [ B d1 ]  [ B d8 ]  [ B c2 ]  [ B c7 ]  [ K e2 ]  [ K e7 ]  [ N c4 ]  [ N c5 ]  [ N a5 ]  [ N a4 ]  [ N x b7 ]  [ N x b2 ]  [ N a5 ]  [ N a4 ]  [ R a d1 ]  [ R a d8 ]  [ R h e1 ]  [ R h e8 ]  [ N c4 ]  [ N c5 ]  [ N b6 ]  [ N b3 ]  [ N c8 + ]  [ K f8 ]  [ N x a7 ]  [ K e7 ]  [ N b5 ]  [ N c1 + ]  [ K f1 ]  [ N x a2 ]  [ K e2 ]  [ N b4 ]  [ N g5 ]  [ N g4 ]  [ N x h7 ]  [ N x h2 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ N b3 ]  [ N b6 ]  [ N c1 ]  [ N c8 ]  [ N g5 ]  [ N g4 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ N g3 ]  [ N g6 ]  [ N h5 ]  [ N h4 ]  [ N x g7 ]  [ N x g2 ]  [ N h5 ]  [ N h4 ]  [ N g3 ]  [ N g6 ]  [ N f1 ] , [ N f8 ]  Just in case there is any uncertainty with regards to the rules of this popular game here is a summarised version of the 'Blide Verpoinian Chess rules' ___ 1.1 Nature and Objectives: All pieces behave in the same way as they do in conventional chess moves alternate as usual. The objective of the game is to capture the opponent's 2 rooks (not including promoted pawns) whilst avoiding checking the opponent's king. As soon as the opponent's king is checked the opponent wins the game. If no move can be played without checking the opponent's king the game is a draw. ___ 6.1 Special Rules: If either player hesitates just as they are about to make a move the opponent is allowed to cry out 'Maggot-Moose' and they will be rewarded with a free legal move of their opponents pieces. The words 'Maggot-Moose' must be said articulately; 'Magga-Moose' 'Maggom-Toos' or 'Mag-Moose' are not acceptable. If a player temporarily leaves the game for any reason during play it is acceptable for the opponent to slyly move pieces around at their discretion. If for any reason either player leaves the game before it has finished and doesn't return within exactly 5 minutes both players must be roasted and fed to the spectators.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ Q h5 ]  [ N d6 ]  [ B b3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N b5 ]  [ g6 ]  [ Q f3 ]  [ f5 ]  [ Q d5 ] , [ Q e7 ]  All the tourrnament games begin here. Black will lose the Exchange after the recommended line 9 NxP ch K-[ Q1 ] 10 NxR P-[ N3 ] 11 P-[ Q3 ] B-[ Q N2 ] 12 P-[ K R4 ] P-[ B5 ] 13 Q-[ K B3 ] N-[ Q5 ] 14 Q-[ N4 ] BxN but gets a potent attack in compensation.
 [ R x f3 ] , [ Q x f3 ]  Black sacrifices a rook for a knight but has a way to equalise.
 [ c3 ]  [ B a5 ] , [ O-O ]  Now my bishop looks silly with nothing to do.
 [ f x e5 ]  [ B x g4 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ d x e5 ] , [ N d e2 ]  the knight has no other good square to go to [ f5 ] is a possibility but this allows the 0-0-0
 [ N x e5 ] , [ Q e7 ]  This line of petroff is not familliar but I have seen it before. Usually continues 3.[ d6 ] [ N f3 ] 4.[ N x e4 ] and my favourite was the open game that follows with ...[ N c3 ] 5.[ N x c3 ] etc
 [ e x d5 ] , [ B x d5 ]  I'll take it! Development may have been better since everything was covered for him. Let the exchanges begin!
 [ R g3 + ] , [ K f1 ]  His fate is pretty much sealed now.
 [ B b4 + ] , [ K f1 ]  I was surprised to see this move however. As my anticipation was 10.[ N d2 ] as then I'd probably exchange due to being ahead. The question is how much liquidation would work here and I think it would. That's why Nathan doesn't allow it here. And naturally I'm now ready to pull my Q back.
 [ K e8 ]  [ R a8 + ]  [ K d7 ]  [ R a7 + ]  [ K c8 ]  [ R h7 ]  [ R f4 ]  [ K d5 ]  [ R f3 ]  [ R f7 ]  [ h3 ]  [ R a7 ]  [ h2 ] , [ R a1 ]  promotion stop try.
 [ B e7 ]  [ R f d1 ] , [ a6 ]  I'm not sure of the value of this move.
 [ h x g6 ] , [ R x b8 ]  I think he should have taken the rook.
 [ N d4 ]  [ Q g3 ]  [ N x f3 + ] , [ N x f3 ]  forced unless i want to give up my bishop for free.
 [ Q b6 ] , [ Q x b6 ]  White takes the opportunity to exchange the queens and push to move to an end game where Blacks a pawn (soon to be b pawn) and center pawns are not as strong as White's structure.
 [ N f1 ] , [ R d8 ]  22. ..... [ R d8 ] - Glenda at least relieves the [ b8 ] rook of defensive duty of [ b7 ] and so the rook wisely lines up behind the passed pawn. The nearer that passer gets to Glendadom the more passive that white rook is gonna be that thought does cheer me up a bit!
 [ R f8 ] , [ Q d4 ]  I started to feel a bit more comfortable now.
 [ R f1 ] , [ K e5 ]  42.[ R x c5 ] [ R b1 ] 43. [ R a5 ] [ R x f1 ] 44. [ R x a2 ] R[ f x f2 ] check and white loses another rook.
 [ K x f1 ]  [ h x g5 ] , [ Q h5 ]  Now the mate is unavoidable.
 [ N c6 ]  [ a3 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ b4 ]  [ a6 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ f5 ] , [ O-O ]  Panic struck in here. Whats whites plan? [ [ f5 ] ] was instinctive to stop [ [ f5 ] ] by white whites pieces are aiming at the kingside so I made another bad move to try and stop any attack.
 [ B b3 ] , [ B b7 ]  Interesting choice here developing the bishop on the a8-[ h1 ] diagonale to put pressure on white's center. While this move is seen in many variations of the spanish opening at some point the early [ b5 ] followed by [ B b7 ] defines the Archangel (aka. counterthrust) variation. This idea was developed in the early sixties. Critics of this variation say that the early [ B b7 ] gives away Blacks plans too early. White doesn't have to push c3-[ d4 ] here but can also play the very solid 7.d3! reinforcing e4. This is the main reason why this is very rarely played on top level. A more popular variant is to play 6...[ B c5 ] instead (Neo-Archangelsk) deferring the development of the c8-bishop to when black knows what white is up to.
 [ g5 ] , [ K c5 ]  personally I don't see white doesn't take the quicker route of [ e5 ] [ f6 ] e7.
 [ Q h3 ] , [ Q b4 + ]  first attack i have to go on
 [ f x e5 ]  [ f x e5 ] , [ Q f2 ]  dark black bishop is free at the cost of light black bishop mobility... And my queen is now pointing on another target.
 [ K b6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ B f8 ] , [ B x f7 ]  Winning the [ f7 ] pawn.
 [ B x f4 ]  [ N x f3 + ]  [ Q x f3 ]  [ g x f4 ] , [ R d7 ]  activating the rook and freeing the Q from defending it. White could have resigned at this point ... but hope springs eternal :-)
 [ B e4 ]  [ N c4 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ d x c5 ]  [ B x c5 ] , [ B d3 ]  Alternative variation: 15. [ B d2 ] O-O $11
 [ B g2 ]  [ Q b6 ] , [ b4 ]  The rook is glued and fully supported on a5.I also saw the shifting of the rook to [ h4 ] after [ B x h6 ]  [ R b d8 ] , [ B x h6 ]  Here it comes i could not wait Bxh6!!.In my plans i expected [ f x h6 ] and [ Q x h6 ] followed by [ B e5 ] followed by [ N f4 ] to exchange it for a mate on h2.In chess you must wait a lot.Chess teaches us to be patient
 [ h x g3 ]  [ Q x g3 + ]  [ K f1 ]  [ R f8 ]  [ R g1 ] , [ Q f4 + ]  Yeah this is nice!
 [ B x c4 ]  [ d x c4 ] , [ R a2 ]  I knew that was coming I just expected to see it earlier.
 [ Q d2 ]  [ R a d8 ]  [ R a d1 ] , [ B e7 ]  Black tries to prepare a little combination based on the fact that the backward pawn on [ d4 ] is pinned.

 [ K a3 ]  [ b5 ]  [ K b2 ] , [ K b4 ]  Black has opposition.
 [ Q x g4 ]  [ Q e1 ]  [ B g2 ]  [ R g1 ]  [ Q x e4 ]  [ N e3 ] , [ B f3 ]  So now two pawns up and feeling really good.
 [ a4 ] , [ N x d6 ]  ?? Oh my god what was I thinking. In truth I was getting ahead of myself. I was suppose to play [ B c2 ] and black goes down two pawns.
 [ K a4 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N x c6 ] , [ K x c6 ]  The difference here being significantly that White's King is a step closer now.
 [ N x e2 ]  [ e x f6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ R e8 ]  It is said that [ d5 ] was the correct move. Who knows.
 [ h3 ]  [ e x d4 ] , [ e x d4 ]  6. [ e x d4 ] - pawn trade.
 [ B x b2 ]  [ N c5 ] , [ N c3 ]  Completing my development of my minor pieces.
 [ f4 ] , [ N a7 ]  Now black will take the pawn but I hoped that in a cramped position.
 [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ] , [ B x f7 + ]  Maybe the most popular sacrifice in the openings
 [ g x h6 ] , [ B x d5 ]  ? Objectively a mistake but this was obviously the point of the sacrifice: the bishop on [ f6 ] is without defenders.
 [ c4 ] , [ d6 ]  The early [ d6 ] makes this the Old Indian defense but it all goes to the same place.
 [ R x h3 ] , [ N e5 ]  just in time to prevent Rf3+...
 [ b6 ]  [ N f2 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ f4 ]  [ N b4 ]  [ N c2 ] , [ a5 ]  Black pieces seem to be better placed than white's
 [ B c5 ] , [ B g2 ]  I was right.
 [ g6 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ B h6 ]  White may have assumed I was going to fianchetto my bishop on [ g7 ] because that's usually what lower-rated players have seen. However look at every possible place the bishop could go and you will be able to avoid these types of mistakes.
 [ e x d5 ]  [ R x d5 ]  [ N x d4 ] , [ B c5 ]  Black's pieces are very active while white's are a bit worse. Black should be better but white's next sequence made me do strange moves that lost the advantage.
 [ Q e2 ] , [ b5 ]  Black plans to win the [ d5 ] pawn and does so with precise calculations.
 [ B x f5 ]  [ Q x f5 + ]  [ Q g5 ] , [ Q x g5 # ]  Congratulations are due to Black for a very excellent game. White had one brief chance to equalize thanks to his massive pawn front and active play but demonstrated quite clearly the dangers of pushing too hard for a win in a losing situation whereas Black defended carefully and patiently and it paid off in spades. Many thanks to white_noise for a great game! Comments and ratings on the annotation are appreciated and thank you all for reading!
 [ R f1 ] , [ R d3 ]  preventing [ R d1 ] and prepares [ c3 ]  [ K g5 ] , [ K e6 ]  I disliked having white play [ K x f5 ] but then it might have been better to just push the c pawn and forget about my week f pawn anyway
 [ B d3 ]  [ K d7 ]  [ B f4 ] , [ B g5 ]  To save the knight but I wanted this exchange anyway. Now I have to make my knight superior to the bishop. Must battle the imbalances we have.
 [ N g4 ]  [ B d5 + ]  [ K g7 ]  [ h3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ R f e1 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ R x e8 ] , [ N x e8 ]  ...and a rook apiece.
 [ B e7 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ N b d7 ] , [ e5 ]  Further simplifying the position.
 [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ] , [ B d7 ]  Passive move after which the advantage is clearly mine. Here I definitely should have played [ B e3 ] with maybe [ B f2 ] later [ Q d2 ] and queenside castling. But I decided to continue the policy of limiting black's options. I was concerned that [ B e3 ] would be met by [ N c4 ] which is why I played the next move.
 [ K b5 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ B e1 ] , [ K e6 ]  The light square highway. I had pictured my King on this square since move 29.
 [ c5 ] , [ O-O-O ]  !? allowing black to get away with ...[ c5 ] is just asking for trouble. 17. Nx[ c5 ] was necessary
 [ N c6 ] , [ B e3 ]  For the next six moves Stockfish thinks that Black's best option is to castle.
 [ B x f3 ]  [ g x f3 ] , [ R f d8 ]  Botvinnik: 13...P-[ [ K3 ] ] gives Black an equal game. Fischer: 13...P-[ [ K3 ] ] is not in the Hypermodern spirit which is to tempt White into advancing his center Pawns in the hope they become overextended.
 [ B c2 ]  [ g6 ]  [ d4 ] , [ c4 ]  8. ........ c4?? - I think this is the move that causes black to lose at least a piece.
 [ d5 ] , [ e x d5 ]  black lost a pawn but it prevented white from doing n[ x7 ] forking [ d8 ] and [ h8 ]  [ N g e4 ]  [ N x f2 ]  [ N x f2 ]  [ B x f2 + ]  [ K x f2 ] , [ Q h4 + ]  Black can now gain the bishop on [ c4 ]  [ g3 ]  [ Q x c4 ]  [ d x c6 ]  [ Q x c6 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ Q f6 + ]  [ K g2 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ Q e2 ]  [ O-O-O ]  [ Q x e5 ]  [ Q x e5 ] , [ R x e5 ]  White gained a pawn
 [ K x f2 ]  [ R x d4 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ R d2 + ]  [ R e2 ] , [ R x e2 + ]  Another trade makes things easy.
 [ N h6 ] , [ h3 ]  6.[ [ h4 ] ] calls to me: 6.[ [ h4 ] ] [a]6...[ B d7 ] seems passive but the aggressive line b only seems to lose time having to retreat the bishop [b]6...[ B g4 ] 7.[ f3 ] [ B d7 ] [c]6...0-0 7.h5! [d]6...[ f6 ] 7.Ne6!
 [ Q d7 ] , [ N x e7 ]  10. ... Qd7? is a blunder that loses a piece. The right move was 10. ... [ B x c6 ] to only lose the pawn.
 [ K f3 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ K e4 ] , [ K e6 ]  38. ..... [ K e6 ] - but it is gonna be a while before I can round it up.
 [ d4 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ d5 ]  here i prefer pushing pawns then exchanging and was hoping the knight would kick down to [ d4 ] to exchange knights bring either queen up or castle first and accepting a pawn down wasnt sure id have to wait and see what he did
 [ a3 ] , [ a5 ]  Given the position to close it is ok for me. I'd take advantage of the b column but I am not well prepared for it yet.
 [ N x e4 ]  [ b6 ] , [ O-O ]  As White has a Bishop for a pawn and Black is very passive he can castle without worry--the endgame should be a win so he can simply consolidate removing his King from possible checking tactics and make ready to compound his advantages.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ d6 ]  started as philidor
 [ N f6 ]  [ d3 ]  [ h6 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ b6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B b4 ]  [ B x c6 ] , [ d x c6 ]  White has spotted the lack of protection on the King's pawn but Black is compensated by having Queen and Bishop free.
 [ R f2 + ] , [ K g3 ]  I figured however that I'd gotten out of trouble here because it appeared that 20...[ R f2 + ] was a nuicanse. This is where I learned that it's serious and leads to mate.
 [ K e1 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ Q x e4 ]  [ N g3 ]  [ N x g3 ]  [ Q x g3 + ]  [ K d2 ]  [ Q f2 + ]  [ Q e2 ]  [ Q x e2 + ] , [ K x e2 ]  Exchanges exchanges exchanges...what does my opponent get out of them? Less than nothing.
 [ N x c6 ] , [ N x c6 ]  White has now to anticipate the threat ...[ d4 ]  [ a5 ] , [ B d2 ]  This might look like a mistake from white but this will turn into a tricky position soon.
 [ R x e8 ] , [ R x e8 + ]  Black's fate is sealed.
 [ e x d5 ] , [ Q x d5 ]  ...and trade pawns.
 [ R x e1 + ] , [ Q x e1 ]  [ Q x d5 ] according to plan.
 [ B d7 ]  [ N e5 ] , [ B e8 ]  I need that bishop to protect some spots around my king keep his queen away. I'm also wondering if [ B h5 ] might help me.
 [ R b1 ]  [ R a d8 ]  [ a4 ]  [ B a6 ] , [ R d1 ]  (GT) White has clearly lost time with his Rook's moves.
 [ R e7 + ] , [ B e3 ]  I decide to block the check this time as I have no intention of being chased around the board.
 [ R x c7 ]  [ R x c7 ]  [ R x d4 ]  [ K e3 ]  [ R a4 ]  [ R x a7 ] , [ K g6 ]  White should keep his rook on the a file and try to advance that pawn to queen. It's difficult to move the rook out of the way but with black's king on the 2nd rank it's possible. Something like: 34. [ R a8 ] [ f6 ] 35. [ a6 ] [ e5 ] 36. [ a7 ] [ R a3 ] 37. [ K f2 ] [ R a4 ] 38. [ R g8 ] [ K h6 ] 39. [ a8 = Q ] [ R x a8 ] 40. [ R x a8 ]  [ R e7 ]  [ e5 + ]  [ K f3 ] , [ R x a5 ]  Positions are almost equal again though white's single e pawn leaves him slightly weaker. This game should draw barring any blunders.
 [ c3 ]  [ N d5 ] , [ B x d5 ]  When i'm ahead early on(especially 9 points ahead) I like to make even trades for kinghts I always feel uncomfortable around knights because of the threat of forking(even though many people say bishops are better). It's just something I felt couldn'ty hurt me right now.
 [ e6 ]  [ e4 ] , [ B b4 ]  OK no more cheap discovered attack threats.
 [ B x f6 ]  [ g x f6 ]  [ N x c6 ]  [ b x c6 ] , [ Q d2 ]  Completing his development and getting the Q mobile.
 [ Q f3 ]  [ B x e1 ]  [ R x e1 ]  [ Q c5 ]  [ N f5 ]  [ Q a5 ]  [ c3 ]  [ e4 ]  [ N x h6 + ] , [ K h7 ]  Black has a decisive advantage after whites Queen moves white looses the knight at [ h7 ]  [ Q e3 ]  [ K x h6 ]  [ h4 ]  [ d4 ]  [ h x g5 + ]  [ Q x g5 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N g4 ]  [ Q h3 + ]  [ K g7 ]  [ Q c3 ]  [ e3 ]  [ f x e3 ]  [ Q h4 ]  [ B e5 + ]  [ R x e5 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ Q f2 + ]  [ K h1 ] , [ B e4 ]  Mate in one
 [ N x c3 ]  [ R x c3 ] , [ Q a5 ]  18. ........ [ Q a5 ] (nasty nasty - doubly attacks rook and a pawn so I back my rook off to [ c2 ] and black exchanges his [ g7 ] bishop for my [ d4 ] knight. Joanne
 [ d5 ] , [ c4 ]  2. c4!? - interesting move - Freddy just lurves gambits! The purpose of this move is to divert the [ d5 ] pawn on to [ c4 ] where it can be recaptured after playing 1. e4. Master Bastalex however declines the gambit and responds with [ c6 ] which has shades of the Slav Defense in the Queen's Gambit Declined.
 [ R e7 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ R d7 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ K e7 ]  [ N d5 + ]  [ K f8 ]  [ N x b6 ]  [ R c7 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ R d7 ]  [ b6 ]  [ K e8 ]  [ a7 ]  [ R d8 ] , [ b7 ]  
 [ d3 ] , [ d5 ]  ...and attack his first pawn...
 [ O-O-O ] , [ g x f5 ]  After all of those fireworks material is even.
 [ O-O ]  [ N g4 ] , [ B d4 ]  I would rather trade off bishops and place my knight on a strong square.
 [ R e5 e7 ]  [ g x f6 ]  [ N x f6 ] , [ N f5 ]  28. [ N f5 ] - what's this? A knight sac? If black accepts then he must be prepared for a nasty check on g1.
 [ e4 ] , [ c6 ]  Let's see if he lets me play my Caro-Kann.
 [ N x h5 ]  [ K g6 ]  [ Q x g7 + ]  [ K x h5 ] , [ Q g2 ]  and.... curtain... what a fight!
 [ O-O ]  [ N d7 ]  [ R e1 ] , [ c5 ]  Time to take on white's center.
 [ d4 ]  [ d6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ N g f6 ]  [ h3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N b d2 ]  [ B e7 ] , [ e4 ]  This is contrary to my typical dev plan but black is playing so passively...
 [ B h4 ]  [ c x d4 ] , [ N x d4 ]  Could I mate in under 21 moves? I asked myself:
 [ h6 ]  [ N h3 ]  [ N b5 ]  [ B b2 ] , [ f5 ]  At this point I am eyeing [ f4 ] as a great spot for my knight if I can support with the g and h pawns
 [ Q x h5 ] , [ R g1 ]  I do not know why white played this.
 [ e4 ]  [ b6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ e6 ] , [ N g e2 ]  I wanted to avoid too much symmetry so I eschewed 5. Nf3.
 [ g x f3 + ] , [ K g3 ]  Now I get at least ONE move avoiding a check but at the cost of losing another pawn.
 [ N f3 ] , [ K g8 ]  further protection of my king now with [ h7 ] to hide from white's queen and any perpetual threats
 [ B c8 ]  [ R a7 ] , [ B x e6 ]  ?? One blunder too many. I was covering [ b7 ] from [ g2 ] but not c7.
 [ Q f6 ]  [ Q b8 + ]  [ Q f8 ] , [ R d8 ]  The death blow. There is nothing Black can do now so I resigned. I thought this was a fun game started by my opponents daring Cochrane style attack. While I had my chances my opponent kept up the pressure and took advantage of my mistakes to slowly improve his position and eventually gained a winning attack.
 [ N d3 + ]  [ K d2 ]  [ N x e1 ] , [ K x e1 ]  Again here I offered a draw which he declined.
 [ Q e7 ] , [ R x c4 ]  Instead white defends his pawn on b4. That's OK white wasn't going to capture that one first anyway. Since the pawn on [ d3 ] is pinned to the king the black rook can safely capture on [ c4 ] putting a double threat on b4.
 [ c6 ]  [ B e2 ] , [ O-O-O ]  Finally black castles. Ok. but...
 [ g3 ]  [ Q f6 + ] , [ K g2 ]  8. [ K g2 ] - Henry moves off the f file and I am one step away from castling by hand if I move my rook to [ f1 ] or e1.
 [ K e2 ]  [ N x a1 ] , [ B e6 + ]  Maybe [ B d3 ] was better allowing me to free the [ c1 ] bishop and capture the knight. I saw some nasty traps on the king with the open b file and thought I would try to force something more profitable.
 [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ B x a3 ] , [ b x a3 ]  White come out of the exchange ahead
 [ Q g6 ]  [ g3 ]  [ Q e4 ]  [ R g1 ]  [ B f5 ] , [ Q c1 ]  26. [ Q c1 ] - oh dear that move was to prevent [ Q c2 + ] but gameknot calls it a Blunder: -7.03 » 26. [ Q c1 ] [ R d8 + ] 27. [ B d4 ] [ R x d4 + ] 28. [ e x d4 ] [ Q x d4 + ] 29. [ K e2 ] [ B [ g4 ] + ] 30. [ K e1 ] [ Q x g1 + ] 31. [ K d2 ] [ Q x h2 + ] 32. [ K d3 ] [ Q x g3 + ] 33. [ Q e3 ] [ B f5 + ] 34. [ K d2 ] [ Q g2 + ] 35. [ Q e2 ] [ Q d5 + ] 36. [ K e1 ] Best: -0.94 » 26. [ B d4 ] [ Q c2 + ] 27. [ K e1 ] [ c5 ] 28. [ B c3 ] [ B [ g4 ] ] 29. [ R g2 ] [ Q d1 + ] 30. [ K f2 ] [ Q x f1 + ] 31. [ K x f1 ] [ B h3 ] 32. [ b3 ] [ R d8 ] 33. [ g4 ] [ B x g2 + ] 34. [ K x g2 ] [ K c7 ] At the end of the "best" analysis however I will still be the exchange down.
 [ B d3 ] , [ B x b3 ]  obvious with less pieces i have advantage for the power of my rook (as I said)
 [ B x e6 ]  [ d x e6 ] , [ Q e2 ]  Freddy does not want a queen exchange and now Black has to be careful.
 [ d6 ] , [ B b5 + ]  I thought this was a waste of time.
 [ N f x e4 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ N x e4 ] , [ Q h5 ]  Threatening mate on f7.
 [ h5 ]  [ K h7 ]  [ K f6 ] , [ K h6 ]  I need to wait again and drive his King to [ K R2 ] buying time to move my own King and KBP in position to Queen.
 [ K f6 ]  [ N e4 + ]  [ K e7 ] , [ B g5 + ]  winning the queen. nothing to see from here on...
 [ R a1 ] , [ N c2 ]  Alternative variation: 40. [ N e f3 ] [ no sirve de mucho] [ e x f3 ] 41. [ N x f3 ] [ R a3 + ] 42. [ K f2 ] [ R a2 + ] 43. [ K e3 ] [ R g2 ] $19
 [ Q d4 ] , [ R e d1 ]  Now his knight is mine.
 [ h5 ] , [ e5 ]  If 19...[ h x g4 ] my King will be in great danger. I can think of no particular defense against this however so I proceed with the idea of taking e5. This also finally opens up the a8-[ h1 ] diagonal so that my Queen can live up to her potential.
 [ N e8 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ Q c7 ] , [ h5 ]  Blasting the h-file open should lead to a rapid mate for White.
 [ B x f6 ]  [ B x f6 ] , [ N c3 ]  At this point I'm only interested in completing my development since a main goal in chess is to "develop develop develop" as schakertjie would say. In addition this is excellent timing because it does not give away material. It's just that I did a little differently then should have due to the sudden changes as noted earlier. But at least for now my head is back in the game and I'm back to my normal self. Let's see how long this lasts.
 [ c4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ b6 ]  [ e4 ]  [ d6 ]  [ g3 ]  [ N b d7 ]  [ B g2 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ N g e2 ]  [ c5 ]  [ d3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B e7 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ N g4 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ N x e3 ]  [ Q x e3 ]  [ a6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ b3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ R a d1 ]  [ R f e8 ] , [ f4 ]  white's best move limiting my ability to make the break [ d5 ] and threatening to push f5.
 [ c5 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N a6 ]  [ a3 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ N c7 ]  [ a4 ]  [ a6 ]  [ b3 ] , [ N f e8 ]  Playing for [ f5 ] here - pushing the f pawn feels like winning!
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ c4 ]  
 [ e5 ]  [ c5 ]  [ B h6 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ] , [ B x e5 ]  Black sacs the exchange.
 [ Q g3 ] , [ B f8 ]  Black is looking good if a bit passive. White has a slight advantage due to his space advantage and his attacking chances.
 [ B f4 ]  [ Q c8 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N a5 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ d6 ]  [ B d8 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B c4 ] , [ h6 ]  Here black felt comfortable about his position because his pieces are working together and are all well defended. But he still needs to bring his h8-rook into the game.
 [ Q e2 ]  [ R d4 ]  [ d3 ]  [ R e8 ] , [ B d2 ]  23 [ Q x B2 ] withdraws support from Ne5. White is ill advised to propose even material exchanges.
 [ R x h7 ]  [ a3 ]  [ R a7 ] , [ a2 ]  getting a bit difficult to do anything.
 [ N f1 ]  [ N g4 ]  [ Q e2 ]  [ N x e3 ]  [ K d2 ]  [ N x f1 + ]  [ R x f1 ] , [ R h2 ]  black resigns. It was just a matter of finishing the game at this point. I felt good with this game. My first tourney in the advanced section. I will not win it but can sure throw the bracket off. He was the top rated player in the bracket. I know he just under estimated me and will probably kill me in our next game. Thanks for following along.
 [ O-O ] , [ N x c3 ]  So I'm down a pawn entering the middle game - the middle is torn asunder and he has slightly more of a command of it with his knights. General plan of attack is I need his pawn on [ c6 ] to stay competitive. Similarly I think his best plan is to target [ c7 ] via moves like [ B f4 ] [ N e4 ] and Rc1. Ultimately I like my bishop pair with the open board but it'll be hard to limit his knights. [ Q e8 ] seems challenges the pawn but [ N d4 ] defends and challenges my bishop straight away. Projected line of 14. ... [ Q e8 ] 15. [ N d4 ] [ N d5 ] 16. [ R e1 ] [ N x c3 ] 17. [ b x c3 ] seems okay but doesn't terribly get me closer to my objectives. [ Q b1 ] seizes an open column and lets tickle a potential target on b2.

 [ b x a7 + ] , [ K a8 ]  And now to enact the solution...
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ N f3 ]  This move stops the e5's Budapest. Does it?
 [ h5 ]  [ e5 ] , [ N e4 ]  19. .... [ N e4 ] - Gerhard's knight has been driven to a better square. This move puts a little pressure on the isolani on c3.
 [ N d5 ]  [ R a7 ]  [ B a5 ]  [ R b8 ]  [ b3 ]  [ R b5 ]  [ N b4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ c4 ]  [ R x b4 ]  [ B x b4 ]  [ c x b4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ d6 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ R d1 ]  [ R d7 ]  [ R d5 ]  [ g6 ]  [ c5 ]  [ K f7 ] , [ c6 ]  perhaps the turning point of the game?
 [ f5 ] , [ e x f5 ]  23. f5? seems to have been ill-prepared. It had the potential to wreck black's castle if black replied 23. ... gxf5? but 23. ... [ e x f5 ] simply refutes the move entirely costing white a pawn.
 [ N f6 ] , [ d3 ]  6. [ [ d3 ] ] - but it is [ [ d3 ] ] first.
 [ B x c6 ]  [ b x c6 ] , [ Q e2 ]  ({15:-3.55} 9. [ Q e2 ] [ Q x d4 ] 10. [ B e3 ] [ Q [ [ e5 ] ] ] 11. [ f3 ] [ Q a5 ] 12. [ a3 ] [ R b8 ] 13. [ b4 ] [ Q c7 ] 14. [ R f d1 ] [ [ e5 ] ] 15. [ Q a6 ] [ R b7 ] 16. [ Q c4 ] -+) ({15:+0.39} 9. [ R b1 ] [ [ e5 ] ] 10. [ N f5 ] [ B x f5 ] 11. [ e x f5 ] [ B e7 ] 12. [ B g5 ] [ R d8 ] 13. [ Q e2 ] [ Q c7 ] 14. [ B x f6 ] [ B x f6 ] 15. [ N e4 ] [ B h4 ] 16. [ R f d1 ] +=)
 [ e x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ d6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ a6 ]  This is to keep his knight off of b5.
 [ a x b5 ] , [ a x b5 ]  So Carlsen decided to trade his a for b pawn. Black has a weak [ c6 ] pawn while white has a [ b4 ] target with his own pawn.
 [ Q d7 ]  [ d4 ]  [ Q x b7 ]  [ Q c4 ] , [ R f d1 ]  Here is where the game gets interesting. with so much tension in the centre pawns and both kings in vulnerable positions a swift attack could break out at any minute.
 [ Q h5 + ]  [ K g8 ] , [ B h6 ]  and there falls the rook
 [ R e8 + ]  [ B e3 ] , [ N b d7 ]  I'm not criticizing his move but doesn't this block in his bishop?
 [ Q g6 + ] , [ K e7 ]  The alternative (22...[ K g8 ] 23.[ B e6 + ] [ K h8 ] 24.Qh5#) is obviously bad or (22...[ K g8 ] 23.[ B e6 + ] [ R f7 ] 24.[ B x f7 + ] [ K h8 ] 25.Qh5#) is no better so the king is left with one choice at e7.
 [ c x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ d4 ] , [ c x d4 ]  I develop the knight with tempo.
 [ O-O ] , [ B b4 ]  The idea was to gain both the knight and b pawn while developping.
 [ Q h5 + ]  [ g6 ] , [ Q x h7 ]  I thought that if he took my rook I could checkmate him. I guess I didn't notice it would put me in check
 [ B x f5 ]  [ O-O ] , [ O-O-O ]  0-0-0 always leads to an attacking game with both forces aiming to sack the king's position.
 [ Q x a1 ]  [ R x a1 ] , [ B b1 ]  from here on out the war on the queen side was won and i had an extra rook to help the king side Pawn assault was a slow walk up to a checkmate my oponent stay the whole way i like those games hehe
 [ e3 ] , [ h3 ]  He didn't address the [ [ g2 ] ] attack. But what else is there as his queen and two bishops are busy elsewhere. [ R g1 ] still gets the [ [ g2 ] ] pawn and an open king.
 [ R x c5 ]  [ b x c5 ] , [ R h7 ]  ! Yes this is exactly what I would've played to pinning that N directly. Note: I did this in quite a few games including my game against Jack a couple of weeks ago. No absolutely guarantees but more often not I've won several games by directly pinning the N like this.
 [ Q e3 + ]  [ K f1 ]  [ B e2 + ]  [ K e1 ]  [ B f3 + ]  [ K f1 ]  [ Q e2 + ]  [ K g1 ]  [ R x g2 + ]  [ Q x g2 ] , [ Q x g2 # ]  Although different the Damiano Defense (which I mentioned a little to a student) although it directly applies here. When a stronger player gives things away it could be a blunder but more often then not there is a good reason. By taking you are potentially setting yourself up for disaster. This happened in one game where I would've faced ruinous loss of material but got greedy and attempted to take. I figured that I won something back but in doing so my opponent was able to deliver mate. Something similar happened against both dynamic_dv and Jack Stockel. In both cases I got greedy took a pawn and in doing so they were able to win the Queen for free. That forced me into resignation shortly after. The same thing is true here where white took and got mated.
 [ d x e5 ] , [ B x e5 ]  First pawn gone but for a N
 [ B x a5 ]  [ Q x d3 ] , [ B c2 ]  31. [ B c2 ] - the Wicked Witch of the West must retreat and now the trap is about to be sprung.
 [ N f6 ]  [ b4 ] , [ N x f3 + ]  the most easiest move to come with at this point will be taking it back with the bisschop at least.. i think that will be the first answere that enters your mind if you see this. But what SPCMN did was way more stronger!
 [ Q x g5 + ]  [ K h1 ]  [ N f4 ]  [ Q f1 ]  [ B x e1 ]  [ R x e1 ]  [ Q h5 ] , [ c5 ]  ?? The idea was to get a passed pawn. I like the intention because passed pawns are generally dangerous and ugly. However white can and does prevent the that. Even if he brought one of those R's to [ c8 ] the idea would work and that's what I mean when I talk about bringing that R in front of a pawn like that to stop the opponent from getting a passed pawn. But what white plays is far worse and it is going to lose a Q for a N which is why this move is a blunder. In fact this is was the plan behind 23...[ Q h5 ] which is why it's also important to think and plan ahead. I'm going by the anlaysis reveals as I agree. The best move here was 24.[ R e3 ] to prevent. And this time I do not completely agree with what the anlaysis said because the line they gave also loses a Q. There would've been ways to protect it had white played that.
 [ Q b3 ]  [ R c d8 ]  [ e4 ]  [ R f7 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ B x d5 ]  [ Q e3 ]  [ R f5 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ R d f8 ] , [ R x c7 ]  Black resigned here. I was surprised because I thought Black still had plenty of play. After [ Q x c7 ] White can play [ R x [ d5 ] ] but Black has the annoying [ Q c2 ] attacking the hanging B on b2. White's Q is overloaded and can't guard the [ d5 ] R the [ b2 ] B the [ e4 ] N and the back rank threat of [ Q b1 + ] all at the same time.
 [ K h2 ]  [ b5 ]  [ a3 ]  [ h5 ]  [ d4 ] , [ h4 ]  Now with the coming [ g4 ] I know he is going to sacrifice the Bishop for the 2 pawns and what he believes will be a strong winning attack.
 [ N d4 ]  [ N x h3 ]  [ N x c6 + ]  [ K e6 ]  [ N a7 ]  [ N g5 ]  [ N x b5 ]  [ N e4 ] , [ K f4 ]  ! -- Stopping any hoped-for penetration by Black's King because White's b5N freezes the d-pwan.
 [ d5 ]  [ c4 ] , [ B f5 ]  2. ....... [ B f5 ] - an unusual 2nd move but that bishop stays there until a few moves before the end with devastating effect as that will help to interfere with the co-ordination of my pieces.
 [ R h8 + ]  [ K f7 ] , [ B d4 + ]  So I grab a pawn if black comes to take the g one.
 [ O-O-O ]  [ B e3 ] , [ B d4 ]  trading the bishops are fine.
 [ K h2 ] , [ K e3 ]  My king is taking a nice stroll now on white territory...
 [ B c6 ]  [ Q d6 ]  [ Q x d6 ] , [ e x d6 ]  [ B x f3 ] 26. [ g x f3 ] [ K f8 ] 27. [ c4 ] [ K e8 ] 28. [ c5 ] [ K d7 ] 29. [ R c1 ] Rc830. [ R b1 ] Rx[ c5 ] 31. [ R x b7 + ] [ K x d6 ] 32. [ R x a7 ] [ R c7 ] 33. [ R a8 ] Kc634. [ K f1 ] [ K b7 ] 35. [ R g8 ] [ g6 ] 36. [ K e2 ] [ K a6 ] 37. [ R a8 + ] [ K b5 ] 38. [ K e3 ] Rc3+39. [ K e2 ] [ g5 ] 40. [ R h8 ] [ K x a5 ] 41. [ R x h6 ] [ R c2 + ] 42. [ K e3 ] = But it is white who has to play accurately to hold. When I conducted this World Championship poll out of the 1 200+ votes about 71-72% picked Carlsen to beat Caruana. Do you still agree after seeing this game?
 [ Q c4 + ] , [ B e6 ]  ?? Trying to harass white's Queen. Although black was lost this is the move that loses right away. I'm not sure what the best move was but Joe said that this was the biggest blunder of the entire game. If black doesn't make any blunder so with best it's a mate in 9 for him because of this move. That's based on what Komodo said.
 [ N f3 ] , [ N e4 ]  Not willing to give up the [ B d5 ] under any circumstance.
 [ g x h6 ] , [ d6 ]  Here black shouldn't have taken the pawn on [ d6 ] because if 10.cxd6......11.bh5-k[ e2 ] followed by 12.kd5-ke6.....13.q[ g4 ] mate.
 [ Q e3 ] , [ N c4 ]  ?
 [ b x c4 ]  [ B x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ] , [ Q b4 ]  White can't hold everything.
 [ Q x g5 ]  [ R g8 ]  [ Q h5 + ]  [ Q x h5 + ] , [ K x h5 ]  Chessnut: [ N g3 ] & Tal drew but...
 [ B g4 ] , [ B e2 ]  And he is already ready to castle
 [ R f c8 ] , [ B a4 ]  i want to get my bishop away from his pawns and get it more involved in my plans.
 [ N f6 ] , [ B x d4 ]  There are times when we say more than we mean and there are times when we mean more than we say; Black can take the bishop pair and probably should have: 19...[ N x g4 + ] 20.[ h x g4 ] exd4.
 [ K e7 ] , [ Q x e5 + ]  Now I am going to force him all over the board. This is similar to another one of my annotations but this one requires more work.
 [ e6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ O-O ] , [ d5 ]  of course. taking the center and vanishing the white bishop.
 [ N c6 ] , [ d4 ]  Risking the marginally supported d pawn in order to prevent the checking move [ B c5 ] by Black. D4 also forces Black to pay attention to his now threatened [ f4 ] pawn.
 [ c6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ e6 ] , [ O-O ]  White is doing fine...
 [ h5 ]  [ B b7 ] , [ N d2 ]  a moment of hesitation in the White camp...
 [ N x f3 + ]  [ R x f3 ]  [ B e7 ] , [ B g5 ]  if knight x [ e4 ] my dsb x [ e7 ] threatening the black queen then i place my rook in [ e3 ] and intent to win the back knight
 [ R x d1 ]  [ Q x d1 ]  [ R d8 ] , [ Q e2 ]  25. [ Q e2 ] - this choice of square proves vital for Glenda as she has a line to c4.
 [ B x d4 ] , [ N c3 ]  Figuring out what to do after his last move I decided to play this. The idea being that not only do I continue to develop but I am not concerned if he doubled up my pawns with 6...[ B x c3 ] The idea being is that we haven't exchanged major pieces. I know that it depends on the position. But when I'm not sure in a particular position then I go by what tactical-abyss told me as it makes sense to me.. In it Joe has said that doubled pawns are usually of no real asset until major pieces have been exchanged.
 [ b6 ] , [ K f2 ]  31. [ K f2 ] - a multi-purpose move. It gets Henry towards the centre and it prepares that exchange of rooks.
 [ B f4 ] , [ Q e7 ]  Controlling the N's jumps and thinking about a possible [ Q h4 ] (was it sound at some point the sac Bxf2? Probably yes!)
 [ Q x d3 ] , [ Q e5 + ]  ... and I split the king and knight enabling me to snaffle the latter...
 [ K e5 ]  [ R b5 + ]  [ K d6 ]  [ R a7 ] , [ R e2 + ]  Intermediate check
 [ a3 ] , [ d6 ]  Opens up the bishop this move usually blocks in the black squared bishop but because the bishop is at [ g7 ] this move is fine.
 [ B d2 ]  [ R f c8 ]  [ N b d4 ]  [ h5 ]  [ R a c1 ]  [ e5 ] , [ N x c6 ]  This starts a series of exchanges that puts black temporarily behind in material. Could this be the second tipping point? I devoted my attention to recovery of material.
 [ R f6 ] , [ R e1 ]  My achievement so far is to have tucked Black's pieces in front of his own pawns. Since he has exchanged a knight for two pawns you can see how the material edge is only amplified on my part by this.
 [ K d4 ] , [ O-O-O + ]  White castles. Gets king safe and puts in a check. Even though development wise up untill now there was no real difference white has managed to maintain all the running forcing black to react.
 [ R d4 ]  [ K b1 ]  [ B x c3 ]  [ R x c3 ]  [ R d1 + ]  [ R c1 ] , [ R d4 ]  I'm starting to think: Hey my position isn't terrible. After I win his knight I've got the bishop pair against his rook.
 [ c4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ g3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ B g2 ]  [ O-O ]  [ d4 ]  [ d6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N b d7 ]  [ O-O ]  [ e5 ]  [ e4 ]  [ c6 ] , [ h3 ]  9 [ h3 ] is generally considered necessary to prevent the bishop from getting harassed by [ N g4 ] after it gets to e3. For 9 [ B e3 ] [ N g4 ] 10 [ B g5 ] [ Q b6 ] see Mikhail Botvinnik-Vassily Smyslov 1954.
 [ B b3 ] , [ R d7 ]  Karpov with nice combination finishing the game . if 28...[ B x c2 ] .29.Rxe6!-fxe6.30.Bxe7and black loses a free pawn and with 2 pawns lead its hopeless game for black .
 [ K h1 ] , [ N c5 ]  The vision starts to become reality propelled by the exposed threat to the misplaced B.
 [ N f4 + ]  [ B x f4 ]  [ Q x f4 ] , [ Q d5 ]  Tactically preventing g6.
 [ e x d5 ] , [ e x d5 ]  Fritz recommends 9. [ B x d5 ] (-0.12) Second best move by Fritz is 9. [ N x d5 ] (-0.43) with my choice coming in third 9. [ e x d5 ] (-0.50) I agree with Fritz that [ B x d5 ] would have been a good move. I would then have a direct threat on my opponent's King and the pawn on [ f7 ] would be pinned.
 [ K g1 ] , [ Q x f5 ]  and picks up a loose pawn on the way attacking the h-pawn and threatening ... [ N f3 ] or ... [ N g4 ] or ... [ N d3 ] followed by ... [ Q x f2 # ]  [ a7 ] , [ R g6 + ]  Attacking the King is an urgent priority with the pawn about to Queen.
 [ c5 ]  [ d5 ] , [ N x d5 ]  Ohhhhhhh I somewhat unwisely take his queen.
 [ Q x h6 ] , [ R e8 ]  Trying to seize the only open file before connecting your rooks generally means losing control of that file later often permanently.
 [ N x f6 + ]  [ Q x f6 ]  [ Q x f6 ] , [ g x f6 ]  Knight and Queen exchange complete white has the slight advantage of the doubled pawns and weakend kingside defence of black.
 [ d5 ]  [ B d3 ] , [ a6 ]  I've never understood this move... What gain?
 [ O-O ]  [ B g2 ] , [ d5 ]  And it gets interesting as Charles advances his center pawn. In doing so an interesting exchange will occur. Then Janet will use her opportunity to castle as well.
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ] , [ N c3 ]  3. [ N c3 ] - I decided to open up lines for both my ecclesiastical twins and follow up with developing a knight.
 [ N d5 ]  [ N x e5 ] , [ B b4 ]  Pinning the queen
 [ R x a4 ] , [ b x a4 ]  No other choice
 [ N f6 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ c4 ]  [ N b4 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c6 ] , [ N f3 ]  5. [ N f3 ] - after establishing a strong pawn centre I develop a piece.
 [ K x h2 ] , [ Q c7 + ]  Long range fork. Check and the bishop on [ c4 ] will fall.
 [ e3 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ N c3 ]  Now that the White Bishop is no longer pinning the [ g7 ] pawn it's all right to close it off temporarily for the sake of development.
 [ Q x d2 ]  [ K h8 ]  [ Q f4 ] , [ Q e7 ]  I have effectively blockaded the position. Even if White wins the P on my [ Q B3 ] the Q-side Pawns will remain obstructed.
 [ R x e8 ]  [ N f1 ] , [ R e1 ]  A HUGE blunder in a winning position. Just about any other move retains Black's winning edge. Evidently 20...[ d x c4 ] 20...[ h6 ] 20...[ g6 ] all seem to fit the bill.
 [ Q x c4 ]  [ R a e8 ] , [ N g5 ]  After unpinning my queen I really wanted to place my knight here. This proved to be a very valuable outpost!
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ e3 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ c4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ Q b3 ]  [ B x f3 ] , [ g x f3 ]  (W) Mm I like QxP[ b7 ] better. Black must deal with the rook then white picks off the bishop picking up a pawn in the process.
 [ R g7 ] , [ B b5 ]  Black rejects the queen yes but shields itself from the attack on [ b2 ] giving me the tempo to go...
 [ N x e4 ]  [ e6 ] , [ N b c3 ]  White gets another piece out in the hope that his strong central presence and developmental advantage will pay dividends.
 [ N x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ] , [ b5 ]  !
 [ B f8 ] , [ Q d4 ]  Black chased my queen away but nothing has changed.
 [ g x f5 ]  [ e x f5 ] , [ Q x f5 ]  Now im six points ahead but drastically behind on time
 [ e6 ]  [ Q x e6 ]  [ B x h3 ]  [ Q x h3 ] , [ e4 ]  24. [ e4 ] - puts the question to my knight. I opt for [ f6 ] - will Janet be prepared to part with this strong bishop in order to open up the g column? Will this decision prove costly to me? Time will tell.
 [ B g7 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B e2 ]  [ d6 ] , [ O-O ]  This all seems normal up to now.
 [ K b4 ] , [ R d c7 ]  24. .............. [ R d c7 ] - confining the white king to the a and b files if dmaestro does not look out his king could be walking right into a mating net!
 [ d6 ] , [ B e3 ]  ? But this is giving away too much. With the following sequence of moves black will inflict a more serious positional damage.
 [ N e3 ]  [ R a1 ] , [ K f6 ]  holding the pressure on g2...
 [ O-O ] , [ B e3 ]  White is developing nicely here and Black needs to get moving
 [ Q d3 ] , [ c4 ]  This appears to be a good move as it opens up the black bishop with a tempo on the queen but...
 [ R x a8 ] , [ B x a8 ]  All according to plan.
 [ B x e5 ] , [ N f3 ]  I black's DSB moves for the third time white will havve developpement advance
 [ K x a6 ]  [ h x g6 ]  [ h x g6 ]  [ g5 ]  [ f5 ]  [ K e5 ] , [ N d6 ]  !
 [ e3 ] , [ h6 ]  Since this is white's "bad bishop" (all his pawns on the same color) Thomas is happy to give it up for the knight.
 [ K f1 ] , [ Q g4 ]  35. .......... [ Q g4 ] - here she comes! Notice the rook on [ d1 ] is en prise.
 [ d x c4 ]  [ B x c4 ]  [ b5 ]  [ B b3 ] , [ R x c1 ]  Alternative variation: 22... [ R c7 ] 23. [ R x c7 ] [ Q x c7 ] 24. [ R c1 ] [ Q b6 ] [ is better for Black but still is lost especially after] 25. [ Q a2 ]  [ Q x c1 ]  [ N b6 ] , [ N d6 ]  Alternative variation: 24. [ Q c5 ] [ N f d7 ] 25. [ Q c2 ] [threatening Nxh6! .] [ K f8 ] 26. [ N d6 ]  [ R e7 ]  [ Q c5 ]  [ B d5 ] , [ B x d5 ]  Alternative variation: 26. [ N f5 ] [keeping the tension while attacking black's rook.] [ R c7 ] 27. [ B x e5 ] [ R x c5 ] 28. [ B x b8 ] [ R c3 ] 29. [ N e7 + ] [ K f8 ] 30. [ N x d5 ] [ R x b3 ] 31. [ N x b6 ]  [ N b x d5 ] , [ e4 ]  Alternative variation: 27. [ N e4 ] [ R d7 ] 28. [ Q c6 ] [almost all of Black's pieces are under attack] [ R d8 ] 29. [ N x f6 + ] [ N x f6 ] 30. [ R x d8 + ] [ Q x d8 ] 31. [ B x e5 ]  [ N f4 ]  [ B x f4 ]  [ e x f4 ]  [ R c1 ]  [ N e8 ]  [ N x e8 ]  [ R x e8 ] , [ h3 ]  Alternative variation: 31. [ K f2 ] [ white should aim for getting his king into the game soon.]
 [ K x h2 ] , [ N g4 + ]  He takes advantage by placing me in check and this is very serious as I am going to loose the Queen. That is why 10.[ N e5 ] was the loosing move. Therefore "You need to look further! I've just won your queen" is what he says after 14.Qxg5.
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ e3 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ c4 ]  [ c6 ]  [ b4 ]  [ e6 ] , [ a3 ]  Too much pawnmoves.
 [ R a6 ] , [ a2 ]  one step closer to heaven...
 [ e4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ g3 ]  Having an extra opening for the bishop is really unnecessary.
 [ Q c2 ]  [ h6 ] , [ B h4 ]  While the [ N f6 ] needs to be eliminated as a prerequisite for my [ B e4 ] plan I was prepared to accept the loosening of k-side pawns as equivalent compensation.
 [ Q d7 ]  [ K h2 ] , [ N e8 ]  Preparing ...f5. 12...[ N h5 ] would have invited 13. [ g4 ] at this stage which wouldn't have helped me with my plan.
 [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ B c5 ] , [ R a d1 ]  Reminding myself to make strong moves instead of passive moves.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ d6 ]  This is the Phildor Defense
 [ B c5 ]  [ b3 ]  [ N d4 ] , [ N x e5 ]  White gains a pawn but Black's development is better. 6. ...[ d6 ] will let Black start the first significant attack and we're just at the sixth move.
 [ e5 ]  [ f4 ] , [ f6 ]  this i believe is the worse way to not accept the gambit.
 [ R x g6 ] , [ K x g4 ]  but White is not a grandmaster nor a player at judochess.com so he has no business trying to draw this endgame better was to keep the knight
 [ f6 ]  [ g x f6 ]  [ B x f6 ] , [ N a5 ]  16. [ N a5 ] - still book. There is a possibility of establishing that knight on c6. In this game however that knight never quite gets there.
 [ d4 ]  [ g6 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ c3 ] , [ c5 ]  Just hitting at the right point. Both [ d5 ] dxc or [ N f3 ] seem playable. I won't go into it.
 [ c5 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ] , [ d6 ]  I am starting to lose focus I think. I recall beginning to feel impatient about this point in the game. Things are even in material and I seem to be in a slightly better position and his king has become exposed. Maybe I get impatient and lax at the same time.
 [ N x e5 ]  [ N x e5 ] , [ N e4 ]  Threatening [ Q f6 ] with [ Q x f2 # ] [ Q x e5 ] and Q look at [ R a1 ] !
 [ Q c7 ] , [ a3 ]  Preventing [ N b4 ] ideas which in order to keep my double bishop pair would force [ B e2 ] making it harder to do a kingside attack which is my plan here.
 [ O-O ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ c x d5 ] , [ N e7 ]  As now even if Nathan did have something else planned my K is tucked away which is what I like even if I'm go to overboard with castling early.
 [ R a d1 ]  [ N g x e5 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ N d5 ] , [ c6 ]  [ f6 ] is better as it maintains blacks advantage. [ c6 ] leaves the game in the balance after 15. [ Q g3 ] focusing on the weak pawn but....
 [ Q b6 + ] , [ d4 ]  Pass pawns must be pushed!
 [ Q x f3 ]  [ Q g5 ]  [ c6 ]  [ R b a8 ] , [ N c7 ]  Lancelot makes his presence known!
 [ B x d7 ]  [ B x d7 + ] , [ K d8 ]  Black blunders here and does not take the bishop. I suspect though that Black is a gambling man and hopes that White hastily moves the bishop away and forgets about the CHECKMATE waiting on his doorstep. Here Black is playing the player rather than the board and rolling the dice. From my experience such tricks rarely work against highly ranked players who tend to play the board than the player.
 [ K d8 ]  [ Q x f5 ] , [ Q c6 ]  I have different options: [ N c4 ] heading to d6. o-o-o in order to pin the [ N e7 ] or [ R g1 ] preventing his developement (dsb wouldn't move or Rxg7). I went for a wrong line thinking in having an annoying pawn in e6. It was the wrong plan
 [ b4 ]  [ B d4 ] , [ N b5 ]  14. Nb5?? - but this just drops a rook white should have played [ B b2 ] here ([ B d2 ] drops the d pawn to the black queen).
 [ R f1 ] , [ R d8 ]  Bringing in my final attacker. Mate was already inevitable for a while already but even a lower level player like me is able to see the forced mate now.
 [ d6 ] , [ e4 ]  Backing up the d pawn and giving the light square bishop some options.
 [ R x b4 ]  [ N b d7 ]  [ K f1 ] , [ B d8 ]  So many options for Black...
 [ h x g2 ]  [ K x g2 ]  [ R g8 + ]  [ K f3 ]  [ B e6 ] , [ K f4 ]  Useless move.
 [ B d2 ]  [ d6 ]  [ h3 ]  [ b5 ]  [ B b3 ] , [ R b8 ]  To avoid knight pin with white bishop [ d5 ]  [ Q x d2 ] , [ N g e7 ]  exchange offered on whites troublesome knight
 [ f6 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ Q e8 ]  [ B h6 ]  [ R f7 ] , [ Q f4 ]  Big mistake the WT queen has blocked all safe squares for the bishop on [ h6 ]  [ K h8 ] , [ B x g7 + ]  pretty much forced
 [ B g4 ]  [ Q b3 ] , [ R b8 ]  Defending the pawn which I need to protect my knight. ...[ b6 ] would have been a mistake since it would have pinned my knight to my king making by one advanced pawn more vulnerable.
 [ R x e6 ]  [ h3 ]  [ R e1 + ]  [ K h2 ] , [ B g3 # ]  Black checkmates while white is frolicking around on with it's horsey
 [ Q e4 + ]  [ K b3 ] , [ N e3 ]  Now I fork his Queen and Rook with the move I had already prepared two moves ago.
 [ N x g4 ]  [ Q f5 ] , [ N h6 ]  game is technically over with that move. nothing more to see.
 [ a4 ] , [ R d7 ]  preparing to duple my rocks in d file.
 [ R x g5 ]  [ R x a3 ]  [ R g7 + ]  [ K b6 ]  [ R e e7 ] , [ R b8 ]  I don't see better options. Now by pushing the pawn white wins.
 [ b6 ]  [ h6 ] , [ g6 ]  In order to create at least some pressure I have to reinforce the h column. In order to do that I have to move the Q but I don't want him to take advantage of [ d5 ] and the discovered threaton [ R h1 ] so...
 [ R x d6 ] , [ a7 ]  As now Charles will promote. But can be stopped? We will find out soon.
 [ e x d4 ] , [ Q x d4 ]  Bringing a big piece into the fray.
 [ R e b8 ] , [ g x f6 ]  As now I am down another pawn and for the same reason.
 [ Q x e6 ] , [ B x c6 ]  Again I am playing the game the way I want it to head towards.
 [ N f6 ] , [ R g1 ]  Anderssen was ignoring the piece and trying to attack the queen.
 [ Q e6 ] , [ N x f6 + ]  Here I missed Nxc7!!.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ d5 ] , [ d3 ]  Russ. It's your move here. PxB is the correct move.
 [ Q h7 + ]  [ K f8 ]  [ Q h8 + ]  [ K e7 ]  [ Q x g7 ]  [ Q x d3 ] , [ B x h6 ]  A very important position. Black is better but walking on a thin red line.
 [ b x c3 ] , [ N d7 ]  Getting the knight out.
 [ e4 ] , [ b5 ]  He has taken control of the centre but i will back up my pawn
 [ Q d3 ]  [ R e7 ] , [ R f e1 ]  I am going to double my rooks
 [ g x h3 ] , [ Q x h3 ]  My calculation is like this...I lost 3 points and he lost 2 points. But his king is vulnerable now. Though no checkmate exist at this position
 [ g3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ h4 ] , [ B g4 ]  He goes for my knight.
 [ B e3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ f3 ] , [ O-O ]  7. [ f3 ] is known as the Yugoslav attack.
 [ K b8 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ K a8 ]  [ R a b1 ]  [ Q x d4 ] , [ N b5 ]  Alternative variation: 22. [ Q x d4 ] [ e x d4 ] 23. [ N b5 ] [ B x b5 ] 24. [ R x b5 ] [ B d6 ] $15
 [ R b8 ] , [ Q x f5 ]  Might as well eat when the snack is free.
 [ B g7 ] , [ N g f3 ]  This loses a pawn: 10...[ N x f3 ] 11.[ Q x f3 ] [ B x e5 ]  [ N x f3 + ]  [ Q x f3 ]  [ B x e5 ] , [ O-O ]  White has achieved a fast kingside development for the sacrifice of a pawn. Now it is black's task to develop himself into a safe position. 12...0-0 A) 13.[ N b3 ] [ Q c7 ] 14.[ h3 ] (14.[ R e1 ] [ B x h2 ] 15.[ K h1 ] [ B e5 ] 16.[ Q e3 ] [ [ [ d6 ] ] ] 17.[ Q h6 ] [ B g7 ] 18.[ Q e3 ] Re8) [ [ [ d6 ] ] ] 15.[ B d2 ] [ b6 ] and [ B b7 ] B) 13.[ R e1 ] [ Q c7 ] 14.[ Q e3 ] [ [ [ d6 ] ] ] 15.[ Q h6 ] [ B g7 ] 16.[ Q e3 ] [ R e8 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N b3 ]  [ Q c7 ] , [ B h6 ]  Knocking at black castle's backdoor. A) 14...[ B g7 ] offering the exchange. B) 14...[ R e8 ] Note that now two pawns are en rpise: [ h2 ] and a2. E.g. 15.[ h3 ] [ B x a2 ] 16.[ R b1 ] [ B e5 ] 17.[ R f e1 ] [ d6 ] looks the better way going with the bishop and two extra pawns rather than without them. ;)
 [ h3 ] , [ Q c4 ]  move the queen around a lil
 [ B x a4 ] , [ Q x b1 + ]  Winning the rook and another pawn so white resigns.
 [ R c1 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ R e1 ] , [ Q d7 ]  q[ d7 ] is a popular move in this position because it helps the bishops diagnol
 [ N d2 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ c5 ]  [ c3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ f4 ]  We've reached the stone wall position here.
 [ R d7 ]  [ a2 ] , [ R a7 ]  phew... just in time while also restricting any advancement of the opposition king
 [ N f7 ] , [ R a e1 ]  19. I develop my final piece the queen rook to [ e1 ] this controls the e file and might act as a cut off for the black king should my mating attack really get going.
 [ Q e2 ] , [ B f3 ]  A very interesting move and I saw it but didn't expect white to play it. I thought if anything 17. ... [ N f3 + ] would have been a better option - it provides cover for his weak pawn while moving the white king... If 18. gxf3?? then 18. ... [ g x f3 ] 19. [ Q f1 ] [ R g1 + ] 20. [ K h1 ] (20. [ K f2 ] Qh4#) f2+! If 17.... [ N f3 + ] 18. [ K f2 ] then black responds with [ Q h4 + ] or 18. [ K f1 ] Nxh2. The final response to that line could have been 17. ... [ N f3 + ] 18. [ K h1 ] Qh4! All lines result in heavy material loss opening up the white king and/or checkmate.
 [ Q c7 ] , [ R e1 ]  Getting my rook out of harm's way.
 [ e x f6 ] , [ g x f6 ]  Game note: “10...[ g x f6 ] is ugly but not sure about ...Bxf6”. I still wasn’t seeing …[ Q a5 + ] was I?
 [ a x b3 ] , [ R f c8 ]  With both Tal's rooks charged on the c-file can you hear the bolt locking into place?
 [ K x h2 ] , [ R b8 ]  ?? But I was surprised to see black play this. Then again the computer has no good moves left. I kept that right in mind which I took with R as opposed to the N. Of course the idea being was to leave black in that pin.
 [ a x b3 ] , [ c x b3 ]  Not a very good move ends to 15...[ Q a5 ] 16.[ B c4 ] [ B f6 ] 17.[ Q c2 ] [ Q a3 ] which increases the pressure on white's king.
 [ b5 ]  [ B a2 ] , [ B b7 ]  Finally developing a piece
 [ R x d4 ]  [ R x d4 ] , [ R a8 ]  Forced. It protects the [ a6 ] pawn as well as it moves the Rook away from the troubled d-file.
 [ e x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ g6 ]  [ c3 ] , [ B g7 ]  Not a bad opening so far for either side. Each player is two moves away from castling - and can launch offensive strategies easily.
 [ K d2 ]  [ Q b2 + ]  [ N c2 ] , [ a5 ]  not much I could do with my king.
 [ R c7 ] , [ R d a2 ]  By bringing my castle over I protect the rank against a double castle exchange and a certain loss.
 [ N f3 ] , [ c5 ]  If I develop [ N e2 ] this move is seriously delayed with a low paced game involving [ N c1 ] Ng3... too slow (and less known) for my taste.
 [ a x b5 ]  [ f5 ]  [ R e e3 ]  [ K f7 ] , [ K h2 ]  Now the final action begins.
 [ R f d8 ]  [ R d4 x d8 ]  [ R x d8 ]  [ R x d8 ]  [ Q x d8 ] , [ f3 ]  I thing I proposed the draw here. Computer saws that move as an Inaccuracy
 [ Q x e6 + ]  [ f x e6 ]  [ B x f8 ]  [ K x f8 ] , [ R d7 ]  With those two exchanges White has now established a rook on the seventh rank and enjoys a positional as well as a material advantage. Needless to say I was feeling optimistic at this point
 [ N e6 ]  [ b4 ] , [ B d4 ]  19...Bxd5? doesn't work. 20. [ e x d5 ] [ B x b4 ] 21. [ d x e6 ] fxe6. The smoke clears with White having the advantage.
 [ Q e6 ] , [ Q x e6 ]  This is slightly inaccurate as after 16... fxe6! your knight and bishop are both under attack and in order to not lose a piece you must play 17. Be3. However just 16. Nxc7! wins a pawn flat out
 [ B b5 ] , [ O-O ]  This doesn't save the pawn. All I wanted was to get my king out of danger and consider that lonely rook pawn on [ a2 ] as a fair exchange for losing the doomed pawn on e5.
 [ N f6 ] , [ d5 ]  Offering a pawn to open the light-squares to White's powerful bishop.
 [ R f e1 ]  [ B g7 ] , [ e4 ]  ?! This allows a monster passed pawn. I think better is [ e3 ] guarding the [ d4 ] square and allowing the B to roam around and offset the Blk B on [ c4 ]  [ B b2 ]  [ R c2 ] , [ d4 ]  Board up the windows the zombies are coming!
 [ B e3 + ]  [ K h2 ]  [ B x b6 ]  [ a x b6 + ]  [ K x b6 ] , [ R f7 ]  Closing in for the kill
 [ h x g6 ] , [ f x g6 ]  White mates in 3.
 [ B x h4 ]  [ R x g4 + ] , [ h x g4 ]  46. [ h x g4 ] - so Darren now has a 4 point material advantage over Freddy but can he convert it to victory?
 [ R x d2 + ]  [ B x d2 ] , [ a2 ]  And the pawn marches for glory.
 [ e x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ] , [ B x d5 ]  I can sense that he is keen to attack now. I have to be careful.
 [ B c4 ]  [ O-O ]  [ e5 ] , [ d5 ]  9. ....... [ d5 ] - here Dave departs from the database. After careful calculation I decide to take on f6.
 [ h3 ] , [ N x e3 ]  Maybe should have played [ N e5 ] with the aim of pushing [ a4 ] as originally planned but I only had that as a plan to remove a bishop (I struggle against bishop pairs). Under the circumstance taking this one seemed like a good plan.
 [ N x b6 + ] , [ K h8 ]  indeed a flaw in Blacks' game: but it does not matter anymore...
 [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ a6 ]  [ B a4 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ N c3 ]  However better was to castle. This is what reversion has noticed before playing this. The only thing to note is that this move was played before my game against Jack Stockel. Therefore I was only remembering what tipsyjourneyman said which is that it's preferable to hold off on castling until later. He recommended this move. However I base things on what cplusplus11 has also noted. And after that game he said to learn some theory because after this variation (which you most often see) 5.0-0 is most often played. Like that game I was worried about losing a pawn after ....Nxe4. The truth however is that black would not be able to hold onto it after white plays Re1. Had this happened after my game with Jack I would've stuck to mainlines.
 [ Q f6 ] , [ c4 ]  Frees the queen onto the light squares without moving the [ e2 ] pawn. Also threatens the [ d6 ] bishop
 [ R f e8 ] , [ Q e2 ]  He has tripled his big guns. But it's that pawn rather foolishly (in my view) advanced that he needs to worry about.
 [ O-O ] , [ N d4 ]  I suppose with this move black intends to set sup some advanced pawns in the center.
 [ R c a8 ] , [ B c5 ]  [ d6 ] is for the Knight.
 [ g4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ g5 ]  [ N h5 ] , [ R x h5 ]  good move . white must keep agressive game on the black king if 20.Ng3?!-Bg4!.21.fxg4-Nxg4.22.Bxf7+-Kxf7.21.Qxh7+Ng7.22.Rhf1-Nf6.23.[ Q h3 ] and black have the advantange .
 [ Q d7 ] , [ N x g7 ]  another move that deserves a '?' . If anyone finds a variation that I might have went into that would win him his material back please let me know I don't see any.
 [ B e2 ] , [ R x e4 ]  Lange gains a tempo by attacking the Queen while recapturing.
 [ e3 ] , [ f6 ]  Another poor move from black should've been Qa1.
 [ R a3 ]  [ R x h7 ]  [ R a4 + ]  [ K e3 ] , [ R a3 + ]  I wanted to keep my king on same line as his so instead of check [ B d3 + ]  [ e6 ]  [ c x d5 ] , [ e x d5 ]  I end up losing a central pawn for a flank pawn but it is OK because White is creating weaknesses with every additional pawn advance. I also get an open e-file for my rook if I need it.
 [ B b3 ] , [ d6 ]  7. ....... [ d6 ] - supports [ e5 ] and keeps my options open as to where to put Fou Leblanc. The square [ b7 ] seems thematic to this opening however.
 [ N c7 + ]  [ K d7 ] , [ N x a8 ]  Wins the rook but the N is trapped and Black is now on the offensive.
 [ R f8 ]  [ Q e4 ] , [ R x f2 ]  These days 13...Bg5ch would be preferred but even so White has a tremendous attack: 14.[ K b1 ] [ R f4 ] 15.Qxe5ch [ K f7 ] 16.[ N x d5 ] [ c x d5 ] 17.Bxd5ch [ K f8 ] 18.Bb3!
 [ K c1 ]  [ Q x a3 + ]  [ K d1 ]  [ Q a1 + ]  [ K e2 ]  [ Q x h1 ]  [ R d1 ]  [ Q g2 + ] , [ K e1 ]  [ K e3 ] runs into the same problems as Ke1.
 [ N c5 ] , [ Q e8 ]  I was surprised that my knight scared off the black queen. Black did not yet wanted an attrition of pieces through minor pieces exchange. Or he was just too protective of his dark bishops. Pretty interesting theme of dark bishops. See don't the dark bishops have a profound influence?
 [ h5 ]  [ a5 ]  [ h6 ]  [ a4 ]  [ h7 ]  [ B e5 ] , [ K x e5 ]  See! I told you
 [ B d4 + ] , [ B e3 ]  offers up trade which may or may not benefit me because of my pawns being on light squares.
 [ K h1 ] , [ Q e7 ]  Clearing space on the back row. I can't protect either of the e-pawns so there's no point in trying.
 [ N c5 ] , [ R a7 + ]  26. ... Nc5? seems to defend the rook but white can simply play 27. [ B x c4 + ] [ R x c4 ] 28. [ N c6 + ] and still win the exchange with the added bonus of trading of a pair of minor pieces too. But white finds an even better stunt. Now black is busted. 27. ... [ B d7 ] is met with 28. [ B x c5 + ] [ R x c5 ] 29. R[ a x d7 + ] [ K f6 ] 30. [ R x d8 ] and white gains three pieces for one.
 [ e4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ] , [ e x d5 ]  the advanced variation of French: not sure it is meant like this...
 [ c x b4 ]  [ Q x b4 ]  [ R g5 + ]  [ K h8 ] , [ K e2 ]  
 [ f3 ] , [ B e6 ]  moving same piece twice
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ b4 ]  [ c x b4 ]  [ a3 ] , [ b x a3 ]  I had forgotten how much fun the Sicilian wing gambit can be.
 [ R a2 ] , [ R e1 ]  i was attempting to play [ K h3 ] if i played that last move his rook could of went to [ c1 ] threatening a checkmate on [ h1 ]  [ R b2 ] , [ R a1 ]  playing this first just incase i need to check on the a file
 [ B x f3 ] , [ g x f3 ]  Equality achieved (approximately).
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ c5 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ c x d5 ] , [ d6 ]  In this themed mini the games all started here.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ Q f6 ]  Not a great idea to bring out the queen so early. Common moves instead are [ N c6 ] and [ N f6 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ O-O ]  [ a6 ]  [ B a4 ]  [ b5 ]  [ B b3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d3 ]  [ N h6 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ Q g6 ] , [ B x c5 ]  White is somewhat carefree and allows black to begin some complications. [ R e1 ] was safer
 [ Q d5 + ]  [ R f7 ]  [ R x g3 ]  [ R x g3 + ]  [ K f1 ] , [ Q h3 + ]  I feel bad for white being crushed. I seriously feel bad but black's last move was unwise. If black had done 43...Qxh2! then he has a force mate in 1. Feel free to post a comment suggesting something you see but I did not see.
 [ B x d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N b1 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ B f3 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ N e2 ] , [ e5 ]  Maybe this isnot good for me. [ e6 ] would be enough for free my bishop but not to closing my queen. I loose here some tempo.
 [ e x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ] , [ B b4 ]  All book so far...
 [ d6 ]  [ N g e2 ]  [ N d7 ] , [ Q d2 ]  plan is to 0-0-0 and attack on the king side!
 [ Q d6 ]  [ N b5 ]  [ Q e7 ] , [ a3 ]  controlling the board...
 [ K g6 ]  [ d x e4 ] , [ R x g5 ]  He probably not thought about that! But it's far to be finished.
 [ Q x d4 ] , [ R b8 ]  [ Q a7 ] is not the threat that [ B a7 ] would have been now I have to get the bishop of the back rank and develop.
 [ B x f7 ]  [ R d7 ] , [ B b3 ]  If my Bishop had not been en prise I might have given [ h3 ] a shot at this point.
 [ b4 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ N x d5 ] , [ e x d5 ]  so i am successful to control centre as well as advance my centre pawn
 [ B d6 ]  [ B x d6 ] , [ Q x d6 ]  didn't like that bishop there
 [ d4 ] , [ R d1 ]  pinning the pawn to hold off the inevitable material loss awhile
 [ N g e7 ] , [ B e2 ]  Time to swap pieces on b5.
 [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ B b5 ]  ....." The Ruy Lopez".......
 [ N e7 ]  [ R e1 ] , [ h5 ]  Looks aggresive but I really just wanted him to play [ g5 ] locking the kingside structure for my king to hide behind and freeing up the [ f5 ] square again.
 [ B x d5 ]  [ Q x d5 ] , [ O-O ]  ?! Although my intention wasn't a waste of time it was pointless because he protects by castling Kingside. BTW in this position this move is better then ...0-0-0 as castling Queenside initially leaves the King too open. Now that the pressure is off I either have to protect it with my R or advance my a pawn. However I prefer 25.a3. That ensures that I did not move the R away from [ a1 ] for nothing. In other words it ascertains that 22.[ R a d1 ] was not a waste of time.
 [ Q f6 ]  [ Q x f6 ]  [ N x f6 ] , [ B g6 ]  At this point I laughed at the fact that we had already used half of our time with only ten moves complete. His clock had nine minutes left and my clock had fourteen minutes left.
 [ Q c1 + ]  [ Q f1 ] , [ Q x f1 # ]  the end of the game his [ h3 ] ended up killing him.
 [ d5 ] , [ B b5 + ]  I'm not sure how to feel about this. On the one hand it invites Black to bottle up his forces with 9...[ c6 ] making development slightly more difficult. On the other hand it doesn't accomplish a whole lot and Black's QN frequently ends up aiding on the kingside via [ d7 ] anyway so this check may not accomplish much of anything.
 [ d3 + ]  [ N x d3 ]  [ R x d3 ]  [ K x d3 ] , [ K f2 ]  With [ K f2 ] Black takes control of the promotion squares of both passed pawns. White cannot stop the two potential Qs and resigned here.
 [ B g4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ B x f3 ] , [ R x f3 ]  The exchange gives white the half open file he wanted.
 [ N f x e5 ]  [ Q c7 ] , [ N x c6 + ]  Now black has a choice. He can sac the knight...or he can sac the queen...neither of which prolongs it very far. As I said I tend to be way too direct most of the time so to finish off with the pieces so well co-ordinated was very pleasing ;-)
 [ f6 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ B d2 ] , [ B e6 ]  Alternative variation: 14... [ c6 ] 15. [ N c5 ] (15. [ a4 ] [ a5 ] 16. [ N c5 ] [ K h8 ] 17. [ [ h3 ] ] [ [ f5 ] ] 18. [ R e1 ] [ R e5 ] 19.

 [ d3 ] , [ B c5 ]  another good developing move
 [ e4 ] , [ c5 ]  Yet another Sicilian! I had 5 White games in this tournament and four of my opponent chose the Sicilian (my opponent in round 7 chose the French).
 [ K x c6 ]  [ e3 ] , [ K x c7 ]  ...and I certainly anticipated that my opponent would finally remove my doubled pawns...
 [ e5 ]  [ e4 ] , [ f4 ]  My knight is in trouble again. So it needs to move. It would have probably have been better to retreat it...
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ N c6 ]  Protecting the pawn.
 [ N f3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ] , [ N c3 ]  So far pretty standard. Nothing too unusual. Not a lot of threats but not many weaknesses.
 [ K b8 ] , [ B a5 ]  Bringing my pieces to the king with tempo
 [ B b4 ]  [ N g e2 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ a4 ] , [ N d7 ]  Obviously my opponent has decided not to take the pawns. So now after say 13.[ a x b5 ] [ c x b5 ] 14.[ b x [ c4 ] ] [ b x [ c4 ] ] Black's pawn on [ c4 ] is isolated and consequently weak.
 [ R x e1 ]  [ B x e1 ]  [ K x e1 ]  [ R e8 + ]  [ K f1 ]  [ B x d3 + ] , [ K f2 ]  continue the pain
 [ R f d3 ]  [ K c6 ]  [ R d3 d5 ]  [ b6 ]  [ K f2 ] , [ R e4 ]  Black must replace the wall that keeps white's king at bay.
 [ N f6 ]  [ B e2 ] , [ R f8 ]  16. ..... [ R f8 ] - black looks OK here he is fully developed and just needs to play a move like [ K c7 ] and then try and take advantage of white's lack of development - he still needs to move out his [ c1 ] bishop to prepare castling long.
 [ c x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ] , [ e5 ]  The center has been fixed now and the structure is something similar to the French but slightly better for Black because his LSB isn't hemmed in by its own pawns.
 [ N d2 ] , [ g4 ]  threatening to open the columns in front of white's king
 [ d3 ] , [ d6 ]  As White hasn't played 7.[ d4 ] I might have chosen 7...[ d5 ] had I been playing the Black pieces.
 [ N x h1 ] , [ O-O-O ]  Bingo. He can't preserve the Knight either.
 [ g5 ] , [ Q x a8 ]  take the rook
 [ R d c1 ]  [ g6 ]  [ R c5 ] , [ Q e2 ]  Another good move. This one allows the queen to support the d pawn all the way to d1.
 [ B e7 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ B g4 ]  ! now I must trade dsb but this shouldn't be a problem for me in the long run.
 [ B d7 ]  [ f4 ]  [ B c8 ]  [ f5 ]  [ B d7 ] , [ B h5 ]  Setting up the final breakthrough.
 [ B x e5 ]  [ N c a6 ]  [ R d7 ] , [ N b8 ]  losing move. The combination that happens wins two pawns of me
 [ N b3 ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ R x e8 + ]  [ Q x e8 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ Q e1 + ]  [ B f1 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ B d2 ]  [ Q e7 ] , [ R e1 ]  White wishes to force black's queen away.
 [ K g6 ]  [ B g3 ] , [ R b8 + ]  I made a new plan:To force the king into a corner.
 [ B x h7 ]  [ R x d8 + ]  [ K f7 ]  [ R x g8 ]  [ B x g8 ] , [ f4 ]  Vital to keep a passed pawn on this side of the board as well as the potential for one on the other side...
 [ B b4 ]  [ Q e3 ] , [ O-O ]  I hasten to connect my Rooks and seize the center.
 [ N x d4 ] , [ B b4 ]  i still don't understand this move. why he didn't eat it. anyway better for me.
 [ O-O ]  [ O-O ] , [ N c6 ]  This is what I was hoping for in postponing the recapture.
 [ R e1 ] , [ R f e8 ]  Just in case.
 [ N c6 ]  [ Q d5 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ B g5 ]  Pinning down the knight for now. Allowing me one more move at least before I must decide where to put my queen.
 [ R a d1 ] , [ N b4 ]  Joe: I am now thinking along the line of [ B a3 ] to pin your N. Ken: a worthwhile thought I've been trying to decide what I will do if you do that Joe: Yes I'm thinking along the same lines of how you'd answer which is why I'm cautious. It's like I don't know but then try to do some difficult math. I would like to also get my Nd2-[ g3 ] at some point. But if I were to play [ N f1 ] if I did that right away I'd be worried about tying down the Knight. There is so much to think about that nothing is easy. But I like positions that are difficult to figure out like this.
 [ R h3 ]  [ R f2 x f3 ]  [ R f x f3 + ]  [ R x f3 ] , [ R x h4 ]  All this for just ONE PAWN?!?!?!? But now the endgame is interesting and in theory won for black. But... how to get to it?
 [ e5 ]  [ R x d8 ]  [ R x d8 ]  [ f x e5 ]  [ B x e5 ]  [ R d1 ]  [ R x d1 ] , [ N x d1 ]  This is the position I was playing for. White has the better pawn structure on the queenside where the Black bishop can't touch his pawns. An important factor is that the Black bishop is the wrong color for his h-pawn and cannot control the queening square. If some type of mutual zugzwang position is reached on the kingside White has two pawn moves a2-[ a3 ] & a3-[ a4 ] on the queenside. White has the better king position. However with pawns on both sides of the board the long reaching bishop is probably the better minor piece.
 [ K f4 ]  [ R x a4 + ] , [ K f3 ]  White must hold out for a stalemate which of course cannot be forced.
 [ Q x d4 ] , [ N e6 ]  Carl decides to attack my Queen. But it does not matter as I will exchange. Liquidating is to my benefit since I'm an entire piece up.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ d4 ]  Scotch game considered fairly moribund until revivified somewhat late last century by Harry Kasparov.
 [ R f3 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ N g3 ]  [ N a6 ]  [ N h1 ]  [ Q c5 ]  [ R g3 ]  [ Q b4 ] , [ Q e2 ]  Maybe it would be better to exchange Queens and eliminate most of the pressure?
 [ c3 ]  [ b x c3 ]  [ K c2 ]  [ g6 ] , [ h4 ]  At this point white resigned. Although he had managed to free his king moving it would let me promote my c-pawn with victory sure to follow. Thank you for reading this. Comments are welcome.
 [ B d5 ]  [ K b8 ]  [ K b6 ]  [ N d3 ]  [ K b5 ]  [ N f4 ]  [ B c6 ] , [ N e6 ]  Here I ceased scurrying about and accepted the draw.
 [ N x d4 ] , [ N x d4 ]  The most popular line in the Gameknot database is 8... [ Q h4 ] 9. [ g3 ] [ Q f6 ] 10. [ N x c6 ] [ b x c6 ] 11. [ f3 ] [ B c5 + ] 12. [ K g2 ] O-O 13. [ f x e4 ] [ f x e4 ] where White is up a piece for two pawns but Black has a dangerous looking attack. The game move is probably prioritising material; I have no idea which is better.
 [ N b d7 ]  [ B d3 ] , [ B d6 ]  i need another guard
 [ Q f1 ] , [ R f8 ]  Offering the h pawn for the f pawn and attacking chances.
 [ Q d5 ] , [ K e2 ]  Mistake Black has now a winning sequency
 [ R c8 ] , [ Q x c8 ]  He resigned after this.
 [ R e4 ]  [ R e3 ]  [ R x e3 ] , [ f x e3 ]  
 [ N f5 ] , [ N d4 ]  29. [ N x d4 ] would probably have drawn. The bishop is good for defending pawns but not much good for attacking as the two rooks and queen can always protect any white square. I was still trying to win and was after the f pawn but miscalculated
 [ e3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ d6 ] , [ N c3 ]  Duz-Hotimirski-Capablanca Moscow 1925 continued: 6. [ Q e2 ] [ N c6 ] 7. [ R d1 ] e5! 8. [ d x [ e5 ] ] [ d x [ e5 ] ] [Denker-Kavalek USA 1976] 9. Nc3=. If 6. [ e4 ] [ N b d7 ] 7. [ h3 ] [ c5 ] 8. [ c3 ] [ e5 ] 9. [ d x [ e5 ] ] [ d x [ e5 ] ] 10. [ a4 ] [ Q c7 ] 11. [ N a3 ] [ [ c4 ] ] advantage black. (ECO A48 p. 287 n. 10.) I think white could have played 6. [ [ c4 ] ] with a good spatial advantage.
 [ Q d6 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ Q x d5 ]  [ R h3 ]  [ Q x d4 + ] , [ B e3 ]  Developing another piece at the cost of a pawn.
 [ d6 ] , [ B c4 ]  A bit unusual the standard moves are [ d4 ] and [ N c3 ] after black's Nf6.
 [ B x b7 ] , [ R x b7 ]  White exchanges and now although materially is for the time being level I think White has a forced win from here. How?
 [ B d7 ]  [ O-O ] , [ O-O-O ]  different wings castled king's and we will both be attacking on the king's wing theoretically my king is more exposed to danger so I have to grab the initiative and outplay my opponent
 [ d5 ]  [ c4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ c6 ]  [ d5 ] to open up c on black
 [ a4 ] , [ R f d1 ]  The end is in sight.
 [ Q d7 ] , [ R c4 ]  Doubling rooks on the only open semi-file for white.
 [ e x d5 ]  [ e x f4 ] , [ d3 ]  Black could force a loss of the right to castle right now via Qh4+. Actually I find this move a bit strange since it locks the white bishop and perhaps that's the reason why this will be the first game in the gameknot DB with this moveorder. (I'll call it the stack variation ;D)
 [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ e6 ]  I was expecting [ d6 ] but [ e6 ] is also fine.
 [ R x a6 ]  [ b4 ]  [ K e4 ]  [ f5 + ]  [ K e5 ]  [ R e7 + ] , [ K f6 ]  the move of a madman: White is seriously considering a mate attempt...
 [ N x c3 ] , [ R d8 ]  (?) The rook gets out of the way but to the wrong square! Black needed [ d8 ] for the king.
 [ N g e7 ] , [ e x d6 ]  this will clear the e file for me and also isolate his -
 [ B f8 ] , [ B d3 ]  Another full question mark worthy move here. Still oblivious to the wisdom of [ B f3 ] I hope to reinforce the queenside instead of going through with my original plan. Again at that point I saw that [ h3 ] was dumb but didn't think of [ B f3 ] at the time.
 [ N c4 ]  [ K e7 ] , [ B f3 ]  The point of 15. [ B e2 ] and ideally trying to coordinate my pieces with a future [ N a5 ] to win the *other* c-pawn if given the chance.
 [ N x f2 ] , [ K x f2 ]  Finally down in material. At the beginning of the game being down a point or two is not so much an issue as it now as the game goes into the end. To me anyway. In some gambit it is common to be down in material and either get it back or have some positional advantage. Here is lost my lead and in a positional quagmire.
 [ R e2 ]  [ R h1 ] , [ R f2 ]  Step four: force White to choose what he is going to take.
 [ N b2 ] , [ N f3 ]  Pratically forced because of what comes next
 [ e x d6 ]  [ Q x d6 ]  [ d x e6 ] , [ Q x e6 + ]  I thought Black might take my queen outright but since the queen is in front of the king I decided to make the best of this situation.
 [ O-O ]  [ B g7 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ O-O ] , [ B x d5 ]  ? An unusual choice by me. I usually prefer to keep my Bs and swap off Ns. It removes the defender of [ e7 ] but I don't think it is justified for tactical or strategic reasons - only material.
 [ N f2 + ]  [ K h4 ]  [ K e4 ]  [ K g3 ]  [ N d1 ]  [ K g4 ]  [ N f2 + ] , [ K g3 ]  and here White forces a least a draw...
 [ d3 ]  [ f6 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ e5 ] , [ N d5 ]  White matches my aggression.

 [ N c3 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ h3 ]  [ B h5 ] , [ g4 ]  10. [ g4 ] - this is recommended in the World DB but it does leave Henry a little draughty.
 [ B b2 ] , [ B a6 ]  Improves the bishop a bit but I think this is also a mistake. Better is probably [ R c8 ] or [ Q e7 ] to prepare c5. However this stops Nb5.
 [ O-O ]  [ h3 ] , [ N b3 ]  :)
 [ B d1 ] , [ N f6 ]  improving the position of the knight and directly threatening the knight on e4. So white has to move it.
 [ R b g8 ]  [ Q h5 + ]  [ R h7 ] , [ Q x h7 # ]  One of my best game endgames against a better player Jeremy Ross
 [ N f6 ] , [ c3 ]  Standard moves. Because the early development of the QB in this system weakens the dark squares at home somewhat ...[ Q b6 ] remains a thematic black move to challenge them (as well in similar opening lines of the d4/[ c4 ] complex). Usually white replies with [ Q b3 ] and an early queen-trade ensues. Not to Nosferatu's taste. Too vegetarian.
 [ h x g5 ]  [ h x g5 ]  [ R x h7 + ]  [ N x h7 ]  [ R h1 ]  [ K h8 ]  [ R h6 ]  [ Q f7 ]  [ B d1 ]  [ R g8 ] , [ Q b3 ]  A: As all of black's pieces are more or less engaged on the kingside the queen undertakes a promenade on the queen side not for sightseeing but to grab anything insufficently protected. This material gain by no means accidental is the logical consequence of persistent initiative. which kept black from protecting all of his weak points.
 [ K h7 ] , [ K b1 ]  black is so tied down that any move will let white walk right in the door.
 [ K x b7 ]  [ K e7 ]  [ K x a6 ]  [ K d7 ]  [ K b6 ]  [ K c8 ]  [ B f4 ] , [ K d7 ]  Now the path is clear and it's just a matter of time.
 [ Q h5 ]  [ B x d4 ] , [ B x h6 ]  Another mistake here. A meaningless tactic that will accomplish nothing.
 [ R x c7 ]  [ N x c7 ]  [ R b8 ]  [ N a6 ]  [ R b6 ]  [ N c5 ] , [ N e4 ]  Rook endgames can often be salvaged a pawn down but not against two queenside connected passed pawns
 [ B d3 ]  [ N b d7 ]  [ Q c2 ] , [ Q c7 ]  9. ........... [ Q [ c7 ] ] - out comes Glenda - hopefully this move to [ c7 ] is better judged than last time I played black - here she can eye up [ h2 ] and there is always the possibility of putting a horsie on g4.
 [ R b4 ] , [ N c6 ]  White moves his rook down to [ b4 ] and I move my knight to [ c6 ] and have the rook under attack again. White's knight is still at [ c7 ] attacking my [ a8 ] rook but this can be recaptured by the [ b8 ] rook.
 [ N x d4 ]  [ a6 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ N b d7 ]  [ b3 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N c2 ]  [ Q e7 ] , [ f3 ]  I set up a bind which I cannot remember the name of at this time.
 [ a3 ]  [ N f5 ]  [ b4 ]  [ c x b4 ] , [ c x b4 ]  Correct.
 [ R e8 ] , [ a3 ]  Seem my Bishop is annoying !
 [ Q x e7 ]  [ R d8 ] , [ h3 ]  At this point I was ready to just bring everything to the game. I hope if anyone has read this you enjoyed it! It was a fun game to play so I thought I'd share it. Any comments or suggestions are welcome.
 [ R d1 ] , [ N x b3 ]  Funnily I trheat [ N x d4 ] since the WR has to cover the back rank.
 [ B b5 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ B d6 ]  preventing [ N e5 ]  [ O-O ] , [ B d7 ]  breaking the pin and making way for queenside castle if neccesary
 [ N g5 + ]  [ K g2 ]  [ R c8 ]  [ h4 ] , [ N x f3 ]  ?? here is all the game! an hopless trade
 [ c5 ]  [ R d7 ]  [ c x b6 ]  [ a x b6 ]  [ B a4 ] , [ R d6 ]  I lost some of my advantage as well as tempo. However I still had the edge if albeit slight.
 [ Q x d6 ]  [ N f4 ] , [ N f6 ]  There still isn't much Black can do in this position so I felt better knowing that I was the one who had the attacking chances.
 [ d x e4 ] , [ Q x e4 ]  After the exchange white is left with a backward pawn on the half-open d file. This will become the focus for an attack.
 [ f4 ] , [ K h5 ]  moved there to stop on Pawn moving whilst my Bishop is stopping the other one
 [ R x c3 ]  [ b x c3 ] , [ B f6 ]  Preventing the exchange.
 [ Q x b7 ]  [ R d8 ]  [ R d1 ] , [ B x d1 ]  Now material is in Black's favor and his attack still rages.
 [ K d2 ] , [ Q x h3 ]  This was definitely a mistake but I have no real means of capitalizing any more than gxh5.
 [ B b2 ] , [ R b8 ]  It's the natural move to place the rook on the open column plus I have the opportunity to temporarily sacrifice a quality to win it back plus a pawn as the [ c3 ] pawn is under-defended
 [ B d3 ]  [ B h6 ] , [ h3 ]  Now it is decision time
 [ R x f2 ]  [ B x e6 + ]  [ R f7 ]  [ B x f7 + ]  [ K x f7 ]  [ Q f2 + ]  [ Q f6 ]  [ Q x c5 ]  [ Q a1 + ]  [ Q g1 ]  [ Q x g1 + ] , [ K x g1 ]  atleast here its over
 [ R g6 ]  [ Q d6 + ] , [ R c7 ]  38. ........ [ R c7 ] - forced to avoid losing further wood.
 [ N b x d7 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ N g e2 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ B d6 ] , [ B d2 ]  I would automatically choose [ f3 ] here. But due to recent Blitz games I am now having the habit of preparing the [ B c1 ] to rapidly enter the king-side zone whenever Black chooses to attack taking advantage of the [ e4 ] support position.
 [ N b3 ]  [ Q f7 ]  [ R c3 ]  [ R b c8 ] , [ R f c1 ]  28. [ R f c1 ] - this doubling up becomes a battering ram on the c file.
 [ N x c3 ] , [ b x c3 ]  Centre dominated strong structure beginning to attack
 [ N c3 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ] , [ d4 ]  White challenges Black's central development
 [ N h4 ]  [ N x h4 ]  [ Q x h4 ] , [ g5 ]  I didn't know what Nathan intended to do here. I thought that he might try to get a passed pawn and then perhaps protect with his Bg2.
 [ B b3 ] , [ B d7 ]  targeting a4.
 [ N c3 ] , [ N d7 ]  And again. Black is perhaps preparing to play ...[ c5 ] but his Bishop belongs on [ d7 ] not his Knight. Now Black requires at least two moves to develop another piece.
 [ R x c2 ] , [ g5 # ]  Overall black extremely well. I would say like a 1000 rated player. But @knightrider62: The lesson to be learned is "Don't give things away". There were mistakes that lost material and by doing so it enabled me to force a win. So like I said in a previous annotation always judge carefully and don't leave your pieces attacked. If those mistakes weren't made I think the game would've sooner or later ended in a draw.
 [ N e4 ] , [ N e3 ]  A major blunder on my part that my opponent failed to capitalize on. An exchange of queens now guarantees the loss of my knight while her knight is perfectly safe after the exchange.
 [ N x d4 ] , [ e6 ]  This variation was a welcome change from the typical kingside fianchetto defenses which are mostly popular at club level. Here Black intends to deploy his dark-squared bishop along the a3-[ f8 ] diagonal.
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ g6 ]  Signalling Black's intention to play the Accelerated Dragon
 [ N b1 ]  [ h6 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ N d2 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ N e4 ] , [ h5 ]  Maybe [ f5 ] was better as it was a little less loosening.
 [ N d f6 ]  [ N f e5 ] , [ B d7 ]  Finally Black has done something now he is trying to play through [ B e8 ] and [ g5 ] advance. Also he has a3-[ f8 ] diagonal.
 [ N b d7 ]  [ b4 ]  [ B b6 ]  [ Q e2 ]  [ a5 ] , [ B x f6 ]  no way i am going to take that lying down
 [ d x c3 ]  [ b x c3 ]  [ R x c3 ]  [ R x b7 ]  [ R x c2 ] , [ Q d8 + ]  So knowing that I play this. And I actually miscalculated. Like with Jack Stockel when I was a R and two pawns behind. To make matters worse he was very close to promoting a pawn. However he took another pawn which is what sealed his fate as it enabled me to pull a swindle. I thought the same thing happened in that black underestimated white and that this move was a mate in one. What I forgot however is that he moved his h pawn so instead of this being a mate he can and does escape with 26...Kh7.
 [ b5 ] , [ N e5 ]  This was the idea behind [ N c4 ] to win Black's K-side pawns. But my previous blunder hanging two pawns had me pretty depressed at this point; I was just about ready to resign.
 [ B f4 ] , [ B c5 ]  Pins the f pawn. Looking at it now I think perhaps [ N e4 ] would be stronger
 [ K e8 ] , [ B f4 ]  Again not the strongest setup for white. A more common line is: 10.[ N c3 ] [ N e7 ] 11.[ N d4 ] [ N g6 ] 12.[ N e4 ] [ B e7 ] 13.[ R e1 ] [ c5 ] 14.[ N b3 ] [ b6 ] 15.[ N f6 + ] (15...[ g x f6 ] 16.[ g x f6 ] then [ f x e7 ] winning piece back) [ K f8 ] 16.[ N d5 ] [ B d8 ] 17.[ N d2 ] [ c6 ] 18.[ N e3 ] when Black appears to be tangled up but is fine.
 [ Q x d7 ] , [ B x f6 ]  Sacrificing that bishop here was a bold move. I did in full confidence of winning the game with a breakthrough my opponent has no chance to stop... when failing to go on with it this exchange could have proven itself to be a key error. However there are some circumstences that save the situation and give a good ground for this move. Black cannot take back with the g-pawn because that closes up his own bishop badly. Moreover after 16.[ B x f6 ] he has to make another move to make that bishop active and to give way to his f-pawn. What else then? 15.[ Q e2 ] for attacking [ a6 ] while giving way to the king-rook to occupy the d-file... or 15.[ K h1 ] doing the inevitable.
 [ Q b7 ]  [ b4 ]  [ N a4 ]  [ N x a4 ] , [ b x a4 ]  Each move opens up the position. It is very double-edged but White has the initiative and doesn't let it go.
 [ K e8 ]  [ Q g7 ]  [ K d8 ]  [ Q f7 ]  [ K c8 ]  [ Q e7 ]  [ K b8 ]  [ Q d7 ]  [ K a8 ] , [ N c5 ]  ...and my opponent let this game time out as the next move would be checkmate.
 [ Q a5 + ]  [ K b2 ]  [ Q a1 + ]  [ K x c2 ]  [ Q c1 + ]  [ K x b3 ]  [ R d3 + ] , [ K b4 ]  Mate in two.
 [ B d4 ] , [ N c5 ]  Defends the passed pawn and prepares to draw out the black LSB.
 [ c3 ]  [ B a5 ]  [ N b d2 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ b4 ] , [ B b6 ]  black now achieved a powerful twin boom attack potential on the two diagonals directed at my king's castle. He is both tactical and a strategist I believed.
 [ K d7 ] , [ R h g1 ]  aiming for g7...
 [ R f7 ] , [ B g6 ]  ? Wrong move. Full retreat was better.
 [ B x g5 ]  [ f x g5 ]  [ e5 ]  [ R h4 ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ R f6 ]  [ K g7 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N e5 ] , [ Q h3 ]  Was thinking of dropping queen to [ c3 ] as the diagonal to the king would be full of my pieces handy for discovered checks...
 [ R b1 ]  [ R x d4 ]  [ Q h5 ] , [ R a d8 ]  never underestimate the power of controlling the center. Black threatens to play ...[ R d5 ]  [ R b7 ]  [ g6 ]  [ Q c5 ] , [ R d4 d1 ]  wins the rook because of the threat of a back rank mate
 [ N b d2 ]  [ B d6 ] , [ O-O ]  white completes his own development.
 [ e5 ]  [ f4 ] , [ N c6 ]  osidant declines my King's Gambit choosing instead to defend his e-pawn.
 [ K x h7 ] , [ d4 + ]  d4! discovered check wins bishop and as i played 12.[ d3 ] my [ c1 ] dark-squared bishop has suddenly got involved.
 [ e x f6 ]  [ e ]  [ p ] , [ R x f6 ]  [ B x h7 ] is now no longer too great and I've got a little bit of space on the kingside
 [ g3 ] , [ d3 ]  41. ….. [ d3 ] - pawn push!
 [ N c1 ]  [ g4 ]  [ h x g4 ]  [ N g5 ]  [ B e2 ] , [ N x g4 ]  Computer analysis afterwards showed -4.40 for White in this position. My gut feeling told me to tip over the King and pay respect for the very good play by my opponent. White can just wait for something like Rf6-[ R h6 ] mate or loose material with a depressing endgame.
 [ K x d8 ]  [ N g5 ]  [ B e6 ] , [ N x e4 ]  Now i have a material advantage to go with my positional advantage. If I can develop quickly I can harass the exposed Black King.
 [ N c6 ]  [ O-O ] , [ a6 ]  Maybe too slow. It prevents Nc3-[ b5 ] but at this point White plan is playing on king side.
 [ N a6 ] , [ Q a4 + ]  Now I get a some clarity and threaten to win a pawn.
 [ B x c2 ]  [ g4 ] , [ B a4 ]  I'm preparing to regain my queen well at this moment.
 [ B e4 ] , [ Q g3 ]  I like P[ f3 ] or maybe Pg3. White has to do something to prevent QxP[ g2 # ] but if the black queen can be persuaded to leave the g file white could do to black the same. Even better--32. RcxPd3. BxR 33. RxB. If RxR [ Q b8 + ] leads to 35. Q[ x R d8 # ] (after interposition). QxR and QxP[ g7 # ] (with that bishop tucked in the [ a1 ] pocket covering).
 [ Q g2 + ] , [ K c3 ]  Aha my bet was: now what? Black must move the queen again in order to make her harmful but I can take and check in one move.
 [ B x f6 ]  [ B g5 ] , [ B x f3 ]  Both White and Black have been making very large mistakes here. Black now could have taken with the pawn. Perhaps White was simply employing what Robin Shaw coined as 'blufftics ' and Black thought that there was a trap set for him in case he took with the pawn. In the end one can only look at the board and wonder what was going on.
 [ K d2 ] , [ b2 ]  Nice and elegant. After all both sides' mistakes my first plan succeded at last...
 [ N x e4 ] , [ d5 ]  White's position is now unstable. I suspect the correct choice is to preserve the knights to harass Black's queen.
 [ B d6 ] , [ g4 ]  Here we are! 7.[ g4 ] is the very aggressive Shabalov attack introduced by Alexander Shabalov in the first 90's. Of course this is more powerful in fast games because of the surprise effect. The main idea is that after the sacrifice of the pawn (that in some cases can be token back) white can make a strong attack with the rook on the open g column so black must be very carefull as we will see with an example in the next comment. If the black decides to not take the pawn white has gained some space and has the possibility of playing g4-[ g5 ] attacking the knight.
 [ Q x d6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ R b7 ] , [ Q a5 + ]  Now that I look back at this fresh I see that a one-piece counter-attack is rarely effective. In this case it wasn't. He's a move behind and can't gain quite regain the tempo.
 [ O-O-O ]  [ B d6 ] , [ g3 ]  Now I'm in lots of trouble. There's the blunt threat of [ B d3 ] that attacks the queen and the pawn on h7. But worse is Bg2. I''m not going to be able to stop [ d5 ] and that's when the game falls apart for me.
 [ N x d5 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ Q e2 ]  [ N x d3 + ]  [ Q x d3 ] , [ c5 ]  What was wrong with 23...Qxd5? 24...[ c5 ] is then a real threat.
 [ N f4 ] , [ d4 ]  I moved this piece out to start my defensive scheme I usually have.
 [ B x b8 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B x d6 ] , [ O-O ]  Castling is all well and good but this comes far too late to be useful. Black is lost but there are a few more comments I'll make through the end.
 [ R x b6 ]  [ a x b6 ] , [ K c4 ]  Targeting the b-pawn
 [ R b1 ] , [ a5 ]  Some technique: now black can't advance the pawn or [ K c3 ] wins it for free.
 [ N c6 ]  [ B e3 ] , [ Q c7 ]  Alternative variation: 9...[ Q b6 ] [ I had expected ]
 [ N e3 ]  [ K g6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ B x e3 + ]  [ K x e3 ]  [ b x c4 ]  [ K d4 ]  [ f5 ]  [ e x f6 ]  [ e ]  [ p ]  [ K x f6 ]  [ K e4 + ] , [ K e7 ]  I chose this as I thought any change I may have had would lie in getting over to the other side of the board but I am clearly lost by this point and should have resigned
 [ N x e5 ] , [ d x e5 ]  25. [ d x e5 ] - pawn I choose you! Just look at those passers! Black is really going to be hemmed in. Strange that for once it is my opponent that is passive. Usually it is me that ends up in a bad position in the middlegame and has to fight it out. This is most refreshing!
 [ h5 ] , [ R b7 ]  harassing Black's Q for want of anything better to do. White's plan at this point is merely to hassle Black as much as he can.
 [ R e4 ] , [ Q d7 + ]  now if [ K h4 ] [ R h2 + + ] and [ K f4 ] [ g5 + ] [ K e3 ] ([ K e5 ] [ R e8 + ] [ Q e6 ] [ Q x e6 + ] and white is lost) [ Q d2 + + ]  [ K f4 ]  [ g5 + ]  [ K e3 ] , [ Q d2 # ]  
 [ N d2 ] , [ g6 ]  ? I simply don't see a purpose to this move. It needlessly weakens the Black King's position when Black *should* be focusing on getting all his pieces out. When you're behind in material it is absolutely critical to make every move count and make more use of the pieces you *do* have.
 [ Q x h4 ] , [ Q x b7 ]  
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ B c4 ]  My now usual Italian opening (if black responds in the usual way).
 [ K h1 ] , [ Q a6 ]  White unpinned the knight on [ d4 ] and black seizes an opportunity to fork the rook on [ f1 ] and the pawn on a4. Note that I don't plan on playing [ B x a4 ] any time soon since that bishop would be pinned and easily won by white with b3.
 [ B g2 ] , [ e3 ]  White cannot take the pawn because I win a tempo attacking his queen.
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B b4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ c5 ] , [ B d2 ]  It is not out of any desire to avoid early complications that Nezhmetdinov avoids the sharpest line approved by theory namely 5.[ a3 ] [ B x c3 + ] (possibly I would have tried 5...[ B a5 ] as in my game with Robert Fischer at 1960 Leipzig Olympiad) 6.[ b x c3 ] [ N e7 ] 7.[ Q g4 ] [ c x d4 ] with very complex play. The old move chosen by White does not have a very good reputation but he had had a number of fine wins with it. One should note that as a rule the talented master did not try for a 'theoretical advantage'. He was normally interested in getting a tense and intresting position in which one could just play chess.
 [ g5 ]  [ R h f3 ] , [ R a8 ]  He takes advantage of my rush to clear my congested position to pursue an attack on the a file.
 [ R f1 ]  [ g x f4 ]  [ g x f4 ] , [ N x f4 ]  Now if I take his knight he takes my knight and material is equal so I try a desperado take with my knight.
 [ g x f6 ] , [ R f3 ]  Black's [ g7 ] pawn takes my [ f6 ] pawn and doubles up his pawns on f file. I move rook to [ f3 ] in order to attack knight at d3. Whilst also threatening pawn at f6.
 [ e x d6 ] , [ B f5 ]  THIS in between move doesn't work (or at least shouldn't have). White can play 9.[ d x e7 ] and will be better in the resulting game. However Kim misses this move.
 [ N g4 ]  [ h3 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ B d4 ]  [ f6 ]  [ c3 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ N x f6 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ a5 ]  [ c4 ]  [ N b4 ]  [ B d4 ]  [ R f8 ]  [ N h7 ]  [ R e8 + ]  [ K f3 ] , [ N c6 ]  This move was the turningpoint in the game.. I go two pawns up and force black into making a tactical blunder that earnns me position and a bishop
 [ N f6 ] , [ B e3 ]  Why not [ f5 ] at once? Of course he wants to keep the tension but this move just helps me:
 [ R g2 ] , [ Q x g2 # ]  
 [ N f6 ] , [ O-O ]  Still mainline. Black attacked white's center pawn on [ e4 ] and white leaves it en prise because it's a "poison pawn" as they say. If black takes it bad stuff will ensue for black.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ N f6 ]  The Petroff defence.
 [ d4 ] , [ R x h7 + ]  Here he has now made a fair exchange of Rook and Bishop for Rook and knight. Due to the fact that I am ahead I have no worries at this point.
 [ Q x e3 ]  [ Q x e3 ]  [ R x e3 ] , [ c2 ]  the end...
 [ B b7 ]  [ Q f2 ]  [ R c8 ]  [ R d3 ] , [ N c5 ]  Black's counter-attack gets going. I've decided that castling is more risky than leaving the K in its central position surrounded by pawns and the central [ B e7 ]  [ R g3 ] , [ b4 ]  hoping that the N won't come to [ d5 ] in the classic positional sac (one doesn't really need to work it out: it nearly always works!) but will instead interfere with White's defence of [ c2 ]  [ e4 ] , [ N c6 ]  Warning: this gme times out right when it's getting good. It's a team match and I am playing black. White opens with the Open Game and I reply with the Nimzovich Defense.
 [ N d5 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N x b4 ] , [ N x b4 ]  6. .... [ N x b4 ] - after getting rid of a potential pin on my [ c3 ] knight by exchanging it for his bishop it seems it is gonna allow one pesky knight into my position. I kick the knight back though on the next turn.
 [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ e5 ] , [ N b3 ]  This is considered even worse than 6. [ N f3 ] after which Black's best move is 6...[ h6 ] making sure White won't get an easy grip on d5. But why is such a natural retreat frowned upon so severely? It's very common in many other Sicilian lines where White usually gets good play. The following moves by Black should shed some light on why this move is considered very weak probably worse is only 6. [ N x c6 ] after which Black gets a very game because he will play [ d5 ] in good conditions.
 [ f4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ B b2 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ B x d4 ]  [ Q e7 ]  [ R f3 ] , [ f6 ]  17. .... [ f6 ] - to screen out the white dsb's attack down the a1-[ h8 ] diagonal.
 [ N c6 ]  [ O-O ] , [ Q a5 ]  Not a bad idea. If Black can steal the initiative he can control the game.
 [ N d2 ]  [ B x e2 ] , [ Q x e2 ]  11. [ Q x e2 ] - bishop trade.
 [ B x c3 ] , [ B x c3 ]  White has a clear advantage now. He's nearly completed his develpoment and has an akward pin on the [ f6 ] knight.
 [ e6 ] , [ a x b5 ]  Pawn Trade.
 [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ] , [ d6 ]  we learned from earlier experience that this is the best way to go after Nc3... my preferred [ e6 ] [ N e7 ] 0-0 to prepare [ d5 ] will soon fail in the absence of a6... maybe I should incorporate [ a6 ] somewhere in this variation...
 [ Q x d8 ] , [ R a x d8 ]  In hindsight I should have taken back with the bishop because he can take my knight and double up my pawns on the kingside
 [ c4 ]  [ K a2 ] , [ c x b3 + ]  There is only one square where the king is safe. I did not found a checkmate for this continuation but the advantage of the Black camp is too strong to do something great. After 31. [ K b2 ] we have: 31. [ K b2 ] [ R c2 + ] 32. [ K a3 ] [ B f8 + ] 33. [ B e7 ] [ B x e7 # ] If they play 32. [ K a1 ] 32. ... [ b2 + ] may give you everything white camp has.
 [ N e8 ]  [ Q e3 ] , [ f6 ]  12. ....... [ f6 ] - I try to drive off that enemy bishop but he moves to h6.
 [ N e7 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N c3 ] , [ c6 ]  The best plan for black know at this time was suggested several years before this match by Louis Paulsen. He played 12. ... [ c5 ] then [ B c7 ] [ a6 ] and [ b5 ] advancing pawns of the Queen's side. But Steinitz had its own idea. The 1st game of this match was played in the similar way and was won by Anderssen. But after this game Steinitz had to revise his approach.
 [ B x f4 ]  [ e x f4 ] , [ N g5 ]  I like 8.[ B e2 ] better; this doesn't serve much of a purpose and loses a move.
 [ a6 ] , [ B e2 ]  Having established his pawn structure White calmly completes his development before launching operations. The direction of those operations will depend on where Black exposes weaknesses in his defences. For example White could develop his B to [ e3 ] and Q to [ d2 ] castle queenside and launch the g-pawn at a castled king (the English Attack) or alternatively White may castle kingside and exploit the hole at [ b6 ] with B[ e3 ] and Na4. The pawn on [ c4 ] encourages this approach.
 [ Q x d7 ] , [ d x c5 ]  and a pawn leaving material mathematically even.
 [ N h5 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N f4 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ N x e2 + ] , [ Q x e2 ]  11. [ Q x e2 ] - Fou Leblanc is traded off for one of black's knights.
 [ Q g2 ] , [ B x h4 ]  Now he plays it and although he does get a bit of an attack it doesn't really work because I can just trade queens.
 [ B f5 ]  [ N g3 ]  [ B g6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N d7 ] , [ B f4 ]  White has a nice development. Computer analysis shows that White has a small advantage.
 [ N e4 + ]  [ K d3 ] , [ c4 # ]  And checkmate. Usually my games tend to go on for quite a while this one was a lot different.It was amusing to finish a teamgame the same day as it started. Guess the moral of the story is: don't move the same minor piece 3 times for a pawn if it gives the other side attacking options.
 [ R d3 ]  [ N x a3 ] , [ K x a3 ]  While White moved his rook to [ d3 ] to supposedly protect the [ a3 ] bishop he instead took back with the king. This allows Black an extra check with [ Q d6 + ] [must analyze].
 [ N g4 ] , [ B f3 ]  Not at all surprised. Given how black captured she wants to get rid of his N one way or another. Since she already knew that black would see the threat this was part of her plan. That once he played 25...[ N g4 ] this was how she would respond. So although it was OTB I think it is still nonetheless a conditional move because under the condition that Karpov retreats this was white would do.
 [ B x g5 ] , [ Q d7 ]  But now I realize what's going on. Of course I'm protecting the Queen but there's a little more as he's threatening mate which I'm trying to hold off for the moment.
 [ B d4 ]  [ B f3 ] , [ B x c4 ]  There's no rush to take on [ e3 ] - the rook isn't going anywhere and the rest of White's position will fall off the board first.
 [ N g5 ]  [ N e3 ]  [ R d3 ] , [ N x d5 ]  66. .... [ N x [ d5 ] ] - I do take off the [ d5 ] pawn and now white has nothing to promote. Meanwhile I am now a clear two pawns up and determined to make it count.
 [ R g3 ]  [ N f8 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ R c1 ]  [ Q f5 ]  [ N c4 ]  [ Q d5 ]  [ N e3 ]  [ Q e4 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ g5 ]  [ N g4 ]  [ Q g6 ]  [ f4 ]  [ f5 ]  [ N e5 ] , [ N x e5 ]  A forced trade here.
 [ K x d2 ] , [ R d8 ]  here my opponent resigned but there are some very interesting lines to look at. if 14. [ R e1 ] thinking of pinning my queen 14...[ N e2 # ] if 14. [ K e1 ] ...[ N c2 + ] will still win the queen for a piece and a rook (my [ h8 ] rook) but actually i should still be able to win that bishop back if nothing else so white would be down very heavy material especially given that i'm a piece up to begin with. leaving the king where he is will lose the queen on discovered check so what about other king moves? if 14. [ K c1 ] 14. ...[ N e2 + ] now wins the queen and a big position. 14. [ K c3 ] on the other hand is more interesting: 14. [ K c3 ] [ N x e2 + ] 15. [ Q x e2 ] [ Q x e2 ] (if 15. [ K b4 ] ...[ a4 + ] 16. [ K b5 ] Qc6#) 16. [ R h e1 ] (looking to recoup the queen and survive) ...Rd3+! 17. [ K b4 ] [ a5 + ] 18. Kb5? Rd5+! 19. [ K a4 ] [ B c6 # ] the only other hope i can see is 14. [ B d3 ] after which i might for example take the pawn on [ g2 ] and again steer toward an endgame where i'm up material. all things considered this bishop move was probably best. i don't see an immediate way to ruin white after 14. Bd3. still it would be a move that's obstinately playing for a mistake. probably not a pleasant prospect.
 [ B x e3 ] , [ d x e3 ]  which castle to take? I do not want his knight protecting the pawn in front of the king so I choose the far castle
 [ e x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ] , [ N c3 ]  A small exchange
 [ Q b4 ] , [ N c7 ]  {Nakamura Polgar - 78%} (16...[ B d7 ] {Lagrave - 22%} Continuing to get the knight over to the queen side to aid in the defence. White doesn't take the hanging pawn since [ R c b8 ] would win his queen. The two black knights are covering the flight squares [ a6 ] and c6.
 [ Q x f4 ]  [ Q x f4 ] , [ R x f4 ]  as expected. This will be another draw.
 [ Q c2 ] , [ g6 ]  And this is another good one. The threat of [ B f5 ] forces the white to defend.
 [ B d2 ]  [ Q b5 ] , [ N x e5 ]  setting up the fork - will he fall for it? surely not!
 [ N b6 ] , [ K h1 ]  Playing almost as if he hadn't a care in the world... ;-)
 [ N f4 + ]  [ K g3 ] , [ R x d2 ]  now you wren't expecting that ... but as I'm now 3 ahead the quicker I can swap off the material the better. I've still got the awesome [ N e6 ] to come.
 [ R e2 ] , [ a5 ]  I move my rook over to protect my pawn at [ e5 ] and black moves his pawn to a5.
 [ e4 ] , [ R g8 + ]  attempting to prolong
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ c3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ B b4 + ]  [ N c3 ]  [ O-O ] , [ d5 ]  I seldom see this move from over the board against club players.
 [ R a1 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ R x a7 ] , [ R x h2 ]  31. ...... [ R x h2 ] - pawn trade.
 [ f x e3 ]  [ Q x c6 ] , [ N c3 ]  With my center compromised I decided to get back to the basics of development my pieces. I'm also thinking about a long side castle
 [ N d b5 ]  [ Q c6 ] , [ a3 ]  Continuing his attack which I also there. In fact I forgot this but the next few moves including the exchange on [ d5 ] is also what I studied.
 [ R b7 ]  [ R x b7 ] , [ K x b7 ]  White could now win with 61 P-K7.
 [ N c3 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ b5 ]  [ B d5 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ Q g4 ]  [ b4 ] , [ N f5 ]  Black must respond to imminent mate.
 [ K h4 ] , [ g3 + ]  He moves away but is threatened by a pawn. Only one move left...
 [ h6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ] , [ B a3 ]  there is no alternative for the bishop to stay on c1-[ h6 ] diagonal on [ a3 ] it have better option of development
 [ a3 ] , [ B x c3 ]  Now not 11. [ B x c3 ] Nxe3.
 [ h5 ] , [ b4 ]  A deep trap as will soon become apparent!
 [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ g6 ]  [ g3 ] , [ B g7 ]  The kings indian is a very flexible openning system. GMs often use it to steer way from varations that they do not wish to play.
 [ R d x e5 ] , [ Q d7 ]  No place to go to cover Re2+. I will have to lose another pawn (a2)
 [ c6 ] , [ O-O ]  Both sides develop. [ c6 ] is often played by Black to give an escape square to the queen after [ d4 ] and [ B d2 ] or less usually [ a3 ] and [ b4 ]  [ B g4 ] , [ B e2 ]  White just wastes a move in retreating the Bishop. [ R e1 ] [ h6 ] [ d4 ] or [ d3 ] were all better. White is just a tempo down on the main line now.
 [ g3 ] , [ e5 ]  So he's going for the fianchetto. I prefer a more direct attack of the center. Game on!
 [ N h3 ] , [ K g7 ]  Since center is possessed by white pawns why not attack on the side?
 [ B e3 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N e7 ]  [ c4 ]  [ N b c6 ]  [ Q a4 ] , [ a6 ]  This is the state-of-the-art treatment of this branch. The great protagonist of this variation Anatoly Karpov lost a theoretically important game versus Boris Gelfand in their 1995 FIDE World Chess Championchip Candidates Match after 9. … [ d x c4 ] and gave up the Caro-Kann for the rest of this match. But since then the black knights strengthened their stonghold. :-)
 [ B d7 ]  [ Q c2 ] , [ Q e8 ]  Now we see why castling was a liability for White! White's king would be a whole lot safer on [ e1 ] right now than it is now on g1. White's rook would also still be able to defend the pawn on [ h5 ] if it were still on h1.
 [ K c6 ] , [ R x f5 ]  
 [ g3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ B g2 ]  [ d6 ] , [ N g e2 ]  Many players also prefer [ N f3 ] and in fact is better in case you want a strong center but I will try a flank advance instead.
 [ c x d4 ] , [ N c3 ]  No one is paying attention to the hanging rook.
 [ B b7 ]  [ N b d2 ] , [ N d7 ]  not unclever: supporting [ c5 ] and covering square e5...
 [ N e7 ]  [ N b d2 ]  [ c x d4 ] , [ N x d4 ]  strange move... now black have [ c5 ] and after this 0-0-0 or [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ Q g3 ] , [ N c2 + ]  check and game over :-)
 [ Q g6 ]  [ h5 ] , [ Q f6 ]  Whites attack is getting dangerous but he hasn't castled. Will the king in the center backfire?
 [ K a6 ]  [ R c6 ]  [ K b7 ] , [ R x b6 + ]  I really don't NEED a knight now.
 [ c x d5 ] , [ N x d5 ]  
 [ g4 ]  [ a5 ]  [ h4 ] , [ c3 ]  my pawns are now unstoppable he cannot cover both sides.
 [ B g8 ] , [ R e1 ]  I move in for the kill.
 [ N g f6 ] , [ B e2 ]  I wanted to keep the f-file open for my rook I knew I would have some defending to do here but I also saw some opportunities to attack should I be given time to do so..
 [ Q x a1 + ]  [ K g2 ] , [ g6 ]  Like I said after taking I knew that I could stop the threat. What I like about the only move is that it's aggressive since Carl is forced to lose another tempo which gives me more opportunities.
 [ N f3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ c3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N b d2 ]  [ O-O ] , [ e4 ]  So I go with [ e4 ] for a change I think black is going to have difficulties developing his other pieces
 [ f x e3 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ Q g8 + ]  [ Q e8 ]  [ B f6 + ]  [ K d7 ] , [ Q x h7 + ]  Good job picking up that extra pawn before trading Queens.
 [ K h2 ] , [ R x h4 + ]  with this move I can even hold on to my knight
 [ B x e6 ] , [ d x e6 ]  now this is probably very silly... retrospectively how did I get there .. don't really wanna defend this pawn - it may actually be indefensible. together with being immovable. [ e7 ] is solid. I'll probably give it up as lost.. now I really need to get get at the pawns on 'a' file
 [ R c d1 ]  [ a5 ] , [ R d5 ]  White blunders. His back rank is completely undefended.
 [ N e2 + ]  [ K h1 ] , [ B x g2 + ]  A necessary sacrifice to get my queen in the game and create a possible mating sequence
 [ N g5 ]  [ h5 ] , [ R f3 ]  An inaccuracy. White should play [ f x g6 ] weakening Black's castled structure significantly before bringing the rook into the attack.
 [ R f1 ]  [ Q f4 + ]  [ K b1 ]  [ R d8 ]  [ Q e1 ] , [ K f8 ]  White was threatening 28.Qe7ch. But placing the Q and K on the same line as the rook on [ f1 ] does have its risks...
 [ d6 ]  [ Q g3 ] , [ B g4 ]  ?! The computer makes a positionally unsound move which allows good counterplay by white.
 [ Q g8 + ] , [ K h4 ]  blunder: [ K f4 ] was best. Black is now looking for draw.
 [ K e4 ]  [ K c6 ]  [ K d3 ] , [ K d5 ]  OK I win!
 [ e5 ] , [ d4 ]  Center game I feel that unless you're going to play some kind of gambit it's not great.
 [ B x f7 + ]  [ K g7 ]  [ B x h5 ] , [ Q x h5 ]  43. ...... [ Q x h5 ] - this B for N exchange was necessary to cut down black's mating attack. Henry is still not out of the woods yet though. So Glenda snuggles up to her other half everyone say aaah!
 [ K f1 ]  [ K f6 ]  [ R e4 ]  [ R f2 + ]  [ K g1 ]  [ e2 ]  [ R b1 ]  [ R f1 + ]  [ R x f1 ]  [ e x f1 = Q + ]  [ K x f1 ]  [ d2 ]  [ R f4 + ] , [ K g5 ]  After 47. Rg4+...[ K f5 ] and there are no more checks and the pawn queens.
 [ B g4 ] , [ B c6 ]  a further attempt at counterplay but I think ...[ R e8 ] was called for. I pondered forking Black's Rs with [ B d6 ] immediately but could seen no lasting advantage that way...
 [ e4 ] , [ e6 ]  The French defense -- which usually leads to closed lines.
 [ e x f6 + ] , [ K x f6 ]  White chooses to exchange.
 [ B x f3 ]  [ Q x f6 ]  [ g x f6 ] , [ g x f3 ]  all expected natural replies until here
 [ b3 ]  [ N g f6 ]  [ B b2 ]  [ e6 ] , [ O-O-O ]  An interesting progression: though white is a bit open on the queenside he still castles there. This shows that White is ready for a fight.
 [ c4 ] , [ f6 ]  One of us has to surrender a move.
 [ R f8 ]  [ R d1 ]  [ Q e3 ]  [ Q h4 ]  [ Q f4 ]  [ Q e1 ]  [ R a4 ]  [ Q c3 ]  [ R d4 ]  [ R x d4 ] , [ Q c1 + ]  Why did black move this?
 [ N d3 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ N x e5 ] , [ R x e5 ]  Loses a pawn it seems... Alternative variation: 28. [ B x e5 ] [ B a3 ] 29. [ R c2 ] [ R d c8 ] 30. [ R e3 ] [ B b4 ] [Ends up losing a pawn as well so possibly 28. [ R x e5 ] is better after all since only one rook is left on the board.]
 [ N d6 + ] , [ K f8 ]  3 moves to the end
 [ Q f8 + ]  [ K a7 ] , [ Q c5 + ]  Draw: three-fold repetition of position. A good result for Gerhard - very good result. For her part Jo stood up well to adversity to escape with a draw with the enemy hammering at the gates. Neither should beat themselves up too much over the missed chances at move 24. The correct defence for White would have been very hard to find; and to exploit the lapse Black would have had to contemplate sacrificing two of his remaining three pieces to achieve the checkmate. Fine game!
 [ B x e5 + ]  [ f x e5 ]  [ f6 ] , [ h5 ]  ! it blocks the king's penetration... it's incredible: with two rooks black is not able to harass the white king. Really? [ R a3 + ] [ K g4 ] [ R g8 + ] [ K f5 ] [ R f2 + ] Ke6...
 [ B g7 ]  [ Q x f6 ] , [ B x f6 ]  White has his queen swap but I have the development
 [ R f4 ]  [ Q e7 ]  [ c4 ]  [ N x d2 ]  [ Q x d2 ] , [ g6 ]  14. ......... [ g6 ] - after an exchange of knights on [ d2 ] I cleared the way for castling and have now supported my foremost f pawn. I am still keeping my options though on where would be the most appropriate location for Henry.
 [ e4 ]  [ g6 ] , [ B c4 ]  Slightly better than [ B e2 ] or [ B f4 ] as white prepares for a possible e5.
 [ Q b5 ]  [ R d7 ] , [ R c1 ]  to passive why not [ Q x a5 ] to get some counter-play
 [ Q x d3 + ]  [ K x d3 ]  [ R x g3 ] , [ K e2 ]  Blunder. It is game over now.
 [ O-O ] , [ b3 ]  [ b3 ] offers the option of playing [ B b2 ] later.
 [ N c6 ] , [ B e3 ]  defending an developing i'm getting late i should develop also
 [ N d7 ] , [ c4 ]  Blocking in my lsb.
 [ Q d7 ]  [ Q f8 + ]  [ N g8 ] , [ N x c5 ]  And now White is up a pawn.
 [ e x d5 ]  [ c x d5 ] , [ N x e5 ]  If [ B b5 ] [ a3 ] wins the trapped bishop. White chooses this means to gain two pawns for the piece.
 [ B c4 ] , [ N c6 ]  1. Started with the basic King Pawn's open....I wasn't quite sure what to do with the bishop coming out...was thinking the Ruy was coming...so I just stuck to the plan and deveoped my Knight. If the queen were to follow I was hoping for the basic king queen fork or king rook fork that so often you can get when someone tries the scholars mate.
 [ B b4 ]  [ O-O ] , [ O-O ]  [ B x c3 ] [ b x c3 ] [ d5 ] would have been wiser here...
 [ a2 ]  [ Q e8 + ]  [ K d5 ]  [ Q d7 + ]  [ K e4 ]  [ Q c6 + ]  [ K e3 ]  [ Q c5 + ]  [ Q d4 ]  [ Q a3 + ] , [ Q d3 ]  White loses the king and pawn ending after 53. [ Q x a2 ] [ Q f1 + ] 54. [ K h2 ] [ Q f2 + ] 55. [ Q x f2 + ] [ K x f2 ] 56. [ K h3 ] Kg1.
 [ Q f3 ] , [ b x a2 ]  I move my queen out to [ f3 ] and black takes LB with b pawn and now there are 3 pawns on the 'A' file! At this stage black could have taken my F rook with his bishop and that would have left me with a pawn ab out to take my B rook so would have created difficulties. When I look at my king side I see I cannot progress with the queen still at [ d8 ] so I would have been hoping that my opponent would move this soon! There was the [ f5 ] square for my knight which would be safe.
 [ Q x d1 ] , [ Q x d1 ]  Better to take with the queen to threaten the knight.
 [ N d5 ]  [ g4 ]  [ K f7 ]  [ f4 ]  [ f5 ]  [ K f3 ] , [ K e6 ]  35. .... [ K e6 ] - now out comes the BK and he will be more than a handful to me.
 [ N c4 ]  [ f x g4 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ e4 ]  [ R d7 ]  [ N c6 e5 ]  [ R e7 ]  [ R e b8 ]  [ R a7 ]  [ a5 ]  [ R x a8 ]  [ R x a8 ]  [ g5 ]  [ R c8 ]  [ B d4 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N d2 ]  [ N d6 ]  [ R h4 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ N f5 ]  [ R h3 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ N d6 ]  [ R h4 ]  [ N e c4 ]  [ N x c4 ]  [ N x c4 ]  [ R h3 ]  [ f6 ]  [ g x f6 ]  [ g x f6 ]  [ b3 ]  [ N a3 ]  [ g4 ]  [ K f7 ]  [ R h2 ]  [ R g8 ]  [ R g2 ]  [ R c8 ]  [ R e2 ]  [ R g8 ]  [ R g2 ]  [ R c8 ]  [ N f5 ]  [ K e6 ]  [ R d2 ]  [ K e5 ]  [ N d6 ]  [ R c6 ]  [ N b7 ]  [ R c3 ] , [ B d4 + ]  at last forced into a mistake it's now over
 [ K e7 ]  [ R f1 ]  [ R d6 + ]  [ K b5 ]  [ R d2 ]  [ K c4 ]  [ B b6 ]  [ K c3 ]  [ R d6 ]  [ R b8 ]  [ B d4 + ]  [ K c4 ] , [ K x e6 ]  White's last pawn is obliterated.
 [ e4 ] , [ e5 ]  My favorite kinds of openings come from the King's Pawn games.
 [ d x e5 ]  [ B g4 + ]  [ K d2 ] , [ Q x f2 + ]  Unprotected pawn
 [ B x b7 ] , [ N d7 ]  12. ....... [ N d7 ] - to protect my [ e5 ] pawn.
 [ B d3 ] , [ d5 ]  ? [ d6 ] needed to stop the next move
 [ Q x f1 + ]  [ R x f1 ]  [ h5 ]  [ K g1 ]  [ K f8 ]  [ B h3 ]  [ b5 ]  [ K f2 ]  [ K g7 ] , [ g4 ]  White is maintaining his strong position on the kingside.
 [ f x e7 ] , [ Q b7 ]  To prevent my pawn from advancing further.
 [ N x a4 ] , [ b x a4 ]  Now the two pawns are neutralized.
 [ B g2 ]  [ R f e8 ]  [ O-O ] , [ Q b6 ]  The Q is White's best-posted piece. if I can exchange it off I can seize the center and split his forces in two.
 [ K d2 ]  [ N x c2 ]  [ K x c2 ]  [ B f5 + ]  [ K c3 ] , [ Q b4 # ]  
 [ B e2 ] , [ B g7 ]  Getting the bishop back to safety. I prefer this to [ e5 ] which cuts the bishop off from the kingside and potentially leaving a hole on the dark squares there. [ Q b6 ] was an option instead threatening [ f2 ] but I don't want to open up the game before I get my knight out. I have ideas of playing [ b4 ] then if n[ a4 ] q[ a5 ] forcing [ b3 ] leaving the dark squares completely vulnerable.
 [ N e4 ] , [ R d8 ]  I'm sorry for my Qside pieces but this is the forcing move
 [ N d5 ]  [ c4 ] , [ B e2 ]  White has done enough damage: this is stronger than Be4...
 [ B x e2 ]  [ N x e2 ] , [ B g5 ]  Black's bishop is forced back anyway. He has probably come out the worse for the fight despite material equality as most of his remaining army is stuck at home.
 [ O-O ]  [ B e7 ]  [ c3 ]  [ O-O ] , [ N a3 ]  on route to square [ c4 ] and relocate the Queens' Knight; of course [ b5 ] is no option anymore...
 [ c4 ]  [ e5 ] , [ N f3 ]  The Nimzovich variation which can quickly transpose into normal lines or lead to independent play.
 [ Q x d1 + ]  [ R x d1 ]  [ R x d1 + ]  [ B f1 ] , [ B a6 ]  Wins the pinned bishop. White's Queen will be no match for Black's pair of Rooks and two minor pieces.
 [ Q c2 ]  [ B d7 ] , [ a4 ]  here comes the pawn push as anticipated
 [ d3 ] , [ N d7 ]  I figured all my play was on the queen side so I should bring my pieces over there but this move just looks wrong. Maybe [ R e8 ] was slightly more accurate.
 [ K d7 ]  [ f5 ] , [ d x c2 ]  15. ..... [ d x c2 ] - this makes me 5 points down on material - ghastly!
 [ B g5 ] , [ N a6 ]  Intending to bring the knight to [ c5 ] however this will not provide any counterplay as the e-pawn is already doubly protected. The better plan is to attack the white center with ...[ c6 ] or to play ...[ Q e8 ] followed by ...Nh7.
 [ R h2 ] , [ B h3 ]  Note the need for constant pressure again from white. [ Q e4 ] !!
 [ g x f3 ]  [ Q x d5 ]  [ Q e3 ] , [ h6 ]  Black has the piece advantage... now can I convert?
 [ d x e3 ]  [ e ] , [ p ]  Black sees it and decides to deny me the powerful center pawns. Now he threatens ...[ B c4 ] and ...e2.
 [ B g3 ] , [ Q c8 ]  Preparing c5. I can't distract defending or I'll lose my attack chance.
 [ N x e4 ]  [ d x e4 ] , [ Q e2 ]  wining the pawn ?
 [ Q x f4 ] , [ Q x d1 + ]  15.[ Q x f4 ] [ Q x d1 + ] - Inaccuracy! Better was [ Q x g7 ] (15. [ Q x g7 ] [ Q x d1 + ] 16. [ R x d1 ] [ R x d1 + ] 17. [ B f1 ] [ B e5 ] 18. [ Q f8 + ] [ B c8 ] 19. [ Q c5 ] [ B h3 ] 20. [ Q f8 + ] Bc8). Black goes for a sequence of exchanges while I am under check losing tempo with pressure building on my Kingside.
 [ f4 ]  [ g x f4 ]  [ B x f4 ] , [ B e7 ]  13...[ N e7 ] was probably better to clear [ g8 ] for a Rook.
 [ R a6 ]  [ d5 ] , [ N e8 ]  All black pieces are at the back - except the rook on [ a6 ] what a strange position.
 [ e x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ Q x e4 ]  [ Q x h5 ]  [ Q x d4 ]  [ B g3 ] , [ Q c3 ]  Threatening to take the Bishop.
 [ Q d2 ] , [ h5 ]  I was very tempted to play 12...h6?! witht the idea that if white plays 13.[ B x h6 ] [ N x d4 ] leads to some interesting sharp play. however there were plaenty of other options at whites disposal. Including [ h3 ] with the idea of trapping blacks LSB. That woul;d force me to play [ [ h5 ] ] anyway so I decided rather than waste a tempo I wpuld play h7-[ [ h5 ] ] in one go.
 [ K e3 ] , [ K g7 ]  now it will cost an expensive tempo...
 [ Q x c3 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ Q c2 ]  [ N d f6 ] , [ N e5 ]  preparing [ f3 ]  [ N d6 ]  [ R f c1 ]  [ R c8 ]  [ b4 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ B h7 + ]  [ K h8 ] , [ B d3 ]  And here I pondered on 22. [ N g6 + ] for clearance to capture 23. BxNd6. But that wouldn't work out to well for my light square bishop.
 [ d6 ] , [ d4 ]  3. [ d6 ] is the Old Steinitz defense not a very popular variation for black. 4. [ d4 ] is a fairly forceful move. White grabs the center threatens to win a pawn on [ e5 ] and threatens to win the pinned knight with 5. d5.
 [ d x e4 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ N g3 ]  [ B g6 ]  [ h4 ]  [ h6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ h5 ]  [ B h7 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ B x d3 ]  [ Q x d3 ] , [ e6 ]  A well known position from this opening
 [ R x b8 ]  [ Q g3 ]  [ g6 ] , [ f5 ]  threatening blacks rook or the gain of a pawn
 [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ g6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ O-O ] , [ e3 ]  Not the most active move but playable.
 [ e5 ] , [ f4 ]  I personally don't like playing against the kings gambit. The centre usually belongs to white although you may have an extra pawn or not.
 [ B b1 ]  [ N a4 ] , [ B c1 ]  Notice that now all my pieces have returned to the home rank that are not off the board that is. The knight on [ a4 ] is a great paralyzing piece for black as it inhibited both my [ c1 ] bishop and [ a1 ] rook from coming into the game. However black really doesn't have any way to take advantage of this as of current and will most likely need to move the knight in order to make a breakthrough. My goals are going to be getting my lsb out from its square on [ b1 ] since all the pawns are guarding my squares. A good way to do this would to break open the board with f5. Really none of my pieces are that bad since the action is going to most likely take place on the king side and all my pieces are slicing though it.
 [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ] , [ e5 ]  the budapest defence white does better to immediately return the pawn and play for a solid positional edge rather than try to hold the pawn when black should be more than compensated
 [ N f3 ]  [ B b7 ] , [ B e2 ]  preparing to castle
 [ e6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ N c6 ]  [ N f6 ] inorder to play [ d5 ] was better.
 [ N d7 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ f5 ] , [ c3 ]  Controls b4+[ d4 ] Alternative variation: 12. [ Q d2 ] $11
 [ c5 ]  [ c x b5 ]  [ a x b5 ]  [ B x b5 ]  [ B c8 ]  [ a4 ]  [ O-O ] , [ N f d2 ]  gathering the troops...
 [ h x g5 + ] , [ R x g5 ]  ...and as expected we trade our pawns...
 [ B f5 ] , [ N f3 ]  protecting the central pawns
 [ B b5 ] , [ B d7 ]  White got back to the main line but with a difference being the threat of exchanges in the center.
 [ B d3 ]  [ a6 ] , [ a4 ]  10. [ a4 ] - trying to discourage b5.
 [ e5 ]  [ f4 ]  [ e x f4 ]  [ B c4 ] , [ N c6 ]  This is one of the strongest replies. Black retains the option of [ Q h4 + ] while developing.
 [ e3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N g e2 ] , [ d5 ]  the offensive has been taken! Counter attack!
 [ N x g7 ] , [ Q d2 ]  Realising he doesn't have the forces available to press home his attack White tries to regroup by attacking [ d6 ] once more.
 [ K c6 ]  [ R x f4 ] , [ h3 ]  ! This subtle move protects everything for now at least. Any way in which I try to attack the h pawn would result in the rook backing it up with [ R h2 ] then following it up with [ h4 ] to protect the g pawn.
 [ Q c1 + ] , [ Q f1 ]  Forced to avoid material loss.
 [ B g5 ]  [ R d7 + ] , [ K e6 ]  I on the other hand didn't like chasing the Bishop so I came up with a check and then this is where Black moves to?
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ c4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N b d7 ]  [ R c1 ]  [ O-O ]  [ e3 ] , [ b6 ]  (LA) Book QGD Orthodox.
 [ Q x f4 ] , [ Q x f4 ]  Or so I thought.
 [ d x e4 ]  [ Q x e4 ]  [ B e6 ] , [ d5 ]  This will give me an isolate pawn but I'm confident in my game. It shouldn't be too much of a weakness.
 [ K g7 ] , [ Q x e7 + ]  and it is over...
 [ Q e6 ]  [ R x d7 ]  [ Q x a2 ] , [ Q e3 ]  securing [ f2 ] and enforcing e5...
 [ f3 ]  [ R h e8 ]  [ f x e4 ]  [ R x e4 ]  [ Q x e4 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ R x f6 ] , [ g x f6 ]  Whilst I have developed a passed pawn the price of this is the isolated h-pawn. However he can stave off both opposing pawns.
 [ Q x b4 ] , [ B c2 ]  Viola. my bishop heavens place
 [ d x c4 ] , [ B x c4 ]  I am not sure the exchange by Black here is wise. White had not yet moved the king's bishop and by capturing on [ [ c4 ] ] now Black allows the bishop to develop in one move. If Black waits for the bishop to move and then captures on [ [ c4 ] ] White has then used two moves to develop the bishop. I think 8... [ N c6 ] (hitting d4) or 8... [ b6 ] (eye on e4) were more consistent moves for Black.
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ a6 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ e6 ]  [ f4 ] , [ N b d7 ]  This variation of the Najdorf was first developed by Polugaevsky in the 60s and refined by Gelfand in recent times. It's actually a more solid line than the totally unclear main lines arising after 7...Be7. The positions also get chaotic after 7...[ N b d7 ] but somehow they tend to end up in draws.
 [ N x b6 ]  [ R x b6 ] , [ a4 ]  A good idea but I was hoping for this.
 [ Q b3 ] , [ N c6 ]  Both sides have poor queenside development but there is a crucial difference: Black can develop his queenside at will although I have not yet done so; White has a cramped queenside whose development is blocked by his king and c-pawn.
 [ a6 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ b5 ]  [ a4 ]  [ N b c6 ]  [ B e2 ] , [ d5 ]  now after exd6ep we can capture Nd4...
 [ B x f3 ]  [ g x f3 ] , [ K f8 ]  This is "technically" a draw. But white has to be accurate. White needs to push c4-[ c5 ] quickly. No time to waste. Otherwise he can be in big trouble!
 [ R e7 ] , [ R a d1 ]  Threatening the queen.
 [ h x g3 ]  [ K g7 ]  [ Q c2 ] , [ N e7 ]  13. ..... [ N e7 ] - Glenda's steed comes over to the kingside to help in the defense of Henry.
 [ N c6 ]  [ N x d5 ] , [ B g4 ]  those pesky pins!!
 [ B c4 ]  [ f6 ] , [ h4 ]  Now there are 4 White pieces bearing down on Black's undefended kingside...queen rook bishop and rook pawn. As Sun Tzu says "The ultimate in disposing one's troops is to be without ascertainable shape...It is according to the shapes that I lay the plans for victory but the multitude does not comprehend this. Although everyone can see the outward aspects none understands the way in which I have created victory" (6:24-25).
 [ R b5 ]  [ K a6 ]  [ K a3 ] , [ R f8 ]  [ N e5 ] protects against RxPf3.
 [ B d6 ] , [ N d f3 ]  Defends the knight on [ e5 ]  [ B h7 ]  [ B d3 ] , [ N e4 ]  to trade bishops would be better for white. Now if white wishs to trade then [ e4 ] will belong to me.
 [ R b c8 ]  [ K b3 ]  [ R b8 ]  [ a4 ]  [ R c c8 ]  [ R b5 ]  [ R c7 ]  [ a5 ]  [ R c6 ]  [ c5 ] , [ d x c5 ]  A file finally opens fully.
 [ R x e6 ]  [ Q x e6 ] , [ f4 ]  Ok now its my time to make a mistake.. I trick SPCMN is awesome if you ask me :)
 [ N x d5 ]  [ Q x a2 ]  [ N x f6 + ] , [ B x f6 ]  Black has the initiative.
 [ N c6 ]  [ c3 ]  [ Q x e3 + ] , [ f x e3 ]  Now there is a weak e pawn to take care of.
 [ B f4 ] , [ N b d7 ]  This is to prevent Bxb8. Since the light squared bishops are off the board sometimes an imbalance of two knights verse a knight and a bishop is better especially if the pawns are mostly still on the board. Yes the bishop can cover the board more quickly but two knights can work very well together and the pawns can hem the bishop in so it depends on the position. I did not want white to make that particular trade. Besides this is typically where the queen's knight goes anyways.
 [ K f8 ] , [ B x e6 ]  He is in trouble. Almost certainly will lose his knight on [ d7 ] and if I can only open up the f file.
 [ Q x a1 ] , [ B f3 ]  
 [ N c6 ] , [ Q b3 ]  ??
 [ N f6 ]  [ d3 ] , [ B b4 + ]  There are some games where I use my knights more and there are some games where I use my bishops more. I determine which one I will be using by getting rid of the other type.
 [ b4 ]  [ N e2 ]  [ a5 ] , [ R d g1 ]  16. [ R d g1 ] - I mean business!
 [ Q d3 ] , [ R a d8 ]  [ d5 ] is now ready to be played ...
 [ f6 ]  [ B e6 + ]  [ K b8 ] , [ N b5 ]  Black has RxP[ d3 ] or QxPd3. The knight (Ne5) is protecting Pc7.
 [ B e7 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ N c3 ]  [ a6 ]  [ b4 ]  [ b5 ] , [ B b3 ]  I wanted to stay on the black kings' diagonal.
 [ K e7 ] , [ B x a5 ]  And now the rook falls.
 [ N b4 ]  [ B e4 ]  [ f3 ] , [ B b7 ]  It was tempting to keep the diagonal but after [ e4 ] it will be closed all the same.
 [ e4 ] , [ e6 ]  Black opens with the French.
 [ h3 ] , [ R x f1 + ]  he trades
 [ K e2 ] , [ c1 = Q ]  Now I have managed to promote so.....
 [ g x h6 ]  [ Q h8 + ]  [ K x g6 ]  [ Q g8 + ]  [ R g7 ] , [ Q x g7 # ]  Not a game to be proud of. My head is not at chess when worrying how to get to pay the rent. Still I hope you had some good laughts reviewing it. A good deserved victory for my opponent. Good for him!
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ N f6 ]  3. ...... [ N f6 ] - all four knights develop so this gives the Opening the Four Knights Opening. I now transpose it into the Scotch.
 [ R b1 ] , [ R a2 ]  do I have a fortress? It seams so...
 [ R e1 ] , [ R x b5 + ]  ! A move that taunts White to get my rook.
 [ e x f4 ] , [ R x f4 ]  Junior 10 prefers retaking with the queen however I wanted to lift my rook over to [ h4 ] to join the fray.
 [ d5 ] , [ N c3 ]  Bad move on my part. Allows his pawn to penetrate with d4.
 [ e5 ]  [ d x e5 ] , [ d x e5 ]  e file pawn exchange what is Black's best move and where should Black put the [ f6 ] Knight?
 [ d6 ]  [ h3 ]  [ B g7 ] , [ Q f3 ]  White doesn't advance the d pawn which allows me to advance the c pawn.
 [ d x e5 ]  [ d x e5 ] , [ N g4 ]  Now my center comes under heavy pressure. I had not considered this move dangerous in my evaluations somehow but now it seems as if my [ e5 ] pawn is already lost (three attackers and one defender).
 [ d3 ] , [ B c5 ]  He attacks my equivalent pawn...
 [ e x d4 ] , [ b x c5 ]  Now I have 4 active pieces against one. Black is lost no matter which way he recaptures. If he recaptures with queen then [ B b4 ] [ Q x [ c1 ] ] R[ h x [ c1 ] ] and my bishop's control of [ c1 ] allows my rook to invade via [ c7 ] and win the [ a7 ] and [ b6 ] pawns. If he recaptures with d-pawn then I'll have 2 connected passed pawns in the center and my diags can aid them after [ B f4 ] [ d6 ] and [ Q c4 ]  [ Q x a5 ] , [ R b7 + ]  If [ N d7 ] then [ R x d7 + ] [ K f6 ] [ Q f4 # ]  [ K d8 ] , [ Q b2 ]  Now threatening to get both majors to the open ranks with tempo
 [ Q h5 ]  [ h6 ]  [ B f3 ] , [ Q e8 ]  There now it's unpinned. Now I need to drive back the gathering White attack on my King's position.
 [ a6 ]  [ a3 ] , [ e6 ]  This is author Tony Kosten's recipe for the English but as black except that black would have already played [ g6 ] and Bg7.
 [ K x f5 ]  [ R f7 + ]  [ K e5 ]  [ K c2 ]  [ R h6 ]  [ N d3 + ]  [ K d6 ]  [ R f5 ]  [ R b8 ]  [ K c3 ] , [ K c7 ]  Black's king cannot really do anything active because it is too vulnerable to checks so instead it remains in the background out of the way and also takes on the job of guarding the cpawn.
 [ R d4 ] , [ N b6 ]  i attacked the bishop
 [ K h8 ] , [ Q h2 ]  Black resigned here.
 [ R c6 + ]  [ K d7 ]  [ R e6 ]  [ R d3 + ]  [ K e5 ]  [ e3 ]  [ K f4 ]  [ R x d5 ]  [ R x e3 ]  [ c5 ] , [ h4 ]  I got to do something. Soon. Anytime now.
 [ a4 ]  [ N b c6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ b6 ]  Black needs to prepare b5: first Bb7...
 [ e x f5 ]  [ e4 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ Q f6 ]  [ Q h5 + ]  [ g6 ]  [ f x g6 ]  [ h x g6 ]  [ Q d5 ]  [ N e7 ]  [ Q x e4 ] , [ R h4 ]  ionadowman: Already Black has a distinct edge
 [ N f6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ] , [ N b d7 ]  !? I would have preferred [ N c6 ] allowing freedom for the bishop. But I think black intends Nb6.
 [ B b4 ] , [ N d1 ]  [ N a2 ] was needed here.
 [ N d2 ]  [ N x d2 ]  [ R x d2 ]  [ Q c6 ]  [ Q g4 ]  [ h5 ]  [ Q g3 ]  [ Q d7 ] , [ B x e5 ]  Handy pawn to pick up
 [ a x b4 ]  [ c x b4 ] , [ R x g2 ]  And thats the one I didn't see!
 [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B b5 ] , [ O-O ]  Unpinning the knight and connecting rooks.
 [ Q x e5 ]  [ R x e5 ] , [ R f7 ]  No use trying to save the pawn I seek for compensation.
 [ h5 ] , [ B b4 ]  prevent the rook advancement
 [ a x b5 ] , [ a x b5 ]  Now if I can advance my QNP I can force away the White pawn blocking my QBP.
 [ R g2 + ]  [ K h6 ]  [ R h2 + ]  [ K g5 ]  [ R g2 + ]  [ K f4 ]  [ R f2 + ]  [ K g5 ] , [ R g2 + ]  And here White offered a draw which Black accepted. It's perpetual check.
 [ b x c3 ] , [ R a b8 ]  Not at all surprised with this move.
 [ R x b5 ]  [ Q x c3 ] , [ R x a4 ]  A draw still seems the most likely outcome - the two Rook's can easily stop Black's passed pawn
 [ B g4 ] , [ B d5 ]  Attacking the black knight and claiming the center. So far we're still perfectly textbook.
 [ R f6 ]  [ f4 ]  [ Q h5 ]  [ g3 ] , [ N c5 ]  Depending what White does I could either go [ e4 ] if he moves off the diagonal or trade for the bishop. Getting a little of trading even however
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ] , [ f4 ]  White offers the Kings Gambit!
 [ f4 ] , [ f5 ]  symmetrical
 [ R a7 ]  [ N b3 ]  [ B b6 ]  [ R x a7 ]  [ B x a7 ]  [ B d2 ]  [ h5 ]  [ f3 ]  [ h x g4 ]  [ h x g4 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ B x b4 ] , [ K g7 ]  White is a pawn up but Black has confidence in the Bishop pair and plays for a draw.
 [ g4 ]  [ O-O-O + ] , [ K c1 ]  25. [ K c1 ] - Henry retreats to safety.
 [ d4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ b6 ]  [ e4 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ N d2 ] , [ f5 ]  A dangerous move. Still look what I had to do in order to win this.
 [ e x d5 ] , [ N d4 ]  White goes up in material. Black forks White's pawn at [ c2 ] and White's queen. Only a simple fork but allows me to gain some tempo.
 [ c3 + ]  [ K c4 ] , [ K e3 ]  White manages to protect his pawn structure in the king's side but black can win a pawn with: [ B x e4 ] [ K x e4 ] [ K x c3 ] which opens the column for his pawn (c7). It has the disadvantage of letting the white king go towards the 6th-7th line which could be dangerous but black believes that by sacrifising his Knight for the advanced pawn at the right moment he can win the game.
 [ c5 ]  [ c4 ]  [ g6 ] , [ d4 ]  ... theory
 [ R d7 ] , [ B x e5 + ]  This loses a piece but Black's position was altogether hopeless.
 [ e x d4 ] , [ N x d4 ]  Again another pawn trade.
 [ Q x g7 ]  [ R e6 + ]  [ K h7 ] , [ d8 = Q ]  As desired new life for the white side with a Queen !
 [ a x b7 ]  [ R b8 ]  [ B a5 ]  [ R x b7 ] , [ b6 ]  here exchange might be a problem. 31. [ B x c7 ] [ R x c7 ] 32. [ b6 ] [ R b7 ] 33. [ R b5 ] [ c4 ] 34. dx[ c4 ] Rx[ b6 ] 35. Rx[ b6 ] [ B x c6 ] and it will be hard to win that endgame.
 [ O-O ] , [ B e2 ]  keeping options open with shifting attacking plans to [ R c1 ] with pressure down the c-file.
 [ B d7 ]  [ B x d7 + ]  [ Q x d7 ] , [ Q x d4 ]  Equalising in material - a centralised queen is great when it can't be driven back but Keres could play [ c5 ] with tempo later if he wanted to.
 [ g5 ]  [ N d3 ] , [ B h5 ]  ?! I think this is a waste of time now that White can interpose with f3. I was very concerned about the simple plan of playing …[ N b6 ] and …[ N c4 ] which would basically shut down my Queenside play before it started. This move came as a big relief to me: the fact that Black would move his Bishop off of [ f7 ] where it supports …[ N c4 ] so well meant that he probably hadn't seen that plan. My opponent probably meant to make something of the half-open e-file once I unsupport the e-pawn with [ f3 ] but as we see in the game that doesn't work too well for him.
 [ N d7 ] , [ f4 ]  if 14.[ Q c2 ] then F5 blocks attack
 [ K c7 ]  [ Q f7 + ]  [ K b6 ] , [ Q b3 + ]  I have to be sure that I will have checks all the time.
 [ N x h7 ] , [ R g8 ]  
 [ d x e5 ]  [ B x e5 ] , [ B x e5 ]  As this is what I analyzed and was happy here until he took back on e5. It's important to note that if I didn't have those other things to worry about I would not have exchanged. As my focus is generally on the "here and now". That would've made me realize what's going on here and why Tom played 16...Rde8.
 [ N c3 ]  [ c x d4 ] , [ e x d4 ]  9. [ e x d4 ] - pawn trade.
 [ K d6 ] , [ R a d1 ]  Trying to bait him into taking the bishop then I take the pawn pinning the king to the queen with the rook.
 [ N x c5 ]  [ Q x c5 ]  [ B d3 ] , [ f5 ]  All troops... to action!!!
 [ B d4 ]  [ B x d4 ]  [ R e1 + ]  [ K g2 ]  [ Q e2 + ]  [ B f2 ] , [ Q f1 + ]  
 [ e x d5 ]  [ R x d5 ] , [ N e3 ]  gaining intitative against the rook.
 [ d4 ] , [ B x g4 ]  OK ill have that and attack your queen!!!
 [ c x b2 ] , [ B x b2 ]  He didn't decline and this is the Danish accepted line
 [ N f6 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N d5 ] , [ d4 ]  3. [ d4 ] - standard pawn thrusts.
 [ K e1 ]  [ Q x b7 ]  [ K d1 ]  [ Q g2 ]  [ K c1 ]  [ b3 ]  [ K b1 ]  [ Q c2 + ]  [ K a1 ] , [ Q c1 # ]  All in all a better effort than my last game vs. Freddy. But it was not enough
 [ K f5 ]  [ R d2 ]  [ R c1 ]  [ K d3 ]  [ K g4 ]  [ R c2 ]  [ R d1 + ] , [ K e2 ]  Biding his time for the moment. After 47. [ K c3 ] Black will start counterplay with 47. ...f5!. Fine then continues the variation 48. [ K b3 ] [ R b1 + ] (the immediate 48. ...[ [ f4 ] ] allows 49. Rc4) 49. [ R b2 ] [ R e1 ] 50. [ a4 ] [ [ f4 ] ] 51. gx[ [ f4 ] ] [ K x [ h4 ] ] 52. [ a5 ] [ K g4 ] 53. [ a6 ] [ R e8 ] with a draw. This appears correct although it is close e.g. 54. [ K c4 ] [ h5 ] 55. [ R b6 ] Kx[ [ f4 ] ] 56. [ R x g6 ] [ R e2 ] 57. [ K b5 ] [ R a2 ] 58. [ R h6 ] [ K g5 ] 59. [ R h8 ] [ h4 ] 60. [ f4 + ] [ K g4 ] 61. [ f5 ] [ R b2 + ] 62. [ K c4 ] [ R c2 + ] 63. [ K d4 ] [ R c7 ] 64. [ f6 ] [ h3 ] 65. [ R g8 + ] [ K f3 ] 66. [ R g7 ] [ R c8 ] etc.
 [ b2 ] , [ R e e1 ]  They will!
 [ K f8 ] , [ B c5 + ]  But Tom is determined not to let me pull a swindle.
 [ R a c1 ] , [ B d8 ]  15. .... [ B d8 ] - another piece Fou Lenoir takes the knight's place to defend that vulnerable [ c2 ] pawn from Freddy's heavies on the c column.
 [ K g2 ]  [ Q f6 ]  [ R h1 ] , [ a5 ]  now white can play simply 27.[ b5 ] and black has nothing to do on his queen side. But i can feel that I have nice attack. And just continued my plan instead of playing 27.[ b5 ]  [ h4 ] , [ K h8 ]  from this point i think both sides played their best moves and it is proved that Black has nothing to rescue his game
 [ N d6 ] , [ N d2 ]  Of course 12.[ R x [ e5 ] ] is there...but always remember development and tempo. So far I have not alot going on...but neither does he. So let's get our pieces out. [ N d2 ] sets up for [ N f3 ] and then I am hitting the [ e5 ] pawn twice and also have the threat of [ B g5 ] hitting the queen. These are the thoughts going through my head as I have this sey up on an analysis set and telling the wife I don't care about what she is doing in Farmville
 [ Q c2 ] , [ N f6 ]  Black plays the calm way.
 [ B d7 ] , [ Q x c4 ]  8. [ Q x [ c4 ] ] - and she picks off the [ c4 ] pawn and material parity is restored.
 [ a4 ]  [ a3 ]  [ N b5 ]  [ R d7 ] , [ B x c3 ]  Despair....but helps to create a nice finish of the game
 [ B e6 ]  [ B x d5 ] , [ B x d5 ]  That surprised me. A discovery attack could be made but Getting with the queen would start some action
 [ N d4 ] , [ Q e4 ]  Trading would have just helped him bring the queen out and connect the rooks. I felt [ e4 ] was a nicely active square for the Queen where she couldn't easily be dislodged (for example if [ R e1 ] then Qxf4) without perhaps a trade (and the trade of knight for bishop now works better for Black).
 [ e5 ] , [ B c4 ]  The Bishops Opening is coming back in popularity in fact a recent book by GM John Emms features this system tied in with a quick [ f4 ] push.
 [ K d7 ]  [ Q x e3 ]  [ R x a2 ] , [ h4 ]  White's goal is now two-fold. 1. Promote the h-pawn or threaten it seriously enough that black must give up his rook to prevent it. 2. Find a way to fork the black king and rook so that white can capture the rook then achieve the first goal unobstructed or simply checkmate with queen+king vs. king.
 [ Q c3 ]  [ N d3 ]  [ R a d8 ] , [ h3 ]  Not sure if this was really necessary already (I was worrying the queen check on a1) either [ Q x a7 ] or the fork threatening [ N e5 ] would have been stronger probably.
 [ b x c5 ]  [ R x c5 ]  [ Q e3 ]  [ R c8 ]  [ Q b6 ] , [ R c2 ]  What I wouldn't give right now for a second rook...
 [ N x d7 ]  [ Q x d7 ]  [ f x g6 ] , [ h x g6 ]  i tought [ f x6 ] could be better for him opening the f colon. He has a rook more so he could exchange rooks with me and get a leading situation
 [ N x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ g3 ]  [ B x h4 ]  [ g x h4 ] , [ Q x h4 ]  Now material is even although White can retain the pawn with Bxd5. The bigger problem for White is that the King is now exposed.
 [ K d3 ]  [ b3 ]  [ R a1 + ]  [ K b2 ]  [ R a6 ]  [ K b1 ]  [ R b6 ] , [ b2 ]  Finally. Now I just have to move my King out of the way.
 [ f4 ]  [ a6 ]  [ B f3 ] , [ N b8 ]  14. ..... [ N b8 ] - this innocent looking retreat uncovers an attack on the [ c4 ] pawn. Steve notices this and decides to stab at my knight. I decided to exchange bishops on f3.
 [ R a5 ]  [ R g1 ]  [ R x b5 + ]  [ K x b5 ] , [ c6 + ]  ? I am "able" to trhow the game away if I'm not careful. This was an unnecessary mistake (it is to be said that white should have played [ B f4 ] and make my Q run away from its fantastic position.
 [ c x d5 ] , [ e x d5 ]  Alternative variation: 9... [ N x d5 ] [uses a nice tactic to defend against Ne5-c6.] 10. [ N c6 ] [ N b4 ] 11. [ N x b4 ] [ B x g2 ] 12. [ K x g2 ] [ B x b4 ] $11
 [ f4 ]  [ e x f4 ]  [ B x f4 ] , [ B d6 ]  4....Bd6? is rather unsightly after the Bishop trade-off but Black has no concern about it or else might have tried to correct the doubled-isolani situation or avoided allowing it in the first place~! But this is all part of the freedom of expression which the programmers wished to inculcate into their brainchild. As explained in its paperwork it does not use an opening book but rather calculates each move to its own tastes & satisfaction.
 [ R a d1 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ B x d4 ] , [ B e4 ]  This was the idea. Now MY bishops seem powerful and looking to the WK.
 [ c4 ]  [ R a2 ]  [ c3 ]  [ B c1 ]  [ K c4 ] , [ R x a5 ]  ok my opponent resinged here and i want to apologize that i showed no respect by toying around. although its not often you get such strong story telling situations on the board. and its clearly not every day that you have your 8 pawns and just march the opponent over and dont have to fear a thing. ofcourse id loved to play it down to the 1st rank but chess is a 2player game if its not for any reason its about to be over. like here ^^
 [ N x e4 ]  [ R c d3 ]  [ N c5 ]  [ R d c3 ]  [ R c e8 ] , [ R x e5 ]  I deliberated for awhile on whether to take with the pawn which looked very likely to end in a draw. Getting the rook through was vital.
 [ Q g5 ] , [ B x d4 ]  Here I get two minor pieces for a rook which can be a crushing advantage in a lot of positions but White's rooks get active and my minor pieces take awhile to coordinate so White was able to get a lot of play and almost won.
 [ N x c4 ] , [ b x c4 ]  look to double file his pawns and hope to hamper him later
 [ Q x b5 ] , [ O-O ]  Now is the moment. White did take the pawn but I have a tempo. Now I fear h4-h5... but they are a lot of tempos. I now have [ f5 ] as the only way to activate...
 [ R e f2 + ]  [ K e1 ]  [ R f e2 + ]  [ K f1 ] , [ K f3 ]  Threatens mate but overlooks...
 [ c5 + ]  [ B e6 ]  [ Q b4 ] , [ N x c5 ]  16. ....... [ N x c5 ] - Not only have I got my pawn back I am a pawn up!
 [ R x g6 ]  [ R h7 ] , [ N d2 ]  White is going to use the knight via [ b3 ] then [ a5 ] or [ d4 ] to destroy white's pawns it is a matter of time now. White will block the advancing pawn with the king
 [ K x c2 ] , [ Q g3 ]  threatening both [ f3 ] ad [ h3 ]  [ R d8 ]  [ R b1 ]  [ R c8 ]  [ R b7 ] , [ h5 ]  I'll ignore the treat against my pawn on the queen's wing and focus on pushing my supported pawns on the kings wing
 [ O-O ]  [ B c2 ] , [ b5 ]  in fact loss of tempo for Black but anything goes right now...
 [ e x f5 ] , [ Q x f5 ]  Material equality has been restored and so has the game. There's nothing in it now. But the dramatics are by no means over!
 [ b x c5 ] , [ R a1 ]  28. [ R a1 ] - first my rook takes command of the open a file.
 [ K b2 ]  [ Q g2 ]  [ K b1 ]  [ Q h3 ] , [ K a1 ]  What is going on here??
 [ B d2 ] , [ N c5 ]  oh my the infantry ddidnt get enough support and with blacks cavalry in sight white's officer in command leaves the poor men on prey
 [ b x c4 ] , [ e x f6 ]  he trades he now has the bisschop pair but he weakened his kingside.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ d6 ]  2. .......... [ d6 ] - the Philidor Defense - have played against this opening but not played it myself on Gameknot before so this is a bit of an experiment for me. This game is unrated by the way.
 [ R x e8 ] , [ R x e8 ]  At this point he resigned. He can`t prevent 36.[ R g8 ] [ K h7 ] 37.[ Q f7 # ] without massive losses of material and he is a rook down anyway. This game was interesting I think because of many opportunities to win a very good position and a desperate try to attack after missing them and even getting into trouble. Anyway thanks for reading :)
 [ B x c4 ] , [ N e5 ]  the goal here was to attack [ B c4 ]  [ B x e5 ] , [ Q b3 ]  threatening to check king and take Bb7...
 [ f x e4 ] , [ g6 ]  Best moves I can see here for White is 32.[ R g3 ] R[ a x f2 ] 33.[ K h2 ] Be2. Not a winning move more a 'delay the inevitable' move.
 [ a8 = Q ]  [ R x a8 ] , [ R x a8 + ]  After maneuvering out of check the next few lines would be simple posturing.
 [ R e1 ] , [ e5 ]  After 7 [ R e1 ] [ [ [ [ e5 ] ] ] ] the game is back to similar territory as with 6...e5. Transposition of moves. Caruana seems to have returned to his childhood favorite...

 [ R d1 ] , [ a5 ]  Preparing for [ a3 ]  [ c6 ]  [ B x b5 ] , [ c x b5 ]  atleast they are in one team now
 [ N e2 ]  [ d5 ] , [ N d4 ]  White has moved the knight 4 times in his last six moves.
 [ b3 ] , [ B d4 ]  ...and attack the rook with my bishop...
 [ K h4 ] , [ g3 # ]  how many times do we get to checkmate wih a pawn?? 15.[ Q h3 ] also mates.
 [ B x h6 ] , [ Q x h6 ]  Black is down a piece so it doesn't seem to his advantage to trade material. However either way he could not avoid trading bishops since his bishop on [ g7 ] had nowhere to hide from white's bishop on h6.
 [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ c5 ]  All very classical
 [ g6 ]  [ d4 ] , [ B g7 ]  Attacking the center with a fianchetto.
 [ d3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N e4 ] , [ N c6 ]  Opens the diagonal for my bishop. The black pawn at [ c5 ] seems undefended but it is really just bait for a little trap.
 [ h5 ]  [ N g5 ]  [ K f1 ]  [ N h3 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ N f4 ] , [ d4 ]  Kasparov's pressure finally forces a mistake.
 [ d x c4 ] , [ h5 ]  well let's try to grab the only advantage I have
 [ N e5 ]  [ R f6 ] , [ N d7 ]  29. [ N d7 ] - suddenly threatening [ N c5 ] and Nxf6.
 [ N g7 ] , [ R a f1 ]  I had a long think on this move as well. I could nothing that was immediately "game changing" so I sought to improve my position. After looking for a bit I realized that my R on [ a1 ] was not part of the game and it appeared that including him helped my position.
 [ B x f3 ]  [ O-O-O + ]  [ B d2 ] , [ N d4 ]  Black is more confortable already but the queenside is undeveloped.

 [ K d8 ]  [ R d1 ]  [ Q a5 + ]  [ R d2 ] , [ Q x b5 ]  This speeds the end.
 [ h6 ] , [ B x d6 ]  I initially noticed this move when I started thinking about the board schematically saying to myself what needs to be changed to be able to force a mate? I thought I either needed the e-file opened with tempo the c-7 pawn removed (or moved) to allow [ R c4 ] or the Bishop to move so that my queen can safely move onto the back rank. With these thoughts in mind [ B x d6 ] didn't seem so bad afterall! Capture with the Bishop results in mate in two: 20...[ B x d6 ] 21. [ Q a8 ] [ K d7 ] 22. Qxe8#. Recapture with the pawn results in mate in three: 20...[ b x d6 ] 21. [ R c4 ] [ K [ d8 ] ] 22. [ Q b6 ] [ K d7 ] 23. [ Q c7 # ] or 20...[ b x d6 ] 21. [ R c4 ] [ K d7 ] 22. [ Q x b7 ] k[ d8 ] 23. Qc7#. Not capturing the Bishop would result in a decisive material gain
 [ e4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ] , [ e x d5 ]  The one work I have on the French doesn't cover the exchange variation so it is all me from here on out but with a little experience in the Sicilian and Tarrasch defenses I gave it a try.
 [ f3 ] , [ B x e4 ]  Joe: Now I am forced to take back with fxe4. I'm just not sure what's going to happen after you play ...[ Q g5 + ] Ken: I believe your best after [ Q x g5 + ] is to play [ K h1 ]  [ f x e4 ] , [ Q g5 + ]  Joe: I think so to. I was about what happens after Kh1. I'm interested in that part. Ken: I will double the Rooks on the f-file. Joe: That makes sense because there's added pressure. I agree that [ K h1 ] is the best move.
 [ K d3 ]  [ K d6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ g6 ]  [ b4 ]  [ a6 ] , [ a4 ]  33. [ a4 ] - planning on creating a passer with my queenside pawn majority.
 [ R e5 ]  [ g6 ] , [ f3 ]  I needed to retreat.
 [ O-O ]  [ N x d2 ]  [ R e1 + ] , [ K f8 ]  I don't see another sensible move. [ N e4 ] serves no purpose.
 [ B d2 ]  [ B x d2 + ]  [ Q x d2 ]  [ N g e7 ] , [ B d3 ]  a developing move in order to castle kingside
 [ e6 ] , [ f5 ]  I couldn't take the pawn as I would lose the knight.
 [ R b2 ] , [ R a c8 ]  Preventing a piece exchange that would break up the a/b pawn chain.
 [ R c8 ] , [ R e8 + ]  White forces a rook trade.
 [ B x c2 ] , [ R a c1 ]  With that being said I follow ION's advise by playing the man as opposed to the board.
 [ g6 ]  [ K f1 ] , [ B g7 ]  
 [ K h6 ] , [ R f1 ]  If white had taken my bishop then I would have played 31...[ N x d4 ] hoping that my opponent recaptures so I can get a perpetual check but that didn't happen. I waived the withe flag at this point seeing that I could not efficiently stop 32.Rf6+. My thanks to stalhandske for this great game! 1-0
 [ N d2 ] , [ R a e8 ]  17. ....... [ R a e8 ] - the back row decks are cleared and the rooks are now connected.
 [ B e3 ] , [ a4 ]  Continuing to push.
 [ Q g4 + ]  [ K f7 ]  [ Q h5 + ]  [ K g7 ]  [ Q g4 + ] , [ K f7 ]  But even though we're no where near that yet as Michael pointed out this is where I realize that Joann has a win. As Martin was trying to go for a draw by rep with the perpetual checks. In this position I would've overlooked it and played 60.[ Q h5 + ] and I'd like these checks so much that the same position would more then likely repeat themselves 3 times which would enable the opponent to declare the draw.
 [ h3 ]  [ B h5 ] , [ Q e2 ]  White does not know what to do in the position. There was very little for him to do. Black has a fierce grip on the position and has gotton his pieces inside of the white's pawn chain which has left many squares weak. More weak squares=More attacking chances for the attacker and therefore pawns need to stay where they are when you defend.
 [ R x f6 ]  [ Q h3 ]  [ R d6 ]  [ N x h7 ] , [ R d8 ]  20...Kxh7? 21.[ B f8 + ] [ K g6 ] 22.[ Q h6 + ] and Black's king is stuck in the open. Instead seemingly ignoring White's threats to his king Black is following a checkmating threat of his own.

 [ e4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N d2 ]  [ c5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ N g f3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B b5 + ]  [ B d7 ]  [ Q e2 + ]  [ B e7 ]  [ d x c5 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N b3 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ a6 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ a5 ]  [ a4 ]  [ N a6 ]  [ c6 ]  [ B x c6 ]  [ N f d4 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ N g4 ]  [ O-O ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ g3 ]  [ N x e3 ]  [ Q x e3 ]  [ B f6 ] , [ Q d3 ]  I was expecting 19. [ Q f3 ] [ N b4 ] and next 20...[ N c6 ] which parallels Karpov-Bareev Tilburg 1994. But 19. [ Q d3 ] let's black's queen's knight into action quickly. It seems to shift the momentum now.
 [ N f5 ]  [ g6 ] , [ N x d6 ]  33. [ N x [ d6 ] ] - The isolani on [ d6 ] does drop off but there is a nasty knight fork from black on e3. Ouch and double ouch!
 [ N e4 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ R x e4 ] , [ Q c1 ]  Forced.
 [ N d b5 ]  [ d6 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ a6 ]  [ N a3 ] , [ b5 ]  ..[ [ b5 ] ] is the most popular and suits my taste. Lines without ..[ [ b5 ] ] allow white to play [ N d5 ] followed by [ c4 ] (and white has a central bind)
 [ e x d5 ] , [ c x d5 ]  White is again blocking my bishop.
 [ R x d1 ] , [ R a5 ]  ?? Huge mistake on my part. I failed to see the upcoming tactic.
 [ b4 ]  [ N a4 ]  [ a5 ]  [ h5 ] , [ e6 ]  Finally off the database. And there's something about that move that screams glaring error to me. It all looks too dangerous for Black like a pile of precariously stacked dishes or a teetering Jenga tower. Of course unlike in Jenga the object in chess is to find the one move (or move sequence) that brings it all crashing down.....
 [ B x f1 ]  [ K x f1 ] , [ R e e4 ]  The pawn hunt continues and my grip on white's position becomes stronger.
 [ Q x g6 ] , [ Q e4 ]  Trying to force exchange. Because of Black´s huge material advantage it´s a good idea!
 [ B f5 + ] , [ g4 ]  !Yay! A lovely sacrificial tactic materialises.
 [ Q x c7 ] , [ N c6 ]  This hurt. I did not see this one coming. This opening is not supposed to get me anymore.
 [ e5 ] , [ N f d7 ]  Well the knight is there alright but not the right one.
 [ a6 ] , [ K f2 ]  25. [ K f2 ] - white now begins to centralise his king.
 [ Q e3 ] , [ h x g3 ]  Took to early.
 [ Q x d4 + ] , [ K h1 ]  21.[ K g2 ] might actually be better here keeping the King near his far-advanced pawns so he can potentially provide some much-needed support.
 [ d x e4 ]  [ N g5 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ B c4 ]  This obvious attack on the [ f7 ] square can be easily dispelled with the simple ...[ e6 ] and it may be best in that case white will eventually get back the e pawn and it will be roughly an equal game however with blacks next move it shows that my opponent intends to go all out for the win.
 [ B e3 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ B d3 ]  I complete minor piece development and have a strong center and well developed pieces. I believe white is slightly better here.
 [ N d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ R x d4 ] , [ B e6 ]  I gladly swap off a pair of Knights.
 [ a5 ]  [ a3 ] , [ B g7 ]  Putting my eye back on my main goal.
 [ B d2 ] , [ B x a1 ]  Q cannot take because of 20...[ R x d2 ]  [ Q e2 ] , [ B d4 ]  using the B to pin the N to the R on [ g2 ]  [ a4 ] , [ Q f6 ]  I'm not quite sure the reasoning behind this move. I think I wanted to be able to push the pawn on g2. also I wanted to alleviate the pin on me queen
 [ N x b6 ]  [ R d2 ]  [ a5 ]  [ B c6 ]  [ h4 ]  [ B e4 ]  [ K f1 ]  [ h5 ]  [ R e3 ]  [ B x g2 + ]  [ K e1 ]  [ R a2 ]  [ N d7 + ]  [ K e8 ]  [ N x c5 ]  [ R x a5 ]  [ N x e6 ]  [ f x e6 ]  [ R x e6 + ]  [ K f7 ]  [ B c3 ]  [ K x e6 ]  [ B x a5 ]  [ B f3 ]  [ K d2 ]  [ B g4 ] , [ K e3 ]  Wow a very well played game by Stalh. This is one he should have won!
 [ R e1 ]  [ e6 ] , [ B g5 ]  (?!) Recommended is 9. [ N b d2 ] so that 9... [ B d6 ] can be met with 10. Nf1!
 [ e x d5 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ B g7 ] , [ N d4 ]  I choose to sack the knight to keep up with the complete control of the center...
 [ d x e5 ]  [ N x e5 ] , [ N d4 ]  I decided to improve the position of this N rather than try to prevent Black swapping off the [ B d3 ] since I didn't expect to be able to complete the attack with the Q and B on h7.
 [ N x c1 ] , [ Q x c1 ]  The other option is 16.[ B x f5 ] [ N x e2 ] 17.[ Q x e2 ] [ c x b3 ] where black has regained the pawn and it's passed! Also [ a3 ] is hanging this seems much better as my opponent forces exhanges without giving back the material immediately.
 [ b6 ] , [ b x c6 ]  And finally..... the first piece is taken after 19 moves! Most unusual in modern chess.
 [ Q x h4 ] , [ N x g2 + ]  i hate games like this!
 [ c4 ] , [ d x c4 ]  A Queen's Gambit Accepted
 [ N d4 ]  [ R c4 ] , [ R g3 ]  Alarm bells should start ringing with Black.
 [ B x a1 ] , [ B x e6 ]  The final fireworks commence White down a rook and a minor piece.
 [ b5 ] , [ d4 ]  now let's play chess...
 [ B x e5 ] , [ N f6 ]  The pawn on [ g7 ] was en prise this is one good way to save it developing a piece and preparing to castle.
 [ N g3 + ]  [ Q x g3 ]  [ B x f1 ]  [ B x a8 ]  [ Q x d2 ] , [ B x d2 ]  now black properly resigns. Please comment especially if you see a combo or something I missed.
 [ R d c8 ]  [ B d5 ]  [ f5 ] , [ N f2 ]  Other option is to keep the Knight still in the area with 18.[ N [ c3 ] ] but ..Nb4! attacking bishop and open up the [ c8 ] Rook to exchange the [ c3 ] Knight.
 [ Q x c2 ]  [ R h2 + ]  [ K d3 ]  [ R x c2 ]  [ K x c2 ]  [ B c6 ]  [ B d3 ] , [ B h6 ]  now I started to play
 [ N f4 ]  [ B f1 ] , [ b6 ]  I think this move was also unnecessary. This just helps me as will be shown in a few moves.
 [ N x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ] , [ R h8 ]  ICC: he either missed [ R h8 ] or underestimated the problems he has here
 [ d4 ]  [ h6 ]  [ e4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e5 ]  [ f6 ]  [ e x f6 ]  [ N x f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ a6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ Q d7 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ O-O ] , [ B h3 ]  This was an interesting move by Black. Capturing the bishop with my pawn would lead to an opening in front of my king so perhaps that is what my opponent's intentions were. I do end up taking the bishop but it doesn't work out as well for Black as it could have. Also Black doesn't really have enough support in that area to force a checkmate anyways.
 [ c4 ] , [ N b4 ]  It seems that I will exchange rooks for a pawn... not really a bargain.
 [ Q x h6 ] , [ Q b2 ]  I'm badly behind and my pieces are disjointed. I'm looking to sneak a mate on [ g7 ] now while I try to consolidate.
 [ b6 ] , [ K d1 ]  I thought I should protect the rook just incase anything opens up.
 [ c x d4 ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ R e8 ] , [ N e5 ]  A way to prevent [ e5 ] from black in the near future.
 [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B b4 ] , [ e3 ]  Adam played [ a3 ] here [ e3 ] is more common and scores better according to the on-line databases.
 [ d4 ] , [ e x d4 ]  It is all forced because every other move seems to lose material or worse.
 [ e4 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ f3 ]  ? Weakening the King safety and the Pawnstructure. Black continues with the standard setup.
 [ R a4 x a3 ]  [ N x a3 ] , [ R x a3 ]  Now Black is threatening to win the [ g3 ] pawn which ties White's king to the defense of it.
 [ R e1 ] , [ B e3 ]  Trying to build a bridge so my king can get to the queenside.
 [ B x f5 ] , [ O-O ]  Standard development. White looks like he's going to try to play [ d3 ] [ R e1 ] and perhaps [ B g5 ] (or Be3) with a comfortable game.
 [ f3 ]  [ N d6 ] , [ N c3 ]  Catching up a little on development because the knight at [ b4 ] is no great worry. It will be chased away.
 [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ a6 ] , [ B e3 ]  There doesn't seem to be any mystery about what is going on. I am playing against one of the most popular openings that black has (sicilian) and the most popular variation of that opening (najorf) The gamedatabase alone at gameknot is full of this line
 [ K e7 ]  [ K g5 ] , [ f6 ]  The KNP and KRP will fall but I only need 1 Queen.
 [ N c6 ]  [ g3 ] , [ N b4 ]  threaten the queen.
 [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ B b4 ]  [ Q c2 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ e3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ a3 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ d4 ]  [ B e7 ] , [ B d2 ]  Idea to castling on Queen side
 [ O-O ]  [ d4 ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ c x d4 ] , [ B e7 ]  White has already castled so [ B b4 ] is of no use anymore...
 [ O-O ] , [ N c3 ]  In a resent game I had a opponent try Nxc3. I achieved a huge central pawn phalanx's and when on to win easily. http://gameknot.com/annotation.pl?gm=10358
 [ B b7 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ b4 ] , [ N a4 ]  Better was 6.[ a x b4 ] [ B x b4 ] 7.Bd3.
 [ c x d5 ] , [ N b4 ]  Alternative variation: 10... [ B x f3 ] 11. [ B x f3 ] (11. [ g x f3 ] [ N b4 ] ) (11. [ d x c6 ] [ B x c6 ] 12. [ Q c2 ] O-O) 11... [ N e5 ] 12. [ B e4 ]  [ B b5 + ] , [ c6 ]  .
 [ B x e7 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ N e f3 ] , [ B c4 + ]  And black resigned as [ R a8 ] was coming next and black would not last long. Thank you for watching this game which was ultimately won by black's poor opening play. See you soon!
 [ K x d8 ] , [ N a3 ]  To protect the rook.
 [ B x e2 ]  [ Q x e2 ]  [ O-O ]  [ R a c1 ] , [ R a c8 ]  Both sides are looking to take control of the open c-file.
 [ g4 ]  [ R c7 ]  [ R g1 ] , [ R c f7 ]  doubling rooks to add pressure on the king after f pawn has been removed.
 [ e3 ]  [ d5 ] , [ B b5 ]  White starts to be aggressive...
 [ g x h6 ]  [ Q x h6 + ]  [ K g8 ] , [ O-O-O ]  This simple move is definitory. Black is tied to defend the h column and this allows me to play freely and eventually recover the piece.
 [ g x f4 ]  [ B x f4 ]  [ Q c8 ] , [ B x h6 ]  ... gxh6?? loses to [ Q x f6 ]  [ a x b6 ]  [ e ]  [ p ] , [ Q d8 ]  Now ... [ g x h6 ] is threatened
 [ g x f6 ] , [ Q d1 ]  Coward.
 [ O-O ]  [ B g2 ] , [ B g4 ]  As far as I could tell this is a novelty on the databases. I had not considered this move. The light squared bishop is black's good bishop (his pawns are on dark squares so it is the one with all the threats) and so he doesn't really want to trade it off for a knight as that would mean my light squared bishop would become an unopposed monster should the center ever open up. It is also not clear whether or not the bishop should be here or on [ d7 ] or [ e6 ] so this might waste a tempo in some lines. Of course you could just take on [ e2 ] knight has to take back and maybe play [ d5 ] and try to open lines before the king is safely castled. Without a light squared bishop and the dark squared bishop passive opening these lines holds little venom in my opinion but it is a possibility.
 [ d4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ b6 ]  [ N d2 ] , [ B b7 ]  ...alowing [ e4 ] at once. I could have played it.
 [ b4 ] , [ B d6 ]  now I have to make the most out of this iether I have to get a rook back soon or im done
 [ N f3 ] , [ d6 ]  Gunning for the Dragon. Because I like dragons. Big and scary.
 [ e x d5 ] , [ B f5 ]  attacking the pawn on c2. An attack black receives for free.
 [ d x e5 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ Q x e5 ]  [ f4 ]  [ Q h5 ]  [ h4 ] , [ Q g4 ]  [ B x h4 ] looked like a tempting sac but I don't think it would have accomplished much.
 [ K c2 ] , [ K a5 ]  The Knight and Pawn keep him from the valuable squares at [ Q B2 ] and QB3.
 [ Q x e4 ] , [ R h2 ]  Defends the night that is good
 [ b4 ] , [ d1 = Q ]  He surely will capture my new Queen. Then R[ f x f2 ] begins to chase his King. That will be fun. (For me anyway...)
 [ R b7 + ]  [ K c8 ] , [ R x h7 ]  Knowing the ultimate game result I think this may be a mistake.
 [ R b8 ] , [ h3 ]  avoiding other surprises
 [ B d3 ]  [ B d7 ] , [ R g1 ]  This is the first "surprise" for him. Not going for castling.
 [ N f3 ]  [ B b4 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B x c3 ]  [ b x c3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ Q e2 ]  [ Q d7 ] , [ N e5 ]  White gets the N to a good square with the gain of a tempo.
 [ B g4 ] , [ B x f6 ]  I'd still like to avoid the endgame with 13.[ Q g3 ] or something like that but all four games in the database exchanged down into the endgame so I thought it would be wise not to deviate from that. Can anyone explain why 13.[ Q g3 ] (or even 13.[ Q x g4 ] [ N x g4 ] 14.[ B x d8 ] Rfxd8) are never played? Now that I've taken on [ f6 ] the following exchanges are forced.
 [ O-O ]  [ N f6 ] , [ Q e2 ]  This is the main move for white and it's a key move to the opening. The queen does a great job supporting the [ e5 ] push and this prepares Rd1! which exerts huge pressure against black's queen.
 [ N g5 ]  [ B x d6 ] , [ c x d6 ]  There's no rush. The [ R f7 ] isn't going anywhere useful the [ N h6 ] is offside the [ B c8 ] is useless and the [ N d7 ] has few useful squares. White's development whilst discreet is practically full and with only 3 pieces off the board the Black king is ominously exposed.
 [ N e4 ] , [ R x h1 + ]  White left his rook at [ [ h1 ] ] and instead brought his knight to e4. So I captured the [ [ h1 ] ] rook and put his king in check.
 [ O-O ]  [ B b7 ]  [ B f3 ] , [ R a d8 ]  good move the black rooks now joining to the game Rook(a)pined the whites knight on [ d5 ] while R(f)will move to e8.
 [ N c6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ] , [ B c5 ]  This is now a must win or else for Caruana! Whether you like or dislike Carlsen or think he deserves to win or not it does not matter. He won in accordance to FIDE regulations fair and square! He has never lost a WC playoff and one again he will not lose this one. So you can fault the system but not him.
 [ g x f6 ] , [ B e3 ]  Protects d4.
 [ g6 ] , [ a4 ]  ? The pawn march could win the game for White if there was time for it but there isn't. (Fritz: 23. [ a4 ] +0.58/19; 23. [ Q b2 ] +1.24)
 [ Q f2 ]  [ Q c7 ] , [ R b3 ]  Somehow I thought this move would get me out of trouble. This is not the way to play with opposite side castling I should have played 23 [ g4 ] instead.
 [ B d7 ] , [ h3 ]  Preparing for attack on King side.
 [ N d7 ] , [ N a3 ]  This looks like a losing move although the threat of ... [ a6 ] makes White's life very difficult. The exchange sacrifice on [ e6 ] has to be considered but the e-pawns are hard to attack and after exchanging the front pawn for that on [ f4 ] Black will have a passed pawn in any endgame.
 [ B b5 ] , [ B b7 ]  First part of it is in place.
 [ B b3 ] , [ K f7 ]  Black needs a square for his king and castling seems impossible.
 [ Q x d5 ] , [ B c3 ]  I think White must soon forfeit his Queen one way or another. She's remained on the e-file too long and White is out of free tempi. This move is probably superior to 18.[ d3 ] (losing to ...ex[ d3 ] with the dual threats of ...[ R e6 + ] and ...d2+). 18.[ Q b4 ] just results in the Queen being chased around by 18...[ R b6 ] so that doesn't help much either.
 [ N x e4 ] , [ N e5 ]  Ask a question to [ f7 ] (with a fork chess/rook) and to [ K e4 ]  [ B x e4 ] , [ f5 ]  Often hazardous to open the pawn f
 [ e6 ] , [ d4 ]  3. [ d4 ] - pretty standard follow up.
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ N b d7 ]  [ e3 ]  [ N h5 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ N x f4 ]  [ e x f4 ]  [ h6 ]  [ N h4 ]  [ B h7 ]  [ O-O ]  [ e6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ B x d3 ]  [ Q x d3 ]  [ c5 ]  [ d x c5 ]  [ B x c5 ]  [ f5 ]  [ O-O ]  [ R a e1 ]  [ Q b6 ]  [ f x e6 ]  [ f x e6 ] , [ b3 ]  This was a very poor move as I can pin his knight.
 [ R x d1 ]  [ R f f8 ] , [ R f1 ]  Trading pieces is good for the side with more material.
 [ N c6 ] , [ h5 ]  Well finally the K-side attack sets in - it is not too late because black has neglected his K-side (for example by not playing f6)
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N g5 ] , [ B c5 ]  Ok the start of the Traxler variation..
 [ K x c8 ]  [ R f6 ] , [ K c7 ]  The white king is trapped in my rook bubble!
 [ K x f2 ]  [ Q c5 + ] , [ B e3 ]  White's best move. Other options sacrifice more pieces block the [ h1 ] Rook or lose another tempo.
 [ N x e5 ]  [ d6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ d4 ] , [ B g4 ]  5... [ d5 ] is more commonly played.
 [ K f6 ]  [ B b5 ] , [ R e4 ]  Advancing either pawn leads to a draw. I chose the one with the best chance of provoking an error. (Fritz: +0.06/19)
 [ a3 ] , [ N a6 ]  It probably would have been better to go to [ a5 ] in the first place
 [ K e2 ]  [ B x a1 ]  [ Q b7 ]  [ O-O ] , [ Q x c7 ]  as I anticipate this move I let him to catct 1 pawn then my attack..
 [ R x a2 ]  [ N f5 ] , [ B x c4 + ]  hm... i think i had no more option
 [ N f3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ Q b6 ] , [ N d5 ]  I knew that black would not capture the bishop but I tried it. [Computer: 5. [ B b5 ] last book move]
 [ N x h4 ] , [ K g1 ]  27.[ g x h4 ] [ Q x h4 ] 28.[ K g1 ] [ B f3 ] transposes to the game.
 [ Q x a2 ]  [ O-O ] , [ B g4 ]  The only other reasonable alternative is 12...[ N d7 ] which concedes a lot of space to White at the cost of keeping the extra pawn.
 [ h6 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ B e8 ]  In retrospect I think [ Q a5 ] should have been played. Or maybe even Qb6. They both lead to interesting attacks on white's weak queen side.
 [ B f2 ]  [ Q f4 ]  [ R h1 ] , [ R b8 ]  This move really shows that black is in charge. The threat of [ R b1 + ] is hard to meet without some major concessions.
 [ N d4 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N f4 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ K h1 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ R b c1 ] , [ N b5 ]  Black will have none of this "pawn-break on c3" stuff!
 [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B d3 ] , [ N e4 ]  I want to keep in control of an unknown sopening. I dared to open the [ Q h5 + ] by playing f5.
 [ R b8 ]  [ B x e6 + ] , [ K f8 ]  Black should have cover himself with [ B f7 ] but in this point it really doesn't matter.
 [ R x d7 ] , [ R f5 ]  I see no advantage for black with that. Maybe the grand plan will be revealed further on.
 [ g5 ] , [ N g7 + ]  And black resigns in view of 36... [ K g4 ] 37.Qf5#. I think this was a wonderful attack white played excellent moves to cover the dark squares at the end but all along white was creating holes by move 19 black had all SIX pawns on light squares. I think the bishop for knight exchange was the best move of the game it led to black's inability to defend dark squares and made black lose his one strong piece. This was also a surprisingly powerful attack for so few pieces but black's holes made up for the lack of pieces. I hope you enjoyed this game! Please comment if you have any criticism idea or just want to say anything.
 [ d x c6 ]  [ N x c6 ] , [ R x d6 ]  here is the first one.
 [ h6 ] , [ N e2 ]  Preparing to play [ N g3 ] and be2.
 [ Q a7 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ B x e3 ]  [ N x e3 ] , [ N e7 ]  The idea is bringing the N to a stronger square. But I don't anything except for ...[ N g6 ] and I wouldn't want to play it because that would leave both N's cramped.
 [ B g8 ]  [ Q d2 ] , [ Q a5 ]  An excellent move with which black starts to take complete control of the queenside; white can't play 23. [ N x e7 ] since his position will simply collapse after 23... [ B x c4 ] with both black bishops now having full scope on the queenside. Black's position is phenomenal. I submitted this game to post-mortem analysis in Fritz 10 and it considered that black had made the very best moves since move 12!
 [ d3 ]  [ R a d8 ]  [ R e3 ] , [ R h e8 ]  20. ....... [ R h e8 ] - consolidation by rook centralisation.
 [ R d5 ] , [ R x d1 + ]  It would have been better to not take my rook because after trading with r[ x d1 ] I can capture [ a2 ] in a few moves too
 [ N d4 ] , [ Q h2 ]  That's it chase that blitch off!
 [ N x d4 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N x c6 ]  [ N x c6 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ N e7 ] , [ a4 ]  Good Move if 12...[ b x a4 ] Then 13. [ B x a4 ] and now is imposibility 13...[ N x d4 ] then 14. Bc6!. And if 12...[ N x d4 ] 13. axb4!!
 [ N f6 ]  [ h3 ]  [ B h5 ] , [ B d3 ]  Apparently the light square bishop is enough trouble to drive back one square but white does not feel he has time to persue with the Knight's pawn. Perhaps he was concerned about the pawns being pushed so far forward at such an early point in the game and developement took priority instead.
 [ B d7 ] , [ R a b1 ]  A half-hearted attack on the b7-pawn.

 [ N c3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B g5 ] , [ c4 ]  Locking down the queenside and hampering development by White's light-squared bishop.
 [ B x b2 ] , [ R x b2 ]  ...so we swap. This was not a good trade for me as I am behind on material.
 [ B c3 ] , [ R a7 ]  I had a few choices here: 1. [ R b5 ] to protect the passed pawn; 2. [ R a6 ] to try and set up a revealed check attack; but I chose 3. [ R a7 ] This was to stop [ K d5 ] by tying his King down on defensive duties to force the movement of the dangerous knight from [ d7 ] and also to threaten [ R e7 + ] (which might be useful)
 [ c5 ]  [ B d8 ]  [ B h3 ] , [ N d3 ]  new targets...

 [ N x c7 + ]  [ K d8 ]  [ N b5 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B a6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ h5 ]  Why not take the rook?
 [ Q h3 ] , [ N f8 ]  ?? Worser than worse. But why? What is white threatening? What's the only defence against... a double check? Not this: this will only cover [ g6 ] but against...

 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ] , [ N f3 ]  thinking of fried liver attack
 [ N x f3 ]  [ Q x f3 ]  [ Q x f3 + ] , [ R x f3 ]  Thanks for the extra pawn and a possible escape route White.

 [ c x d4 ]  [ R e4 ]  [ h3 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ d3 ]  [ R x c4 ]  [ d2 ] , [ R d4 ]  A very nice game until the end. If black kept his cool he might have won! Please comment and rate it on the star system. Thanks!
 [ K h1 ] , [ B f5 ]  A move with two threats. 17. ... [ B e4 ] forks the white knight on [ f3 ] and the white pawn on d5. White has precious few options to save that pawn because his queen needs to stay home to defend the knight (else white's castle will be opened wide and his pawn structure destroyed). 17. ... [ B d3 ] skewers the white queen to the rook on f1. Both moves win material for black and white is ill-positioned to defend against both threats though 17. [ R f c1 ] eliminates the skewer threat and threatens to counterattack after 17. ... [ B e4 ] by playing 18. [ R c7 ] and making threats of his own. Black would need to play 17. ... [ R f c8 ] to contest the open c-file before playing [ B e4 ] which would then give white time to secure e4.
 [ Q f8 + ]  [ Q x f8 ] , [ R x f8 # ]  
 [ K c8 ] , [ Q x a6 ]  There is no where left to hide and the black king ends it in surrender.
 [ Q f8 ] , [ B c3 ]  I would like my queen to take place on f6. His completely useless light-squared bishop blocks 22 ...f5. His knight and queen are also far away from the defense of their king.
 [ h3 ] , [ B e5 ]  There's the first shot at the advanced pawn...
 [ b6 ]  [ N d2 ] , [ c5 ]  If I didn't support this with [ b6 ] I would have lost a pawn to dxc5.
 [ d x e4 ]  [ B x h4 ]  [ B h2 ] , [ N x e4 ]  Now a second pawn falls.
 [ d5 ]  [ c4 ] , [ d x c4 ]  Accepted
 [ K b2 ]  [ Q f2 + ]  [ K a1 ] , [ Q a7 ]  The next 14 moves were set as conditional. One would normally resign but there were always opportunities in this game for both players.
 [ B d3 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N b3 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ K h1 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ h6 ]  [ B h4 ] , [ N x e4 ]  11....Ne4!! black wins a pawn.
 [ N c3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ N x c6 ]  [ N x c3 ]  [ N x d8 ]  [ N x d1 ]  [ K x d1 ]  [ K x d8 ]  [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ B c4 ] , [ f6 ]  My opponent is wise to me attacking his pawn
 [ B x g5 ]  [ N x g5 ]  [ O-O ] , [ N f3 ]  as a result of the bishop exchange white is totally passive.
 [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ B b4 ]  So it starts as a standard Nimzo-Indian. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nimzo-Indian_Defence
 [ Q a5 ] , [ R e3 ]  lining up 2 attackers on your knight its only defended by your bishop at the moment.
 [ h3 ] , [ B x e5 ]  hence why trying to kick the bishop wasnt good. [ B f4 ] wouldve also probably been better to a castling. and way better than [ h3 ] this opponent was making me think here why did he leave his LSB hanging. if i take the LSB DSB goes [ b g3 + ] then my queen is dead. damn almost died here. im so used to being the aggressor as white this is uncharted territory for me playing on the defense. and if i castle the same thing happens with [ B h2 + ]  [ g x f3 ] , [ Q c6 ]  relieves stress on his queen i couldnt see what to play here i was pretty crunched having a pin my rooks were asleep. oh crap his queen antics are still alive on [ Q a4 + ] k[ e1 ] [ B x b2 ] then my queen dies to a rook. i think only reply left
 [ d4 ]  [ R x e2 ]  [ N x e2 ] , [ Q x e2 ]  white's [ d4 ] was also nice for me as now I can get my queen back to defend the [ c8 ] bishop if needed
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ e3 ] , [ d6 ]  The idea is to play the Budapest anyway with [ e5 ] and if dx[ e5 ] [ N g4 ] [ e x d6 ] [ B x d6 ] with some developement for the pawn.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ c3 ]  My favorite opening. The Ponziani. Although it's not the main choice among the elite it has been successfully used by Magnus Carlsen back in the Wijk an Zee tournament of 2013 when he beat Harikrishna from this opening.
 [ R c3 ] , [ R a c8 ]  I would love to exchange Rooks as well.
 [ B x b5 ]  [ B d7 ] , [ c3 ]  This move surprised me. I was sure i was facing the [ e5 ] break on the next move. Not sure what my opponent thought of here.
 [ d5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ h3 ]  [ e6 ] , [ N b d2 ]  Wrong move. White has to defend the [ d4 ] pawn here with e3. Because the plan is to answer to black's [ B d6 ] with [ N e5 ] leaving the pawn unattended. This happened here but...
 [ b x a5 ]  [ B x a5 ] , [ N x c2 ]  The complicating factor is the threatened fork at [ e3 ] which persists after White's next. All the same GK now considered the game evenly balanced. This would have been a disappointment to Jo but immersed as she was in her scheme to break the chains about her Q-side pawns no doubt thought she still had the better of it and soon she would be home free.
 [ R c x c7 + ] , [ K a6 ]  25...[ K b8 ] is insignificantly better (25...[ K b8 ] 26.[ R b7 + ] [ K a8 ] [26...[ K c8 ] 27.Rec7#] 27.[ R x a7 + ] [ K b8 ] 28.[ B e5 + ] [ R d6 ] 29.[ B x d6 + ] [ K c8 ] 30.Ra8#).
 [ N d7 ] , [ Q x d3 ]  My plan works perfectly.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ f4 ]  [ e x f4 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ g5 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ g4 ]  [ O-O ]  [ g x f3 ]  [ Q x f3 ]  [ Q f6 ]  [ d3 ]  [ B h6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ N e7 ]  The starting position for all the games in the tourney.
 [ c x d4 ]  [ c x d4 ] , [ Q x c2 ]  ?! A slight mistake as now white keeps black tied up for the rest of the game. Better was [ Q c4 ] when it is hard to see anything better than accepting the ending when the position is about level.
 [ a6 ] , [ N d5 ]  Seeing that White can easily mate after playing 18.[ B d2 ] Black resigns.
 [ K x b5 ]  [ N a3 + ]  [ K b4 ]  [ N x c4 ] , [ K x c4 ]  I here I could have resign...
 [ c4 ]  [ d x c4 ] , [ b x a4 ]  now i got his bishop trapped in a box
 [ g6 ] , [ N b d2 ]  How about 6.[ d4 ] which threatens with 7.[ d5 ] to the pinned horse? 6.[ B e3 ] also not bad.
 [ g x h3 ] , [ f4 ]  too little too late.
 [ N b1 ] , [ g5 ]  Fianchettoing his B as it will be on the longest flank for his next move. As black though I would've played 6...[ g6 ] but for the same reason. So I don't see anything wrong with this move.
 [ Q c8 ]  [ Q x c8 ]  [ B x c8 ]  [ h6 ] , [ R c1 ]  Threatening [ B f5 ] [ R c8 ] mate
 [ b x c3 ]  [ B x d5 ]  [ N g5 ] , [ R b8 ]  Black covers a possible white [ R b1 ] but a move has to be used to take care of white's control of the kingside. If not inmediately [ h6 ] or at least [ Q d7 ] in order to cover [ d6 ] along with the bishop. In case of [ N d6 + ] BxN QxB QxQ RxQ and holds. Or [ B x [ c7 ] ] - ok you lose your beloved lsb your best piece but against the fatal pawn on [ c7 ] and black can try [ R a7 ] then. Of course white has Rb1! But white has an even better move:
 [ R d2 ]  [ e6 ]  [ R d5 ] , [ K f3 ]  I admit it full blooded: we had some (well-earned?) fortune... After 36. ... Kc6!! (pulls the hook out of any threats against b5) 37. Ke1/[ K f1 ] (lost tempo at 36) Bd5! (prepares [ e6 ] and prevents Kf3) white has to start worrying... The text is forcing for white after 36. ... [ B f7 ] [ N f5 ] is the only viable move... Of 40. ... [ R d5 ] I am not utterly convinced. I feared [ R d6 ] Nd4/[ N f4 ] etc... This is very unclear now. After 41. ... Rd3+/[ R f5 + ] 42. Ke4! ([ R f5 + ] [ K g4 ] [ R f6 ] is better for black) white suddenly has Nd4! Damned knight?!
 [ R x e5 ]  [ R x b6 ] , [ R c5 ]  Threatening [ R c8 # ]  [ R b8 ] , [ R h5 ]  Again threatening Rh#
 [ e x d5 ] , [ Q x d5 ]  looking rough now. im slowly getting dismantled. pressure has appeared everywhere.
 [ f x e4 ]  [ Q e7 ] , [ R a e1 ]  I played [ R a e1 ] here to provide a look at the Q if the e file opened up and create more tention on e4. Playing [ e x f5 ] would have opened the line to [ h7 ] which I saw and had plans for later.
 [ R e e8 ]  [ B h3 ] , [ B x h3 ]  Forced trade.White gets rid of a dangerously placed bishop and Black loses the 2 bishops advantage but the trades favours material advance
 [ N f6 ] , [ N x f6 + ]  What a genial move!I exchange his defensive Knight making dangerous 0-0 and way to dangerous the center escaping with 0-0-0 is to long!
 [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ B b4 ]  So it starts as a Nimzo-Indian Defence.
 [ N e6 ] , [ K e8 ]  Why did I do that?!
 [ Q x e5 + ]  [ Q x e5 ]  [ R x e5 + ]  [ K f7 ] , [ B g5 ]  Preventing Rd8.
 [ R a2 ]  [ R f7 ]  [ Q e1 ] , [ B g4 ]  so [ B g4 ] works also before [ R h7 ] ? 35.[ h x g4 ] [ R h7 ] __ 35.[ R g2 ] perhaps ? __ anyway thanks from black saying i have well defended.
 [ K h1 ]  [ Q d4 ]  [ R f1 ]  [ Q e4 + ]  [ K h2 ]  [ Q e2 + ]  [ K g1 ]  [ Q e3 + ]  [ R f2 ] , [ Q d4 ]  He checks me a bunch until he eventually gets my rook pinned to my king then continues to defend the diagonal.
 [ Q h5 ] , [ R f7 f5 ]  keeping on the pressure
 [ B d3 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ O-O ]  [ b5 ] , [ N e2 ]  Worried about P-[ b4 ] so moving to safety
 [ N x c5 ] , [ Q x c5 ]  White has a huge advantage his queen is well centralized he has a strong center and he is up a pawn.
 [ e4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e5 ] , [ c5 ]  It immediately becomes clear that 3. [ e5 ] is not a move aiming for fast development for it can be said with only a slight amount of exaggeration that Black is now taking the initiative. He attacks [ d4 ] and has plenty of opportunity to become aggressive on the queenside. In fact this is exactly why from time to time theory has considered the Advance Variation to be inferior. But the crucial question is: how does Black's short-term initiative compare to White's long-term prospects? This is where theory has changed its mind again and again in the past (and is likely to keep on doing so in the future).
 [ B e2 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ K g1 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ c x d5 ] , [ Q b6 ]  28. [ Q b6 ] - an aggressive move for Glenda the Defender! The [ a5 ] pawn is attacked.
 [ R a2 ]  [ R x g4 ]  [ K h2 ] , [ R h4 + ]  28. ..... [ R h4 + ] - deadly Henry has only one square to go.
 [ K f8 ]  [ K f2 ] , [ K e7 ]  31. ..... [ K e7 ] - sure enough out comes Henry!
 [ N e4 ] , [ B d3 ]  This is a good move I noticed afterward. Not only does this piece reinforce [ c4 ] it challenges his knight on e4.
 [ N x f3 + ]  [ R x f3 ] , [ Q x b2 ]  Now with the b-file open the thought of playing ...[ b6 ] & O-O-O cannot be very appealing to BL anymore.
 [ d5 ]  [ e3 ] , [ c5 ]  Sniping immediately at White's central pawn chain.
 [ e x f4 ]  [ c3 ]  [ B x f2 + ] , [ R x f2 ]  15. [ R x f2 ] - I decided to trade anyway since I am still 3 points up in material giving white less possibility of counterplay.
 [ B x g5 ] , [ B x g5 + ]  20. [ B x g5 + ] He is a good player and he will not let me keep my Knights up forward. He knows to trade them. So I do not get so good an advantage.
 [ R g3 ] , [ R a d8 ]  This is to play [ N e5 ] Nd3+.
 [ g3 ]  [ h x g3 ]  [ Q x g3 + ]  [ K e6 ] , [ h4 ]  Black resigned here but it was a good game!
 [ N d1 ] , [ N d f6 ]  13. ..... [ N d f6 ] - I improve the placement of my [ d7 ] knight and unblock the c8-[ h3 ] diagonal for Fou Leblanc.
 [ h x g4 ]  [ N x g4 ] , [ R x f7 ]  ? why giving up a queen?
 [ d6 + ]  [ K a7 ] , [ a5 ]  36. [ a5 ] - I expected [ d x e7 ] here but my rook can quite happily sacrifice himself if necessary for that pawn. With the text I can get rid of that d pawn at once. Steve now waves the white flag. I think with the 7-5 lead he has over me (his wins are 5-3 in his favour the remaining matches were draws) that Steve's rating should be in the 1800s so I was glad to get a win like this one out of him. I just hope he gets to 1800. I hope you have had a good read. Bye for now Joanne
 [ R e1 ]  [ B x c4 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ b5 ]  [ b3 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ N d1 ]  [ c4 ]  [ b x c4 ]  [ B x c4 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ b4 ]  The game is over. White cannot stop both the e pawn and those on the queen side. One of my most straight forward and accurate game strategy wise in a blitz game.
 [ B b2 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ e3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B b5 ] , [ e4 ]  Played to avoid going a pawn down from [ B x c6 ] b7[ x c6 ] [ B x e5 ] which I didn't like the look of
 [ Q e6 ]  [ b3 ]  [ R d5 ] , [ Q b1 ]  33. [ Q b1 ] - Glenda releases my knight from the pin by the black rook on c8.
 [ R x e8 ]  [ R x e8 ] , [ K b3 ]  Still hanging for what?
 [ R x b5 ] , [ N d5 ]  The queenside has been opened up allowing the black rooks into the attack.
 [ c5 ] , [ f4 ]  2. [ f4 ] - another Grand Prix!
 [ g x h6 ]  [ Q x h6 ] , [ N h7 ]  Here Black should have captured the bishop to relieve some of the pressure. After 11...[ B x c4 ] 12. [ d x c4 ] [ N x e4 ] Black has a small edge and covers the important ground of White's attack.
 [ R x d3 ] , [ Q e5 ]  ...come off the board.
 [ N g3 ] , [ Q g4 ]  Because he played the fork I had to move my queen away from danger in order to avoid loosing the queen.
 [ N h7 + ] , [ K e7 ]  Now his e-pawn is pinned.
 [ f6 ] , [ b4 ]  ignoring the threat to the [ B e5 ] to threaten [ B d5 + ] forking the Black Queen
 [ N x f3 ]  [ B x g2 ]  [ K x g2 ] , [ R a c8 ]  Saving the black rook that has been en prise for 5 moves and driving away the white knight.
 [ B g6 ]  [ B f2 ]  [ Q e7 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ Q g5 ] , [ f4 ]  That seems questionable. Trading queens would not have been bad--it would open up black's h file.
 [ d6 ] , [ B e3 ]  he hasn't taken the pawn instead he defended his e pawn. i continue to develop. [ B e3 ] seems ideal spot can cover much ground from here is not currently blocking me in and adds support to [ d4 ]  [ h3 ]  [ B x f3 ] , [ g x f3 ]  i take with pawn to open up g file
 [ B g2 + ] , [ K c4 ]  ?? I have a mate net now but I have to be careful: if [ K c2 ] [ b4 ] can delay the mate.
 [ b5 ]  [ b3 ]  [ b x c4 ] , [ b x c4 ]  Now my own pawn structure doesn't look too great. And my knight is still pinned.
 [ a3 ]  [ N x c3 ]  [ Q x c3 ]  [ Q x c3 ]  [ R x c3 ]  [ R a c8 ]  [ R f c1 ]  [ a5 ] , [ h3 ]  White offered a draw at this point. Black declined only because he thought his bishop pair gave him an (albeit very slight) advantage…and White’s last move suggested he was unsure how to proceed.
 [ d4 ] , [ N d6 ]  But now I can threaten another fork...
 [ Q b4 ]  [ a3 ]  [ Q x b3 ]  [ Q b1 ]  [ Q x a3 ]  [ Q a2 + ]  [ Q x a2 ] , [ R x a2 ]  42. [ R x a2 ] - here I give back a couple of pawns to simplify down to an endgame. I am getting short of time on my clock. I have made it to the time control but I have only the minimum time left 15 minutes. I think I have sped up a bit since then but I used to get into time trouble a lot in my early games.
 [ R e d8 ]  [ b x a5 ]  [ b x a5 ] , [ B x a5 ]  Now he's up a Pawn. I decide to bring my Bishop back to the Q-side for defence.
 [ Q d7 ] , [ O-O ]  castling.
 [ Q x b6 ] , [ B a6 ]  !
 [ e x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ] , [ N e5 ]  Black needed to put the N somewhere; this move looks nice and active. But it allowed me a simplifying combination that improved my position.
 [ a3 ] , [ R d8 ]  Seizing the file back before white takes it.
 [ d x e4 ] , [ N b6 ]  19. ....... [ N b6 ] - stage 2. Clears the way for Fou Leblanc.
 [ N c5 ] , [ R x c5 + ]  Having committed so much into the attack already i decided to just keep pressing forwards and what better way to do so than with an exchange sacrifice
 [ K g1 ]  [ f5 ]  [ Q b1 ]  [ f x g4 ]  [ Q d1 ]  [ h5 ] , [ R g3 ]  rg3?? this is blunder because i cant see any threats after takes.
 [ N x c1 ] , [ d3 ]  he cant take the knight cause i go [ Q x f3 ] and then [ K g1 ] [ B c5 + ] mating next move.
 [ R f d8 ]  [ N b3 ]  [ N x d3 ]  [ e x d3 ] , [ B x d3 ]  here comes rokk + 2 pawn for a bishop and a knight
 [ d x c5 ] , [ b x c5 ]  Black now has hanging pawns at [ c5 ] and d5. Fischer gives a masterful lesson on how to play against hanging pawns.
 [ N c1 ]  [ R g3 g2 ]  [ N e2 ] , [ K b6 ]  A fascinating endgame which illustrates the difficulties that can lie in the way of converting an extra exchange especially with few pawns remaining on the board.
 [ N e2 ]  [ Q c2 ]  [ N f4 ]  [ K x f5 ]  [ N x d5 + ] , [ K e5 ]  I think it was around here that I got accused by cheating but I'm not sure. Anyway I try to brush it off and move on but the accusation broke my concentration due to the flustering. Lesson: Don't take the "cheater" troll bait.
 [ R x b3 ]  [ K x g6 ] , [ R x a3 ]  Material is now even but white wins the race to the queening square
 [ R a1 + ]  [ K c2 ] , [ N d4 + ]  16 ...Nd4+! turns the tables.
 [ d x e5 ]  [ B d5 ] , [ R c8 ]  Surprisingly the black king is safe in the center and furthermore all but one of his pieces the [ h8 ] rook is developed.
 [ N d5 ] , [ B e5 ]  threatening the [ e4 ] pawn.
 [ f5 ] , [ K c1 ]  Neutralizes any Black's hope connected with c-pawn.
 [ N x h4 ] , [ N x e5 ]  10.[ N x h4 ] [ N x [ e5 ] ] I need to get rid of that pawn doing so loses the defense of [ e5 ] which is then taken by Black. I have lost control of the centre and the Kingside.
 [ e4 ] , [ e6 ]  Already an opening I'm not aware of
 [ e4 ]  [ c6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ N g3 ]  [ B g6 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ h6 ]  weak. permits 7.[ N e5 ] [ Q d6 ] 8.[ N x g6 ] [ Q x g6 ] 9.[ B d3 ] [ Q d6 ] giving White a development advantage. and initiative.
 [ Q x f7 + ]  [ K x f7 ] , [ g x f4 ]  Played immediately with the idea of loosening the grip on [ d4 ] to allow my rook to post there in defense of the [ b4 ] pawn.
 [ N c4 ]  [ Q c6 ]  [ R c1 ] , [ Q d5 ]  Black slowly creeps his Queen towards g5.
 [ B c4 ] , [ Q h4 + ]  La Bourdonnais wastes no time getting his counterattack going.
 [ B x c4 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ K f1 ] , [ B b6 ]  Aiming to exchange off rooks with ...Rd8.
 [ c x d4 ] , [ Q x d4 ]  Not 21. ... Qxc2? 22. [ B x c2 ] and white is ahead by a pawn. After black plays [ B x a2 ] the game is even. As played white's knight is still in danger.
 [ Q c7 ] , [ B x f7 + ]  Now that the Queen has left the nest I can bring out Ole Henry! I know this isn't a sacrifice too uncommon but I was feeling Mikhail Tal-ish at the moment!
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ] , [ f4 ]  nice: returning the favor of a Kings' Gambit like approach with also specs of a Dutch Defense based attack; which is none other than the Grand Prix Attack: against the player who teached me to play this...
 [ K d6 ]  [ N e8 + ]  [ K e6 ]  [ N c7 + ]  [ K d7 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ K d6 ] , [ N e3 ]  This might not have been best but Black is now winning here. The R is much more mobile than the N.
 [ Q a4 ] , [ B d7 ]  threatens [ c5 ]  [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B c4 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ h4 ]  [ R c8 ]  [ B b3 ]  [ N e5 ] , [ O-O-O ]  12.[ h5 ] is all so playable here .
 [ B h4 ] , [ B x f4 ]  ?? the queen and knight make a perfect team here.
 [ b x c3 ] , [ B x c3 ]  My rook is attacked but I chose not to defend it I saw that there is another possibility in the chess opening book database and it turned out nicely.
 [ K g3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ N f3 ]  Time to connect the rooks.
 [ B d3 ]  [ O-O ] , [ N g e2 ]  Trying not to block [ [ f3 ] ] point. I have seen positions like the one we are playing that wither advance there with [ f4 ] or block moving f2-[ [ f3 ] ] and then focus on the queen side. I am more prone to attack the king but this time I will go for a slower approach.
 [ R f6 ] , [ R a d1 ]  According to plan. 19. ...[ R h6 ] is no immediate threat due to 20. [ Q f7 + ] [ K h8 ] 21. [ h3 ]  [ h3 ] , [ Q a8 ]  Again white has to deal with the question of how to defend - active or passive? [ f3 ] has it's pros but it also weakens not only the King's (un)safe haven even more but also e3. It also keeps the queen commited to the Kingside with not much room to breathe.
 [ N a6 ] , [ c3 ]  The idea is to block the dark squares keep the N off [ c2 ] and then capture the e pawn. [ N x e4 ] immediately is met by Qd4+.
 [ N f d4 ]  [ N x d4 ] , [ N x d4 ]  20. ....... [ N x d4 ] - knight trade - now you would not believe this game is gonna terminate in just two moves would you?
 [ B g4 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N f6 ] , [ B f4 ]  Expanding on the queen side for black might be useful here. But he continues to develop castle and perhaps then expand(?). I think [ b5 ] would be good as it threatens to play [ b4 ] and seriously disrupt white's position. White could reply with [ h3 ] and after [ B h5 ] follow with [ Q d3 ] perhaps.
 [ K a1 ] , [ R d8 ]  As now I bring the R forward which was also the plan behind 23...Qd7. However right after this the position starts to become corrupt.
 [ c3 ]  [ d x c3 ] , [ N x c3 ]  At this point I felt like I had created some more space but looking at the position I still had an undeveloped bishop and knight on the queenside with all my moves being defensive I am expecting him to bring his queenside pieces into play soon
 [ h5 ] , [ h4 ]  23. [ h4 ] - checks Freddy's kingside pawn roll.
 [ g x f4 ]  [ K f2 ]  [ h5 ]  [ K f3 ]  [ b5 ] , [ K x f4 ]  Almost there.
 [ d x e5 ]  [ d4 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ g3 ]  This was as far as I was comfortable; after this I started spending a lot of time on my moves.
 [ h3 ] , [ Q a1 ]  Pinning the knight.
 [ Q h7 ] , [ R f f2 ]  28. [ R f f2 ] - a nice flexible set up with the potential to turn my heavies from defenders into attackers. I think my next plan should be to move Henry back towards the centre of the board before I try any counter-play on the h column.
 [ h5 ] , [ B h3 ]  Forced as the knight must stay defended and remain on his lovely outpost. [ B f3 + ] allows the king to escape via d7. I want my bishop to cut off that route when the knight eventually has to move or threaten a discovered check if the king tries to escape early.
 [ N e g5 ] , [ N g6 ]  NO time to to think in attacking but defending. I was worried about [ h4 ] though...
 [ O-O ]  [ Q c8 ]  [ Q c2 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ a3 ]  To prevent [ N b4 ] forking my queen and bishop.
 [ B g5 ] , [ Q x h4 ]  and I'll exchange queens with the queens off the board my advantage can now be better exploited...
 [ R d1 ]  [ B c4 ] , [ R a1 ]  54. [ R a1 ] - blocking my a pawn but I move it to [ a2 ] anyway.
 [ Q x d6 + ]  [ K b7 ]  [ B d5 + ]  [ K a6 ] , [ a4 ]  this move plays itself almost literaly the bishop must now die the question is where to put the grave
 [ N g f3 ] , [ N x b3 ]  ? Too greedy. According to Rybka Black should hold White to a slight advantage with 21. … Rg8.
 [ N x e5 ]  [ Q e4 ]  [ f5 ] , [ Q e3 ]  [ Q f4 ] attacking the h-pawn and preventing the advance of the f-pawn
 [ h3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ g4 ]  [ B g6 ]  [ g5 ] , [ N d4 ]  Now nothing protects P[ e5 ] from NxPe5.
 [ K d5 ] , [ B f3 + ]  forcing the exchange
 [ R x f5 ]  [ Q d3 ]  [ R e7 ] , [ R c1 ]  ! The rook is headed for c6. White doesn't allow himself to get distracted by the "threat" of ...Re4.
 [ B c4 ]  [ R a d8 ]  [ Q h5 ] , [ B e6 ]  Central domination = easy attack turning
 [ N x e4 ]  [ R b1 ]  [ B c5 ] , [ d3 ]  And another.
 [ R c1 ] , [ Q d5 ]  I have to admit I love a central Queen. It's just such a fitting place for such a powerful piece.
 [ K g6 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ R x c4 ] , [ e6 ]  I have a file all to myself!!
 [ K e2 ] , [ B e4 ]  And this will keep him there. Note how he can only move between [ d2 ] and [ e2 ] without backing up even farther.
 [ B d7 ]  [ N e6 ]  [ B x e6 ] , [ f x e6 ]  Simple exchange though some rank bishop higher than knight.
 [ R x g4 ] , [ R x b7 ]  ?? He got greedy.
 [ R c1 ]  [ K f7 ] , [ Q f2 ]  ? - Interesting that he let me advance the pawn. I was thinking of sacrificing the queen gaining a rook and retaking the queen later but this seemed like a more feasible end game.
 [ R c3 + ]  [ K f2 ]  [ R x b3 ] , [ R x d6 ]  now White choses to get the pawn back
 [ g4 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ N x d5 ] , [ B x d5 ]  16. [ B x d5 ] - a knight trade.
 [ b4 ]  [ B b6 ] , [ c4 ]  ??
 [ R f d1 ] , [ N h5 ]  My pieces are starting to uncoil White's [ h4 ] knight is still a longways from getting back into the game and my Kingside action is starting to take shape. I was starting to feel better about things.
 [ N e8 ]  [ N h7 ] , [ N d6 + ]  Tempo check to gain time and win a pawn.
 [ N x d5 ] , [ B e6 + ]  This move introduces a "mate" in 6 sequence. I announced that (sorry Fatcat2) and triggered the moves until I realized that the [ d5 ] Knight should be eliminated first. It would be a terrible a blunder. Alternative variation: 19. [ B x h7 + ] [My intuition was said that there were some tactics here and i would played that in a friendly OTB blitz game.] [ K h8 ] 20. cx[ d5 ] Alternative variation: 19. [ Q x d5 + ] [ K h8 ] 20. [ N f7 + ] [ R x f7 ] 21. [ Q x f7 ] [This gives White the Exchange back and will be up a Bishop for a passed pawn. I don't like the position.]
 [ K g8 ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ B x d4 ]  [ Q f5 ]  [ Q x f5 ]  [ B x f5 ] , [ R e2 ]  Now white has given back the pawn and the position is very drawish though black has a slightly better position to be in for the first time this whole game white has the the edge gained by having the first move.
 [ b5 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ N x e5 ] , [ f x e5 ]  This is the idea behind White's early f-pawn push. Black's knight is chased away making it easier to attack the kingside. Traditionally this is followed by a bishop sacrifice on [ h7 ] although in this game Black's fianchetto has made this impossible.
 [ N b5 ]  [ g6 ]  [ N e3 ]  [ B x b5 ] , [ Q x b5 ]  A point I thought worth noticing was 11....[ Q e8 ] Black moves his Queen IN LINE with White's Queen as to threaten it although covered by the Knight on [ c3 ] at the time but as you will see when White threatens it Black shys away...it just made me think a little more
 [ N e5 ]  [ N e6 + ]  [ K d7 ] , [ K b1 ]  [ c7 ] is becoming the center of the world.
 [ N x d4 ] , [ R g5 ]  The rook should occupy one of the open files. 26...[ R d5 ] can be followed up by ...Rfd8. The rooks must work in tandem.
 [ e x d6 ]  [ e ] , [ p ]  After this move black loses material. He will lose at least a rook.
 [ f x g5 ] , [ B f5 ]  Mmmmm passed pawns the stuff of fortune and fame. My bishop move is designed to strand the knight on [ a3 ] to defense even if only momentarily but more importantly I cover [ h7 ] and [ g6 ] too.
 [ Q c4 ]  [ Q f7 ]  [ Q b4 ] , [ R c8 ]  At this point I decide to try for a back-rank mate anyway.
 [ Q x e1 ] , [ d x e5 ]  At this point Black might well have been thinking that he had reasonable drawing chances as to balance his underused Q-side White is running out of troops. However...
 [ R f1 ]  [ g x f5 ]  [ N x f5 ]  [ B x f5 ]  [ R x f5 ]  [ Q e6 ]  [ g4 ] , [ h5 ]  Here I have multiple attacks if I take his pawn (hxg4) and he takes back (h3g4) he leaves me [ R h1 + ] and me taking his queen
 [ N x e5 ] , [ Q c7 ]  [ Q c7 ] doubles the attack on [ h2 ] hence N retreats to [ f3 ] to protect [ h2 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ B b7 ] , [ B e4 ]  [ B b7 ] eyes the p at [ d5 ] so the Bishop protects at [ e4 ]  [ f5 ] , [ B c2 ]  [ f5 ] forces the Bishop to [ c2 ]  [ R f6 ] , [ B e3 ]  Not too sure of black's plan with the [ R f6 ] I finally develop the Bishop at [ e3 ]  [ B d4 ] , [ R f7 ]  The R retreats leaving Pawn at [ d5 ] unprotected and having control of [ e5 ] decided to trade Bishops
 [ Q h5 + ] , [ K d7 ]  Escaping Q side. Now white can continue with [ c4 ] winning easily.
 [ e5 ]  [ B x f3 ]  [ R x f3 ]  [ N g4 ] , [ R d1 ]  threatening clearly to destroy my pawns structure... If you can try to guess my next move i have been thinking quite a lot on it.
 [ O-O ]  [ B g7 ]  [ B f4 ] , [ R b8 ]  developing the Rook to an open file with a threat
 [ N f6 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ e6 ]  With my center secured I now have to develop my pieces.
 [ Q c6 ] , [ c3 ]  Solidifying my position further.
 [ B x e4 ] , [ B x e4 + ]  ... well of course not 21. Rxe4? as followed by Qg6!
 [ g6 ] , [ a4 ]  ? - played without thinking about a b4! response
 [ K e2 ] , [ K c3 ]  And by taking away [ d2 ] black is forced onto the rim.
 [ R x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ] , [ Q b5 + ]  Now Her Majesty weighs in
 [ B g4 ]  [ Q g3 ]  [ B x f4 ]  [ Q x f4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N d2 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ B x e2 ]  [ R x e2 ]  [ R a d1 ]  [ Q b6 ]  [ b3 ]  [ R d8 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ R x a2 ]  [ N g5 ]  [ h6 ]  [ N h3 ]  [ Q x b3 ] , [ R d e1 ]  i let the past 2 pawns fal so i could set things up for a mating attack
 [ K f2 ] , [ Q e2 + ]  King moves out of check again but queen continues up e file to recheck with knight in support.
 [ e4 ]  [ Q f4 + ]  [ K g7 ]  [ B x e4 ]  [ Q x e4 ]  [ Q x e4 ]  [ B x e4 ] , [ R c8 ]  37. [ R c8 ] - I am now a whole rook up but my opponent refuses to wave the white flag. Mind you again my time management is letting me down I have 3 moves to make before the time control and I have less than 5 minutes on my clock. It is 40 moves in an hour and a half and then 15 minutes is added on when the time control is met. Anyone who fails to make 40 moves in an hour and a half or whose flag falls at the end of the 15 minutes added on will forfeit the game on time.
 [ N c3 ]  [ N g6 ]  [ O-O-O ]  [ N h4 ]  [ R h f1 ]  [ O-O ]  [ g3 ]  [ N x f3 ]  [ R x f3 ] , [ d6 ]  i made this move withb the aim of [ b g4 ] eventually winning a rook for a bishop
 [ N f3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B d6 ] , [ c5 ]  like taking candy from a child...
 [ K x e6 ]  [ g3 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ R a2 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ R f3 ]  [ a4 ]  [ b4 ]  [ N c4 ]  [ b5 ]  [ c5 ]  [ d x c5 ]  [ B x c5 ]  [ K g2 ]  [ B x a3 ]  [ Q f2 ]  [ B c1 ]  [ R c2 ]  [ B a3 ]  [ R a2 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ Q c2 ]  [ h x g3 ] , [ Q b1 ]  Ouch. [ N d2 ] forks the queen and f rook. Either black knight but [ N e d2 ] is clearly the superior choice as the c knight guards the black bishop.
 [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ] , [ N d4 ]  8. ...... [ N d4 ] - in come the cavalry!
 [ d x e5 ]  [ Q x e5 ] , [ Q d6 ]  the activity of the white queen seems to bother the black and as i mentiond earlier exchanging pieces will be for black much better chances to release him self .
 [ N x f6 + ]  [ d5 ] , [ B x d5 + ]  after [ Q x d5 ] N[ f x d5 ] [ N x f3 + ] [ g x f3 ] [ e x f2 + ] [ K x f2 ] [ R b8 ] White is better... but far from winning...
 [ c5 ]  [ O-O-O ] , [ c4 ]  Black cannot allow the d file to open. Sample line: 16...[ c x d4 ] 17.[ R x d4 ] [ N c7 ] 18.[ B x c7 + ] [ K x c7 ] 19.[ N x d5 + ] looks pretty bad for Black.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ a6 ]  [ B x c6 ] , [ d x c6 ]  ruy lopez - exchange variation my favorite.
 [ Q h4 ]  [ B g3 ] , [ B x f2 + ]  Since I don't really know this game well we'll see how this good opportunity vanishes in the end.
 [ N f4 + ]  [ K f2 ]  [ Q x h4 + ]  [ K e3 ]  [ B g5 ] , [ N x a8 ]  Too greedy he should be worrying about his king now
 [ f x e4 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ N x f6 + ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N c6 ] , [ B e4 ]  aiming to trade light-squared bishops
 [ d5 ] , [ c3 ]  ? Oh so thats all about the previous move. One can see that white has no idea what to play not to mention a bigger plan or strategy.
 [ B g6 + ]  [ K e7 ]  [ R e1 + ]  [ K d6 ]  [ B f4 + ]  [ K c6 ] , [ R e6 # ]  Voila! Wasn't that pretty?
 [ B d4 ] , [ B d6 ]  The white queen has to leave and has not many places to go.
 [ N e4 ] , [ d5 ]  And so does this!
 [ N d1 ] , [ N d3 ]  Adolph Anderssen once remarked about Knights posted on the sixth rank that "they are like a rusty nail in your knee!" Or a bone in your throat -- pick your metaphor.
 [ b x a5 ] , [ R x a5 ]  Unless one has played in long Classical World Championship matches it is hard for most chess players to understand the importance of psychology home preparation momentum and other rarely seen off the board factors. Carlsen has a big edge in match experience but Caruana has adjusted very well after a shaky game 1. Big kudos to his team for preparing him nicely. This now has become a really interesting psychological battle.
 [ R x h5 ]  [ f x g5 ] , [ R x g5 ]  ! The obvious move 21...[ B x g5 ] is playable but not remotely as strong. Now Black bears down on [ g2 ] with overwhelming force.
 [ a4 ]  [ R f c8 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ N x d3 + ] , [ c x d3 ]  White's pawns are doubled again but this time the 2nd pawn actually strengthens white's center. He could either trade his [ d4 ] pawn if black pushed his c pawn and still maintain a pawn front on the d and e files or support his e pawn during a push forward. At this point both positions are almost identical. Black's rook on the b file is easily countered and the differences in pawn structure are almost negligible.
 [ K g7 ] , [ Q e5 + ]  If 40. ... [ K h8 ] 41. [ h x h6 ] and black is quickly mate by 42. [ R g2 + ] etc. or Rh2+etc. depending on black's option.
 [ N x e5 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ N d7 ] , [ B x e7 ]  This gives me the move I wanted.
 [ R e3 ] , [ B d5 ]  Saves his Bishop.
 [ R d1 ] , [ R x d1 + ]  I gladly swap Rooks. White is now significantly behind in time as his entire K-side still must be developed.
 [ B c5 ] , [ a4 ]  Again I think the rook pawn is odd at this stage
 [ b3 ] , [ a5 ]  The pawn is now in serious trouble and there is little to be done to save it 7. ... [ c x b4 ] 8. [ B x b5 ] [ c x b5 ] 9. [ Q x b3 ] evens material with a strong center and a big gain in development
 [ f4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ f x e5 ]  [ d6 ]  [ e x d6 ]  [ B x d6 ] , [ N f3 ]  The weird and wonderful Birds From Gambit...the position is meant to allow black the opportunity of mobilising his pieces quickly in return for the pawn which can be equalized quickly anyway....in theory! In practice I had alot of trouble with black but had some good successes with the white pieces....this game being one of them.
 [ d x e4 ] , [ Q a4 + ]  ?! Having said that I would not be troubled with this check. Instead I would respond with 4...[ B d7 ] as after white retreats I'd then answer with 5...[ N f6 ] But I like Charles next move just as well since he's continuing with his development whereas white's Q will be prone to harrassment since he developed this before his other pieces. In return that will give black a space advantage. As far as I'm concerned this is where white starts to go wrong even though it's not a losing move.
 [ N e3 ] , [ Q a5 + ]  11. ...[ Q e7 ] better to move the queen back to safety
 [ Q f5 ]  [ Q d4 + ]  [ K g8 ] , [ N e4 ]  ! -- poisoning the f-pawn just about as much as a pawn can be poisoned. If 40. ...Qf4?? 41. [ N f6 + ] wins.
 [ N a5 ]  [ K b4 ] , [ N b7 ]  WHAT was I thinking here putting my knight there to attack the pawn...
 [ a4 ] , [ B x a4 ]  No real choice. Note no good is 27...[ B d7 ] which follows 28.Bxd7! [ Q x d7 ] 29.[ Q x c4 ] winning the Knight and Bishop for a Bishop.
 [ R x a5 ] , [ N b6 ]  Again attacking the Bishop which is in a very strong position now
 [ Q f3 + ]  [ K g8 ] , [ B d3 ]  Protecting the pawn. Also allows for short castle.
 [ N f3 ]  [ B x c3 + ] , [ b x c3 ]  The book considers [ B x c3 + ] generally not such a great idea because White fairly easily undoubles the pawns and often ends up with the Bishop pair
 [ b5 ]  [ N a7 ]  [ c4 ]  [ c6 ]  [ c5 ]  [ b x c5 ] , [ b6 ]  It seem to me this is the only alternative. After 26. [ Q x [ c5 ] ] [ N x b5 ] 27. [ Q x e5 ] [ [ a4 ] ] and after 28. [ Q [ c5 ] ] white will be constantly troubled by black's pawns on the queenside. It is unclear whether white will eventually be able to stop them. La única alternativa. Después de 26. D[ x [ c5 ] ] C[ x b5 ] 27. D[ x e5 ] [ [ a4 ] ] 28. D[ c5 ] el blanco tendrá la constante preocupación de detener los peones pasados y ligados del negro y en realidad no es claro que pueda siquiera lograrlo.
 [ c4 ] , [ c6 ]  7. [ c4 ] doesn't gain much but it does open up [ c3 ] for the white knight. Black's response challenges white's center but it allows white to isolate another black pawn.
 [ K g7 ] , [ f4 ]  Finally a pawn break!
 [ B d3 ] , [ a5 ]  Now he has decision to make. I'm ready either way...I think.
 [ R d5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ R d4 ] , [ N f3 ]  [ N e2 ] would have protected Pf4.
 [ B c4 ] , [ B g7 ]  Seizing the long diagonal.
 [ e5 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ O-O ]  [ R e8 ]  [ Q c2 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ b3 ]  [ B g4 ] , [ Q d1 ]  A slow move [ N x e5 ] is more dynamic
 [ O-O ] , [ N c6 ]  finally development
 [ N x f2 ] , [ Q f3 ]  Realizing that my Rook was en-prise and not thinking hard about what to do (because of the time crunch) on top of not being able to castle and being a pawn down I play a move that's unsound and easy to drive off. It's actually similar to a cheapo tactic but for coaching purposes since I don't want the game timing out either. And yes as Ken noted with one of Jeff's annotations "Shutting down a kibitzer" it's very easy to drive off. But this unlike other games with the time crunch is where I use TA's strategies from his blitz Q sac (where Joe gives up his Q by the second or third move and wins) to test Perry and see if he finds the best. In other words it's another example of where I use Joe's method to teach chess. What he plays is what I thought he'd do but this is where I coach since his next move is going to cost him the game.
 [ f4 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ f5 ]  I go ahead and start attacking in earnest before black gets a chance to get caught up in development.
 [ B d2 ]  [ Q c5 ] , [ c4 ]  I want to move the night so that I can play [ b4 ] and consolidate the pawn on [ d6 ] that will be really difficult for black to play if I can do that.
 [ Q e7 ] , [ B b5 + ]  Once again he can't use his light-coloured bishop to get rid of the threat because of 9. [ Q x b7 ]  [ Q h5 ] , [ N f6 ]  At this point I wasn't happy with my position because my queen was on the run. Black on the other hand kept developing pieces with tempo.
 [ e x d4 ]  [ e x d4 ] , [ N x d4 ]  loss of 1 pawn
 [ B e5 + ] , [ d4 ]  The only defence
 [ Q x c3 ]  [ N x c3 ]  [ N x e6 ]  [ f x e6 ] , [ B x e6 ]  The less dangerous position for black is reached. I am pretty sure [ R d7 ] is black's best move but I was staring at an elegant knight replacement.
 [ O-O ]  [ b6 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ c6 ]  This is a moment when development is finished and sloughter is to begin
 [ N c3 ] , [ f x e4 ]  ok you don't want my pawn me yes.
 [ c3 ]  [ B c1 ] , [ R a e8 ]  White's centre is coming in for a terrible battering but it's still holding up...
 [ Q f6 ] , [ B x d3 ]  If I had played [ Q h7 ] he couldnt have taken this true or QxB and [ e3 ] and the N can be taken.
 [ Q x g5 ]  [ R x f6 ]  [ g x f6 ] , [ Q e1 ]  17. [ Q e1 ] - my pawn on [ e3 ] is very weak so is the one on [ e4 ] but never fear Glenda the Defender is here! I still need to develop my queen knight though. However black's threats delay this as I must escape Old Matey's shadow after 17. Bh3.
 [ R b1 ] , [ e4 ]  Once more Black advances a Pawn. White defends the already marginalised light-side Bishop by retreating. This move also strengthens my dark-side Bishop who no longer has a competitor on the White-side.
 [ K b4 ]  [ K d3 ]  [ K b3 ]  [ K d2 ] , [ K b2 ]  i tried to not to check when he changed him pawn to queen..
 [ a6 ]  [ B a4 ] , [ b5 ]  I love pushing this pawn.
 [ Q a5 + ]  [ c3 ]  [ B g4 ] , [ N f3 ]  Two relatively cheap attacks that merely gave White excuses to develop although there are two pins in place.
 [ B d2 ] , [ N e7 ]  Now I can castle either direction. If he plays [ N a2 ] I'm happy to trade bishops. I'm curious if he'll threaten my other bishop with [ N h4 ] again. I don't think he would because I'll just recapture with the knight. In this closed position the knights are probably stronger than the bishops. But I'm not sure what other threat he's going to work on. Maybe I can start looking at some counter-attacks. I'd like to play c5. It's guarded three times. I'd probably recapture with the bishop so it is attacking [ f2 ] and so my knight on [ d7 ] then attacks the pawn on e5. That's if he trades. But before I can do that I'll want to play [ a6 ] so his knight can't come up to b5. I like it that his knight doesn't have any strong squares to move to right now.
 [ K d8 ] , [ N e5 ]  my favourite piece Knight on the run
 [ R f e1 ] , [ O-O ]  Now [ d7 ] has two defenders again and I should be able to chase the knight away and take the pawn.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ] , [ N f3 ]  So I play my usual after 1...e5.
 [ K e2 ]  [ R x d4 ]  [ K f3 ]  [ N e5 + ] , [ K e3 ]  Time to run out my clock making three second moves while stopping him from immediately mating me.
 [ f x e5 ]  [ f x e5 ] , [ Q e2 ]  Again perhaps a bit negative you're still letting me force the pace rather than forcing me to respond to your moves. Imagine a long distance race against someone you know is a strong finisher you don't stay with them you accelerate deaccelerate trying to use their energy up.... similar analogy here....
 [ B g1 ]  [ K d5 ]  [ B b6 ]  [ K c6 ] , [ B e3 ]  What Caruana is banking on is even if he has to sacrifice his Bishop for the a pawn he c and h pawn will march and the White Bishop will have to try to defend them and he can simply take the f pawn = draw.
 [ Q x d6 ]  [ O-O ] , [ Q e7 ]  ? a waste why move the queen twice? better was 0-0
 [ N c3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ e3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B d3 ]  [ d x c4 ]  [ B x c4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N c6 ]  [ d x c5 ]  [ B x c5 ] , [ Q c2 ]  start attack by occupying b1-[ h7 ] diagonal as a base
 [ N d7 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ h6 ]  [ Q d2 ] , [ N e7 ]  Six pawns on the sixth row and Knights on [ e7 ] and [ d7 ] - a typical setup for the Hippo. The major headache for White is where to put his pieces and find a soft spot to attack.
 [ N d5 ] , [ B b5 ]  The queen is pinned to the king
 [ R c2 ] , [ B x a5 ]  Another pawn less for Black.
 [ N d5 ]  [ Q d7 ] , [ f5 ]  [ N c5 ] looks nice but sadly doesn't actually do anything after [ Q d8 ]  [ N e5 ] , [ h5 ]  The attack now breaks through
 [ Q e7 ]  [ N x h8 ] , [ N x e4 ]  Threatening to win the queen with [ N x c3 ] .
 [ e4 ] , [ c5 ]  My toughest victory to date a hard fought game against Joanne. It's an unrated game because when she challenged me Joanne's rating was 140 points higher than mine (1627 vs. 1767) so she went for friendly rather than fierce. She begins with the Open Game and I respond with the Sicilian.
 [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ] , [ R x d5 ]  ..so now white is in trouble...the knight is a total weak point...I can double quickly on the a-file and its good knight irene from here...[ Q e2 ] should be played i think but...
 [ R c d1 ]  [ B e3 + ]  [ K g3 ] , [ R a b8 ]  taking the halfopen b-rank as well and attacking the pawn on [ b2 ]  [ b3 ] , [ B b7 ]  here my opponent ran out of time it was a great game I wonder how it would've ended. please r&c
 [ f5 ] , [ e x f5 ]  shouldn't have done that
 [ B b3 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ N g6 ]  [ N x e6 ]  [ f x e6 ]  [ a4 ]  [ N g x e5 ]  [ B x e5 ] , [ N x e5 ]  24. .......... [ N x e5 ] - material equality is restored. Mission accomplished. White has a slight edge here due to me having an isolani and white's pawns being more advanced. However things can change.
 [ b x c4 ]  [ B x c4 ]  [ R c8 ]  [ B b3 ]  [ g5 ]  [ R x a7 ]  [ f4 ]  [ B d5 ]  [ g4 ] , [ R a8 ]  Trading away rooks to prevent counterplay with plans to push the a pawn.
 [ h3 ] , [ N e5 ]  The fork is in place. Neither the queen nor bishop can safely move to protect the other.
 [ f5 ]  [ e x f6 ]  [ e ] , [ p ]  15. [ e x f6 ] ep - renewing the mate threat.
 [ Q x a8 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ Q a4 ]  [ N a6 ]  [ B x a6 ]  [ b x a6 ]  [ c x b4 ]  [ Q b7 ]  [ N e2 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ B c3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N d2 ] , [ c5 ]  Black exposes a threat to the white queen.
 [ N x e5 ] , [ d x e4 ]  Somewhat expected though not too good.
 [ N x a6 ] , [ e x f4 ]  So the bishop is taken but I am still +1 on the count.
 [ N e3 ] , [ R e1 ]  I'm ok losing N and pawn for a R. But maybe I was wrong. I could have taken [ g2 ] for free but I felt I needed to "build up" some more before acting.
 [ B h6 ] , [ B x f6 ]  This move to attack my queen has left my bishop an open line right thru whites position. My bishop on [ h6 ] will know sit.
 [ O-O ] , [ h3 ]  A waiting move perhaps?
 [ e4 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ e x d3 ]  [ Q d2 ] , [ d x e2 ]  Were it not for his N on [ d4 ] I would've captured and placed him in check with my [ R e8 ] instead as that would've also gotten his Q. However I assumed that I was now an entire piece up. And I know why as I didn't overlook what Tom could've done. But I had Ghost Vision thinking that somehow he was down by an additional piece then what I had calculated. And that's because I visualized another B from the earlier fork.
 [ c5 ] , [ d5 ]  7. [ d5 ] - trying to create a cramp on Ion.
 [ R b2 ] , [ f5 ]  Let's break up the pawns a bit.
 [ R f3 ] , [ Q h4 ]  That's why I played this. But right after this move it was noon and I had to go. So there was just no way that I could continue with this game since I had to get ready for work. And at the time we both agreed that it would be very difficult for either side to win. The reason for me is that it would now take very little for me to go wrong and lose which I've done in this situation against either Carl or Tom Walsh.. With past unfinished games Nathan would take a picture of the position but the problem is that we'd forget where we were. Thus the game would just remain as unfinished with no end. Keeping that in mind along with how difficult it would be for either side to win Nathan offered me a draw. And I promptly accepted the offer.
 [ g x f5 ]  [ N g3 ] , [ N d3 ]  Knight jumps to an unprotected square behind enemy lines and forking rook and bishop.
 [ d5 ]  [ c4 ]  [ c6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ d x c4 ] , [ a4 ]  Both players made a good opening...
 [ Q x g4 + ] , [ K c2 ]  white's best option here is probably to play [ Q e2 ] to stop the bleeding.... but he tries to run to satety because of his own attack that he wants to resume
 [ N g6 ]  [ a5 ]  [ B c5 ] , [ b4 ]  Strong enough i guess..
 [ B e7 ] , [ h4 ]  Might as well see what this passed pawn can do.
 [ O-O ]  [ O-O ] , [ N f5 ]  Now [ N f5 ] starts to eye the [ h6 ] pawn. 8 ... [ d6 ] is probably best.
 [ B x d5 ] , [ N x d4 ]  And save my Knight (With a snack) but...
 [ R x d7 ]  [ Q x f8 + ]  [ R d8 ]  [ Q f5 + ]  [ R d7 ] , [ R e8 + ]  pay attention to the final position. it looks like a problem solved.
 [ b x c4 ] , [ N x c4 ]  I thought 15. [ d x c4 ] left my e pawn in a precarious position
 [ R x a4 ]  [ K d2 ] , [ R c4 ]  ...or not. I initially dismissed this line as trivial: superficially it looks like an empty threat from Black; if Black captures the knight it seems a pointless rook sac and Black goes to -4 in material. However that is far from the truth. (I'm on my ph so can't post my lines but why don't you give it a go? ) White is again forced into fighting withdrawal as I couldn't find any move other than [ R d3 ] which didn't end in disaster! White is slowly steadily being outplayed. But through luck they are still a pawn up. If White can get its King out of jeopardy and double or triple on the d file or force Black to simplify they may just fall over the line. If.
 [ c x d5 ]  [ c x d5 ] , [ Q x d5 ]  Probably should have taken with the knight.
 [ R x f8 ] , [ R e7 ]  again if [ K x g3 ] [ B f2 ] wins a rook. This move surprised me but is harmless.
 [ Q c7 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ N b d7 ]  [ N x f6 + ]  [ N x f6 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ B x f6 ] , [ Q x h5 ]  Losing another pawn but Black managed to prevent certain catastrophe.
 [ N x e3 ]  [ Q x e3 ]  [ Q b6 ] , [ N d1 ]  too late.
 [ Q x d5 ]  [ B x d5 ]  [ a4 ] , [ B c4 ]  White's pawn on [ a3 ] was en prise and needed saving but 27. a4? gets another question mark since now white loses the exchange. 27. [ R a1 ] would have held the pawn. The pile grows.
 [ K e1 ] , [ Q h4 + ]  The other bishop is dead now
 [ e5 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ N f6 ]  This move is less aggressive than 2.[ N f3 ] but often leads to more violent play.
 [ Q x d6 ] , [ R x e2 ]  Desperation. As I said earlier [ c2 ] looks the only possible square for the rook. 29. ... [ f x e4 ] gives white the chance to throw it away: 30.[ f x e4 ] [ N h g4 ] 31.Qxc5? ([ Q a6 ] is the correct move) [ N d3 ] 32.[ B x d3 ] [ R g2 ] 33.[ K h1 ] [ R h2 ] 34.[ K g1 ] [ R g2 ] and a draw by repetition.
 [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ e6 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ a6 ] , [ O-O-O ]  8. 0-0-0. The sequence of moves between 1. [ e4 ] and now is called the Richter Rauzer Variation of the Sicilian. It seems like the Sicilian Dragon in that both players castle on opposite sides etc... As you can see all my pieces bar Frere Leblanc are off the back rank and even he flies the coup on move 12.
 [ Q e2 ]  [ N x f3 + ]  [ Q x f3 ] , [ f x g3 ]  
 [ B e5 ] , [ R h3 ]  Looking to get my queen to [ h5 ] to threaten [ Q x h7 ]  [ B d4 + ]  [ K h1 ] , [ Q g4 ]  This is a major blunder in my view black is looking for the queen exchange he has however forgotten about the pin The analysis suggests [ Q f6 ]  [ R c c7 ] , [ R g3 ]  and there it is
 [ g6 ]  [ R h5 h8 + ]  [ K g7 ] , [ R h1 h7 + ]  next my knight will go to [ f6 ] he will go to [ e6 ] my queen will come to [ h3 ] etc. he resigns.
 [ K c3 ]  [ N x g2 ]  [ a4 ] , [ b6 ]  basically fully locking up the queen side as the pawns can no longer force anything through. With the white king shut out from the king side I want to make that the only place where chess is played.
 [ N f3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ d4 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ c3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ Q c2 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ c4 ] , [ B f5 ]  Searching for a Semi Indian Defense black goes for all
 [ B c5 ]  [ N f5 ] , [ B d4 ]  ??
 [ B x f6 ]  [ N d5 ] , [ B x d5 ]  It was unnecessary to give up the bishop pair as 17...[ Q c5 + ] (which I missed of course) 18.[ K h1 ] [ B g5 ] would retain it but White's position is more active and you can't say that Black's bishops are doing very much in that position.
 [ K h4 ] , [ R h6 + ]  The black king goes back on [ g5 ]  [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ h3 ]  [ h6 ]  [ g4 ]  [ B e4 ]  [ N b d2 ]  [ e6 ]  [ e3 ] , [ f5 ]  Interesting well known but not much played for a reason.
 [ B g4 ] , [ Q g3 ]  I wanted to keep [ c3 ] free for now.
 [ N d7 ] , [ B a3 ]  The bishop does nothing on a3.
 [ Q e5 ] , [ a5 ]  Mate in 4.
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ a6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ B b3 ] , [ b5 ]  A well-known position. Bobby Fischer scored many fine wins with White using this set-up.
 [ N f3 ] , [ b6 ]  Trying to get rid of the irritating c5-pawn.
 [ d4 ] , [ B b4 ]  Transposing fully into the Winawer Variation.
 [ R f d8 ] , [ R x f5 + ]  And as White's material dwindles so do his chances.
 [ Q x h6 ]  [ B e6 ] , [ Q x g6 + ]  +-
 [ K c7 ]  [ N a8 + ]  [ K b7 ]  [ K d4 ]  [ K x a8 ]  [ K c5 ] , [ B x a4 ]  ChessMaster considers this as a mistake and proposes [ b7 ] as the better alternative. Indeed it saves Black a-pawn and only delays Bxa4...
 [ R x a2 ] , [ R d3 ]  Better IMO [ R d5 ] but there's not a great difference.
 [ K x f7 ] , [ Q f3 + ]  Checking the king and threatening the knight on d5.
 [ N c4 + ]  [ K b4 ] , [ N e5 ]  This is the point I suddenly realized on move 20 when I was sitting at the computer. Ironically I had gotten to the position after 21. ... [ K b4 ] previously in my analysis and concluded there was no way White could play this line. He has two pieces en prise and he can't defend them both. It was only several hours later that I came back to this move and realized White doesn't HAVE to defend them both!
 [ O-O ] , [ e6 ]  ...or [ R g8 ] at once. Black wisely (IMO) leaves the black diagonal open for the pieces instead of allowing tempoes to white going [ e4 ] (if ever allowed).
 [ B x a4 ] , [ N x a4 ]  the rook can wait
 [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ] , [ N e7 ]  Probably the best square for the knight to retain activity.
 [ Q x c6 ] , [ R h g8 ]  27. ….. [ R h g8 ] - still thinking about attacking Henry's castled position. In the meanwhile a familiar dark dark shadow is moving ever closer to King Joe - that's right our Chessic Grim Reaper Old Matey is not that far away.
 [ Q a3 ] , [ Q d7 ]  simply defending.
 [ N e3 ]  [ R g6 ] , [ N f5 ]  I can see the [ h6 ] space being filled with a rook or queen and then backed up threatening h7.
 [ N f6 ]  [ B c4 ] , [ d5 ]  6. ........ [ d5 ] - opening a line for Fou Leblanc. You would never believe that he stays at home until the game is 30 moves old but he does.
 [ Q c6 ]  [ Q x f5 ]  [ R a e8 ] , [ Q d7 + ]  Forcing the exchange of queens
 [ e x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ] , [ N x d5 ]  Unfortunately this game happened before my first lesson with Ken. Therefore I exchange pieces just because it's possible to do so. Now how this game occurred after the lesson I would've denied it with 5.[ N e2 ] followed by 6.[ N f4 ] to leave my N well placed as in theory for general games I might need this at a later time. But since this happened before the game that did not come into consideration. All I cared about exchanging in order to continue with my development as we'll see when 5.[ N f3 ] is played.
 [ O-O ] , [ a6 ]  4.. [ g6 ] or 4.. N[ g6 ] are the "book" moves according to M.C.O.-13.
 [ b3 ] , [ Q f6 ]  If black moves his knight I must stop the queen from moving down the diagonal.
 [ R a c1 ]  [ B x d4 + ]  [ Q x d4 ] , [ Q b6 ]  Black usually has the better endgame in Maroczy Bind so White shouldn't allow me to force trades
 [ K h8 ]  [ R e d2 ] , [ B c5 ]  black would appretiate bishops exchange
 [ R e e2 ] , [ R f c1 ]  Trying to prevent 24...[ R c2 ] but there were much bigger concerns which is what's happening right now being the threat.
 [ N c x d5 ]  [ c x d5 ] , [ N x d5 ]  Thank you my dear horses!
 [ K h8 ]  [ B b4 ] , [ R g8 ]  24. ..... [ R g8 ] - still not given up the idea of a mating attack.
 [ d4 ] , [ N b1 ]  Probably best white aims to redirect the knight to [ c4 ] via [ N a3 ]  [ b5 ] , [ N a3 ]  Ok so I had achieveed what I had wanted though this is because I had seriously misjudged the problems involved with exchanging my good bishop but I have something to work with will blacks queenside attack be enough to win the position? that remains to be seen.
 [ d x c3 ] , [ R d1 ]  [ R x f2 ] is still the better choice. Second best is Kxc3. This move is a blunder.
 [ N x c4 ] , [ b5 ]  That's when Ding goes on the offense.
 [ B b5 ] , [ N c6 ]  By playing [ B b5 ] I had hoped to hinder the development of the black knight maybe prompt an exchange of bishops. If my opponent had played [ a6 ] I would have countered with Qa4. After [ B x f2 + ] [ K x f2 ] [ R x d2 + ] [ K e3 ] my queen would have a better shot at the 8th rank for the win. If then he played [ R d8 ] my rooks would be easier to develop. My opponent however exchanges the knight to take advantage of the open position with his two bishops.
 [ R x g4 ] , [ K x g4 ]  ...leaving another pawn ending.
 [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ N g5 ]  4. [ d3 ] [ B e7 ] (4... Bc5) 5. O-O O-O 6. [ h3 ] (6. [ R e1 ] [ [ d6 ] ] 7. [ B b3 ] [ N a5 ] 8. [ B a4 ] [ [ a6 ] ] =) 6... [ [ d6 ] ] 7. [ c3 ] [ N a5 ] 8. [ B [ b5 ] ] [ [ a6 ] ] 9. [ B a4 ] [ b5 ] 10. [ B c2 ] [ c5 ] = Black has Ruy Lopez-style counterplay 4. [ d4 ] ex[ d4 ] 5. O-O B[ c5 ] Is the Max Lange attack which has been analysed to death for several centuries with no firm conclusions. I prefer 5...[ N x e4 ] as easier to play although that's quite sharp too
 [ K h2 ] , [ c6 ]  With this move the White Queen is blocked from [ e8 ] the Black rook is free and [ d5 ] is protected. Now it should be apparent that the four connected black pawns on the queenside are the major force in this game.
 [ N x g6 ] , [ R c e8 ]  I can't take the Knight without further losses so instead I move Rook to [ e6 ] which protects my Bishop and Queen
 [ Q b2 + ]  [ K d1 ] , [ B f6 ]  Black avoids the threat on the bishop. If [ Q h6 ] [ R f7 ] and that's all.
 [ h4 ] , [ b5 ]  My turn to go on. White is blocked on the queenside!
 [ K e7 ]  [ Q c7 + ]  [ K e6 ]  [ Q c8 + ]  [ K e7 ]  [ Q c7 + ] , [ K f6 ]  I might have searched for a possible win 'long about here but I was desperately short of time; so short that even repeating moves wasn't giving me enough back on the increment.
 [ Q b7 ]  [ b4 ]  [ N h7 ]  [ R f d1 ]  [ Q e7 ]  [ R d b1 ]  [ Q g5 ]  [ Q e3 ] , [ Q g6 ]  With my lead I lose focus in the game and look what happens later
 [ d x c5 ]  [ B x c5 ]  [ b4 ] , [ B d6 ]  Not a great looking move but again it's hard to see what could've been better. Marshall has played excellently and it's hard to find an improvement. But Capablanca was just a little bit better. (Of course he was just a little bit better than *everybody*.)
 [ Q x e6 ]  [ N x e6 ]  [ R x a7 ] , [ R x h2 ]  There is some danger of a pawn promotion for white due to the connected passed pawns but black has a chance to promote first.
 [ K a7 ] , [ R f1 ]  Stops the immediate mate. Possibly Jo was hoping Black might play 23...Qxc2? when 24.Qc5ch forces the draw. I'll come back to this motif.
 [ Q x h3 ] , [ f4 ]  ! Black could play for a draw with [ Q g3 + ] continual check.
 [ K x h5 ] , [ d5 ]  Things look a lot different now I win because of one pawn.
 [ B c2 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ K f3 ]  [ K f6 ] , [ K f4 ]  What has gone wrong here? In trying hard to find a winning play White has fallen asleep and leave his Rook ripe for the picking.
 [ B x c6 + ] , [ b x c6 ]  thitho: taking with queen wouldn't have changed for a better: you would have taken back with your own queen...
 [ R g7 ] , [ N x h5 ]  Now this looked like ever such a clever move when I did it. Slight snag though....
 [ h3 ] , [ N f6 ]  Black develops a piece. The position is about =. White looks better.
 [ N f3 ]  [ b5 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ O-O ]  [ h6 ]  [ B f4 ] , [ f6 ]  Weakens black's kingside castle. Probably dangerous since white is well developed on the kingside.
 [ e x f4 ]  [ B x f4 ] , [ B c6 ]  ?! Here I decided against objectively best 15...Qb6; 16.[ K g2 ] Qb2; 17.[ B d2 ] because now Black has to either give up the [ b7 ] pawn or allow 18.g5. The reason is that I liked the (objectively equal) position after 15...[ B c6 ] - it is very safe and still gives plenty of opportunity for long-term advantage due to the safer King and slightly better pawn structure (less weaknesses). This decision is a direct result of the competitive situation (explained in introduction).
 [ K d2 ]  [ N x c1 ] , [ N x e3 ]  Smart move for black. [ N c1 ] looks beyond rescue though [ Q f2 + ] KxN QxN makes an exchange.
 [ c x d4 ]  [ Q x c2 ]  [ h5 ] , [ K g7 ]  Black decides to prevent further advance and prepare a counterattacking pawn storn supported by the strong bishop.
 [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ] , [ c5 ]  Benoni defence. Here the main goal of Black is to break white's center with sac on c5.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ c3 ]  Relied on the Game DB for my opening
 [ Q x f3 ]  [ B x f3 ]  [ O-O-O ]  [ N d2 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ N h4 ]  [ K e2 ] , [ f5 ]  f5?! this creates a big weakness on [ e6 ] after [ N g5 ] not to mention the fork threat of Nf7.
 [ B e7 ] , [ f x e5 ]  Black unpinned his [ e5 ] pawn but didn't support it. He missed the threat. I would be remiss in my duty were I to fail to show him what he missed.
 [ N d4 ] , [ N c5 ]  [ N d4 ] attacks white's queen the queen must move to [ b1 ] [ c2 ] [ e2 ] [ e3 ] [ f3 ] g3? We can eliminate the following classed as non significant moves Q[ b1 ] And Q[ c2 ] Q[ e2 ] Q[ f3 ] restricts whites options to move its pieces We find finally two best moves for the queen so Q[ e3 ] or [ Q g3 ] choose one?
 [ f x e5 ]  [ d x e5 ] , [ N d5 ]  ! The key move of the combination as now the [ N f6 ] is attacked three times and cannot be defended a third. Capturing on [ d5 ] or [ e4 ] is impossible due to [ B x d8 ] and so black has no choice but to play a piece down.
 [ N f8 + ] , [ K g7 ]  Keeping guard of the bishop on h6.
 [ N x e4 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ N d7 ] , [ Q e2 ]  Putting extra pressure on the center. It can't last long. The important factor is that black is attacking a defended knight on [ e5 ] with even material (knight for knight) while white is attacking an under-defended knight on [ [ e4 ] ] threatenting to win a pawn. Black's knight cannot retreat from [ [ e4 ] ] or black will lose his queen: 6. ... Nf6?? 7. Nc6+.
 [ h6 ]  [ R x g7 ]  [ Q x g7 ] , [ Q b5 + ]  A mortal check due to the combined action of my bishop and rook.
 [ B b3 ] , [ B e7 ]  So this is where he places his B. If I were black I would have played 6...[ B c5 ] because the Master Mater adviced me to and Mr. Arboite (the assistant coach of Jack Stockel at the time implied to) place your B where it covers the most squares (which is also why I was taught to fianchetto them). For me that does not just apply for the midgame because the recommendation from Mr. Arboite applied during the beginning game. However this move is perfectly fine and it won't make a difference because Jim and I are both going to castle Kingside on our next move.
 [ K h6 ]  [ e7 ]  [ R e8 ] , [ B f6 ]  Black is now hopelessly lost. There is no defense to my threat of Bc6.
 [ f6 ] , [ Q x c3 ]  Not really a sac as after 15...[ f x g5 ] 16.Bxc6ch [ K e7 ] is merely an exchange (Black won't want to recapture 16...[ b x c6 ] 17.Qxc6ch [ K e7 ] 18.[ Q x a8 ] Ba6ch 14.[ K g1 ] When Black is the exchange plus pawn down and still has to activate half his remaining pieces). After16...[ K e7 ] 17.Qc5ch [ K f7 ] (17...[ K f6 ] 18.Qd4ch) 18.Ne5ch [ K f6 ] 19.[ Q d4 ] [ Q h5 ] (the sole escape square for the queen as 19...[ Q h6 ] 20.Ng4ch wins) 20.Ng6ch! [ K f7 ] (20...[ K x g6 ] 21.Be8ch) 21.Nxh8ch etc
 [ Q f5 ]  [ N x e6 ]  [ Q x e6 ] , [ g4 ]  Will he/she/it computer thingy take the bait?
 [ N f3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ Q e2 ] , [ B g4 ]  what else !?
 [ e4 ] , [ e5 ]  Typical King's Pawn Opening.
 [ d5 ] , [ N x e5 ]  Equilibrating the material situation losing one tempo and aggressively contesting the center.
 [ N c x d5 ] , [ R e8 ]  With him grabbing I decide to attack his Queen. Once he runs back I double up. This was also played to prevent the fork with 30.[ N e7 + ] which would win the Queen.
 [ B g4 ] , [ B e2 ]  His light-square bishop comes out to attack my knight so I defend it with mine. This is to maintain a good pawn structure so then if his bishop captures my knight I can take back and my bishop would sit nicely on the third rank...
 [ Q f2 ] , [ e4 ]  I was prepared to bring my rook to [ e8 ] either after [ f x e5 ] or after I pushed it further. After 21...[ [ e3 ] ] neither queen nor king can take safely on [ [ e3 ] ] due to R[ e8 ] and [ B e5 ] respectively.
 [ e4 ] , [ h5 ]  Sacrificing a pawn to relieve pressure.
 [ B d6 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ Q e7 ]  [ a3 ]  [ R c7 ] , [ R x c7 ]  I didn't want to allow the R's to double.
 [ e x f4 ] , [ R d1 ]  all in days' work...
 [ e x f7 + ] , [ R x f7 ]  I probably played [ R x f7 ] a bit too fast as now the bishop escapes to the vacated f5-square and wants to pin the rook. [ Q x f7 ] was better. As it is I look to win a rook for a pawn and knight but there probably were bigger gains.
 [ R a e1 ] , [ Q b8 ]  [ f5 ] [ g5 ] [ h5 ] [ f4 ] [ g3 ] and [ h2 ] are all covered. Computer significantly prefers 16. … [ Q d4 ] 17. [ Q x d4 ] [ B x d4 ] 18. [ a3 ] [ R f e8 ] 19. [ R x e8 + ] [ R x e8 ] 20. [ R e1 ] [ R x e1 + ] 21. [ B x e1 ] [ d6 ] 22. [ B d2 ] [ B x c3 ] 23. [ B x c3 ] [ B x d5 ] 24. [ B e2 ] [ B e4 ] 25. [ B x f6 ] [ g x f6 ] which leads directly to a fairly even endgame with a slight advantage to white caused by black's doubled and more scattered pawns.
 [ Q x g5 ] , [ h x g5 ]  Disaster strikes! I'd had something like this in mind since 12. ...[ h6 ] but it didn't become inevitable until 15. Bxg5.
 [ B e6 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ B x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ B x d4 ]  [ c3 ]  [ B b6 ]  [ K h1 ]  [ Q e7 ] , [ f4 ]  ? Sinply loses the pawn as 14...[ e x f4 ] 15.[ R x f4 ] [ g5 ] loses a bishop and it may take black a few moves but once the counter-attack gets rolling it will provide black compesation for the exposed King.
 [ d4 ]  [ N x e6 ] , [ R x e6 ]  Now I win the minor exchange. Next goal: remove the heavy artillery.
 [ K e4 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ K f5 ]  [ K c6 ]  [ K x g4 ] , [ K d5 ]  40. ..... [ K d5 ] - While Henry is busily tucking into that fine repast the BK now heads towards the centre to create some problems.
 [ b6 ]  [ B f8 ]  [ K e8 ] , [ e6 ]  With this forcing move Zuckertort induces the exchange of all the remaining pieces setting up a winning K and P end game.
 [ c7 ]  [ f1 = Q ]  [ c8 = Q + ] , [ K d1 ]  and i reply this. he cannot recheck with his queen. i thought he would reply with [ Q e6 ] most probably considering all avenues. and this is the position i got to in analysis and thought that accepting a draw on 43 wasnt wise. im pretty sure my Edged king vs his centralised king is an advantage in the battle of the queens. also considering my king is on white squares and my strong pawn is on a dark square protected by my queen currently.
 [ b4 ]  [ R f3 ]  [ R c3 ]  [ R b2 ]  [ R x e3 ]  [ R b3 ]  [ R x b3 ]  [ R x b3 ]  [ Q c1 ]  [ Q d7 ]  [ Q f4 + ]  [ K h1 ]  [ Q x e4 ]  [ Q x d6 ]  [ Q e1 + ]  [ K h2 ]  [ R b7 ] , [ Q c6 ]  so here is when I proposed the draw. Computer gives me a clear advantage but i don't think it is so clear. What about you?
 [ a3 ]  [ B x c3 + ] , [ b x c3 ]  Now black has to think about developing safely with the semiopen b column. [ b6 ] was simple and wise but it seemed not enough to me so...
 [ K h8 ]  [ h4 ]  [ b5 ] , [ B e6 ]  Invading enemy territory.
 [ B d2 ] , [ R h4 ]  A very strong idea. After 20...0-0 the Black position is solid but Black reasons that the h-file ought to be useful and his king looks reasonably safe on [ e8 ] (and after ..[ K f8 ] he's even safer). Certainly this is a sharp continuation as any Black slip will allow White direct counterplay against the stranded king but after this move Black is very active and highly coordinated along the dark squares. This is significant as White's bad bishop cannot help in defense along the dark squares giving Black the clear upper hand.
 [ a x b4 ]  [ Q b6 ]  [ Q d2 ] , [ h5 ]  Black initiates a kingside attack. Majorly behind in development and pieces will it be successful?
 [ N b5 ]  [ R e1 + ]  [ R x e1 ]  [ N x e1 ]  [ N x d6 ] , [ R c6 ]  Black is beginning to be a bit cautious as he doesn't wish to lose his rook to a knight fork with the king. The next few moves of Black are more defensive to ensure this does not occur.
 [ O-O-O ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ c4 ] , [ O-O-O ]  12... B-Q3! 13 B-[ K4 ] B-B5! simplifies.
 [ d5 ]  [ B b2 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ e3 ] , [ B g4 ]  This is something I've never seen in this opening.
 [ B x f5 ]  [ K x c4 ]  [ B g6 ] , [ b5 ]  The bishop free from constraint and running amok on the K-side is a cause for concern. But once Black's Q-side pawns get up some momentum it must be all up for White surely?
 [ Q x e7 + ] , [ K x e7 ]  That kings angry. I just killed his wife right in front of him. I think it shows courage to the pawns showing he is strong or something and not some slow fat worthless guy who probably shouldn't even get protection.
 [ Q e3 ]  [ N b6 ]  [ g4 ] , [ B e7 ]  I did a mistake again cau.....oh no wait.... excuse me but i didn't see 11...f:[ g4 ] 12.Q:[ e4 ] . Maybe it's still a mistake....
 [ R x d8 ]  [ B x d8 ] , [ R d2 ]  I am playing a game called chase the bishop and Black seems to be saying "I love this game!"
 [ c4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ d3 ] , [ d5 ]  I pressurise the pawn...
 [ Q e3 ]  [ B x f1 ]  [ R x f1 ] , [ f6 ]  Black is trying I think to build a strong pawn centre.
 [ Q e7 ] , [ N c3 ]  I must say I was happy with my position right now. I have 3 pieces developed and rearing to go
 [ B x c6 + ]  [ b x c6 ]  [ Q x c6 + ] , [ B d7 ]  [ R x d7 ] will also win ( and quicker ).
 [ N d7 ]  [ N g5 ] , [ N f6 ]  13 ... [ Q f6 ] is superior with the mate-threat on f2.
 [ a6 ] , [ B a4 ]  4. [ B a4 ] - Bishop Laud mumbles a curse at me and retreats back to Sector a4.
 [ R a d1 ] , [ B e5 ]  here I was planning NxE5 NxE5 RxD6 F3 G2xF3 NxF3 KF1 NxE1
 [ B h3 + ] , [ K g1 ]  Only move.
 [ N c4 ] , [ b5 ]  I did not see that the previous move of black was preparing to bring his pawn out and I stupidly brought my knight up to [ c4 ] and black moved his b pawn out to b5. So my queen and my knight were forked. {You will ask how did I know what move to make when I had no idea of my opponents intentions.}
 [ d5 ]  [ Q c2 ] , [ c6 ]  5. ............ [ c6 ] - bolsters the pawn on d5.
 [ K e7 ]  [ R x b7 + ]  [ K f8 ] , [ R d8 # ]  Couple of mistakes gave me the advantage i think it always rattles players to lose a piece thats been hanging for a couple of moves
 [ c6 ]  [ B b3 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ B x e6 ]  [ Q x e6 ] , [ O-O ]  Time to take my king to safety and unpinning my knight.
 [ O-O ]  [ N f5 ] , [ Q x f6 ]  So I take it.
 [ b4 ] , [ h5 ]  I'm not worried about [ g5 ] anymore because now my knight has the [ h7 ] retreat square.
 [ B x f4 ] , [ e x f4 ]  This way a kinside pawnstorm is set. Of course I didn't expect this to make me win. In fact I have the horrible feeling that I will lose this :-)))
 [ N d4 ]  [ h7 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ h8 = Q ]  [ N x d2 ]  [ Q e5 ]  [ N b3 ]  [ Q b5 + ]  [ K a7 ] , [ N d5 ]  I didn't want to take his knight so I could mess up and let him leave with a stalemate. I want the win. Don't we all?
 [ K d1 ] , [ f5 ]  darn it he moved his pawn all my ideas are gone. probably should have killed the queen.
 [ e x d4 ] , [ c x d4 ]  I now have fairly uncontested control of the majority of the central squares which will be able to use to my advantage in the middle game if can maintain this formation
 [ B x e7 ] , [ N x e7 ]  Good combination allowing Black to maintain the pawn advantage.
 [ B g5 ]  [ f4 ]  [ e x f4 ]  [ g x f4 ]  [ B h4 + ]  [ K d2 ]  [ B b5 ] , [ Q x e4 ]  Not a smart move for White. I still have the advantage as you'll see in the following few moves.
 [ N x c2 + ]  [ K d1 ] , [ N d4 ]  Pulling the Knight from danger and threatening the Queen
 [ e4 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ K c1 ]  [ B a2 ] , [ N d2 ]  Now I would win the knight.
 [ N f3 ] , [ e6 ]  My coach was moving very fast here since he had 30 other boards to move on.
 [ B e8 ] , [ Q b1 ]  At that point white has not much to do but trying to resist the they can. No way to get advantage of they to rooks (too busy protecting pawns) and a very week e4-[ d5 ] pawns.
 [ Q x d2 ]  [ R x d2 ] , [ d3 ]  and now? How to stop my pawns? I will pass whatever it takes as my rooks and my knight will be able to overtake the white rooks structure.
 [ e x d6 ]  [ e ] , [ p ]  Was this a mistake? That was a good pawn on e5.
 [ Q b6 ]  [ K e2 ]  [ Q x b2 ]  [ B h3 ]  [ Q x c2 + ]  [ N d2 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ R h c1 ]  [ Q b2 ]  [ R a b1 ]  [ Q x a2 ]  [ R x b7 ]  [ O-O ]  [ K e1 ]  [ N a6 ]  [ R x c6 ]  [ R a b8 ]  [ R x a7 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ Q a3 ]  [ K e2 ] , [ N b4 ]  unusual move. although knight is threatening my rook i can take his queen.
 [ N x d5 ] , [ e x d5 ]  The knight choices are limited now if he moves to [ b4 ] for example I can chase it around a little while developing some of my pieces so gaining some tempo
 [ B g5 ]  [ h6 ]  [ B x e7 ] , [ Q x e7 ]  Bishop has been traded off.
 [ Q a6 ] , [ N x d5 ]  Now the hanging pawns have vanished and material is even. White's Rook sacrifice was in fact a decoy. Now Black king's castle is open on the g-file. White's knight attacks the [ f6 ] pawn.
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ] , [ N x d4 ]  Prokofiev has converted Oistrakh's Sicilian into almost a mirror-reversed Caro-Kann.
 [ Q h7 ]  [ B g5 ] , [ Q f5 ]  again threatening check on [ c8 ] as well as the B on [ g5 ]  [ c3 ] , [ R h8 ]  Now the defending Rook threatens to attack down the open h file
 [ N e5 ] , [ O-O ]  At last a chance to escape the pin but a fork ensues.
 [ B e7 ] , [ N c3 ]  And my focus was on completing my development as well.
 [ N h4 ]  [ N d4 ] , [ K d1 ]  This looks doubtfull putting the King right opposite the black Queen. White had better find ways to return some material and activating his paieces in the process
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ O-O ] , [ N g e7 ]  this is a mistake which white could have taken advantage of. 5 ... [ N f6 ] was the right move.
 [ B g5 ]  [ B b6 ]  [ B x f6 ] , [ g x f6 ]  White is out of bishops but has his knights advanced.
 [ b3 ]  [ Q a5 ] , [ R h3 ]  Black resigned here because I'm mating on the next move and his counterattack has come a move too late. Black would've been able to mate me if he had two free moves here but remember when I sacrificed a pawn in the opening for two free developing moves?
 [ R h3 ]  [ K c7 ]  [ g5 ] , [ N f5 ]  Skripchenko starts counterattacking the kingside but Bareev refuses to expose the kingside.
 [ Q c2 ] , [ Q e1 ]  Obviously not [ Q x c2 ] Nxc2. And keeping the queens on board is essential if I want to succeed in muddying the waters.
 [ R d1 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ K g2 ] , [ f6 ]  This was a bad move by black. I wanted freedom for my king to get off of the bank rank and make himself useful. I wanted to move towards the center so the f-pawn made sense to me but 25. ... [ f5 ] makes my pawn at [ e6 ] backward. However as played my knight on [ h5 ] is now trapped and falls after 26. [ f4 ] and 27. g4.
 [ N x d3 + ]  [ B x d3 ] , [ B x f4 ]  and White has had enough. I'm not the only person to fall into opening disasters!
 [ Q x e6 ] , [ R a b1 ]  ? A bad one. He can defend too easily. Of course he can't allow Rxb7!
 [ Q d3 ] , [ Q a1 + ]  Now we begin a dance that will eventually lead to mate.
 [ B e3 ] , [ e5 ]  Black's expectation in this 6...[ e5 ] Najdorf Variation is that his control of important central squares with possibilities of Q-side expansion will more than compensate for the slight weakness of his backward Queens Pawn. Other Moves are 6...e6(Scheveningen) and the 'spoiling idea' 6...[ N g4 ]  [ g5 ] , [ b4 ]  Black responds to the attack on his king's knight with one of his own on the c3-knight. This is not an uncommon idea in the sicilian. 10...[ N h5 ] is a sensible alternative
 [ Q x a3 ]  [ g4 ]  [ Q x c5 ]  [ g5 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ B g3 ]  [ a4 ]  [ R d a1 ]  [ a3 ]  [ R a2 ] , [ R f b8 ]  The black aside from the 3-pawns advantage has a superior mobility of the heavy artilleries and is about to occupy open files and rank.
 [ N c4 ] , [ B x c4 ]  I didnt want to retreat my queen to [ c1 ] to defend my pawn. ı t would be real bad duty for excelancy:P nor i wanted to lose a pawn So i exchanged my Bishop
 [ Q e2 ] , [ f5 ]  who will be first? My [ d5 ] is still in my mind: in two moves from now
 [ e4 ] , [ e5 ]  symmetrical
 [ N g4 ] , [ N x e4 ]  ?? and this more than doubles to deficit to over 22!
 [ B d4 ]  [ a x b5 ]  [ a x b5 ] , [ K h2 ]  Keep my K from being pinned down.
 [ Q c7 ] , [ B x h6 ]  Finally!
 [ R h e1 ]  [ B x e3 + ] , [ f x e3 ]  avoiding the loss of a pawn... temporarily.
 [ N c8 ]  [ e5 ]  [ g6 ]  [ N c7 ]  [ Q f8 ]  [ e6 ]  [ Q g7 ] , [ e7 ]  The d- and e-Pawns have almost reached the "goal-line" with the help of the Knight-pair. The game is over but Black fought on for some more moves. And why not? Errors could still be made!
 [ R x e8 ]  [ Q x e8 ] , [ R e5 ]  Gaining tempo and nearly cutting the board in two for black
 [ N d2 ] , [ R c f8 ]  With four pieces left for each side there's still the possibility of complications. I add extra defenses to the King's wing.
 [ N e5 ]  [ d6 ] , [ Q f7 ]  [ Q f7 ] and here is the nail in the coffin. Wasn't easy to find this next move do you see it. Hint it's not Nxa8.
 [ a x b3 ] , [ B h6 ]  Now at this point it looks pretty bad for my opponent but he still has a very strong defensive structure.
 [ N a6 ] , [ N g5 ]  The placement of the knight on [ g5 ] and the bishop on [ f4 ] will be a big help for black when he starts to advance his king side pawns.
 [ Q x a1 ]  [ R x a1 ]  [ R x a1 ]  [ g4 ]  [ R f a8 ] , [ e6 ]  White lashes out with a bad move followed by another bad move.
 [ N c e7 ]  [ N x f5 ]  [ N x f5 ]  [ N d2 ]  [ b5 ]  [ B b3 ] , [ B e7 ]  just making complications: meanwhile White is struggling with the clock...
 [ N g6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ a5 ]  [ K d5 ]  [ R f2 ]  [ b4 ]  [ a x b4 ]  [ c x b4 ]  [ h4 ]  [ a4 ]  [ h3 ]  [ a5 ]  [ h2 ]  [ R h1 ] , [ K g5 ]  Nigel might have resigned around here ordinarily but he sportingly plays on to a more clear-cut conclusion for the benefit of the big crowd watching. Nigel bisa segera menyerah tapi dia dengan sportif terus bermain sampai ke bagian yang lebih nyata kalahnya demi penonton yang ramai mengikuti.
 [ b x a6 ]  [ e ]  [ p ]  [ Q b1 + ]  [ N b3 ]  [ Q e4 + ]  [ K a3 ]  [ R e7 ] , [ a x b7 ]  Defeated at last by a lowly pawn.
 [ d x c3 ] , [ Q d7 ]  Looking to exchange another powerful white piece the bishop on g2.
 [ B g5 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ O-O-O ]  [ O-O ] , [ Q d2 ]  And here it is! Now I knew I achieved a small victory in the opening with smooth development and a clear plan ([ B e6 ] [ R c8 ] Qa5). Correct moves are 10.[ e5 ] or 10.[ B c4 ] with equal game (slightly more comfortable for White) but I guess White played pretty relaxed due to his heavy favourite status. At this moment I had spent 19 minutes from the clock he spent 4.
 [ N x e3 ] , [ B g2 ]  The bishop is lined up
 [ N f6 ] , [ B f4 ]  Completing development and aiming at the weak c pawn.
 [ R c5 ]  [ R h4 ]  [ K g7 ]  [ R a4 ]  [ a6 ]  [ K e3 ]  [ R x c7 ]  [ K d4 ]  [ R c6 ]  [ R a5 ]  [ R e6 ]  [ g3 ]  [ K h6 ]  [ K c4 ]  [ R e3 ]  [ K b4 ]  [ R x g3 ]  [ R d5 ]  [ R x h3 ]  [ R d4 ]  [ R h5 ]  [ R f4 ] , [ f5 ]  Now white finally resigned as I had enough time to end this game and white has completely lost position. K R against my K R 5pawns
 [ g4 ] , [ B g6 ]  As I had hoped the kingside in my mind is dead to my opponent now.
 [ Q h6 ]  [ K g4 ]  [ K g8 ] , [ B c2 ]  Looking for cheap shots with [ B b3 ] etc. If 35.[ e6 ] [ Q f6 ] and black can start thinking about playing for a win.
 [ b4 ] , [ N d7 ]  Gladly retreating to facilitate the maneuver. White's queenside expansion will not help as black's queenside is looking quite robust.
 [ c3 ]  [ R a2 + ]  [ K e3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ f7 ] , [ R e4 + ]  This is a battle right here but I will eventually get my pawn up to the top. I know I will. I know I will.
 [ B f4 ] , [ N x c4 ]  To take away one threat on f7.
 [ a6 ] , [ N f4 ]  The knight is a bit awkward here but I want to attack [ c6 ]  [ R c8 ] , [ h3 ]  ! a good move that forces black into a cramped position. The bishop has no good retreat squares.
 [ c5 ]  [ d x c5 ]  [ b x c5 ] , [ N d6 ]  20.Nd6. Attacking the helpless f-pawn.
 [ R b2 + ]  [ K d3 ]  [ R d2 + ]  [ K c4 ]  [ R x a2 ]  [ N c7 ]  [ K e5 ]  [ g4 ]  [ K f4 ]  [ b4 ]  [ K x f3 ]  [ b5 ]  [ R a4 + ]  [ K d5 ] , [ B f4 ]  Maybe [ R a4 ] was a lot better.
 [ g6 + ]  [ K h6 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ a x b3 ]  [ R h8 + ]  [ K g7 ]  [ R h7 + ]  [ K f8 ]  [ R x c7 ]  [ b2 ]  [ R f7 + ]  [ K g8 ] , [ h6 ]  Ameaçando promover seguido de mate. Alternative variation: 51. [ h6 ] [ b1 = Q ] 52. [ h7 + ] [ K h8 ] 53. [ R f8 + ] [ K g7 ] 54. [ h8 = Q + ] [ K x g6 ] 55. [ R f6 # ]  [ N f7 ]  [ K f5 ] , [ N h6 + ]  Alternative variation: 62... [ K x h7 ] 63. [ K f6 + ] [ K g8 ] 64. [ B c4 ]  [ K h5 ] , [ Q h2 + ]  
 [ a6 ]  [ B x d7 + ] , [ B x d7 ]  black already has equal (if not better) development and the bishop pair looking to free open the board.
 [ K c5 ]  [ N c1 ]  [ K d4 ]  [ K e6 ]  [ K c5 ]  [ K d7 ]  [ K d4 ]  [ N e2 + ]  [ K e5 ]  [ f4 ] , [ h4 ]  50. [ h4 ] - Here Ion stated - At move 50 or (possibly better) 51 it looks simpler to go for the h-pawn with 50.[ K f5 ] or 51.Kf5. 51.[ B c4 ] (ordinarily a desirable move) rather spoils things because after 51...[ N c1 ] White dare not take the f-pawn on account of the knight fork leaving Black a remote passed pawn on the b-file... F] ... but the ensuing pawn race is quite exciting and White's drawing method a queen down is very neat - worth studying and adding to one's own technique.
 [ B g3 ] , [ B g7 ]  A very daring plan forms in my head at this point. I study the board for maybe ten minutes and then I make the move I already knew I was going to do.
 [ e6 ]  [ e4 ] , [ c5 ]  Lets try to transpose to a Sicilian
 [ R b6 + ] , [ K f5 ]  Finally a form of the key position has been reached after all that time and effort spent by Black. The key corner is the corner the defending king has been trapped on for the entire ending. In the key position the bishop should be on the square three diagonal spaces from the key corner and the attacking king should be next to the bishop as shown in this position based on which side of the board the defending king decides to get trapped on.
 [ K h7 ] , [ Q g5 ]  may be unnecessary as my next move is predictable. Better I am sure was [ K f2 ] to make the rooks progress on 1-line.
 [ f3 ] , [ B h4 ]  Blocking his retreat throu[ g h f2 ]  [ B f2 ] , [ Q e7 ]  Did not want to trade here wanted to build my attack and how better to trade on my grounds - getting the queen in there if he know trades
 [ K c3 ]  [ h5 ]  [ R b e1 ] , [ h4 ]  Forget the non-connected pawn I just want to promote as soon as possible
 [ R a e8 ] , [ h5 ]  Putting Black's K-side under pressure. It's not easy to find a defensive plan against the threat of advancing the pawns. Anything creates weak points that my Knight combined with a Rook and Queen can quickly create a strong attack.
 [ d x e6 ]  [ B x e6 ] , [ N h4 ]  ! In this case "a knight on the rim is dim". I chose this candidate so that I could capture his [ g6 ] pawn and play a powerful fork between his queen and rook with 14.Ng6. If this happens I will win his rook at worst. However he will not allow this and I will explain it shortly.
 [ B g4 ] , [ h3 ]  demanding a declaration straightaway...
 [ B x f3 ] , [ Q x f3 ]  Trap is in motion. Now the bishop is unguarded.
 [ c x d5 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ Q x b7 ] , [ N g f6 ]  I'm trying to develop pieces here as best as possible forgetting about the loss of the pawn
 [ N x d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ B c4 ]  I thought he may play [ g6 ] here (or a move or two earlier) to transpose into a modern defence.
 [ b4 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ c5 ]  [ c3 ] , [ f5 ]  I'm not sure if white overlooked this but the computer didn't give any judgement at this point
 [ Q x c4 ]  [ R a d8 + ]  [ K c1 ]  [ Q e3 + ]  [ K b1 ] , [ c5 ]  [ Q h4 ] g4-g5. No time for it.
 [ R b8 ]  [ Q b2 ] , [ f5 ]  Black desperately needs to find some counterplay or White´s two Queenside Pawns will decide the game.
 [ Q f4 ] , [ B c1 ]  Again attacking the Queen.
 [ K g6 ]  [ K d6 ]  [ f6 ]  [ R b1 ]  [ f5 ]  [ R g1 ]  [ K h5 ] , [ K e5 ]  i think this is a strong move. black is lost
 [ R d d2 ]  [ R f4 ]  [ B h3 ] , [ Q x f7 + ]  Understandable that he wanted to check but it doesn't do much because I can and will get out of danger. And if 30...[ K g8 ] instead 31.[ f8 ] and I can still get out with 31...[ K h7 ] so to save time I'll play ...[ K h7 ] right away. While it wouldn't matter much my idea is to teach and help white remember the importance of tempii and how much you really need it because wasting it can sometimes mean disaster as is the case here. And the idea is to set a good example for him.
 [ B g1 ] , [ c4 ]  This another bad move. Oh Zhanna I hope your opponent does not see he can take your rook!
 [ N c e4 ]  [ R f f8 ]  [ Q c4 ]  [ K h8 ] , [ h3 ]  this is not correct. [ h3 ] was the good place for the king. one day black will control the 2th line.
 [ R h e1 ] , [ B d6 ]  White is fully mobilised (developed); Black very nearly so. There doesn't seem to be much in it eh? But White does have a move that might have occasioned Black something of a headache...
 [ B e7 ]  [ B e3 ] , [ a6 ]  This move lets me see something...
 [ N e5 ]  [ N x c3 ]  [ b x c3 ] , [ B x e5 ]  (?)Now my opponent is making a fundamental error. He makes 2 exchanges of his most active pieces and leaves white with a kingside advantage with opposite color bishops and no piece protection for the king. This also frees my dark squared bishop immediately. Ridiculous move but it shows my opponent being afraid of ghosts and "exchanging to draw". That leaves another principle: Exchanges do not necessarily clarify the position at all. When you make an exchange you are making a critical decision that may alter the position drastically. Once again please remember that because material is even does not mean the position is close to it. In fact here white has a major advantage worth just as much or even more than a pawn since he will soon have a powerful attack.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ d4 ]  [ e x d4 ] , [ Q x d4 ]  The first exchanges unleashing my queen...
 [ Q x h4 ]  [ B f7 + ] , [ K h6 ]  ? Now it's mate in six. Find it :)
 [ R a g1 ]  [ N x e3 ]  [ f x e3 ] , [ R a e8 ]  21. ...... [ R a e8 ] - In the chat Ion wondered why I exchanged my active knight for his seemingly passive bishop and for uniting his d pawn with his e pawn. The solution is in this move. It prepares [ e5 ] where I will swap off my isolated e pawn with his d pawn giving him an isolated e pawn. However the plan did not work out in the way I expected.
 [ B e7 ]  [ O-O ] , [ B g5 ]  Although exchanges strengthen white's material advantage black's response (Pxg5) opens the pawn @ [ h2 ] to attack. Mm or not--white stupidly thought [ N g4 ] was an option for black. Actually [ N x g5 ] (white's bishop) followed by [ N f3 + ] and black's rook pawn slides down to create havoc and mayhem.
 [ B d7 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ N x e4 ] , [ B x e4 ]  Every exchange helps me.
 [ K h4 ] , [ R x g4 + ]  Can't really call this a sacrifice as [ h x g4 ] is met with an immediate mate by the queen
 [ B x d8 ] , [ N x d1 ]  the option 13 [ b x c3 ] [ Q x e7 ] is really worse for white as it isolate two pawns on c-column which is open for black.
 [ h6 ] , [ N x f6 + ]  Oops gotta give that last move a ?: 12. ... h6. It looks like it drives away the white bishop but it really just loses a pawn. The knight on [ f6 ] was defended twice but only one defender can recapture (one of the drawbacks of defending minor pieces with the queen). And 13. Nx[ f6 ] gives check so black cannot opt to take the white bishop instead.
 [ N x g5 ]  [ h x g5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ f6 ]  [ a4 ]  [ B x e4 ]  [ a5 ] , [ B x f3 ]  Again here black should have kept the bishop. Instead do 27. ... [ K f7 ] and bring the king closer to action.
 [ B f5 ] , [ Q h4 ]  Black can survive with 28... K-[ B1 ] or 28... P-R4.
 [ d5 ] , [ N e5 ]  This move opens the diagonal so that black can no longer play ...[ d x c4 ] (the bishop on [ b7 ] is hanging).
 [ Q x c7 + ]  [ K b5 ] , [ Q d7 + ]  My computer doesn't think this is the strongest move but I don't regret making it; I didn't want to get into any messy queen endgames and just try to simplify as much as possible. If I have to I can give up one of my rooks to prevent a promotion.
 [ Q b3 ] , [ Q f2 ]  Penetrating into the heart of White's position.
 [ e x d5 ]  [ Q x d5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ Q a5 ]  [ d4 ] , [ a6 ]  This move was a shocker for me and takes us out of the world database although it has been played ~60 time on GK but with a 58%-36% edge to White. Had my opponent played something like [ N f6 ] then my usual response would be [ B d2 ] but now this move seems to score about even for Black. I decide to develop first with [ B c4 ] and see what comes out of this new (for me) move.
 [ Q d2 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ B x e7 ] , [ Q x e7 ]  12. ....... [ Q x e7 ] - some wood has been exchanged but I am still behind in development - still my knight does look good on [ d5 ] and I am ready to castle kingside.
 [ Q x b2 ]  [ a x b2 + ]  [ K b1 ] , [ B f5 ]  i think this is a win
 [ K e3 ]  [ Q e8 + ]  [ K d2 ]  [ R d7 + ]  [ K c1 ] , [ Q e1 # ]  ...to finish the job.
 [ B c5 ] , [ B c4 ]  Since black didn't play 6. ...[ c6 ] I moved my bishop to this more active diagonal and saved a tempo in advance. I'm threatening 7. Bxf7ch and 8. Qh5ch as well. I'm not concerned by the discovered check yet.
 [ c x d4 ] , [ N x d4 ]  Retaking with the knight as clearly [ c x d4 ] is a bad idea.
 [ B g7 ] , [ h3 ]  Presumably feeling the absence of a bishop on e2.
 [ N x d3 ]  [ c x d3 ]  [ Q x a2 ]  [ Q x b7 ]  [ R d8 ]  [ Q x c6 + ]  [ B d7 ]  [ Q c3 ]  [ R c8 ]  [ Q b4 ]  [ N e7 ]  [ N g5 ]  [ h6 ]  [ N h3 ]  [ Q a6 ]  [ N f4 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ R d1 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ Q d6 ]  Now he is playing strong.
 [ c3 ] , [ B c5 ]  White is a bit cramped for space.
 [ d6 ]  [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ a6 ]  [ d4 ] , [ b5 ]  the biginning of the end....mate at 1h...everything jst fall in place:)
 [ Q h5 + ] , [ K d8 ]  So much for my removing the skewer... now it's a genuine pin. Didn't have a lot of other options though. This is really not how I wanted the board to look at this point.
 [ K g2 ] , [ Q a6 ]  The Black queen is safe from the rook in dark squares.So why worry after all .The queen is grabbed
 [ R x e8 ] , [ R x e8 ]  At this point White clearly has the more active game. The trick is to try and press this advantage.
 [ K e6 ]  [ K e3 ]  [ a3 ]  [ K e4 ]  [ K f6 ] , [ Q x a3 ]  I did the math and white couldn't force checkmate before black could promote the pawn so wasting a couple tempo to kill black's final pawn was necessary. And now it's just the normal king+queen vs. king endgame.
 [ b3 ]  [ B f5 ] , [ a3 ]  Necessary to stop [ N b4 ] with a double attack on the vulnerable [ c2 ] pawn.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ N c3 ]  ?! I believe this is an inaccuracy because my opinion is that Black is quite happy with the exchanges happening in the game.
 [ N x e5 ] , [ N x e4 ]  Usually the best move for black here was d6. Nxe4(?!) as the old trap here is possible.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ f4 ]  Lange begins with the Vienna Gambit.
 [ O-O ] , [ b3 ]  Perparing for [ B b2 ] fianchettoing the 2nd bishop.
 [ R a3 ] , [ R c1 ]  Futile. 33.[ K f4 ] would be more direct and allow White to take the f-pawn without requiring the loss of his Rook. Now after 33...[ B d4 ] 34.[ K f4 ] [ R x c3 ] White must move his Rook again to avoid a devastating trade giving Black time to play ...g6. If the White Rook had remained on [ f1 ] at least he could have taken the f-pawn for free.
 [ O-O ] , [ B f4 ]  I had to pull the bishop back in order to prevent him from threatening my knight with his bishop.
 [ d5 ]  [ c4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ g3 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ B g2 ] , [ O-O ]  This is a line in the closed catalan so far. Usually white follows with 6. O-O
 [ Q x a2 ] , [ K e1 ]  protects his king. i can trade out queens at any time now. i still shouldve traded knights out now but had completely "let him go" to play my pawn push. and i also kept looking to see if i could attack his queen with my LSB but saw nothing viable.
 [ N b d7 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ e5 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ d x e5 ] , [ Q b6 ]  this being a game against a friend I wasn't at my best.
 [ c5 ]  [ e3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ c3 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ e x d4 ] , [ B f5 ]  developing outside the pawn chain f7/e6/d5.
 [ N b3 ] , [ R d1 ]  To that end I positioned my castle on D1. It helps that I moved it here in response to attack so its purpose wasn't too obvious.
 [ h6 ]  [ B e3 ] , [ N e5 ]  Better is 13... [ N f6 ] then if 14. [ c4 ] [ Q d2 ] followed by ... [ N f5 ]  [ Q e2 ]  [ Q d7 ]  [ h3 ] , [ R a e8 ]  [ N f5 ] was better exchanging to relieve Black's cramped position; this dictum was not generally known at this time however.
 [ N x c3 ] , [ N c6 ]  Black should be developing his kingside pieces to castle there because my strongly placed pieces will attack the uncastled king.
 [ K d2 ]  [ R x c5 ]  [ K d3 ] , [ R c3 + ]  Black plans 36. [ K d2 ] (not 36. Ke2? allowing 36. ... [ R e3 ] ) followed by 36. ... [ R e3 ] to eliminate white's passed pawn. If 37. [ e5 ] then 37. ... Nx[ e5 ] 38. fx[ e5 ] [ K f2 ] followed by black's king taking white's last pawn and continuing onward for a king rook vs. king endgame. Instead white chose to resign so we can start another game.
 [ d x e5 ]  [ B e3 ] , [ N a6 ]  Now I seek for 15 [ N x a6 ] [ b x a6 ] 16 [ B x c5 + ] [ N e7 ] and I didn't a way for the mate. Thus I captured the rook
 [ O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ a3 ]  [ d6 ] , [ b4 ]  This puts us out of book- the computer recommends 7...[ a6 ] to give the dark squared bishop a cubby-hole.
 [ N c6 ] , [ B e3 ]  7. [ B e3 ] develops a piece and attacks the Wicked Witch of the West (my opponent's queen) and Marin hides her on c7.
 [ R e7 ] , [ B a4 ]  saving the bishop and pinning the white knight and later taking it :)
 [ c6 ]  [ B c4 ] , [ Q g6 ]  Anunciated going for castle breaking note [ B b3 ] in a great position
 [ R a c1 ]  [ Q b6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ R d8 ]  [ N a4 ]  [ Q a5 ]  [ b3 ]  [ N x e3 ]  [ f x e3 ] , [ h4 ]  Black's position has sensibly improved across the last 6 moves.
 [ R e f7 ]  [ c5 ] , [ d x c5 ]  (RC) A pawn is bound to go for if ...N-[ Q2 ] 52 NxP NxP (if... PxP 53 NxP) 53 R(5)-[ Q5 ] N-[ N2 ] 54 NxP. Black hopes by exchanging Knights to retain some of the drawing chances which exist when a pawn down in a Rook ending.
 [ Q e7 ]  [ Q d5 ]  [ R b8 ]  [ Q a5 ] , [ R b7 ]  Guarded!
 [ Q a4 + ] , [ c6 ]  why am i not surprised he didnt develop his knight.
 [ Q d2 ] , [ Q d8 ]  At last. But this is not the best move for the queen in sight of what's coming.
 [ B h5 ]  [ R f8 ] , [ Q h7 + ]  27. [ Q h7 + ] - Henry will get out of check by going to [ d8 ] but is he safe there?
 [ K g8 ] , [ O-O ]  Meanwhile Tom castles and I'm going after his Q. I'm thinking about what else I can do here. And I realize that doing so allows me to win another pawn leaving me the equivalent to an entire piece ahead.
 [ e3 ] , [ B f5 ]  I already know I would play [ h6 ] [ e6 ] [ c5 ] almost for sure.
 [ Q h1 + ]  [ K d2 ] , [ N f3 # ]  Unfortunately my opponent didn�t see it coming and still his queen nicely in the corner.
 [ K g6 ] , [ g5 ]  (!?) This move I don't like. True passed pawns should be pushed but in general co-joined passers should present a united front. The right move then was probably 68.h4. Even then supposing the position was reached with no change but the h-pawn on [ h4 ] I'd play h5(ch) keeping the dark squares open for the King and the bishop to operate on. From here getting the pawns forward will be more difficult. Having said all that it turns out that White is doing better than I thought...
 [ N f6 ] , [ d3 ]  Protect the E pawn.
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ c5 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ d6 ]  [ e4 ]  [ g6 ]  [ f4 ]  [ B g7 ] , [ e5 ]  ?! Does not this just beg to be played! As it turns out 8. [ e5 ] is harmless. Some years ago a gameknot player Maxistar tried to test me on this theory and he too failed.
 [ B x e4 ]  [ R c3 ]  [ R b3 b2 + ]  [ K e3 ]  [ N x f2 ] , [ N d2 ]  The actual move made here was [ B g2 ] but the obvious choice one one would think would be [ N d1 ] for the fork followed by a rook snatch. Here is what blake suggested: ... Blake: One continuation I would have had to really consider here if I had been black would be 30. ... [ N d1 ] 31. [ K x e4 ] Rb8[ b4 ] 32. Bx[ b4 ] Rx[ b4 ] 33. [ K d3 ] [ N x c3 ] 34. [ K x c3 ] Rxa4. While this loses a little material it manages to leave black in an endgame where he is up by the exchange and four pawns. Better it exchanges off everything but white's knight leaving black essentially with King Rook 5 pawns against King Knight 2 pawns an easy endgame to win. I don't know if I would have played it but I would have given it a serious look. ... Herc: So I couldn't follow this at all but I am about to check it out now.
 [ N f3 ]  [ h6 ] , [ B e3 ]  I think looking at it now I might have been better to fianchetto this bishop
 [ e6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ d5 ] , [ N c3 ]  Classical French system. Other options are: 3.[ N d2 ] (Tarrasch:C03); 3. [ d x e4 ] (Exchange:C01); 3.[ c3 ] (also Exchange:C01) 3.[ e5 ] (Advance:C02).
 [ K h2 ]  [ K x h4 ]  [ K h1 ]  [ K g4 ]  [ K h2 ] , [ N e2 ]  From about here until the end of this critical part of the endgame and probably for several moves prior I was in deep time-trouble with my clock's countdown diving into the red on almost every move as I only barely stayed ahead elimination thanks to the Fischer increments.
 [ b x c3 ]  [ N c4 ]  [ Q c2 ]  [ R d d8 ]  [ R b1 ] , [ N d7 ]  Analysis called blacks 2 previous moves inaccuracies and this one which means that black has gone from significantly ahead to roughly equal in the space of 5 moves.
 [ K f7 ] , [ Q d5 + ]  Thought he would put queen in the way which to my delight he does
 [ K f1 ]  [ K f8 ] , [ K e2 ]  26. [ K e2 ] - Henry comes to the centre to prevent ingress of the black rook into my position via the d column.
 [ R h6 ] , [ R h3 ]  White intends to double the rooks and simplify as much as possible
 [ R f7 ] , [ Q e6 ]  The queen is slippery...
 [ R g5 ]  [ R x g2 ] , [ R x g2 ]  All white's moves to protect the bishop are ugly: [ N d1 ] shuts the rook so does [ B c1 ] [ N a4 ] gets removed by ...[ b5 ] [ R a2 ] and [ R b1 ] are not much better. Plus black has two passed pawns.
 [ B x c6 ]  [ b x c6 ] , [ d x e5 ]  Wins a pawn.
 [ h3 ]  [ g3 ]  [ g4 ] , [ f4 ]  now the [ e4 ] square is weak. black has pawns in the king side that pressing the white king.
 [ B d7 ] , [ e5 ]  And that's when he attacks my N. But I answer by exchanging his center pawn.
 [ K f5 ] , [ g4 + ]  Attracting the king to a square that doesn't favour me at all unless I can find a tactic.
 [ d x c3 ]  [ d6 ] , [ N x f7 ]  This is typical of a Cochrane Attack with which I'm fairly familiar
 [ B x f6 ] , [ R c1 ]  Trying to avoid doubled pawns but I like my bishop too much to trade at this point.
 [ d4 ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ] , [ h6 ]  ?? a wait of time. [ N f6 ] is needed with [ B e7 ] and 0-0 following.
 [ N f6 ]  [ c x d4 ] , [ c x d4 ]  At this point I was satisfied with how the opening went. My knight has obviously a brighter future ahead of him than my opponent's light-squared bishop.
 [ R f7 ] , [ R c5 c7 ]  The best rank for a Rook.
 [ K g2 ]  [ B x c4 ]  [ b5 ]  [ B d5 + ]  [ K h3 ] , [ B d6 ]  trooping the colours...
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ] , [ B f4 ]  My favourite. It just transposes but I can have a better control of the lines I know best. Not well enough as someone just showed me (but from a +2000 rating... :-).
 [ Q e4 + ] , [ Q e6 ]  Please trade with me!
 [ h5 ] , [ e6 ]  This is really overaggressive now on white's part. He wishes to disrupt the pawn structure immediately in front of the black king even before he's really ready to. Fritz here wanted [ Q d6 ] here and ...[ f x e6 ] is also playable. I however decided I did not want a trio of pawns assaulting the black position after g5. It just seems too dangerous!
 [ R x c1 + ]  [ R x c1 ]  [ R c8 ] , [ R a1 ]  Trying to grab something out fom the position.
 [ Q d5 + ]  [ K f8 ]  [ R h1 ] , [ c6 ]  Probably hoping for R[ x Q h2 ]  [ Q x d3 ]  [ R f c8 ]  [ N h2 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ R e3 ]  [ b5 ]  [ a3 ]  [ R a b8 ]  [ N g4 ]  [ a5 ]  [ R g3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ h4 ] , [ h5 ]  ?????????????????????????????????????????????
 [ a x b4 ]  [ a x b4 ] , [ B e7 ]  Not the best! [ B g5 ] would force [ f4 ] weakening White's K side. I could then go to the plan I use now. Amazing the things I miss!
 [ B x e3 ]  [ d x e3 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ B x g4 ] , [ Q e2 ]  20 [ B x d5 ] [ N c6 ] should win for black.
 [ e x d6 ]  [ Q x d6 ]  [ R d1 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ Q f2 ]  [ R c8 ]  [ f5 ]  [ g x f5 ]  [ Q x f5 ]  [ Q c4 ]  [ K b1 ]  [ Q x h4 ]  [ Q x f7 ]  [ N c7 ]  [ Q f6 ]  [ Q e4 ]  [ Q b6 + ]  [ Q b7 ]  [ R d7 ]  [ Q x b6 ]  [ B x b6 ]  [ N e6 ]  [ B a7 + ]  [ K a8 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ R c7 ] , [ R d6 ]  Perhaps [ R x c7 ] would have done the trick here.
 [ h6 ] , [ R g2 ]  Black's Rook now imprisons the White King.
 [ K e7 ]  [ Q c5 + ]  [ K d7 ]  [ Q b5 + ]  [ K d6 ]  [ Q b6 + ] , [ K d5 ]  But black's K finds the one escape square which will eventually allow it to help the Q promote the b pawn.
 [ a4 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ a6 ]  I put the question to the bishop.
 [ N c3 ]  [ B g7 ] , [ e4 ]  With 4.[ e4 ] I got a big centre control.
 [ h6 ] , [ R h4 ]  He attacks my knight twice but [ f2 ] is falling now.
 [ N d2 ] , [ B d6 ]  OK but also very strong was 27...[ h4 ] cramping White's kingside completely as suggested by the computer. But this move doesn't give away much of Black's advantage. Clock times: 15 minutes for me 35 for Black.
 [ N e5 ]  [ Q h6 ] , [ Q c5 ]  White is threatening a checkmate on Black's poor exposed King - this should teach Black never to leave the King in the centre!
 [ R x d7 ] , [ Q e6 + ]  Black can even think about some [ R e6 ] exR axR but for QxN.
 [ B a3 ]  [ B d4 ]  [ R b8 ] , [ B x g7 ]  21. Bxg7?? White lashes out threatening [ B x h8 ] and preventing the castle but what he has really done is...
 [ K d8 ] , [ Q x h6 ]  And there you have it! Black resigns as although I'm only 2+ in material so far the outcome is in my favour due to positioning and inevitable gain for me. I really enjoyed this game thankyou branneke ( I like your puzzles too!). To everyone else I hope you enjoyed the game as much as I did!! Cheers Bianca
 [ a6 ] , [ d4 ]  battle for centre begins!
 [ R e1 ] , [ R x f2 ]  White tried for an irritating pin preventing 36. ... [ e x f2 ] but he overlooked black's powerful response.
 [ N x c2 ]  [ R x c2 ]  [ Q b7 ] , [ d x e5 ]  the last move that existed in gameknot database...
 [ B f6 ]  [ Q f4 ]  [ B x b2 ]  [ R a2 ]  [ Q f6 ]  [ Q x f6 ] , [ B x f6 ]  Consolidating the position and maintaining the advantage. D7 pawn is still weak but this is no longer concerning.
 [ B x f4 ]  [ Q x d4 ]  [ Q x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ c5 ]  [ B x d4 ]  [ c x d4 ] , [ R f d1 ]  The pawn is lost white has a material advantage of +4.
 [ K d3 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ B e1 ] , [ c5 ]  45. ..... c5!! - an excellent move. Although I will be pleased to get rid of that isolani it will undoable black's pawns on the queenside.
 [ e5 ]  [ B h4 ]  [ Q g4 ]  [ B c6 ]  [ N f4 ] , [ Q g5 ]  Offering the exchange...
 [ R c1 ]  [ c6 ] , [ R f3 ]  ?? Threatening [ R h3 + ] but at an unfortunate cost.
 [ Q e7 + ] , [ K h6 ]  Rh4+? KxN but now that [ f2 ] will be defended there is no hope for black. He can just try the last way: if I go [ R x b7 ] now he can start the check's round with Rx[ f2 ] and... this is unnecessarily risky (black's queen can go to [ d1 ] so my king won't be able to hide easily.
 [ N c6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ B b4 + ]  [ B d2 ] , [ d x e3 ]  Black takes advantage of white's pinned bishop and force whtie to weaken his kingside pawn structure.
 [ O-O ]  [ N g4 ] , [ h3 ]  Catches the knight with no safe retreat except the 6th rank.
 [ N c3 ] , [ b6 ]  Black hands me the weak b5-square on a silver platter. Time to place a very powerful outpost on it. I think that you can already see my attack forming.
 [ d x e6 ]  [ e ]  [ p ]  [ R e8 ]  [ Q e3 ]  [ K b8 ] , [ B d2 ]  The move black overlooked. Winning for white and disrupts all black's counterplay involving ..[ g5 ] due to the threat of [ B c3 ] (black queen and rook would be exposed to a skewer)
 [ O-O ]  [ O-O ] , [ g6 ]  ? A weak move which simply creates dark square weaknesses. I assume that Black was scared of my [ d3 ] bishop but that is no way to approach chess. Prophylaxis is good but this way too much. I always strive to play active moves and reach for the initiative rather than react to my opponents moves.
 [ R e8 ]  [ Q d6 + ] , [ R e7 ]  Not the best - [ K g7 ] would have been much better. Now White could - and probaly should - try for a draw by repetition by 31 [ Q d8 ] and after ...[ R e8 ] [ Q d6 ] again.
 [ K g4 ]  [ K h7 ]  [ h3 ]  [ Q d1 + ] , [ K f4 ]  And here we broke for lunch. I asked her if she wanted to have lunch with me. She said "I want to go to the bitch." "The bitch?" I queried. "Yes the nice sandy bitch by the sea. I love walking on the bitch." She said smiling. Obviously this Siamese beauty had not mastered English yet. I smiled back. "Me too I love walking on the bitch. Shall we go to the bitch together?" And so it was I got to spend the lunch break with her on the "bitch". She was lovely company. I asked her to join me for supper that evening. She told me that she was winning easily a clear pawn up and wouldn't consider dining with an inferior player! "What if you don't win then?" "eeef I don't win ziss position I vill buy you dinner!" Right! that was it! I had to save what looked like a hopeless position!
 [ d x e5 ]  [ B x e5 ] , [ N x e5 ]  behind on material development and initiative now -- the game is beginning to look bleak
 [ R f5 ] , [ K c4 ]  Alternative variation: 87... [ K e4 ] [does not solve anything] 88. [ R g5 ]  [ K c1 ] , [ R b3 ]  .
 [ d5 ]  [ c4 ]  [ c6 ] , [ N c3 ]  I was trying to angle towards a Meran or a Noteboom.
 [ R d e1 ] , [ K g7 ]  25. ..... Kg7?? - Freddy condemned this move because of what was to follow. He then went on to say ..... 25...[ Q c5 ] and still game on.. lose the pawn but still there to fight another battle.
 [ N d4 ]  [ B h4 ]  [ R f5 ]  [ Q e3 ]  [ Q x g2 ]  [ R f c1 ] , [ N f3 ]  ...[ N f3 ] threatens 24 ... [ N d2 + ] 25.[ K a2 ] [ R a5 + ] 26.[ Q a3 ] winning WT's Queen etc
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ] , [ N c3 ]  So far so good -- a nice standard Vienna game. Typical next moves for black include [ N f6 ] [ N c6 ] or even Bc5. But black has another idea...
 [ B x c3 ]  [ R x d7 ]  [ B b4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ R f e8 ]  [ R f d1 ]  [ f5 ]  [ R x b7 ]  [ f x e4 ]  [ R d6 ]  [ K f7 ]  [ N f4 ]  [ R e b8 ]  [ R b d7 ]  [ K e8 ] , [ N e6 ]  
 [ K e5 ]  [ R f4 ]  [ R g2 + ]  [ K f3 ]  [ R x g5 ]  [ R x f7 ]  [ K d6 ] , [ R b7 ]  Again another overaggressive plan which risks losing a drawish game. Best is simply 52. [ R f6 + ] [ K c5 ] 53. [ R c6 + ] [ K b4 ] 54. [ R x b6 ] [ K x a4 ] 55. [ R b8 ] [ R g6 ] 56. [ K f4 ] [ K a5 ] 57. [ K e5 ] [ R b6 ] 58. [ R a8 + ] [ K x b5 ] 59. [ K x d5 ] [ R h6 ] 60. [ R a1 ] [ R h5 + ] 61. [ K e6 ] [ R h6 + ] 62. Kd5.
 [ e4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B b4 ]  [ e5 ] , [ Q d7 ]  Not frequent move in French defense. The most usual way is 4 ... c5.
 [ Q c2 ] , [ d4 ]  pressing on
 [ N h4 ]  [ g5 ] , [ N g6 ]  Black can trap the bishop here but at a price
 [ B d2 ] , [ N e4 ]  The computer calls this a mistake preferring … [ Q f2 ] 12. [ Q d3 ] [ B b4 ] 13. [ h3 ] [ B x f3 + ] 14. [ Q x f3 ] [ Q x d4 ] 15. [ B d3 ] [ N c5 ]  [ K x e1 ]  [ N x c3 + ]  [ K f2 ]  [ N x b5 ]  [ B x b5 ] , [ R e7 ]  now I am a whole piece ahead on material I just need to ensure I don't make any mistakes
 [ N f5 ] , [ B b7 ]  ...mini trap if Rb8..d5...(Q Oh no..?? dropped a bishop?!!!..Er..no. [ R x b7 ] & curtains with [ R e8 ] )...white now gains a square for the [ d5 ] pawn
 [ c5 ]  [ h5 ]  [ c4 ]  [ g6 + ]  [ K h8 ]  [ g7 + ]  [ K h7 ] , [ g8 = Q + ]  Black resigns. It is mate next move.
 [ R b8 ]  [ B a2 ]  [ a5 ] , [ N d2 ]  My opponent seems to have a bit of problem with his knights.
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ] , [ B f4 ]  This move has nothing special in it. It will be played in many lines. The concept though is not to push [ c4 ] (which black knows and expects) but to build a quick kingside attack. Let's see how.
 [ R h e1 ] , [ f6 ]  to try and prevent [ e5 ]  [ B c2 ]  [ N a7 ]  [ Q x a5 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ Q b5 ]  He can now get a draw by repeating the attacks on my queen however he played
 [ R d1 ] , [ b6 ]  With that being said I attack his N. In addition this is a double fianchetto which is rare. But since it didn't start off with a KID and the fact that I'm nearly lost I felt that it worked here.
 [ d x e4 ] , [ R f2 ]  Planing to double my rooks
 [ N c3 ]  [ e4 ]  [ N e1 ]  [ c x b4 ]  [ a x b4 ]  [ N x c4 ]  [ B x c4 ]  [ R c8 ]  [ Q b3 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ B x c3 ]  [ R c1 ]  [ B x d2 ]  [ R x c7 ] , [ R x c7 ]  This is an imporatant position of the game the material is aprox balanced (R+B+P vs Q) I think black is not worse his dark squared bishop is powerful and dominates the c-file while white pieces are discoordinated
 [ f6 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ R a5 ]  I wasn't sure about the intent of this move. Black's best target is probably g3.
 [ e5 ]  [ g3 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ B g2 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ N c3 ]  one of the things that make the English a difficult system to play is the subtle strategies at play.
 [ R f h1 ] , [ R g6 ]  [ K h7 ] exposed to potential knight check.
 [ N x f6 + ]  [ Q x f6 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ B x d4 ]  [ B d5 ] , [ c6 ]  Driving the bishop away and preparing d5.
 [ K f3 ] , [ g4 + ]  39. ..... [ g4 + ] - this pawn advance cuts off any defense of the pawn on h5. Henry is licking his lips!
 [ B x f3 ]  [ B x f3 ]  [ N x d4 ] , [ Q d1 ]  Alternative variation: 14. [ Q d3 ] [ R f e8 + ] 15. [ K f1 ] [ N x c3 ] 16. [ B x c3 ] [ B x c3 ] 17. [ b x c3 ] [ N x f3 ] 18. [ Q x f3 ] [ Q b5 + ] 19. [ K g1 ] $19
 [ R x d8 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ N h5 ]  [ g3 ] , [ g5 ]  Ah keeping my extra pawn is going to be hard.....
 [ B e7 ]  [ K d7 ] , [ R c4 ]  ?? black's 31st move will prove that was a mistake.
 [ N f6 ] , [ B x c6 ]  Now I win a pawn. Edit: I did not mean to imply that it was forced.
 [ B x h3 ] , [ B x e3 ]  Arrggg....at last I get that knight!! I thought taking the bishop would leave my king wide open. I had to carefully calculate though the threat to my King. The Queen can easily move to [ g6 ] and the rook is controlling the f file. I decide I can protect my g pawn with my bishop to f1.
 [ g4 ] , [ B g6 ]  I'll admit to having mentally flipped a coin here. In hindsight I should have gone [ N x b3 ] and if either [ a x b3 ] or [ c x b3 ] used the tempo to get my bishop clear or if my bishop was taken capture the rook on a1. Either way is good.
 [ c4 ]  [ Q c6 ] , [ N e4 ]  Gain some tempos that weakens the enemy positions further. (Here [ N x f6 ] is threatened)
 [ Q x c1 ] , [ N g6 ]  Finishing the knight maneuver. This move also allows the bishop to come to [ e7 ] so I can castle away and bring my other rook to the c-file.
 [ K h8 ]  [ Q h6 ]  [ R f g8 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ R g7 ]  [ N g5 ] , [ N x d4 ]  The following [ N f5 ] was the only chance that my ood opponent had. But I noticed that and played wonderfuly to me:)!
 [ B x c6 ]  [ b x c6 ]  [ R e1 ] , [ R b8 ]  Playing on his brand new shiny open file
 [ O-O ]  [ O-O ] , [ R e1 ]  The e-pawn is under attack - what can be done about it? Maybe I ought to have carried on for better or for worse 11...e5!? 12.[ B x c6 ] [ b x c6 ] 13.[ N x e5 ] [ N x e5 ] 14.[ d x e5 ] [ B e7 ] but the position doesn't look very comfortable. Another idea might have been 11...[ R e8 ] 12.[ B f4 ] [ N a7 ] 13.[ B d3 ] Nc6. Instead I tried to revivify my game - and redress my earlier mishandling - with a pawn sacrifice. Had I thought this through more I might well have chosen differently.
 [ B d2 ]  [ B x d2 + ] , [ N b x d2 ]  White is happy here but would have preferred to keep the black bishop longer
 [ R x a1 ] , [ R x a1 ]  Now I think white is looking pretty good the question is what are the best moves?
 [ h x g4 ] , [ h5 ]  White offered a draw after playing this move. But White could further have tested Black's defences by 70.Kg3! I would probably have responded with 70...[ R a8 ] with the following plausible continuation in mind: 71.[ h5 ] [ R g8 ] 72.[ R f7 ] [ K e5 ] 73.[ h6 ] [ R h8 ] 74.[ h7 ] [ K e6 ] 75.[ R a7 ] [ K f5 ] 76.[ R g7 ] [ K f6 ] 77.[ R a7 ] [ K g6 ] 78.[ R a6 + ] Kx[ h7 ] Draw! A tough encounter!
 [ B b3 ]  [ a5 ]  [ a4 ] , [ b4 ]  NO problem. His own pawns are my defence. But now I "saw" a nice hole on [ c4 ] and I ran to occupy it without thinking.
 [ N g f6 ]  [ O-O-O ] , [ B e7 ]  Here [ Q c7 ] is usually played delaying the development of the [ f8 ] Bishop which goes to [ d6 ] regularly. Sensing that Black was intending to castle short I played a quite noncommittal move.
 [ O-O ] , [ f5 ]  This looks aggressive but weakens blacks kingside
 [ Q a3 + ]  [ K x d2 ]  [ Q e3 + ] , [ K d1 ]  and white resigns 43....[ B c3 ] 44.[ Q d3 ] [ R x d3 ] with 45....[ Q d2 # ] to follow is the finish
 [ K b6 ]  [ B c4 ] , [ N a5 ]  If [ N c1 ] then one threat by the dark-squared bishop wins the knight.
 [ Q x e1 + ]  [ R x e1 ]  [ R x e1 + ]  [ N x e1 ]  [ f5 ]  [ b4 ]  [ B e4 ] , [ c3 ]  It was here I realized I'm too tied down and am in serious trouble.
 [ K e3 ]  [ K e7 ] , [ R g2 ]  Not fully consistent but i wanted to occupy this file before black did.
 [ Q e5 + ]  [ K f3 ]  [ Q c3 + ]  [ K e2 ]  [ Q e5 + ] , [ K d3 ]  57. [ K d3 ] - Henry makes towards his queenside footman but will this be shelter enough?
 [ N c6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ e3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B d3 ]  [ h6 ]  [ N b d2 ] , [ N h7 ]  Black is apparently planning a pawn assault.
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ d5 ] , [ N a5 ]  attacking the bishop.
 [ e5 ]  [ B x h7 ]  [ R x h7 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ Q x e5 ]  [ Q d3 ] , [ O-O-O ]  Maybe better was a [ Q [ e4 ] ] to change the Queens. If he donot want the exchange You win some territory and time for R7h8. Maybe You stands better after the exchange because You can doubling Your rooks on the d-file and place Your King on [ [ b6 ] ] and then the knight on [ e4 ] and the King on [ [ b6 ] ] enough defence for the push c5. - These are just plans. The opponent will move inbetween too but after [ Q [ e4 ] ] Qx[ e4 ] Nx[ e4 ] [ R c1 ] is a must and then R7[ h8 ] and I think You have the better position.
 [ g5 ]  [ R f5 ]  [ h5 ] , [ Q f8 ]  black has complete control of the f file now.
 [ Q e3 ] , [ R e8 ]  20... P-[ K4 ] is answered by 21 Q-[ R3 ] ch with mate to soon follow.
 [ h5 ]  [ R d1 ]  [ h4 ]  [ R x d4 ]  [ Q b1 + ]  [ B e1 ] , [ h3 ]  Setting up mate...
 [ b3 ]  [ b6 ]  [ B b2 ] , [ B b7 ]  This is to be a 'Nimzo-Larsen' Attack Symmetrical Variation'. This has been played in the top flights of grandmaster chess. I never touch the thing myself... :-D
 [ R f e1 ]  [ h5 ]  [ N e2 ]  [ h4 ]  [ h3 ]  [ g5 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ R f e8 ]  [ K h2 ] , [ f6 ]  Black is playing a little risky pushing the pawns in front of his king.
 [ R b8 ]  [ R c1 ]  [ R e8 ] , [ Q d2 ]  clearing the back rank and connecting the rooks.
 [ B g5 ] , [ N f5 + ]  Taking the strong [ f5 ] post.
 [ e4 ]  [ d6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ Q f3 ]  [ e5 ]  [ d3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ B g5 ] , [ B g7 ]  Going toward the Indian defense type
 [ B b7 ]  [ O-O ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ e x d4 ] , [ B e7 ]  Portisch has a slight lead in development.
 [ g x f6 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ K e1 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ c3 ]  [ N e7 ]  [ h5 ]  [ N f5 ] , [ R g1 ]  Pinning the pawn.
 [ K f7 ]  [ f4 ]  [ K g7 ]  [ h4 ]  [ K f7 ]  [ K c2 ]  [ K g7 ] , [ K c3 ]  And Joanne offers the draw and Black accepts. It's not clear to me how Black could have avoided the draw but I'm sure some of you may have some ideas. Any and all input is appreciated. As always my thanks to Joanne for these games.
 [ N c3 ] , [ e6 ]  4.[ N f3 ] is strong also and leads to both sides fighting for the c file. 4. [ N c3 ] announces a king side pawn attack on the black's light bishop.
 [ R d1 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ Q f4 ]  [ h6 ] , [ B x f6 ]  Gives me the bishop pair but I need to work out how to take advantage of it
 [ N h2 ]  [ R c8 + ]  [ K e7 ] , [ B f2 ]  63. [ B c5 + ] holds out much longer. Now it is over...
 [ a x b3 ]  [ a x b3 ]  [ R a6 ] , [ N d2 ]  and last bad move. which loses after [ g5 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ N d4 ]  I go for early aggression hoping for some early trades.
 [ d x e5 ]  [ f x e5 ] , [ R h4 ]  Best place to continue pressing on the 2 weak points in the king side.
 [ N x c4 ]  [ d x c4 ] , [ B c2 ]  Now my bishop's mobility is restricted and a pawn storm is coming from the west... but hey do I have something of my own to exploit?
 [ Q d3 ]  [ Q x d3 ] , [ B x d3 ]  With the queens gone my bishops dominate the board.
 [ B c7 ]  [ f x e5 ]  [ B x e5 ] , [ N d6 + ]  20 Nd6!! he cannot take my Knight because if he takes [ B x d4 ] wins by forking queen and rook. So his king has to move. [ d8 ] loses because Nx [ f7 ] wins his Bishop for free and I would still have the pin on the Knight.[ f8 ] and [ e7 ] loses because I would take f pawn anyway!
 [ B f4 + ] , [ K b6 ]  better was [ K d8 ] or [ K b7 ] Puts the K in a better place
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ] , [ Q h5 ]  Patzer opening. When I'm playing amateurs I usually go with [ Q f3 ] instead but P[ g6 ] QxP+ gives white a free rook--always a nice way to start the day.
 [ Q x b4 ] , [ B x b4 ]  After the exchange the game is totally over. Black is expecting White to take the "free" pawn.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ f5 ]  ?! The controversial Latvian Gambit. Very rarely seen at high levels Black gives up a pawn (and usually much more) for a lead in space and development.
 [ R d7 ] , [ e5 + ]  entering the castle.
 [ R x h8 ]  [ g x h8 = Q ]  [ Q h3 ]  [ Q g7 ]  [ Q x e3 ]  [ h7 ]  [ a4 ]  [ h8 = Q ] , [ a3 + ]  I lost on time. It was a good game though. And there was only one real mistake one my part in the blitz game on move 28. But although I lost I was still very happy about the game as a whole. Really the only thing you should focus on is the quality of the chess game you played not the result. If you lose but played very well that means you are imporving. If you play badly and win sooner or later you will not get so lucky. In this game the players were stronger than the average opponent. There was really only one mistake made by both sides. Black's only real mistake was letting go of the material(the doubled pawns can be overlooked since they were difficult to attack and in blitz opening lines for your pieces and ignoring structure more or less is a good idea.) and my mistake I mentioned already. His mistake was a bigger one and I won the position but lost the game.
 [ B x e6 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ N f1 ]  [ R h d8 ]  [ a3 ]  [ R a6 ] , [ b4 ]  ? No love for the bishop?
 [ R h1 + ]  [ K g2 ]  [ R h8 ]  [ K f3 ]  [ R f8 + ] , [ R f4 ]  White forfeits on time but the pawn promotion can not be stopped and black would get a queen and win. White does not have time to eliminate the knight and promote pawns. A nice game with interesting play.
 [ K x c2 ]  [ K e2 ]  [ B x d2 ] , [ c x d2 ]  
 [ Q x d8 + ]  [ K a7 ] , [ B x b6 # ]  One of the few games in this mini I've enjoyed!
 [ N d5 ] , [ e4 ]  The White bishop is now locked in however chess is a game of give and take. The Knight on [ d5 ] blocks White's pressure down the d-file and guards against a Rook invasion on c7. Overall the White pieces are doing fine with this move.
 [ B e3 ]  [ Q a5 + ]  [ N b5 c3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ B e2 ] , [ b5 ]  Still from the DB only now I'm playing moves that seem to favor white more than black. I think that was a mental lapse and I was cycling through so many new games where I was playing white that I was just in the habit of picking moves for white (I had just joined two mini tournaments and was white in almost all of those 8 games).
 [ K x c4 ] , [ K x d6 ]  The next few moves are jst formality nw...a man fights till the end but he keeps on hoping even after the end like my opponent here [*-*]
 [ N b4 ] , [ O-O-O ]  15. 0-0-0 - queenside I choose you! I did consider the kingside but then Freddy has a ready-made open g column to attack Henry he already has the Wicked Witch on the h column and all he has to do is to develop his dsb and then the heavies can pile up quite quickly on the g column. I remember a game where I took what looked like a free pawn on the file in front of Henry where he could bring a rook to quickly - Freddy did use this as a basis for a mating attack so once bitten twice shy!
 [ e x d4 ]  [ Q x d4 ] , [ N c6 ]  Nothing new yet.
 [ K h8 ]  [ R b7 ]  [ Q c3 ]  [ R a2 ]  [ B h3 ] , [ R b1 ]  White sees the checkmate threat. (Qe1#)
 [ B e7 ] , [ B x f4 ]  white continually sacrifices pieces to keep the pressure on black and to keep the poorly placed pieces on poorly kept squares
 [ a3 ]  [ K e2 ] , [ K f6 ]  now the idea is to attract the black king as far as possible to have the time to take the a and d-pawns and go back to protect the f-g-h pawns... dramatic...
 [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ O-O ]  Simple development of the pieces.
 [ Q a5 + ]  [ B d2 ] , [ Q x e5 ]  Tartakower regains the Pawn and centralizes his Queen. He next needs to get his King to safety.
 [ B c4 ] , [ a3 ]  thewrongreason: I was real concerned about her a pawn since that's why Charles opponent resigned. But the [ B c4 ] stops it. I'm a little concerned about Janet playing 29...[ K f4 ] which would appear to win our [ g4 ] pawn which would also disrupt that pawn chain. As such I'm going to vote for 29.[ R x g7 ] so that if she's comes down with her monarch the pawn is protected. redfoxrising: I like Joe's suggestion I'll support 29. [ R x g7 ] as well archduke_piccolo: I don't think... ... that a win is possible with the piece sacrifice suggested: 29.[ R x g7 ] [ a2 ] 30.Bx[ a2 ] Rx[ a2 ] Now Black's King is very close to the passed pawn pair; the knight will soon become active; and the White King is cut off from the action on the back rank. We could draw this but not win it. I think the obvious 29.B[ a2 ] ... to blockade the pawn is mandatory. THEN we may think about taking the g-pawn. thewrongreason: I'll change my vote then to 29.B[ a2 ] redfoxrising: I'll change my vote then to 29.B[ a2 ] after Ion's post
 [ B x e5 ]  [ R b7 ]  [ B x d7 + ] , [ Q x d7 ]  Taking with the rook instead would have let him keep his d-pawn. This guy just keeps making bad moves...
 [ N f6 ] , [ e4 ]  Per chess365.com following [ e4 ] (n=17441): 1-0: 53.8% 1/2-1/2: 18.3% 0-1: 27.9%
 [ N b6 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ N x d7 ]  [ Q x d7 ] , [ N c3 ]  11. [ N c3 ] - develops a piece and supports my bishop on b5.
 [ R c4 ]  [ N a2 ]  [ h5 ] , [ N c3 ]  !! Now the pawn is protected! The advantage just switched.
 [ e3 ]  [ b6 ]  [ B d3 ] , [ d x c4 ]  ??!
 [ Q x c6 ] , [ B d3 ]  looks at [ h7 ] and defends [ e4 ] and [ c2 ] but blocks the battery down the d-file: so it has its advantages and disadvantages. Alternatives were 13. [ B e2 ] and 13. Bg2.
 [ Q c3 ] , [ N f5 ]  Already down a pawn [ R g8 ] let's black fork rooks. I just about threw in the towel here with mate a single move away. Then I remembered the queen's original plan. The king has to move buying black another turn while evening the material score.
 [ R h4 ]  [ f6 ]  [ g x f6 ] , [ N x f6 ]  ...then we trade our pawns so I can remove that troublesome pawn high up...
 [ g5 ]  [ e6 ]  [ K f8 ]  [ e7 + ]  [ K e8 ] , [ B h5 + ]  White's pawn will promote.
 [ R e1 ] , [ c5 ]  If he captured my c pawn I would re-capture it and then complete my pawn storm
 [ R x e8 + ] , [ R x e8 ]  not so great as [ B x f5 ] allows black entrance to the 2nd rank(work this out) where it is very strong.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ] , [ f4 ]  grew fond of this: Kings' Gambit...
 [ B h3 ] , [ O-O-O ]  castle away from the danger
 [ B e1 ] , [ Q x a3 ]  Maintaining defense of the rook at [ d3 ] and lining up two pieces to attack f3.
 [ N x c6 ]  [ B x c6 ] , [ Q f5 ]  Childhoodish play!
 [ R e7 ]  [ K x g4 ]  [ R x e4 + ]  [ K f5 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ h5 ]  [ R f8 + ] , [ K g4 ]  42...[ K e4 ] was better; the text allows White to trap the BK on [ h4 ] with 43.f3+! and quickly clean up his remaining pawns without any worry about advancing Black pawns.
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ] , [ B c4 ]  This is one of my First games so I decided to mix it up.
 [ b x c5 ]  [ b x c5 ]  [ g x f4 ]  [ B d6 ] , [ N x d6 + ]  not forced but black had nothing better
 [ h3 ]  [ B h5 ] , [ N e5 ]  9. [ N e5 ] - this knight move brings about a trade off of minor pieces.
 [ f x e4 ] , [ B e5 ]  Still forced
 [ h3 ]  [ B x f3 ]  [ g x f3 ] , [ N f6 ]  Perhaps he should have taken the d-pawn.
 [ B e2 ] , [ K f7 ]  41. ..... [ K f7 ] - Henry marches to the [ c6 ] pawn's aid but alas he doesn't get very far.
 [ N e2 ] , [ N e5 ]  Oftentimes in the middle game you will see a series of knight moves as both sides attempt to find a knight outpost. Both sides are pursuing this goal masterfully!
 [ e6 ]  [ B b2 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ B e7 ] , [ B d3 ]  When both the bishops are aligned like this they become extremely deadly
 [ N x c3 ] , [ c6 ]  Now is my knight that is misplaced. But he will lose a second pawn anyway [ f4 ] is definitely dead. I didn't play [ N e2 ] because I was "smelling" something bad with the black pawn's majority on the queenside but I wasn't able to calculate such a large number of variations. And I wanted to activate my rook. Anyway a more deep look shows that the white position is not as good as it looks. I was unable to see it and I got in serious troubles.
 [ N x f3 + ]  [ Q x f3 ] , [ Q g6 ]  This move came as a surprise. After 13...[ Q x f3 ] 14. [ e x f3 ] [ [ f5 ] ] it seems like black is doing just fine. My opponent probably believed that I would have good drawing chances so he keeps the queens on the board for now while also threatening an [ [ f5 ] ] push.
 [ d6 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ B g4 ]  This is something I play a lot as I generally don't know what to do with this clear black bishop and the knights are dangerous pieces in the closed english
 [ c5 ] , [ e3 ]  First this one thematic too that opens the lsb's way but much more important prevents the knight to jump to [ h5 ] after a future g5. Of course it doesn't solve the [ e4 ] placement.
 [ B x d7 + ] , [ N x d7 ]  Now a central pawn up and equally developed I plan to control the center of the board at some point soon.
 [ N f6 ] , [ R g1 ]  The ideas was to make it difficult for black to develop but I think that o-o-o was better.
 [ B x d5 + ] , [ K h8 ]  Another inaccuracy.31...[ K f8 ] gives more resistance.
 [ B h5 + ]  [ g6 ]  [ Q x d8 ]  [ R x d8 + ]  [ K e2 ]  [ g x h5 ] , [ K e3 ]  A hopeless position for white...0-1
 [ B x c6 ]  [ Q x b8 ]  [ B x a4 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ g3 ]  [ f5 ]  [ Q b3 ]  [ Q f7 ]  [ Q b5 ]  [ Q c7 ] , [ Q d7 + ]  Forces the exchange of Queens. Black's King alone will be unable to stop the pawns running free.
 [ R x f8 + ]  [ K x f8 ] , [ K f4 ]  threatening the piece that protects his knight. It is generally a good idea to move your king between pieces that are protecting each other.
 [ B x h5 ]  [ N c5 ]  [ c3 ]  [ Q d6 ]  [ N g3 ]  [ B c8 ]  [ Q f3 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ N f5 ]  [ B x f5 ]  [ Q x f5 ]  [ Q e6 ]  [ Q f3 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ b4 ] , [ N d7 ]  I was hoping in my [ g5 ] pawn after the queens' exchange and a 0-0-0.
 [ R f2 ] , [ Q g3 ]  This was bound to happen eventually. With my rook there I can't see an immediate threat but I do need to be extra careful.
 [ B h6 ]  [ R f7 ]  [ B x g7 ] , [ R x g7 ]  19. ....... [ R x g7 ] - this rook is gonna be a right pain. It covers Warren's exposed king and puts an end to my mating attack.
 [ Q a8 + ]  [ K b4 ]  [ Q h8 ] , [ a3 ]  43. ...... [ a3 ] - here I decided to wave the white flag as there was no way I could contain the queenside pawns and stop one of them from crowning. 4 pawns are definitely better than a bishop. Anyhow at least this imbalance made the game interesting even though I lost. Hope you have all enjoyed your weekend - bye for now - Joanne
 [ d6 ]  [ B a3 ]  [ N d8 ]  [ f4 ] , [ B e6 ]  Nice move. [ Q b5 + ] would be answered by c6. White has to move the queen again in which case black picks off the white bishop for free.
 [ K g7 ] , [ Q g5 ]  Black tried to defend [ g6 ] with his K but now White threatens check on h6.
 [ e4 ] , [ N e5 + ]  This move was great for multiple reasons. It continues the attack but also adds a defender of [ g6 ] to halt the advance of the pawn.
 [ K h2 ] , [ N h5 ]  targeting new weakness on [ f4 ]  [ N g1 ] , [ N f4 ]  the QN combo forces Black to give up good bishop
 [ h4 ]  [ Q c6 ]  [ h5 ]  [ N h8 ] , [ N g5 + ]  Two moves too late.
 [ N x g5 ]  [ h6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ f x g4 ]  [ h x g4 ] , [ B x g4 ]  won a pawn exposed to many traps... like...
 [ a4 ]  [ a6 ]  [ R d1 ] , [ Q e7 ]  18. ...... [ Q e7 ] - Glenda sidestepps the pin on the [ d6 ] pawn. I now use a pin on the a column to my advantage.
 [ N x e7 + ]  [ K g7 ]  [ R f1 ]  [ Q b7 ]  [ N f5 + ]  [ B x f5 ]  [ Q x f5 ] , [ Q x b2 ]  [ N d1 ] forks black's queen and rook. But a knight and two pawns is worth the rook. 34. NxR Q[ x N e3 + ] lets black defend P[ f6 ] with 37. [ K h1 ] (or Rf2) Qb6.
 [ Q x h3 ]  [ B x f2 + ]  [ K x f2 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ N x f6 ]  [ Q d4 + ]  [ K f1 ] , [ e x d3 ]  Saying "please take my rook on g8". I had in mind the following line: 25.[ N x g8 ] [ d x c2 ] 26.[ N e7 ] [ N x e7 ] 27.[ f6 ] [ K c7 ] 28.[ f x e7 ] [ Q d1 ] 29.[ R x d1 ] [ R x d1 ] 30.[ K f2 ] [ R d2 ] 31.[ K e3 ] [ c1 Q ] 32.[ e8 = Q ] [ R d8 ]  [ c x d3 ]  [ Q f4 + ] , [ N f3 ]  The third pin.
 [ Q b6 + ] , [ d4 ]  En passant or whatever would have REALLY F*cked me over right there. Anyone agree?
 [ Q d7 + ]  [ Q x d7 ] , [ R x d7 ]  And this is the moment for a fine manouvre I think.
 [ B d7 ] , [ Q c2 ]  May have been more efficient to have just put it there a move ago white may have lost his tempo lead but I need to take advantage of that for it to be an issue...
 [ Q g7 + ]  [ R g4 ] , [ N g6 ]  With the deadly threat h7-[ h5 ] or [ N f6 ] and White will have to give up the exchange.
 [ R x d4 ]  [ R x d2 ]  [ R x d2 ]  [ Q x d2 ]  [ Q e4 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ Q h1 + ] , [ Q c1 ]  That was a nice move for the moment ! Though black pieces are much smarter ! Watch out !!! It is ideal time to play tac-tics. Have the focus on Bishop at e6.
 [ K f2 ] , [ Q e1 # ]  So he didn't see the mate threat.
 [ K x f2 ]  [ Q h4 + ] , [ g3 ]  There was not any good place to move the king. In the long term my pawn structure would give nice possibilities for black to attack me but with this move I was so much ahead in development and black position was so bad that I didn't care a bit. Black must not lose any tempo to gain some advantage of this position thing that is almost impossible now that the queen is on the middle of the field.
 [ R f1 ]  [ c3 ]  [ R d f2 ]  [ d2 ] , [ R f2 f8 + ]  last hope: a trick.
 [ B g5 ]  [ Q g7 ]  [ R h e1 ]  [ h6 ] , [ N g3 + ]  Ng3+! There is no good move here--...[ B e5 ] then Rx e5+...[ Q x e5 ] [ Q x d7 ] + with various winning scenarios.
 [ K b1 ]  [ a5 ]  [ h x g5 ]  [ Q x g5 ]  [ R h5 ]  [ Q f6 ]  [ Q e3 ] , [ N e x f5 ]  in my surprice he sacrifice his 2 knight for my 3 phone and that makes his King naked on my attack..
 [ a4 ]  [ b4 ] , [ a5 ]  Exclam. I had only considered 14. [ N c d5 ] [ N b d5 ] 15. [ N d5 ] [ N d5 ] 16. [ e d5 ] [ a5 ] where black has hope of consolidating.
 [ N x a5 ]  [ B x e4 ] , [ B d3 ]  So I decide to attempt another exchange but this is another test. This time however she passes the test. Erika sees that I am threatening and instead of taking black decides to retreat. If she had failed I would have pointed out the problem. The lesson that my student learned is that it's generally a bad idea to exchange when you're behind. Why? Because it gives you less material then he or she needs since the attacks become overwhelming.
 [ g6 ]  [ e3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N g e2 ]  [ N b d7 ] , [ O-O ]  All logical developing moves by both sides so far....
 [ K d3 ]  [ d5 ] , [ B b5 ]  Because of 37...d5?! he took the chance to try and regain what he lost.
 [ K e3 ] , [ R a2 ]  Attacks my Knight. Better: 30. … [ Q a5 ] 31. [ Q x e5 + ] [ Q x e5 + ] 32. [ f x e5 ] [ b5 ] 33. [ R a1 ] [ a5 ]  [ K d7 ] , [ Q d5 + ]  Keeping the tempo and pressure on him.
 [ e4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f d7 ]  [ f4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B e2 ]  [ b6 ]  [ N d1 ]  [ a5 ]  [ O-O ] , [ B a6 ]  This idea is common and works well.
 [ K h8 ] , [ B g8 + ]  Here I respectfully resign. 23.... [ K x g8 ] is forced and then 24. [ Q h7 ] is mate. A nice little modified wing gambit played by white. I need some new lines to counter this gambit.
 [ K f2 ]  [ O-O-O ]  [ R c1 ] , [ b6 ]  Now I felt I had the game in my hands. It's very easy to attack all those advanced pawns...
 [ N e5 ] , [ B e2 ]  I hesitated a long time before electing this move. The other candidates moves where 13. [ Q e2 ] 13. [ Q b3 ] 13. [ N b3 ] but black would probably have traded his e kight against the bishop and in this particular position I thought that the LSB would be usefull to attack the black queen so that it shouldn't be traded.
 [ N d5 ] , [ e6 ]  I'm not why Erika played this but it's irrelevant. No matter what white did black was going to win another pawn. Even after for example 21.[ Q e2 ] [ N x e5 ] 22.Qxe5?? is obviously unplayable.
 [ B h2 ]  [ N d7 b6 ] , [ Q e2 ]  After much time thinking. I have to free my knight [ f3 ] from the duty of guarding e5.
 [ R c5 ] , [ b4 ]  thanks: [ c4 ] is now up to advance any time it can.
 [ Q d4 ] , [ O-O ]  just in case he has any ideas
 [ B h6 ]  [ B x h4 ]  [ R x a2 ]  [ Q x a2 ]  [ B e3 + ]  [ B f2 ]  [ B x f2 + ]  [ K x f2 ]  [ N x e4 + ]  [ K g1 ]  [ N g5 ]  [ B d3 + ]  [ K f6 ] , [ R x h7 ]  The only Black hope to counter attack by [ N x h3 ] is dismissed. White is a Queen up so it's time to resign.
 [ e4 ] , [ g5 ]  The pawn storm in full swing but was I afraid? Not in the slightest - because black had not really developed any pieces on the kingside.
 [ e4 ] , [ d5 ]  For those that know me I play the Scandanavian a lot. It immediately rips up the center and is a "surprise" move to a lot of players who play 1. e4. This opening leads white into a few very tough decisions right from the start but is actually more defensive in nature than it appears at this stage (at least the variation that I prefer).
 [ N c3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B d3 ] , [ e5 ]  My favorite move here.
 [ e6 ]  [ e4 ] , [ d5 ]  Some times I play [ N f3 ] here but this time I was trying something else.
 [ e x f5 ] , [ g3 ]  I was thinking he might play f4.
 [ B e6 ] , [ f3 ]  Defends the [ e5 ] pawn and prevents Bg4.
 [ e4 ]  [ c6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ f3 ] , [ Q b6 ]  Very rare. The main line is 3...[ e6 ] 4. [ N c3 ] Bb4.
 [ K h7 ]  [ f4 ]  [ R b7 ] , [ Q d3 + ]  Black moves to defend [ Q c7 ] but fails to see the second possible fork between the king and knight. Black promptly resigns.
 [ e3 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ Q c2 ] , [ Q e7 ]  The play revolves around the [ e4 ] pawn.
 [ N c5 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ N x d7 ] , [ B x d7 ]  Black has a fatal weakness on [ K B3 ] which White proceeds to exploit.
 [ e5 ]  [ d4 ]  [ e x d4 ] , [ c3 ]  Offering another pawn for time and space to develop quickly and prepare an attack.
 [ B x f7 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ R f8 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ Q b6 ]  [ c3 ]  [ N a6 ]  [ b3 ]  [ R f4 ] , [ Q d3 ]  Better to protect that pawn with the rook maybe. The queen is too easy to push around.
 [ R x d4 ] , [ Q f5 ]  The only reason I'm still playing is because I had posted a comment on the game and was waiting for White to respond to it.
 [ R x f1 ]  [ R x f1 + ] , [ K d2 ]  Forced and that is exactly what I wanted so one of my goals worked. I really wanted to force into making a certain move as it's psychological. If he is forced to do something I generally hope that my opponents get overworked and hand over the advantage. Usually that's how it happens and it has caused me to pull a swindle in a couple of past games. By this I'm alluding to a victory in a lost position. Of course the Master Mater is not going to get stressed over a forced move but it still proves that I'm no where near ready to resign yet. That's because when I first joined the site and for the first few years I used to resign in this kind of position. In fact I gave up as soon as I gave up something like a pawn. That's when Jack Stockel has repeatedly said "Don't give up right away. Start thinking."
 [ a6 ] , [ N a3 ]  The Gameknot computer puts white as 0.86 ahead here
 [ N x b7 ] , [ R x b7 ]  Now it is a matter of forcing my two extra pawns down the board or bringing my king into play to get a King-Rook mate.
 [ e x d4 ] , [ N x d4 ]  Exchange accepted
 [ B d3 ]  [ B b7 ] , [ O-O ]  The current main line. Alternatives are the aggressive [ e4 ] or the quiet a3.
 [ Q b7 ]  [ Q c3 ]  [ Q e4 ]  [ R f1 ]  [ N e5 ] , [ R f4 ]  ! and now my position is very good and fun to play. of course [ Q e1 ] is forced.
 [ K g6 ]  [ Q x e6 ]  [ N x e5 ] , [ B e4 + ]  Mating. Interesting game with mistakes but it wouldn't be fun without mistakes!
 [ N f3 ]  [ Q g6 ]  [ c x d6 ] , [ N g4 ]  Now here he's doing 2 things he's blocking my Queen from the diagonal to [ c8 ] and he's threatening a tremendous forkjob on my castles.
 [ N c6 ] , [ b4 ]  I plan to attack it again by advancing my b pawn.
 [ g4 + ]  [ K e2 ]  [ B h6 ] , [ B x c6 + ]  This move wins a whole Rook in addition to removing a pair of minor pieces.
 [ c4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ d5 ]  i give this move a question mark. Usually black develops the knight Nb8-[ c6 ] or d7-d6. I don't think pushing the pawn one square further is good for black this does not look like a gambit but more like a blunder. Probably black though he could play a reversed sicilian like 1.[ e4 ] c5; 2.[ N f3 ] Nc6; 3.d4. See if you can spot the one small difference.
 [ N g8 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ d6 ]  [ Q f3 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ Q x b7 ]  [ R b8 ]  [ B b5 + ]  [ K e7 ]  [ e x d6 + ]  [ K x d6 ]  [ Q x a7 ]  [ R b6 ] , [ Q a3 + ]  Though no all moves of my opponent were the best this time we came to an end quite easy ...:)
 [ O-O-O ]  [ B d7 ] , [ h4 ]  now i started the attack with h4.
 [ B x g4 ]  [ B x g4 ]  [ N d x e5 ]  [ Q d4 ]  [ Q g5 ]  [ Q a4 + ]  [ K d8 ] , [ h3 ]  I can't play [ h5 ] because he plays f4. I think I have to trade pieces and I'll stay down a pawn. That's bad; I should be avoiding piece trades because I'm behind.
 [ g3 ]  [ Q d8 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ a6 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ R e8 ] , [ K g2 ]  This helps fill in the gaps along the light squares around the king.
 [ g5 ]  [ B g3 ] , [ h5 ]  Here white is strongly encouraged to play QxPd5.
 [ R x a6 ]  [ R c a8 ]  [ R d6 ] , [ R x a5 ]  And that is the way it plays out.
 [ Q c4 ]  [ R d c8 ]  [ B c3 ] , [ Q h7 ]  nice move discover attack from knight on [ c5 ] and nothing to stop him capturing the pawn on [ e4 ] witch has 3 pieces on him !!
 [ N e2 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ K f1 ] , [ Q d3 ]  White is running out of moves black is threatening [ R b1 ] white's position is totally passive
 [ O-O ]  [ e4 ]  [ e5 ] , [ d5 ]  (GT) White might play 15 KR-[ Q1 ] keeping the option of breaking up the center later on. I wanted him to advance this Pawn as there is now a fine post for my B at QB4.
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ] , [ N c3 ]  I am not a favorite of this move to open for white. It leaves too many holes. Lets see how it plays out.
 [ e5 ] , [ a3 ]  I know this is a slow move and is probably disliked by many higher rated players but I need to get my queen pawn moving and I didnt want a pin on my QS knight with Bb4.
 [ N g e7 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ O-O ] , [ O-O-O ]  The Kings have signalled that it's going to be an all out war. I felt really good about my position because thanks to Black's first move I should have the upper-hand in opening lines first. On top of that I am better developed so any active operations would find me better placed to seize the advantage.
 [ N x h2 ] , [ B c7 ]  Now he attacks my [ d6 ] pawn.
 [ h x g5 ]  [ N e4 ] , [ K x e5 ]  I offered White a draw here but he turned it down obviously thinking that he had gained an advantage from his knight position. GameKnot computer analysis has me at +1.44 in this situation.
 [ e5 ] , [ Q d2 ]  ? Why not QxPa7? Juicy pawn ripe for the plucking. Black wasn't attacking anything.
 [ b3 ]  [ N b d7 ] , [ N d2 ]  Making use of the non pressure of Nb-[ d7 ] to develop further and release the [ a1 ] rook. This has the hidden threat of making the knight pin critical.
 [ c x b5 ]  [ a6 ] , [ e3 ]  Personally I think accepting the gambit here is too dangerous. In this line White is willing to give back the pawn but wants to make Black work for it.
 [ N f6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N c6 ]  [ d3 ] , [ a6 ]  I'm not sure the purpose of this move. I'm not really inclined to place my Knight or Bishop on the [ b5 ] square as the king is ready to castle
 [ R b1 ] , [ Q x a6 ]  32. [ Q x [ a6 ] ] - Glenda removes the final passer on the queenside. I am now up in material and at least I have a potential Glenda 2 on the d column. But will that potential be realised? We shall see. Note that that capture on [ a6 ] was only possible because Glenda (known as Glenda the Defender) poor put upon lady defends the rook on f1.
 [ g3 + ] , [ K h3 ]  i liked [ h5 ] better it made him last longer and it gave me a way to mess up.
 [ e4 ] , [ e5 ]  This is horrible. Black should've played Nf6. Black is simply creating the same weaknesses as White while White has the tempo.
 [ h3 ] , [ h6 ]  Since my LSB was valuable i wanted a escape square for my LSB if he played Nh4.
 [ a4 ]  [ R e8 ] , [ d4 ]  This is where his troubles began.
 [ R x a5 ] , [ B f2 ]  Now I am moving away from the treacherous e8-Rook!
 [ N f3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ e6 ] , [ d4 ]  claiming the center
 [ N c e4 ] , [ B x e5 ]  This is a mistake.
 [ N b d7 ] , [ R b1 ]  [ e4 ] and [ Q c2 ] were also playable here.
 [ K x g3 ] , [ K g6 ]  Clearing [ f5 ] for the f pawn.
 [ B b4 ]  [ N a4 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ N x c6 ]  [ b x c6 ] , [ f4 ]  This seems to lose the [ e4 ] pawn. I found this continuation in GameKnot DB and it looked intriguiging so I played 11. [ [ f4 ] ] to see where it will lead: 11. [ [ f4 ] ] Nx[ e4 ] 12. [ B b6 ] [ Q b8 ] 13. [ Q d4 ] [ N [ f6 ] ] 14. [ R a d1 ] [ B e7 ] 15. [ B c5 ] [ B x c5 ] 16. [ N x c5 ] O-O 17. [ R d3 ] [ N d5 ] 18. [ R g3 ] [ f6 ] 19. [ c4 ] [ e5 ] 20. fx[ e5 ] fx[ e5 ] 21. [ R x g7 ] [ K h8 ] 22. [ R x h7 ] 1-0
 [ Q x a7 ]  [ R b6 ]  [ a4 ]  [ B e6 ] , [ a5 ]  White knows that if he can build up enough pressure on Black's queenside Black will have to give up material to stop a promotion.
 [ B g6 ] , [ c4 ]  A player of this rating should reject any plan that makes his pawn structure look like this.
 [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ] , [ e6 ]  This is all standard stuff at the moment
 [ b x c3 ] , [ f6 ]  I'm not sure of the purpose of this move. I think 0-0 may have been preferable.
 [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ c3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ c x d4 ] , [ e6 ]  This is where I vary from a main line. I look to place a N at e7; top players make me pay for this.
 [ N g f3 ] , [ B d7 ]  following my plan to develop all my pieces.
 [ Q g7 ]  [ R d1 ] , [ Q c3 ]  28. ....... [ Q c3 ] - say Hello to Glenda Steve!
 [ Q x b5 ]  [ R d2 ]  [ a4 ]  [ R a2 ] , [ R d1 ]  An extra piece control of the open file and pawns to target would make the win easy and from here black resigned.
 [ R d1 ]  [ R b2 + ]  [ K g1 ] , [ B f4 ]  Forces white to exchange his only remaining piece.
 [ e5 ]  [ B e7 ] , [ d3 ]  white locked the d file and hoping to get a king side game.
 [ B x e6 ]  [ f x e6 ]  [ O-O ] , [ b5 ]  White exchanged. It's time to advance and see if I can get something out of my queenside majority.
 [ e4 ]  [ c6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ N x e4 ] , [ N f6 ]  This generally transposes to the Bronstein-Larsen variation where White already has a pawn on d4...White gains little by avoiding the advance of the pawn.
 [ a x b4 ]  [ a x b4 ]  [ B x b4 ] , [ N x f6 ]  So far White's plan seems reasonable the [ e5 ] pawn is under attack and White has a N on the 6th rank. White does not forsee Black's 16th move.
 [ c3 ]  [ Q x c5 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ e6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N e7 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ B d4 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B x g7 ]  [ K x g7 ]  [ N b d2 ]  [ a6 ]  [ R c1 ]  [ b5 ]  [ c4 ] , [ b4 ]  White has not reached anything so far: Black is just taking up space...
 [ f4 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ B x e2 ] , [ N g x e2 ]  17. N[ g x e2 ] - trade of light square bishops.
 [ B g5 ]  [ N b d7 ]  [ N x d7 ]  [ Q x d7 ]  [ B x f6 ] , [ g x f6 ]  9. .............. [ g x f6 ] - white has split the kingside pawns I would be tempted to do this I think but it does open up the g file for the king rook an occupation of it with said rook will contribute to Ion's victory later on. The plethora of exchanges on [ d7 ] has helped black's development. White still needs to develop his queen knight and lsb - it will take at least 2 moves to develop this bishop.
 [ R f e1 ]  [ Q d5 ] , [ R e5 ]  [ R e7 ] may have tied black up more and threatened using the good d pawn.
 [ K c5 ]  [ R x b8 ]  [ B x b8 ]  [ K c8 ] , [ B x f4 ]  White removes blacks last chance of getting promotions and somewhat decides the game.
 [ c6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ d5 ] , [ N d2 ]  The reasoning behind playing [ N d2 ] instead of [ N f3 ] is that if Black should chose a [ g6 ] system [ c3 ] could be played opposing a solid pawn chain to the fianchettoed Bishop.
 [ N c3 ]  [ e5 ] , [ d5 ]  Interesting! I'm now going on
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B c4 ] , [ B c5 ]  If black plays instead [ N f6 ] I've also been playing around with the Max Lange attack a very similar opening in a lot of ways.
 [ Q g5 ] , [ R f5 ]  fiercequeen: probably my good looks
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ] , [ f4 ]  In opening like Spanish white lays siege on blacks [ e5 ] pawn slowly over a large number of moves but in KG white starts a storm by attacking it right away. This was a popular opening back in time and many great master used to play this aggressive opening. It could be stated as matter of honor to accept the gambit pawn.
 [ B d5 ]  [ c4 ]  [ K x f3 ]  [ c3 ] , [ K e2 ]  hastening to cut off the runaway
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ] , [ c4 ]  Queen's gambit normal for me.
 [ Q a7 ]  [ Q e4 + ]  [ K c3 ]  [ Q c4 + ]  [ K d2 ]  [ Q x b4 + ]  [ K e2 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ Q a6 + ]  [ K b8 ]  [ Q d3 ]  [ Q x a4 ]  [ K e3 ]  [ f4 + ]  [ K f2 ]  [ B c6 ]  [ Q b1 + ] , [ K c7 ]  The game is over so I resign. Well played Monkofunk. Pressure all the way so a well deserved win. And promotion to the 2200+ club.
 [ e x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ] , [ Q g3 + ]  wining [ g7 ] (witch could be dangerous because it will open at the same time the g colon against my castle I'll have to manage with it)
 [ N f6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B e7 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ b5 ]  [ B b3 ] , [ d6 ]  7. ........ [ d6 ] - standard Leonhardt moves but maybe a knight move to [ a5 ] would have been an interesting variation.
 [ Q x a5 ]  [ b x a5 ]  [ B x a8 ] , [ N c6 ]  As you can see now black's advantage is not so great actually. It is perhaps a -/+ but that is it. Maybe even =/+. Here I started to worry a bit and saw my missed win. So I slowed back down and composed another plan. Since I have space on the kingside as well as the king to attack and some misplaced white pieces I need to attack there. ...[ f5 ] is an idea followed by ...f4. Furthermore white is not losing his light squared bishop for less effective knight so I can exploit the light weaknesses as well.
 [ N f3 ] , [ Q f6 ]  greco defense the black queen aims for the [ f2 ] pawn and his intentions become quite clear in the coming moves when the dark square bishop is also applied to this diagonal
 [ e6 ] , [ Q x e6 ]  More resiliant is 14. ... [ Q d6 ] 15. [ e x f7 + ] Kxf7... So to speak...
 [ e x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ] , [ N e5 ]  I hate it when white plays [ B x [ f7 ] ] ; Kxf7; [ N g5 ] . As that would leave me crippled. Hence why I played [ e x d4 ] moving (relocating) White's [ f3 ] knight. The [ e5 ] knight protects my [ f7 ] pawn and attacks White's [ c4 ] bishop.
 [ N c3 ] , [ N a6 ]  i think that my knight is a little superior because it is not blocking a pawn
 [ Q x a2 ] , [ N x d4 ]  9. [ B x d4 ] might be better here attempting a more permanent end to the bishop perched on g7: Either an exchange or 9. [ B x d4 ] [ e4 ] 10. Bc3? leaving the Black bishop cut off. However two pawns down White is not looking to trade material and the knight is a less favorable exchange for Black's bishop.
 [ e4 ] , [ g5 ]  Not to my surprise Joe plays the Basman Defense.
 [ B x f6 ] , [ Q x f6 ]  ...so I remove the first knight in exchange for my bishop.
 [ K h8 ]  [ g3 ]  [ Q e4 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ K f2 ]  [ R f g8 ] , [ Q f3 ]  forcing trading Queens...
 [ R c1 ] , [ a6 ]  White's rook moves to [ c1 ] and black moves pawn at [ a7 ] to strengthen pawns.
 [ B c1 ] , [ N e6 ]  I move my queen’s bishop to a more active square so he can take part in the storming of Black’s barricades..…KO also liked [ h6 ] pressing the attack..... Black moves his knight on [ f8 ] to a more active position eyeing the strategic [ f4 ] square. The intentions of his eighteenth move have now seeing the light of day a karpovian repositioning of the knight to take advantage of some of the holes left by my advancing pawns on the kingside. KO also liked [ a5 ] (breaking up my pawns on the queenside) but not as much as the move that was played.
 [ a4 ]  [ N b4 ]  [ B a3 ]  [ c5 ]  [ B x b4 ]  [ a x b4 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ B d7 ] , [ N h4 ]  After a few poor moves which have locked up the Queenside this move allows a bit of an attack on White's King
 [ Q d6 ]  [ c5 ] , [ Q f6 ]  It's taken 22 moves but I've tripled on the f-file the [ N e4 ] has gone and White is lost. Any bishop move allows [ R x f2 + ] winning but the alternative ...
 [ Q x f1 + ] , [ K x f1 ]  However the price that I paid for the queen was really high! Any comment is highly appreciated.
 [ Q x d5 ]  [ R x d5 ] , [ R x a7 ]  And win another pawn and occupy the 7th rank. Jummy
 [ B x e3 + ]  [ Q x e3 ]  [ N g6 ]  [ N e2 ]  [ N f4 ]  [ N x f4 ]  [ Q x f4 ]  [ R a g1 ]  [ Q x e3 + ] , [ f x e3 ]  Yes a disruption to the pawns but I don't see that much of a disadvantage in having a large block of pawns there.
 [ f6 ]  [ g6 ]  [ Q h4 ]  [ K h8 ] , [ Q h6 ]  This move frightened me as I thought there was something planned after my expected Rg8.
 [ N e6 ]  [ K g3 ] , [ R f7 ]  39. ..... [ R f7 ] - I was wondering whether [ R x f3 ] was better.
 [ b x c3 ] , [ N b1 ]  The queen's knight has had a restless time in the opening so far.
 [ f5 ] , [ R f3 ]  Black's pawn at [ f5 ] is threatening my knight at e4. I sacrificed my knight and instead moved my rook back to f3.
 [ B x f4 ] , [ e x f4 ]  Black moves his pawn off of [ e5 ] and frees his bishop's line of attack.
 [ d x e5 ] , [ B a3 ]  Did you get it? This move is now worth while because the pawn on [ d6 ] has been removed. It build tension on the kingside and prevents black from castling kinside.
 [ N c3 ] , [ N a6 ]  The knight here is not so great. BxN doubles black's pawns.
 [ N b d7 ]  [ R e1 + ] , [ K d8 ]  So much for your rochade - that THAT. But what now there's so much space...
 [ R h3 h1 ] , [ B x c5 ]  ! (I dare). I mean that RxR RxR+ Kmoves and [ R h2 ] wins the bishop. So I don't have to take that's all. But with this move I also threat...
 [ R x b2 ]  [ R b8 ] , [ R c1 ]  With [ f6 ] guarded well I would have at some point or another in the game wanted to reposition my rooks.
 [ N f3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ c4 ] , [ c6 ]  Slav Defense. White to play.
 [ N x d5 ]  [ B x d5 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ B x d6 ]  [ Q x d6 ] , [ Q d2 ]  prepare queenside castel and watch [ [ f4 ] ] and d4. [ [ f4 ] ] is an ugly hole.
 [ e5 ]  [ d x e5 ] , [ N x g5 ]  A nice sacrifice by Carlsen
 [ N x a5 ]  [ B x a5 ] , [ N g5 ]  More pressure on h3. My heart is pounding at this point.
 [ B b3 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ a4 ] , [ N x g4 ]  19...[ Q x g4 + ] leads to a queen exchange but black goes into a queenless middle game three pawns down which is hopeless.
 [ d6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ h6 ]  [ B h4 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ h3 ]  [ B x f3 ]  [ Q x f3 ]  [ g5 ]  [ B g3 ] , [ B d4 ]  14....Bd4!! pinning the knight and threatening to win a pawn.
 [ Q a8 + ]  [ K h7 ]  [ Q e4 + ]  [ Q x e4 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ R x a3 ]  [ N c5 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ h3 ]  [ R c3 ]  [ N a4 ]  [ R c4 ]  [ R a1 ]  [ B d7 ] , [ N b6 ]  This move sealed the draw as I would win the h pawn after the exchanges on [ d7 ]  [ R c7 ]  [ N x d7 ]  [ R x d7 ]  [ R x a5 ]  [ R d1 + ] , [ K h2 ]  
 [ N x h6 ]  [ g x h6 ]  [ f4 ]  [ N d7 ] , [ B d2 ]  19. [ B d2 ] - white completes his development. If you look at the h column now you will notice that it will be very difficult for black to mount that counterplay down the h column because he has his own pawn there and he cannot take his own pawn. Black is already lost.
 [ B x c6 ]  [ d x c6 ]  [ N x e5 ] , [ B e6 ]  To me this is a waste of time. I understand that she wanted to develop but she cannot do this Queenside without bringing her Queen out too early. However I do not care because I am going to continue by castling Kingside.
 [ K b1 ]  [ R b8 ] , [ N c2 ]  Black resigns. His position has been shattered.
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ c4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ h6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ e3 ] , [ a6 ]  5...[ c6 ] is the main line.
 [ B g6 ] , [ g5 ]  2 knights barreling on the pawn hoping to open the king up even more hope my black bishop didnt die in vain so far hes been countering to keep up his 3 point diff
 [ B x f3 ] , [ O-O ]  ah! i took the oppurtunity to make my rook more useful
 [ N d3 ] , [ R e8 ]  32. ..... [ R e8 ] - pile on renewed.
 [ Q g8 ] , [ R e2 ]  [ R e3 ] was better: when creating an Alekine's gun the queen needs to be in the last place ideally.
 [ N c6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ e3 ] , [ N f6 ]  4. ...... [ N f6 ] - both sides concentrate on their development.
 [ N b1 ] , [ N b5 ]  Preempting white's move. The temporary absence of the white knight on its manoeuvres means that the pawn is threatened and white's reply is forced.
 [ N x c6 ]  [ B x c6 ] , [ Q e1 ]  A standard move in this line; protecting the e-pawn and uncovering the [ d1 ] Rook onto the d-file/Black's Queen.
 [ N e4 ] , [ B d3 ]  5. ... Ne4?! was a mistake that will cost black even more time and space.
 [ Q c7 ]  [ N c e5 ] , [ Q b7 ]  with the aim of getting to [ a6 ] to attack the vulnerable white a-pawn
 [ g x f3 ]  [ g x f3 ]  [ N x g3 + ]  [ f x g3 ]  [ R x e1 + ] , [ K x e1 ]  34. [ K x e1 ] - Jeff trades rooks and now I find myself in an endgame with 2 pawns against that awful bishop.
 [ b x a5 ] , [ B x c2 ]  Queen still can't recapture due to the same problem.
 [ N x b7 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ B x g5 ]  [ N x g5 ]  [ Q e7 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ R f5 ]  [ R c1 ]  [ R a f8 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ N d6 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N f7 ]  [ R c2 ]  [ Q f6 ]  [ b4 ] , [ c6 ]  now that the light-squared bishop is gone it is OK to put the pawns in the dreaded V-shape
 [ B b4 ]  [ O-O ] , [ N d5 ]  Helping the [ b4 ] bishop in attacking the [ c3 ] knight.
 [ d6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ d3 ]  Defending the king's pawn against a possible attack with the pawn at [ d6 ]  [ g6 ] , [ B g5 ]  Let's keep an eye on the knight
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ f6 ]  A very questionable move but not easy to see at once. White is in no position to have action on f7... still!
 [ R d7 ] , [ N d e3 ]  Keeping on the pressure by attacking again.
 [ B x c8 ] , [ R x c8 ]  now rook is on the c file that was opened on the 4th move.
 [ R g2 ]  [ R g d8 ]  [ Q e6 ]  [ Q e7 ]  [ Q x a6 ] , [ N h4 ]  wants f3...
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ] , [ N c3 ]  I opt for the closed Sicilian as I believed my opponent will outplay me in the more popular lines of the open Sicilian. I wanted to avoid too much theory.
 [ R g1 ]  [ d3 ]  [ g6 + ] , [ K g8 ]  Rook-supported pawns are powerful battering rams.
 [ Q x h5 ] , [ g6 ]  At this point I usually resign in most games. However I am determined not to do that in this case because this is a team game. Remember: a team game affects the entire team.
 [ N b4 + ]  [ K b7 ]  [ R c5 ] , [ R g d1 ]  White has done a great job of defending and I was beginning to fear that I may have let the win slip away. Since there is no more attacking lines I decide to try my best to get the best position that I can before any major exchanges occur.
 [ Q c6 ] , [ N x a8 ]  17. [ N x a8 ] - I try to close the gap material wise.
 [ N x e7 ]  [ R x f1 ] , [ R f d8 ]  My opponent takes a long time to come up with this move. The original speed of our first seven moves was long gone. But I knew I wouldn't give up even in this position and began brainstorming how I'd fight back. And just as I was thinking "move a rook to [ d8 ] " the move came. Move-mirroring indeed.
 [ B x e5 ]  [ N c8 ] , [ N d7 ]  Black has to respond to the imminent lose of his bishop or his rook.
 [ R a1 ]  [ g7 ]  [ R x a2 + ]  [ K f3 ]  [ R x f6 ] , [ R x a2 ]  This is the blunder that Black was waiting for. [ g8 = Q ] is a much better move. With the promotion granting White the queen a rook trade at [ g2 ] should be welcome. White also would have established his queen behind Black's pawn structure and in good position to maneuver around the remaining Black rook.
 [ Q e3 + ]  [ N e4 ] , [ Q x e4 # ]  Checkmate! Please leave at least three stars for this review. Thanks!
 [ B h7 + ]  [ K x h7 ]  [ Q x d4 ] , [ K g8 ]  it's more simple now but i'm behind with pawn
 [ R b1 ]  [ d6 ] , [ B e2 ]  puttin' Bob on the D1-H5 diagonal
 [ b x c3 ]  [ c6 ]  [ h3 ]  [ B h5 ] , [ B g5 ]  It starts to be a little uneasy but everyting's in control.
 [ K x f7 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N e g5 + ]  [ K g8 ]  [ d3 ]  [ h6 ]  [ N h3 ] , [ B x h3 ]  I played this move after a long thought but in the end I evaluated that my center strike would have come first.
 [ K e3 ]  [ K f5 ]  [ K x f3 ]  [ K g6 ]  [ K g4 ] , [ K x g7 ]  41. [ K x [ g7 ] ] - I give myself the satisfaction of removing the [ g7 ] pawn before waving the white flag! There is no way I will be able to stop the f pawn from crowning. A dismal end.
 [ Q x d8 + ] , [ K x d8 ]  Now white have a big advantage but he has everything to prove. Without the queens the game turns into slow maneuvers like some variations of the berlin defense in the ruy. In this position white have some tempo and black must quickly defend his position. The threats will come fast. I don't think that this opening is any good for black finally.
 [ g3 ]  [ h6 ]  [ b4 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ b5 ]  [ Q c5 ] , [ R a1 ]  Can the b pawn be stopped?
 [ N g2 ]  [ K h5 ] , [ K f3 ]  At this point I was starting to consider ways to get a draw. The White King has to stay at [ f3 ] to keep the Black king from invading at [ g4 ] and if the knight leaves [ g2 ] the White kingside pawns fall. If Black moved his bishop somewhere on the h2-[ b8 ] diagonal I was going to play [ N e3 ] and take the [ f5 ] pawn while Black gobbled up my g&h pawn. It looked like I could win the [ c6 ] pawn with my knight. After that I could play a2-[ a3 ] b3-[ b4 ] and trade off my knight and queenside pawns for Black's queenside pawns. The h-pawn dark-square bishop and king vs lone White king was a book draw.
 [ Q x c6 + ]  [ K f7 ]  [ Q x d5 + ]  [ e6 ]  [ Q x a8 ]  [ Q x a1 ]  [ Q x a7 + ]  [ K g6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B d6 ]  [ Q d4 ]  [ B e5 ]  [ Q e4 + ]  [ K f7 ]  [ Q b7 + ]  [ K g6 ]  [ h5 + ]  [ K x g5 ] , [ Q x g7 + ]  I missed this. This was the straw that broke the camel's back.
 [ B a3 ]  [ K e6 ] , [ K x a2 ]  this game is mine!!! or is it..... i have to win!!!...but this gentleman astounded me....look my endgame aint strong my games jst go to 30 average....this one went to 86 mooves
 [ B f8 ]  [ K f2 ] , [ b5 ]  While I'd pushed the king-side and moved my king into the game this move left me wondering why I hadn't played [ c4 ] earlier. I felt now that I've made this quite a bit more difficult for myself.
 [ Q x b5 ] , [ c x b5 ]  At least I deflected the pawns and my two angels are more free to fly.
 [ K e6 ] , [ R x d2 ]  I decide to just win material. After a short think I couldn't find an immediately forcing checkmate. Having a queen for his rook in an endgame should be easy enough to win.
 [ R x e4 ]  [ B x e4 ]  [ N g5 ]  [ B d5 ]  [ R d1 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ b3 ]  [ B a6 ] , [ N e4 ]  i did this to get my bishop to back up my pawn
 [ e4 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ c6 ] , [ f4 ]  White aggressive here Black playing much more quietly.
 [ e5 ] , [ N x d4 ]  Might as well
 [ N e4 g3 ] , [ N e5 ]  Threatening [ N f3 + ] and if he exchanges BxN my Q would be again on the dangerous diagonal. Of course I am saccing my lsb but you know... there is no win with no pain :-D
 [ K f7 ]  [ R g5 ]  [ R b4 ] , [ R x h5 ]  66. [ R x h5 ] - another p(r)awn for the table!
 [ K x d8 ]  [ B x g5 + ] , [ f6 ]  A good response forcing away my bishop and causing me to regroup.
 [ N d6 ]  [ B a4 + ]  [ N b5 ]  [ N e c3 ]  [ K d6 ] , [ c x b5 ]  White is now ahead.
 [ K b1 ]  [ N c5 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ K f8 ]  [ N e6 + ]  [ N x e6 ] , [ d x e6 ]  The final minors vanish.
 [ e4 ] , [ c5 ]  Team Match I am playing black and since my opponent wants an open game I play the Sicilian. My opponent builds up an overwhelming attack against my castled king but I find the way to weather the storm.
 [ Q e4 + ]  [ K g7 ] , [ N f5 + ]  ?! And white stalls even further.
 [ Q x g2 ] , [ R f1 ]  see here..he have nothing to do..
 [ B g7 ] , [ B h3 ]  i had more than one idea in my mind. 1) the knight could easily take care of [ e4 ] and in case of a5-[ b4 ] could just go on [ d5 ] forcing the exchange with the bishop. 2) continuing the attack on f column 3) continuously threatening d-line 4) doubling the rooks potentially on both column 5) putting the rooks before the queen thanks to some tactic moves.
 [ R e8 ]  [ B e4 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ B d5 ]  [ K h8 ]  [ Q b2 + ]  [ B g7 ] , [ Q d2 ]  [ Q x b7 ] doesn't really win a pawn. After ...[ Q x b7 ] [ B x b7 ] [ R x e6 ] ends any threat from the advanced e-pawn.
 [ R c6 c2 ]  [ Q f6 ]  [ B d7 ] , [ R x h4 ]  32. ..... [ R x h4 ] - pawn grab hope I do not regret it only time will tell.
 [ h6 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N d4 + ]  [ K e3 ] , [ b6 ]  30. ...... [ b6 ] - undermining the support of Ardin's knight on d6.
 [ B g7 ] , [ N c3 ]  now we are ready for fight best position for white should be whith the knight in [ e2 ] or whith the bishop in [ c4 ] befor moving the g knight (in my opinion)
 [ N a4 ] , [ Q d4 + ]  With this nice tactical shot Black wins a piece.
 [ e x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ] , [ B b5 + ]  After openings my opponent has a small advantage (by position).
 [ g x f3 ] , [ h3 ]  threatening to play ...[ Q g3 ] since blocking the check would allow the pawn to take. ...[ e x f3 ] after this
 [ R d g1 ]  [ N g4 ] , [ Q e2 ]  Worse than Bg3? We'll see.
 [ R d8 ] , [ b4 ]  My knight on [ d4 ] is pinned but the only piece making any threats is black's queen. If he gets serious about attacking the knight on [ b5 ] with something else like a bishop I will have to worry about the pin. Meanwhile advancing pawns while attacking seems like a good plan - especially when the advance includes a fork! I feel 20. ... Rd8? deserves a single ?. (I sure wish there were some way to put those ? right into the move list).
 [ Q f2 ] , [ N e2 + ]  At this point white resigns. As kn(5)[ g3 ] leads to significant damage to whites cause.
 [ g4 ] , [ h x g4 ]  ?! This is dubious. White should let Black do all the pawn exchanging on these files a step farther than the reach of Black's Knights. The correct move was 28. Bd5! reopening the threat of 29. a6!! After working up a winning position White is now doing his best to throw it away through passive waiting moves and ill-advised pawn exchanges. ----- Let that also be a lesson to you chess beginners: always look for the most forcing moves that will give you an advantage however small or large it may be and then play them. Dithering has its place at times; but generally one should never dither in chess unless circumstances *demand* it.
 [ N b d7 ] , [ N x d7 ]  White rather falls in with White's plan here. Maybe White could play 14. [ B b4 ] hitting the rook on [ f8 ] and after it moves play [ N c4 ] and maybe playing a bishop or knight into [ d6 ] at some point. Or maybe just playing [ N d3 ] maintaining the tension. White has a slight spacial advantage in the centre thanks to the pawn on [ d4 ] and so should be avoiding exchanges.
 [ h4 ] , [ e5 ]  Absolutely necessary but a little strange-looking. Closing off the Dragon diagonal isn't a concern any more but the backwards d-pawn certainly is. The first point is that Black will play ...[ N x [ b3 ] ] in the future (what else to do with the [ a5 ] knight?) and allowing the White knight to recapture on [ b3 ] isn't so great. The second is simply that the knight is simply not well placed on [ e2 ] and the third - ... [ e5 ] comes with tempo. Since it's hard for White to pressure the d-pawn with his heavy pieces aimed at the kingside Black reasons that this weakness is less important than the 'here-and-now' considerations of generating active counterplay. Alternative variation: [Absolutely no fun is] 14... [ b4 ] 15. [ N d5 ] [ N x [ b3 ] ] 16. [ N x [ b3 ] ] [ N x d5 ] 17. [ e x d5 ] [ f6 ] [when White can play out his kingside attack and then switch to dominating the center with a strong bind.] 18. [ f4 ] [ B g4 ] 19. [ R d3 ] ( 19. [ [ h5 ] ] gx[ [ h5 ] ] 20. [ R d3 ] [ R f7 ] [is fine for Black]) 19... [ B f5 ] 20. [ N d4 ] [ Q d7 ] ([Not] 20... [ B x d3 ] 21. Ne6) ([Also losing is] 20... [ B d7 ] 21. [ [ h5 ] ] [ g5 ] 22. fx[ g5 ] fx[ g5 ] 23. Qx[ g5 ] ) 21. [ R e3 ] [ R b c8 ] 22. [ R h e1 ]  [ N d e2 ]  [ b4 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ N x b3 + ]  [ a x b3 ]  [ N x d5 ] , [ R x d5 ]  ...[ e5 ] forces this entire sequence of moves. From here Black needs a new plan. The text initiates a sort of blockade along the dark squares which has been seen in a previous game.
 [ Q x d7 ] , [ b5 ]  Now Black has initiative
 [ B d6 + ]  [ K d7 ]  [ B x e4 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ N f d4 ]  [ B x d6 ]  [ N x d6 ]  [ K x d6 ] , [ N b5 + ]  was not a bad check but I could do better
 [ B x c6 ]  [ Q x c6 ]  [ B x a5 + ] , [ K d7 ]  24. ..... [ K d7 ] - I win a pawn but have I made Henry's position even more vulnerable? Only time will tell.
 [ K f2 ] , [ K d5 ]  The king wants to join the battle...
 [ e x d6 ] , [ Q d4 ]  bishop...you were pissing me off
 [ K e3 ] , [ R f3 + ]  31.[ K e3 ] [ R f3 ] ! 9K relentlessly drives my king back to a less active square.
 [ N c8 e7 ]  [ R g h1 ] , [ N g6 ]  21. ...... [ N g6 ] - to give Fou Lenoir some breathing space!
 [ R f d8 ] , [ R x h6 # ]  I'm sure she was shoked. It happens sometimes.
 [ B e2 ]  [ R d a3 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ K f1 ] , [ R a3 a2 ]  Fruitless move Joanne is defending very well and despite my material advance I have a lot of trouble to gain terrain.
 [ B e3 ] , [ h5 ]  Moving clear.
 [ N d3 ]  [ N x d3 ] , [ R x d3 ]  white really seems better still and with a little bit of patience would have won. But white disregards h5-4-3...
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ f5 ]  I've been playing the Latvian Gambit exclusively in these games. Gerhard has been getting much better at thwarting it. I'm not going to give the opening itself a lot of detail; I have a whole series of annotations on it if you want that.
 [ a3 ] , [ B a6 ]  But instead Caruana goes the Bishop to [ a6 ] attacking [ c4 ] pawn. In a limited Chessbase Light 2007 I found no win by Black side via this opening.
 [ e5 ]  [ B b5 + ]  [ K d8 ]  [ d3 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ N g5 ]  ...not wanting to exchange the knights just yet...
 [ K c5 ]  [ Q e7 + ]  [ K d5 ]  [ Q d7 + ]  [ K e4 ]  [ Q c6 + ]  [ K d3 ]  [ Q a6 + ]  [ K e3 ] , [ Q a3 + ]  and now with a sigh of relief I pointed out that it was 50 moves since a pawn move and so it was a draw. I expected to see disappointment on her face and she just smiled extended her hand and said "I 'ope you like Thai cooking..." [ K f2 ] would win for black if there wasn't a 50 move rule. for instance 149. [ Q a2 ] [ K g1 ] 150 [ Q a1 ] [ Q f1 ] and she is eventually going to escape the checks. Thanks for reading this don't forget to give me some stars and leave a comment!
 [ Q e7 ] , [ Q x f5 ]  10.-[ Q x e7 ] [ B x e7 ] 11.-[ B d3 ] [ d5 ] its good for black.
 [ a3 ]  [ N d3 ]  [ N e1 ]  [ N x e1 ]  [ R x e1 ]  [ R a c8 ]  [ R b1 ] , [ Q e5 ]  White is now ready to free his game by P-[ Q N4 ] so Black must invade the White position at once. If however 20... Q-[ B4 ] to enter at [ Q B7 ] White replies 21 P-K4. The text move is a finesse to gain time to bring the Queen to Q4. If White now replies 21 P-[ Q N4 ] Black plays 21... B-[ Q3 ] 22 P-[ N3 ] Q-[ K5 ] and the entry square [ Q B7 ] is again under control.
 [ B f3 ] , [ N b d7 ]  Notice how I haven't played [ B e7 ] O-O yet? If I did then White would storm my kingside starting with g4. My king is much more safe in the centre behind my small fortress where I can try to attack White's weak pawn with moves like Nc5.
 [ N b d7 ] , [ B e3 ]  Classical vs. hypermodern. I paused in my thinking for a moment to just appreciate the dichotomy.
 [ R a d1 ] , [ N f6 ]  Hangs the pawn at e5. Leads to 20.[ B x c5 ] [ Q c7 ] 21.[ B d6 ] [ Q b6 ] 22.[ N c5 ] [ e4 ] 23.[ N d4 ] [ e5 ] 24.[ N d e6 ] [ R f e8 ] 25.[ B x b8 ] [ R x b8 ] 26.[ N x g7 ] [ K x g7 ] which wins a bishop and a knight for a rook a bishop and a pawn. Better is [ B c8 ] leading to 20.[ R d3 ] [ Q f7 ] 21.[ R f d1 ] [ Q f4 ] 22.[ R x d7 ] [ Q x e3 ] 23.[ f x e3 ] [ B x d7 ] 24.[ R x d7 ] [ R x b3 ] 25.[ B x c5 ] [ R b1 + ] 26.[ K f2 ] which wins a queen a rook and a pawn for a queen a bishop a knight and a pawn.
 [ R x d3 + ] , [ R d4 ]  The coup of grace. Now the endgame is an easy win for black.
 [ K c5 ] , [ K g4 ]  ...and I now attack his knight's pawn...
 [ Q b7 ]  [ R d8 ]  [ N d c4 ] , [ Q f6 ]  after [ Q e6 ] [ N x c6 ] [ R c8 ] [ N x a7 ] [ R d8 ] [ N c6 ] [ R c8 ] 0-0 Black would not be enjoying a picnic; this however is worse: this will be a very hard to stomach meal...
 [ R f c1 ]  [ R f c8 ] , [ c4 ]  Here black cant take the pawn because the pawn on [ d5 ] is pinned to the hanging queen
 [ c7 ] , [ Q c3 ]  Capturing the pawn just in time.
 [ c x d6 ]  [ O-O-O ] , [ h6 ]  This closes his lsb the way to [ h6 ] which uses to be a good attacking move against my K.
 [ R b8 ]  [ b3 ]  [ K g8 ]  [ R c6 ]  [ R b6 ]  [ R x b6 ]  [ B x b6 ]  [ K g2 ]  [ B c7 ]  [ h4 ]  [ K f7 ]  [ K h3 ]  [ a5 ]  [ K g4 ] , [ K f6 ]  Both of us received an additional hour.
 [ h5 ] , [ R g2 ]  Now I can get a bishop and a rook for a rook.
 [ Q x b4 ] , [ c x b4 ]  Now the knight is not threatened by the pawn. White now has doubled pawns on the b-file (not that that turns out to be much of a factor in games like this) but at least the [ c3 ] square is free for his knight (by the way notice how coordinated Hemingway's pieces are? And notice how Morrison's pieces are effectively doing nothing [even the bishop on [ c4 ] and the knight on h8] Despite not having a queen Black still has a very strong attack going on!)
 [ R x e3 ] , [ B x e3 ]  mediocre defense but absolutely no offense now. At this point would have resigned but I wanted to see if I can make it to 30 moves.
 [ R e2 ] , [ a4 ]  I go for a promotion attempt...
 [ N b d2 ] , [ R f e8 ]  Centralizing my other Rook.
 [ d4 ] , [ e x d4 ]  Electing to exchange and leave White with a stronger Pawn center.
 [ K h4 ] , [ Q h2 # ]  
 [ Q x f2 + ] , [ K h1 ]  I was running out of time. I think I had a little over a minute whereas white had around five. Nothing to do but to move back.
 [ N x c5 ]  [ d x c5 ]  [ B x c5 ]  [ O-O ] , [ Q d6 ]  Ideas of [ c6 ] followed by [ B b6 ] and Bc7.
 [ R e5 + ]  [ K c6 ]  [ R c4 + ]  [ K b6 ]  [ N x e6 ]  [ R x e6 ] , [ B d4 # ]  The game is now over
 [ K g4 ] , [ Q x f4 + ]  completly destroyed this opponent
 [ N d7 ] , [ Q x b7 ]  Now white has the upper hand
 [ B c5 ] , [ R b8 ]  And now you can't castle..... :)
 [ Q x c2 ]  [ B x c3 ]  [ Q b1 ]  [ B x e1 ]  [ Q x e1 ]  [ Q f6 ]  [ b4 ] , [ R c2 ]  black gains space with the advanced R and with the ease with which black can compile a battery with [ R f c1 ] or play [ B a6 ] gives white's R the supporting cast it needs to be devastating to white's back ranks.
 [ B e2 + ]  [ K g6 ]  [ h5 + ] , [ K f7 ]  And the Black king is reduced to tears of frustration as it can now be of no real use
 [ B g5 ]  [ h6 ]  [ B h4 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ N b d2 ]  [ g5 ]  [ B g3 ] , [ N h5 ]  ?! The computer begs for this move a few tempo ago but now it's too late.
 [ R d1 ] , [ K g7 ]  So that White can't activate his rook with a back-row check.
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ c3 ]  3. [ c3 ] - The ponziani opening (the opening I usually play.)
 [ B g5 ]  [ N b d7 ]  [ a3 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ N b d2 ]  [ h6 ]  [ B x f6 ] , [ B x f6 ]  probably not the ideal capture but this temporarily makes it impossible for the white knight to occupy e5.
 [ B c6 ]  [ d5 ] , [ B b7 ]  Notice he has moved his bishop five times now losing tempo.
 [ Q h5 ] , [ d x e4 ]  This turns out to be a mistake. We both missed 17...Qh4+! for a couple of turns which would win my e pawn and a strong advantage for Black.
 [ O-O ] , [ O-O ]  Both sides castle.
 [ g5 ]  [ f x g5 ] , [ N f d7 ]  To prevent white playing 11.p[ x h6 ] because of the obvious 11.[ B x h4 ] . But instead Keres does a brilliant sacrifice....
 [ K h8 ]  [ R x g7 ]  [ K x g7 ] , [ g4 ]  (!) A casual glance at the GK notes on this game will reveal that this was inferior to 62.h6+. Even if that were true I'd still play this advance adhering to the principle of keeping the pawns together. Only in special circumstances should the one abandon his comrade for the glory of promotion. But ... just check out the next couple of GK notes ... :) Yes 62.[ g4 ] is the best move.
 [ e x d5 ] , [ N f6 ]  More popular than 4...[ Q x d5 ] 5.[ N c3 ]  [ d x c6 ]  [ N x c6 ] , [ d4 ]  Attacking the pawn.
 [ K e2 ] , [ f3 + ]  If 42. [ K x e3 ] black replies 42. ... [ R x e1 ] 43. [ K f2 ] [ R b1 ] and soon black will promote his f-pawn at which time white will capture [ B x f1 ] and be recaptured leaving black with a Rook+Bishop material lead with two pawns on each side. Still white has nothing better.
 [ a6 ]  [ B a4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B e7 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ b5 ]  [ B b3 ] , [ d6 ]  Once black plays [ d6 ] it is a classical variation. I know some players who are as high rated as this guy who don't like to play black in this position because they feel like a target to white. But this position has been played by the best players in the world so it's nothing wrong with this position for black.
 [ d4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ Q e7 ] , [ B f4 ]  In that case you could go with [ Q d5 ] I think is more active
 [ B d3 ]  [ N f5 ] , [ B g5 ]  Threatening the queen another option is to simply castle.
 [ K d2 ] , [ N x h1 ]  I wonder: maybe was it faster not to take the rook but I was pointing [ N f2 ]  [ K d3 ]  [ N f2 + ] , [ K c2 ]  If [ K x d4 ] then mate in one Re4x
 [ Q g2 + ]  [ K c1 ]  [ R x d3 ]  [ R e1 ] , [ B a3 ]  at this point Freddy announced a mate in 5. Masters are so modest aren't they?
 [ N f1 ] , [ N c5 ]  menacing the LSB
 [ e x f6 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ c3 ]  [ e5 ]  [ h3 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ f x e5 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ B x e5 ]  [ d4 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ N f4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ B b4 ] , [ R f3 ]  Black has opened the position found good posts for their Bishops and now is ready to deploy their rooks and try to stress White's doubled pawns.
 [ d4 ]  [ f5 ]  [ g3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B g2 ] , [ g6 ]  going for the lennigrad
 [ K g7 ]  [ g5 ] , [ B b7 ]  The pawn on [ f2 ] looks like a potential weak point - I line up the bishop and prepare for either [ Q f1 ] or Rf2. Which of these would be better or is there another possibility altogether?
 [ d6 ] , [ B b5 ]  white tries to pin the opposite knight
 [ N x d4 ]  [ e x d4 ] , [ N f3 ]  White sees Black's impending attack and begins to play inaccurately. Probably 18.[ B f3 ] encouraging trades and activating White's bad Bishop would be more effective here but bringing the Knight to bear is certainly reasonable. White re-defends the vulnerable [ h2 ] pawn and blocks the LSB's diagonal.
 [ R g4 ]  [ c3 ]  [ c5 ] , [ R f1 ]  White looks for play elsewhere
 [ O-O ] , [ e5 ]  Carry on with my plan of extreme space-grabbing!..Have to be a bit careful though my kingside is getting very exposed. I feel reasonably confident in getting castled in time because his Queen is not quite ready to come off the leash yet.
 [ R b1 ]  [ R d3 ]  [ R b2 ]  [ g3 ]  [ R x h2 ]  [ g4 ]  [ h5 ]  [ g x h5 ]  [ R x h5 ]  [ K c7 ]  [ R h3 ]  [ K x b7 ]  [ g4 ]  [ K x a7 ] , [ R x f3 ]  42. ...... Rxf3! - here I threw in the sponge. I made the resignation decision based on the following - although material is even I felt that he would win the race. For a starters I could not exchange rooks as his f pawn would crown long before my a and b pawns could and they would get cleaned up fast! So what if I don't exchange rooks. My rook is skewered against my b pawn. The only way I can save both is to play 43. [ R d6 ] [ K e5 ] 44. [ R b6 ] [ [ [ g3 ] ] ] 45. [ R b5 ] [ K d4 ] 46. [ R b4 ] [ K c3 ] (the checks run out!) 47. [ K b7 ] [ [ [ g2 ] ] ] 48. [ [ [ a5 ] ] ] g1/Q. So that line loses can we try another? There is but.... 43. 43.[ R d1 ] [ R x b3 ] 44.[ [ [ a5 ] ] ] [ [ [ g3 ] ] ] 45.[ [ a6 ] ] [ [ [ g2 ] ] ] ... Now White can't play 46.[ K b7 ] not while Black's rook occupies the b-file and Black would like to see this state of affairs continue preventing the pawn's promotion. {Typical case of dead wood at the top stymying young talent... ;-)}. Meanwhile ...[ [ f3 ] ] is threatened. Can White cover the king's attempt to clear the b-line? 46.Rd6ch [ K f4 ] 47.[ R b6 ] [ g1 = Q ] leaves the White rook pinned with a quick mate to follow. There is a stalemate try that doesn't quite work: 43.[ R d1 ] [ R x b3 ] 44.[ [ [ a5 ] ] ] [ [ [ g3 ] ] ] 45.[ [ a6 ] ] [ [ [ g2 ] ] ] 46.[ K a8 ] [ [ f3 ] ] 47.[ a7 ] [ f2 ] 48.Rb1. Now 48...[ R x b1 ] is stalemate and Black can't promote either (e.g. 48...[ g1 = Q ] 49.[ R x g1 ] [ g1 = Q ] stalemate). What to do? Simply: 48...[ R a3 ] 49.[ K b8 ] [ g1 = Q ] wins. There was a possibility in this ending that I would have to give up the rook for your a-pawn (the b-pawn having disappeared in the meantime) and my pawn pair having reached the 6th rank could not be prevented from promoting. So resignation justified. Never mind good game!
 [ N g6 ] , [ N c4 ]  No way am I going to trade and let him recapture with the f-pawn and get his rook into the attack.
 [ O-O ]  [ B e7 ] , [ b3 ]  Best results according to GK database.
 [ R e4 ] , [ R a3 ]  White knows he won't be able to save his g-pawn so he attacks my a-pawn.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ d4 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ Q e2 ]  [ f5 ]  [ d x e5 ] , [ O-O ]  All book so far.
 [ c4 ] , [ e5 ]  All of these moves by jatayu are now in conditional moves.
 [ a3 ] , [ B c5 ]  forcing him to make all the moves required to kill it
 [ B x c4 ]  [ R h1 + ]  [ K e2 ] , [ Q e3 # ]  Thanks for reading!
 [ N a8 ] , [ Q h5 + ]  He moves his knight to A8 as I hoped. Not sure if his other options were that charming and I had not even explored what they might be. The game is over now. Will he let me have the checkmate? ...... No. He fights all this way and resigns. To be frank I hate that and it leads me to think that players in his position may actually think they have a chance of winning or stalemating a game like this. It is possible of course but not likely. Can at least let the other guy have the mate but the only thing worse than a sore loser is a sore winner. So an interesting game and an interesting way to annotate it.
 [ Q a5 ]  [ R f c8 ] , [ b4 ]  attempting to assault my queen's side and open things up!
 [ N x g7 ] , [ Q c3 ]  (VK) But now 21 P-[ K4 ] was worth considering.
 [ Q e2 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B g5 ]  [ h6 ]  [ B h4 ]  [ a5 ]  [ a4 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ Q d3 ]  [ N x b3 ]  [ c x b3 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ O-O-O ]  [ d6 ] , [ Q c2 ]  White is planning to develop his lsb to [ c4 ] or can play his knight to d5. Black should control the [ d5 ] square.
 [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ a6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ b5 ] , [ B b3 ]  my p-[ a6 ] proved to be more useful than just blocking the N advancement.
 [ R d8 ]  [ R x d8 ]  [ N x d8 ]  [ N g5 ] , [ h4 ]  Removes the defender of [ e6 ]  [ N x f5 ]  [ B d8 ]  [ e4 ]  [ K h7 ]  [ f4 ]  [ B c7 ]  [ e5 ]  [ K g6 ] , [ N e7 + ]  The black king can either go to [ h7 ] or [ h5 ] ([ g7 ] e6+) just losses a piece. K[ h5 ] [ e6 ] [ N d6 ] [ B e5 ] which leads to similar position to what happened in game.
 [ Q e3 ] , [ R a e8 ]  Black needed to move the queen--[ Q g7 ] or possibly Kg7.
 [ N b8 ] , [ N h3 ]  white is trying again to get near my king.
 [ Q a5 ]  [ a3 ]  [ B a6 ]  [ B x a6 ]  [ Q x a6 ] , [ Q c2 ]  16. [ Q c2 ] - connects my two rooks and Glenda eyes up the weak c pawn which is protected at the moment but I see no harm in starting to put some pressure on.
 [ R d1 + ]  [ K e7 ] , [ B x a8 ]  One more piece of wood for the block. Black's LSB had little to do this game anyway.
 [ Q x d5 ]  [ R e8 + ]  [ Q g8 ] , [ f7 ]  Black resigns.
 [ f5 ]  [ R d1 ]  [ K g7 ] , [ R d6 ]  Setting a small trap into which the Black king obligingly falls. Remember my earlier comment about the Rook on [ a5 ] serving both an offensive and defensive purpose? Watch now.
 [ N x g2 + ]  [ K f3 ]  [ N e1 + ]  [ K f4 ]  [ N c2 ]  [ N d2 ]  [ N x a1 ] , [ c4 ]  i have a plan...
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ f5 ] , [ e x f5 ]  3.[ e x f5 ] ... Ion stated here "- this turns the thing into a King's Gambit with colours reversed. You'd think this would be OK for White wouldn't you?" Yes this seems Ok Ion but I think it is how white subsequently plays that turns things down south.
 [ R x d6 ]  [ c7 ] , [ R c6 ]  a blunder here by either of us will come at the cost of the game
 [ B x c6 ]  [ b x c6 ] , [ d3 ]  ! Since white just exchanged his LSB there's absolutely nothing wrong with this move. In fact it is developing and quite good. And I prefer this over 5.d4. After 5.[ d4 ] there would have been exchange 5...cx[ d4 ] 6.Nxd4. Normally doubled pawns don't affect a game that much or as cdeburca puts it "There's more to chess then doubled chess." But when you talk about a GM's that's not usually the case. Double pawns can directly make or break a game because doubled pawns as in this case are two bad pawns which should drastically affect the position later on. Having said that I think that white made a good and very smart decision to let black keep his doubled pawns as opposed to exchange. In addition with this move white's DSB is already quite active and doing a lot even though it hasn't moved yet. Having said all of that I think that white is better developed.
 [ B e7 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N e5 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ B f3 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ N x c6 ]  [ B x c6 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ B x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ B x d5 ]  [ Q x d5 ]  [ R a d8 ] , [ B b2 ]  The game now looks very even. It is hard to see how to move on here and the [ d7 ] pawn looks likely to remain weak as it cannot get ahead of the [ c4 ] pawn.
 [ K x g6 ] , [ N x b2 ]  ...and I benefited from this pair of moves: I lost my weak isolated pawn and captured a strong one isolating one too...
 [ R f8 ] , [ a3 ]  Now the N and B are both attacked by Pawns and Niemzowitsch will regain the piece... he thinks.
 [ R g1 ]  [ B b6 ]  [ N e1 ]  [ B x g1 + ]  [ K x g1 ]  [ R x e1 + ]  [ K h2 ]  [ R e e2 ]  [ K g3 ]  [ d2 ]  [ a4 ]  [ d1 = Q ]  [ b5 ]  [ R e x g2 + ]  [ K h4 ]  [ R g h2 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ g x f6 ]  [ a5 ]  [ Q d4 ]  [ a6 ]  [ Q x f4 + ]  [ K h5 ]  [ Q f3 + ]  [ K h4 ] , [ Q x h3 # ]  Here we moved to Checkmate. I feel sorry of course but she will continue to play chess and win more games. I guess you have to lose many games of chess before you attain Grandmaster status.
 [ Q x f5 ]  [ e6 ] , [ Q f6 ]  Keeping the action tempi for just a little longer.
 [ Q d3 + ] , [ B d2 ]  Gave me the game! Should have Qd2.
 [ Q e5 + ] , [ K a7 ]  I didn't want an ending where my King is stuck on the back rank but I don't think it makes much difference.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N g5 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ N x f7 ]  [ B x f2 + ]  [ K x f2 ]  [ N x e4 + ]  [ K g1 ]  [ Q h4 ]  [ g3 ] , [ N x g3 ]  Now I see it. I thought about going [ Q h4 ] before but I didn't think of the knight attack here.
 [ a4 ]  [ B c2 ] , [ B f5 ]  I will repeat my earlier comment black is ahead in TIME and with his three on one fastbreak he is "pressing" whites position to the maximum! Notice the combination of a positional theme blending in with tactical role play.
 [ d x e5 ]  [ f x e5 ]  [ N f d7 ] , [ N e4 ]  According to G/K analyse this is a mistake -1.50 (12. [ N e4 ] [ Q x a2 ] 13. [ R b3 ] [ h6 ] 14. [ B h4 ] [ Q a4 ] 15. [ N d6 + ] [ B x d6 ] 16. [ e x d6 ] [ N c6 ] 17. [ N f3 ] O-O 18. [ B e2 ] [ Q a1 + ] 19. [ Q d1 ] [ Q x d1 + ] 20. [ B x d1 ] b5). It suggests 12.[ B c4 ] as the best =0.00
 [ N f3 ] , [ a6 ]  !? I never liked this move if it is not provoked because it creates unnecessary weakness and is a bit of a tempo waster. Which for Locvim who likes to play defensively is a big deal because in defending it is imperative that you have time to make the move you want.
 [ N c3 ] , [ b6 ]  This move takes the game completely off the rails of standard play by the records of the database.
 [ O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ B g5 ]  [ a6 ] , [ N b x d4 ]  White gets back the pawn.
 [ R e1 ]  [ B b7 ] , [ a4 ]  I figured he was lining up for queenside castling so I said I'd give him something to think about as early as possible. I find that in the French in particular it can be hard to get a plan going until Black has committed his king to one side or the other (a centre-break isn't really on). Had I a better plan here?
 [ g6 ] , [ R x h5 ]  If I retreat my rook then black's knight escapes to [ b4 ] and I don't win any material.
 [ B x c5 ]  [ d x c5 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ R x e6 ] , [ Q x c5 + ]  first check for black
 [ R a d1 ] , [ e6 ]  In line with what I said before....
 [ K g2 ] , [ Q f5 ]  Intending [ Q h5 ] [ Q h3 + ] and [ N x g3 ]  [ R c4 ]  [ Q h5 ]  [ N h4 ] , [ g5 ]  kicking knight from stopping my plan
 [ N x c6 ]  [ b x c6 ]  [ b x c3 ] , [ N x e4 ]  This is what I'm talking about. And had I played 7.[ d3 ] this wouldn't have happened. Yet losing a pawn doesn't bother me here as this is where I start the unsound aggression. Be it note that there's only about 10 minutes before I have to leave at this point.
 [ K e6 ] , [ Q x e7 # ]  Black chose a quicker checkmate. He could have played 26. ... [ K x g5 ] 27. [ Q x e7 + ] (sacrificing a second bishop) [ K x g6 ] 28. [ R d g1 # ] or black could try leave the second bishop alive with 27. ... [ K g4 ] but then that very bishop gets him with 28. Bh5#.
 [ e x d4 ] , [ c3 ]  3. [ c3 ] ...... the Goring Gambit .....
 [ B c2 ] , [ b5 ]  8. ... [ b5 ] Now I think I see. He is changing his attack to the back of the pawn chain. he si going to try to aim at c3. But his pieces do not work so good to do this.
 [ g4 ]  [ b2 ] , [ K d3 ]  I am starting to realize I will not be able to avoid the dreaded B-K or B-B end game.
 [ N x f6 ] , [ g x f6 ]  if he took with the rook i wouldve taken his [ g7 ] pawn
 [ e4 ] , [ d5 ]  The first two moves are obvious because they are commonly played.
 [ N g e7 ] , [ b4 ]  It has nothing to do with my main plan but it's not bad to force the opponents pieces to drawback. furthermore the dark saquared bishop will no longer control [ c2 ]  [ B a7 ] , [ R d3 ]  Back to the plan : attacking [ d7 ]  [ B x e3 ] , [ R x e3 ]  One pawn late but still a good position
 [ B g2 ]  [ e x d4 + ]  [ K f3 ] , [ B c3 ]  I didn't play [ R h e8 ] as I didn't want to let the [ h7 ] pawn
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ] , [ B c4 ]  The only time I've seen this before was when my opponent attempted SM. However people who've surpassed novice status would not do that. Despite Knights before Bishops it's a solid move. But given that it's 1.[ e4 ] [ e5 ] themed tourney (with it's starting position I must think about what to do.)
 [ Q x h5 ]  [ Q g7 ] , [ B f3 ]  Threatening the rook and heading to d5.
 [ e4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e5 ]  [ c5 ] , [ c3 ]  Typical Structure of French Defence in Advance variation: White has a strong p chain in the center & black consistently will attack the base [ d4 ] of the p-chain. White will try to reinforce the base.
 [ Q g5 ] , [ h4 ]  This didn't help as much.
 [ N c d5 ] , [ N c e6 + ]  I do not remember what I was thinking here.
 [ R f7 ] , [ Q h6 ]  So I tried this one instead. R [ h8 ] is impossible.
 [ O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ R d2 ] , [ B e6 ]  I think 19. [ N d7 ] would have been strong for white. I wouldn't want him to take my knight on [ f6 ] and break up my pawn formation when he has a 4 to 3 advantage and open up my king to all of his pieces on the kingside. Which means I would have played 19. ... [ N x d7 ] which would allow him to get a rook on the 7th rank and create problems for my queenside pawns. White didn't do it and now I prevent it with 19. ... Be6.
 [ g4 ]  [ N f d2 ] , [ h4 ]  Earlier I had thought my attack would break through first but now I wasn't at all sure! Still nothing I can do about it yet. Hack on with my attack is best. I didn't like 18. NxP though - 18...NxP 19. BxN BxB 20. PxB and the c-file that I'm trying to open now has my own doubled pawns on it. I'm not sure how else I can continue my attack though and amn't that happy with my next move.
 [ f4 ] , [ a6 ]  Knowing that the Queen isn't pinned yet I thought I had an answer. My chess thought process was that if he took on [ e5 ] I'd take back on [ b5 ] as it would be even. It was wrong calculation since the inference was that he'd captured with his f4. What I overlooked is where the Queen is since it's on the same file as his Rook. So when he captures with my Rook my [ Q e7 ] will be pinned. Therefore not only does he get a Queen for Rook but on top of it a piece for free. With that being said I'd normally resign right after 11.fx[ e5 ] since as reversion puts there's technically nothing more to learn. But because it's a WTW game I'm following the Supplemental Talking the Talk Rules which prohibits resignation until there is a forced mating sequence.
 [ B f7 ]  [ e4 ]  [ K g7 ]  [ e x d5 ] , [ Q c7 ]  Now Karpov prepares the end of the game.
 [ Q f5 ] , [ N f8 + ]  No matter where Queen got moved Knight would be the hero for the moment with the support of the Rook.
 [ f x e4 ] , [ b5 ]  In the Caro-Kann if white allows black to get developed and allows black a smidgeon of initiative hitting back on the queenside with [ b5 ] is a good way to get counter play. Fritz wanted me to do this a couple of moves ago but I wasn't ready. My opponent probably expected this. A [ c5 ] pawn break in some positions is even better for black.
 [ B x g4 ]  [ h x g4 ] , [ Q x g4 + ]  Now white's busted.
 [ B e3 + ]  [ K h2 ] , [ N x e4 ]  Removing white's last kingside defender before swooping in for the kill.
 [ f5 ] , [ g3 ]  Analyzing the position neither side has any exploitable advantage. White has a 2-1 pawn advantage on the queenside and the bishop pair both of which are advantages but neither of which is enough to win this position. Black has 4-3 pawns on the kingside also not enough to win in this position. So I offered black a draw and he accepted. I feel there is a slim possibility that if this game had played out white might have had an outside chance at promoting one of those two pawns but in all likelihood black would have sacced a piece to prevent it (if it even got that far which it probably wouldn't) and white still wouldn't have enough to win. Very well played by black.
 [ b4 ] , [ N d5 ]  and now a nice temporary sacrifice
 [ Q x e4 ]  [ B x e4 ] , [ N x d4 ]  The trade was bad for black. The white bishop is undefended. Black plays out numerous exchanges none of which turn out favorably. What black overlooks with his next move is [ N c6 + ] ending in NxR or BxR. Black is just sick about this worrying about it all night after his retarded [ B c5 ] move.
 [ e3 ]  [ K h8 ] , [ f4 ]  Here he just pushes the pawns for a reason I'm unaware while i get my attack ready and rolling
 [ g x f5 ]  [ e x f5 ] , [ h4 ]  or [ R g1 ] at once. It is intended to prevent g5.
 [ O-O ] , [ B c5 + ]  White wouldn't have been able to castle if he'd waited a move becauase of the weakness on the g1-[ a7 ] diagonal.
 [ R x f7 + ]  [ K g6 ]  [ N e4 ] , [ Q h3 + ]  23. ........ [ Q h3 + ] - here is a series of checks where the WK is chased around the board.
 [ R b8 + ]  [ K g7 ]  [ K a3 ]  [ Q a1 + ] , [ K b3 ]  
 [ Q x h6 ]  [ R x g2 ]  [ Q h1 + ]  [ K e2 ] , [ Q x g2 ]  Look at my poor queen. [ Q c1 ] was probably the losing move of the game and with a strong opponent one or two slips are enough. I just tired...
 [ N a6 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ N a x c5 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ b6 ]  Now White can bring the Queen into play gaining a tempo.
 [ R e7 ]  [ R a d1 ]  [ N d f6 ]  [ a4 ]  [ N h7 ] , [ R d3 d5 ]  Two against one on the [ e5 ] pawn.
 [ R x a7 ] , [ R x a7 ]  Black exchanges rooks. All four of them. Doubious play but he had little better. Any attempt to bring his rook to [ b8 ] or [ c8 ] is only an illusion of a threat against white's pawns. A little rook maneuvering by white and black will be checkmated if he captures a pawn: 30. ... R[ c8 ] 31. Red7+! [ K e8 ] 32. [ R a c7 ] [ R a8 ] 33. [ R g7 ] Rxa2??? 34. Rc8#.
 [ R a2 + ] , [ K h3 ]  I also considered 38.[ K f1 ] but I didn't want to deal with another half pin against my Bc1.
 [ c3 ]  [ N b6 ]  [ N x f6 + ] , [ Q x f6 ]  Alekhine has two B's vs. two Knights but the exchanges have helped Capablaca free his position.
 [ e3 ] , [ b5 ]  5. ...... [ b5 ] - knits the queenside pawns together. This is undermined by Steve hitting out with 6. a4.
 [ N b6 ]  [ B x f4 ] , [ N b x d5 ]  I felt okay about this position. Move 25 was coming closer and my position was holding thus far. Unfortunately I didn't realize I was about to lose a pawn and some initiative. The knight cannot stay on [ d5 ] as it threatens his dark bishop and looks toward e3.
 [ Q x d5 ] , [ c3 ]  [ N c3 ] is much more popular for white as it helps develop pieces while pushing the black queen.
 [ Q e3 ] , [ B x c3 ]  IF 18. [ B x [ c3 ] ] [ N c5 ] 19. [ B d4 ] [ Q c8 ] 20. [ R f3 ] [ N e4 ] 21. [ c3 ] (21. [ B x b6 ] Qxc2) 21... [ R b8 ] and Black has a small plus as he prepares b5. 22. [ B x b6 ] [ Q a6 ] 23. [ B c5 ] (23. [ B d4 ] Rxb2) 23... [ N x c5 ] 24. [ Q x c5 ] [ R x b2 ] -/+
 [ c x d4 ] , [ B x d4 ]  Giving up the c1-[ a3 ] diagonal White gave up [ c1 ] thus giving me a free rook.
 [ K h8 ] , [ R h6 # ]  #
 [ a3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c6 ]  [ B d3 ] , [ Q c7 ]  7. ......... [ Q c7 ] - the most popular move in the gameknot db but maybe I ought to have developed a piece or at least played [ e6 ] to free up Fou Lenoir and prepare for castling.
 [ h4 ] , [ K h8 ]  50. ..... [ K g8 ] - MADE IT! WHEEEW AND DOUBLE WHEEEW! After Henry is safely ensconced on [ [ h8 ] ] he bends over and puts his hands on his knees just like we girls were taught to do in our PE lessons after going for a 400m jog round the athletics track at school! There is no way Davide can crown that h pawn even if I lost my knight because his bishop does not command [ [ h8 ] ] the best he can achieve is the wrong kind of mate. Ho hum - even though my rating has dropped a further 3.5 points at least I can take heart from the fact that being 3.5 - 0.5 down looks a little better than 3-0 down and is quite an improvement on my 3 other games with him! Anyhow tomorrow is another day ........ so goodnight for now folks!
 [ K g7 ] , [ R d7 ]  33. [ R d7 ] - pins the [ f7 ] pawn and this will lead to a rook trade and black's resignation which comes after I recaptured on [ f3 ] on Move 35. Nice to be on the right side of a tactical melee.
 [ B x c6 ] , [ d x c6 ]  Exchange of the knight-bishop. White must not take the e pawn because it is trapped.
 [ e x f5 ] , [ Q f6 ]  ?! Rather then continuing with my development which I should've done I go right after William's pawn. Being in that pompous move that I was my attitude was that white just made a mistake and allowed me to get a pawn without anything in return. But that wasn't the case since my Q is about to be harrassed. I didn't realize the significance of something like 11.[ R e1 ] until recently. But this centralizes his R and will bring William even closer to controlling the center whereas I barely have anything developed.
 [ B g7 ] , [ N h2 ]  10. [ N h2 ] - passive but I thought that the knight might be kicked out of [ f3 ] soon so I thought this was the least of 2 evils. But this knight too stays out of the game until very late.
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ g6 ]  Kasparov switches from his usual Najorf. Which was dealt harsly by Anand in game 9. This is the first game which Kasparov played Sicilian Dragon in a serious game and Anand was taken by a real suprise to see the Dragon from Kasparov.
 [ K g3 ] , [ R a1 ]  now there's a bishop minor piece loss
 [ Q x f3 ] , [ Q c1 + ]  Black counterattacks and gets back one of his two missing pawns.
 [ Q x f3 ] , [ B d6 ]  First Tom has a threat that must be dealt with. The goal is to win my [ h2 ] pawn and maybe even expose my King.
 [ B e3 ] , [ N g4 ]  Knight on [ e5 ] must go
 [ N e5 ] , [ Q h4 + ]  Check! Starting an attack on Whites exposed king.
 [ a4 ] , [ Q f3 ]  41. [ Q f3 ] - Glenda pins it down.
 [ R f1 ] , [ K e8 ]  Black's K was vulnerable to a check from the B while sitting on a dark square.
 [ N c6 ] , [ B e3 ]  14 moves to mate...
 [ Q h6 ] , [ B x f5 ]  Forced because [ Q g7 # ] was threatened.
 [ K g7 ]  [ Q g4 + ]  [ K f8 ]  [ h5 ]  [ f5 ] , [ Q d4 ]  Around this point analysis has the score more or less equal and I was starting to hope I may be able to get near to promotion as long as I was careful I had half an eye on [ Q f6 ]  [ K e7 ]  [ Q g7 + ]  [ K d6 ]  [ h6 ]  [ R c7 ]  [ Q d4 + ]  [ K c6 ] , [ Q e5 ]  Pinning the rook on [ c7 ] with a view to advancing my pawn or taking blacks [ e6 ] pawn
 [ N x e7 ]  [ d x e7 + ] , [ K x e7 ]  28. ..... [ K x e7 ] - finally on MOVE 28 my development is complete.
 [ Q g3 ] , [ R f3 ]  Still going after my Q. Once I retreat Nathan gets his K into action. I'm not sure why since mate's not immediately threatened and we're not yet in the endgame since there are still too many pieces.
 [ c5 ] , [ b6 ]  [ N x e8 ] would have saved the knight.
 [ B h6 + ]  [ K x f6 ] , [ Q c3 + ]  My opponent resigned.
 [ N b6 ]  [ B b3 ] , [ N g6 ]  Perhaps in retrospect exchanging at [ f6 ] or [ e7 ] was the preferred move since Black has now uncoiled its position to have those knights as sentinel on both the king and queenside flanks. The downside for Black is that those knights will find it hard to co-ordinate so far away from each other. I had previously mentioned the essence of the R-L was to develop officers quickly then hit an over-extended line. 13 [ d4 ] then is perhaps the favoured line as gets the exchanges going. But this is an atypical R-L demonstrated by the fact White hasn't castled AND has the option of castling both sides. As such there are options aplenty: [ a4 ] threatening to push the Black knight into retreat B/[ N h4 ] tempting an exchange O-O O-O-O [ B e3 ] [ h3 ] all beckon as White's lucky 13th move. Much analysis required!
 [ R c d1 ]  [ N a7 ] , [ Q c4 ]  and now white will try to penetrate with this advanced pawn...
 [ h6 ] , [ N e5 ]  19.Ne5! The [ c6 ] square is ohhh so dangerous for black. I will use that pressure to trap black's bishop - then do my dirty work.
 [ h x g6 + ] , [ f x g6 ]  [ Q g4 ] looks very nice but QxQ...
 [ N b d2 ] , [ B b7 ]  ION: I suggest... 12.Bc2. Reason is that we will want to move the d2-knight again very soon in order to free the dark-square bishop. The knight will have to go to [ f1 ] and thence to [ e3 ] or (more likely) g3. But before moving the knight we ought to ensure the protection of the e-pawn hence playing the bishop move first. Joe: I don't know how this frees a square for the N. As that moves the LSB as opposed to the DSB. I know that B[ f1 ] would. Therefore believe it or not my vote is the same as ION but for a different reason. If it were for freeing the N I'd vote 12.Nf1. But what I like about 12.[ B c2 ] is that the both of the Bishops are nicely aligned. As I analyzed a training game between adevela and Steppenwolf. And what I learned just by being a spectator is that you want your B's aligned and vertical to each other. So 12.[ B c2 ] is my vote. Ron: I would also suggest 12. Bc2. That's if I can join in on this game. I know it would be the 3rd time moving this piece but I like the [ B c2 ] position.
 [ N b3 ]  [ B x e4 ]  [ Q a6 ]  [ Q f6 ] , [ f3 ]  ??? Mate in 4 Can you find it?
 [ K x g8 ] , [ R f5 ]  ready for checkmate
 [ Q g6 ] , [ Q d6 ]  Hoping to un-double the e pawns or simply add pressure to the black camp.
 [ Q x g6 ] , [ N d7 ]  I need to regroup on the king's wing to attack white's castle...
 [ a3 ]  [ B x f3 ] , [ a x b4 ]  A skirmish breaks out with both sides drawing blood.
 [ R g7 + ] , [ K c8 ]  [ b7 ] is vital it should be kept at al costs.
 [ Q x h3 ]  [ Q f1 ]  [ B d4 + ]  [ R f2 ]  [ Q x g3 + ]  [ K h1 ]  [ B x f2 ]  [ Q g2 ]  [ h4 ]  [ R f1 ] , [ R d e8 ]  I am winning so much there is no wrong move. So take the Bishop. I'm not gonna go out of my way to save it.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ d3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ d4 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ c6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ d x c3 ]  No matter what White did at this point the knight was lost.
 [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ c3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ d3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N b d2 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N f1 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ Q a4 ]  [ B h5 ]  [ N g3 ]  [ N b6 ]  [ Q d1 ]  [ B g6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B e7 ]  [ a4 ]  [ O-O ]  [ a5 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ Q a4 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ] , [ Q x d4 ]  Unfamiliar to some but Anand navigates the position well. White has a queenside majority of pawns and his central queen dominates the board. However Black threatens with 18...[ B f6 ] or 18...[ R d8 ] even 18...[ N b4 ] is strong.
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B c5 ] , [ N x e5 ]  4. [ N x [ e5 ] ] - first a black pawn on [ e5 ] drops.
 [ N d4 ] , [ B e7 ]  I could have taken the Knight but instead I saw a more hefty prize.
 [ d x e5 ] , [ Q e2 ]  Of course White does not want to recapture immediately because it loses a pawn. However I think 22. [ N c4 ] planning to recapture on [ e5 ] with the knight is stronger here. The knight is well placed and it can open up possible discoveries on the Queen with Nxg6. The text is still not bad
 [ e5 ]  [ K e2 ]  [ f5 ]  [ K f3 ]  [ K e7 ] , [ B c8 ]  It hits me just how strongly I dislike endgames. I'm 2 pawns up yet promoting will require sufficient technique.
 [ B g6 ]  [ R h8 ]  [ d x c5 ]  [ Q c8 ]  [ B d6 + ]  [ K d8 ]  [ c x b6 ]  [ Q b7 ]  [ b x a7 ] , [ Q x a7 ]  Black is behind a couple pawns but of more concern is the king position.
 [ K g6 ]  [ g4 ]  [ h x g4 + ] , [ K f4 ]  a strange decision: but after [ N x g4 ] things become unclear; there is still the matter of an escaping c-pawn...
 [ B b4 ] , [ N x b4 ]  Material is gained no matter what. If he takes my knight then i could come to [ c1 ] and check his king and fork the knight winning a piece at least.
 [ d x e5 ]  [ f x e5 ]  [ B x e5 ]  [ N x e5 ] , [ N x e5 ]  Won the exchange on e5.
 [ d6 ] , [ N c3 ]  I thought we were friends ...
 [ R d b1 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ R h d1 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ a4 ] , [ B b4 ]  Alternative variation: 24...O-O 25.[ N b5 ] [ N a6 ]  [ N b5 ]  [ N x b5 ]  [ c x b5 ] , [ O-O ]  Alternative variation: 26...[ B d5 ] 27.[ R d c1 ] [ K d7 ]  [ B b6 ] , [ R f c8 ]  Alternative variation: 27...[ f6 ] 28.ex[ f6 ] [ R x f6 + ]  [ R d7 ]  [ B d5 ]  [ B c7 ]  [ R a7 ]  [ b6 ]  [ B c5 + ]  [ K e2 ]  [ B x b6 ]  [ R x d5 ] , [ R c x c7 ]  Alternative variation: 32...R[ a x c7 ]  [ R b5 ] , [ B d4 ]  Alternative variation: 33...[ R c2 + ] 34.[ K d3 ] [ R c6 ]  [ K d3 ] , [ B c5 ]  Alternative variation: 34...[ R d7 ] 35.[ K e4 ] [ f6 ]  [ b4 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ a5 ] , [ R c b7 ]  Alternative variation: 36...[ R c6 ]  [ R x b7 ]  [ R x b7 ]  [ b5 ]  [ B d8 ]  [ a6 ]  [ R b8 ]  [ K c4 ]  [ B b6 ]  [ R d1 ]  [ K f8 ]  [ R d6 ]  [ B a7 ]  [ K b4 ]  [ B f2 ]  [ K a4 ]  [ K e7 ]  [ R c6 ]  [ K d7 ]  [ R d6 + ]  [ K c7 ]  [ R c6 + ]  [ K d8 ] , [ R d6 + ]  
 [ e6 ] , [ e4 ]  This is the obvious continuation givnig me great central control
 [ Q x b3 ] , [ R x d1 + ]  Black gets rid of one pair of rooks. However the open file is mine again at least temporarily.
 [ N f6 ]  [ e3 ] , [ N c6 ]  3. ...... [ N c6 ] - normal development - btw there is an un-annotated version of the game in GOM where I did request gameknot analysis so you can follow the game there.
 [ N x d4 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ g3 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ a5 ]  [ Q f5 ]  [ c3 ]  [ N f3 + ]  [ K g2 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ N d2 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N x f3 ]  [ Q x f3 + ]  [ K g1 ] , [ B x h3 ]  
 [ e4 ]  [ c6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ d5 ] , [ N d2 ]  This is the modern way of handling the Caro-kann. White retains flexibility in how to proceed. For example He can immediately transpose into the Botvinnik-panov attack with C4 or maine line classical with [ N x e4 ] if black plays dxe4.
 [ N x d4 ] , [ N e5 ]  But he has to move his knight anyway
 [ b5 ] , [ a4 ]  50. [ a4 ] - not Rxb5?? because of [ B a6 ] pinning it to Henry. I now use a pin on the b file to force a pawn trade.
 [ K x c4 ] , [ K x a6 ]  ...and give it some space.
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ e5 ]  All book so far but I have attained a central advantage.
 [ e4 ]  [ d6 ] , [ d4 ]  If your opponent allows free unmolested movement of a 2nd centred pawn why in the name of all that is Holy don't you 'abuse' such gifts?
 [ R h5 ]  [ Q e7 + ]  [ K g8 ]  [ Q f6 ]  [ K h7 ]  [ Q f7 + ]  [ K h8 ] , [ Q x g6 ]  All according to plan...
 [ B x e2 ] , [ Q x e2 ]  Now we have exchanged 2 minor pieces we both have centrally positioned knights and there really isn't that much between us all said everything is pretty much even steven so look at this position and ask yourself which colour you'de rather play?
 [ f6 ]  [ e x f6 ] , [ R g2 x g7 + ]  With [ R x g7 ] [ N x f6 + ] [ K h8 ] [ R x g7 ] [ K x g7 ] [ N x d7 ] [ B x d7 ] [ B d4 ] being game over. Sorry about a lack of analysis in this game it was more based on opening themes than concrete variations as the attacking moves are quite easy to find and the position sort of plays itself
 [ B x f4 ]  [ B x c6 + ]  [ K e7 ]  [ B x a8 ] , [ R x a8 ]  I originally thought 16...[ B x h2 ] was better but the problem is that after 17.[ K h1 ] [ R x a8 ] 18.[ g3 ] Bxg3? 19. fg Qxg3? 20.[ N f5 ] win the queen. Now we have a rook and a pawn versus two bishops. If white can activate his rooks he will be not worse but black's pieces are all very active.
 [ g6 ] , [ B f2 ]  But now I was equally worried about the possibility of being trapped at [ a7 ] ....
 [ O-O-O ] , [ d x e6 ]  white decide to free space for a [ N d5 ] move and to free the white bishop
 [ R g7 x g2 + ] , [ K h1 ]  only place to go for the king but infront of blacks light colored bishop even though it is separated by a pawn often this kind of situation is not good
 [ N c5 ]  [ Q x g5 ] , [ f4 ]  I had no need to worry about this fork because I had the option of simply attacking the white knight with my queen:
 [ N x e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ B c4 ] , [ B f5 ]  Probably a mistake in hindsight but looked good at the time!
 [ Q c2 ] , [ N g4 ]  Adds a third attacker to h2. I'm starting to feel a little pressure.
 [ R a b1 ] , [ B c3 ]  ...and my bishop sets himself as a pawn's blocker.
 [ e6 ] , [ N c3 ]  Development is key for me - get the knights out.
 [ K g6 ]  [ K c4 ]  [ K f6 ]  [ K d5 ]  [ B g3 ] , [ K c6 ]  53. [ K c6 ] - the black king is cut off from the b pawn. I can draw this game with one fell stroke by taking on [ g5 ] with the dsb but I scent victory!!!
 [ Q f4 + ]  [ K b1 ]  [ R g8 ] , [ c x b4 ]  Threatening 21.[ B b5 ] mate. Black has only one move.
 [ f3 ] , [ R x d4 ]  If Gruenfeld now plays 31 PxR Alekhine has 31... BxP ch 32 K-[ B1 ] N-B5! 33 QxP Q-[ B5 ] ch 34 K-[ K1 ] NxP ch 35 K-[ Q2 ] B-[ K6 ] ch and Gruenfeld may as well resign before the King-hunt ends in checkmate.
 [ Q b3 ]  [ B b6 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ Q c7 ] , [ N c4 ]  18. [ N c4 ] - my knight moves off [ e5 ] to rid myself of that turbulent dark square prelate on b6.
 [ R d2 x d8 ]  [ R x d8 ]  [ R x d8 + ] , [ Q x d8 ]  Again I don't see the isolated pawns as a weakness. Even in an endgame I was confident that I could hold it. I just need to ensure that if I do enter a K&P endgame I don't allow black to create an outside passed pawn.
 [ B e7 ]  [ B b2 ]  [ R a4 ]  [ K f3 ]  [ K f5 ]  [ b5 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ B c1 ]  [ R a7 ] , [ a4 ]  ?! Almost certainly inaccurate but White no longer requires perfection. He just needs his b-pawn to stop on a light square rather than a dark square ([ b7 ] instead of b6) so that the BK will be forced to abandon the kingside in order to take it. With the WK off the fourth rank this is an entirely safe move.
 [ g6 ] , [ a3 ]  Despite [ g6 ] the dsb can still check on [ [ b4 ] ] and I don't like this grimp. So if I want to play [ c4 ] I have to cover [ [ b4 ] ] first. If he goes [ B g7 ] well I'll lost a tempo but also will he.
 [ R x d7 ]  [ R x d7 ]  [ K x d7 ] , [ N x d2 ]  
 [ N f2 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ N f4 ] , [ B c6 + ]  also releasing my rook up the d file.
 [ K f3 ]  [ R a7 ]  [ K e2 ] , [ b4 ]  70. .... [ b4 ] - the two black pawnies now get involved in a race to Glendadom.
 [ K x e5 ]  [ g4 ]  [ K f4 ]  [ g3 ] , [ K f3 ]  King controls position
 [ e5 ]  [ a5 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e3 ]  [ f5 ]  [ a6 ] , [ N x a6 ]  4. ..... [ N x a6 ] - there are several ways to capture this pawn either with the [ b7 ] pawn or with the knight. My opponent chooses the knight.
 [ Q d2 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ B x d4 ]  [ b3 ]  [ Q e8 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ R x f6 ]  [ R a e1 ]  [ Q c6 ]  [ N e2 ]  [ R a f8 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ R g6 ] , [ e x d6 ]  terrible move instead 17. [ f3 ] and I favour white
 [ B g5 ]  [ R a d8 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ Q x f6 ]  [ N e4 ] , [ Q e5 ]  Better would be 17...[ R x e4 ] 18. [ B x e4 ] [ R x d1 ] 19.R[ a x d1 ] winning a knight and queen for two rooks.
 [ K f4 ]  [ R f2 + ]  [ K e5 ]  [ R g2 ]  [ K e6 ]  [ R g7 ] , [ R f5 + ]  now I'll sacrifice the h pawn to try and force a draw... if [ K x h6 ] [ R f6 + ] [ R f6 ] Kf7... and white's king is trapped on the h column depending on his reply I can even win this game if he plays with as much objectiveness as before
 [ Q d8 ] , [ O-O ]  18. 0-0 - time to make use of that extra rook.
 [ K c7 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N x f6 ] , [ B x f6 ]  22. [ B x f6 ] Now I do not get to have any Knights. This is bad because there are lots of pawns on the board and Bishops are not so good when there are so many pawns in the way. Now I must do what Black wants me to do. I must make pawns go away. So I have to find a good way.
 [ B e6 ] , [ K f1 ]  He is successful. My once apparent lead in position is now almost lost.
 [ e4 ]  [ B x a8 ] , [ N b d7 ]  Your undefended pawn is in danger now.
 [ N x e4 ] , [ f4 + ]  37.f4+!!! now black king has to leave black knight without protection.
 [ O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ d6 ]  [ N b d2 ] , [ a5 ]  Not a novelty but a rare variation found only in Alaux-Nobili France 1999 the idea is to get [ a7 ] for my knight or bishop (if needed keeping an eye on [ f2 ] and indirectly white's king) while at the same time prevent [ b4 ] also allowing white's bishop to remain on [ b5 ] he might latter try to exchange it for my [ c6 ] knight...
 [ R d8 ]  [ N a5 ] , [ B x g2 + ]  ?? What is his method here? Get rid of all your pieces?
 [ Q x f4 ]  [ e x f4 ]  [ R f1 ]  [ b5 ]  [ a x b5 ]  [ a x b5 ]  [ B b3 ]  [ R a7 ]  [ R x f4 ]  [ c6 ]  [ d x c6 ]  [ B x c6 ]  [ g5 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ g x h6 ] , [ g x h6 ]  Now I have him opened up.
 [ K f6 ]  [ N d7 + ]  [ K e7 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ Q f2 + ]  [ K e4 ] , [ K f6 ]  ...and it was too late at night. Unconsciously I returned the courtesy and gave up my queen.
 [ d x c4 ]  [ e3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ a3 ] , [ N f6 ]  When in doubt dominate the middle. I'm not good with opening theory and I've never felt comfortable playing this opening so I'm just piling out and hoping for the best.
 [ B d3 ] , [ B f2 + ]  ? [ B a5 ] and I would have to take away my queen chased by the rooks... a disaster. But with this blunder black gives me chances.
 [ R g8 ]  [ Q f7 ] , [ Q c8 ]  32...[ B g7 ] loses to 33.[ R e8 ] and Black has to give up the Queen to stave of mate.
 [ N x d8 ] , [ Q x d8 ]  Knight takes my rook and queen retakes the knight. I am not sure I wanted my queen on the back row again but I did not want to take with my king as this would make him more exposed.
 [ N x d6 ] , [ Q d8 ]  13 ... [ Q g8 ] was a little better though white should win with 14 [ N x f5 + ] [ e x f5 ] 15 [ B a3 + ] [ K d7 ] 16 [ c x d5 ] [ c x d5 ] 17 [ Q a4 + ] [ N c6 ] 18 [ c4 ] a piece ahead and an attack coming. Weaker would be 14 Nf7? g6! 15 [ N x h8 ] [ g x h5 ] 16 [ Q x h5 ] [ Q x h8 ] when white is only an exchange an a pawn ahead
 [ B g5 ] , [ B c8 ]  I decided to go for the Knight
 [ h x g6 ]  [ R f1 + ]  [ K e6 ]  [ Q g7 ]  [ R f8 ] , [ R x f8 ]  
 [ N d4 ] , [ a6 ]  We are now in the end game and I have an extra piece a knight otherwise all even. I move my knight out of the king's grasp to [ d4 ] and black brings his pawn out to a6.
 [ d x c6 ]  [ e x f3 ] , [ d4 ]  I'm notating this game after-the-fact for once and I don't remember what all was happening here. Perhaps I'm trying to get a pawn up on d5.
 [ K g3 ]  [ K d3 ]  [ K h4 ]  [ K c2 ] , [ B f6 ]  Black resigns. 1-0
 [ R x d1 ]  [ Q a5 ]  [ a4 ] , [ R b8 ]  23...[ R x b5 ] followed by [ Q c3 ] would have been much better.
 [ B c7 ] , [ B d2 + ]  What?
 [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ N f4 ]  [ N x f4 ]  [ B x f4 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ Q f3 ]  [ B x f4 ]  [ Q x f4 ]  [ h6 ]  [ R a e1 ] , [ B e6 ]  This exchange no longer favors black. After 16. [ B x e6 ] [ f x e6 ] 17. [ Q e4 ] black is now required to use a queen and a rook to defend the 2 pawns. I think 15. ... [ c5 ] is better as it defends the d-pawn and open the queen to mobility on the d8-[ a5 ] diagonal.
 [ N d4 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ c6 ]  [ R c1 ]  [ R e8 ] , [ a3 ]  Developping on the queen wing
 [ R x c4 ] , [ R b1 ]  Just as important is that my N was attacked. And this was the only way to defend it without losing material since I looked at 27.Bd2?? and even 27.Rb5??
 [ Q d5 + ] , [ R f3 ]  28. [ R f3 ] - don't like walking into a pin but I must keep that Witch out!
 [ R b6 ]  [ f4 ]  [ R b7 ] , [ f5 ]  Get out of my life knight!
 [ R x h6 ]  [ B x h6 ]  [ g x h3 ] , [ R e1 ]  I was convinced that black would play [ Q x g2 ] here leading to an equal game.
 [ R c1 ] , [ B b5 ]  As planned.
 [ K x g7 ]  [ Q d4 + ]  [ K g8 ]  [ R f e1 ]  [ N f5 ]  [ Q c3 ]  [ Q x d6 ]  [ R x e2 ]  [ Q f6 ] , [ Q c2 ]  I decided not to exchange but I'm still not sure it was the right decision
 [ R x f3 ]  [ R c6 ]  [ R f2 ]  [ Q b1 ]  [ K g2 ] , [ Q b2 ]  It was at this point that I began to realize that I was wasting the strength of my pieces by having them so spread out especially since white had managed to have all his most important pieces closely packed. Still I felt that with white's pawns spread out and mine more aligned to properly protect I could take advantage of the natural defense that white's pawns were providing me and gradually work my queen back down to where I had carefully placed my rook to keep the white queen from a very simple checkmate if I were to leave the sixth row unprotected.
 [ N e5 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ f4 ]  [ R c8 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ e4 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ B x e4 ]  [ B x e4 ]  [ N b8 ] , [ Q c1 ]  22. Qc1! - Eschews exchanging queens on d8. White has a clear advantage owing to the beautiful diagonal of his lsb. Glenda moves off [ d8 ] to avoid fronting up to a possible Rd1.
 [ Q h5 + ] , [ K f8 ]  ?? As I mentioned above this is deadly; correct was 23...Ke6. The rest is just an elegant mating net.
 [ R h d8 ]  [ B x d7 + ]  [ R x d7 ]  [ R e8 + ]  [ K c7 ]  [ R a e1 ]  [ K c6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ R e1 e6 + ]  [ K c7 ] , [ R e8 e7 ]  Now Black will have no pieces left.
 [ B c8 ] , [ B b5 ]  Attacks the exposed knight. Whites pieces are swarming.
 [ N x e6 ] , [ Q f6 ]  White tried a different approach an often useful tactic when your opponent launches a an exchange sequence. He captures a black pawn with his doomed knight keeping material even. After 16. Nxe6? each player has a knight en prise so we could both capture or both retreat; either way material would remain even. But not this time. Black anticipated the tactic and had a zwischenzug prepared. Now thanks to the knight on [ g4 ] black threatens checkmate in two and white must respond after which white will lose a piece. Better was simply recapturing with 16. [ B x c4 ] or maybe saving the knight with 16. Nb5.
 [ R x d5 ]  [ R x b2 ] , [ R d3 ]  I erred on the side of caution bearing in mind that Black's next move would have forked K and a-pawn. Not sure whether I could have grabbed the [ h6 ] pawn at this point.
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ] , [ e x d5 ]  To be honest I was a bit disappointed to see the exchange French
 [ Q a4 ]  [ b5 ] , [ Q e4 ]  Faced with a decision of pawn or rook I save the rook. I am not even sure that my next move here is correct. I think White has at least a draw owing to the quickness of his attack. e.g. [ Q x g7 ] [ B g6 ] Rhe1! Qh8.
 [ B x d5 ]  [ Q x d5 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ b3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B b2 ]  [ c6 ]  [ Q d4 ]  [ f6 ] , [ N d3 ]  (9:41:01 PM) babar: i didnt really like your [ N d3 ] (9:41:03 PM) babar: on move 17 (9:41:05 PM) babar: for u (9:41:12 PM) babar: it blocks your d pawn and it's an awkward spot (9:41:26 PM) babar: it's a one move attack on my pawn but i am happy trading that pawn off which is what's gonna happen (9:41:40 PM) babar: so it gives me a free opportunity to untangle my N and B (9:42:21 PM) babar: i thought n[ f3 ] was better and also n[ c4 ] isn't bad bc altho it frees me up some u also get a tempo with the check (9:46:38 PM) CafeConPiedras: i agree [ N d3 ] is awkward (9:46:43 PM) CafeConPiedras: not sure what i hoped to accomplish (9:46:51 PM) babar: well you're attackingn my pawn (9:46:54 PM) CafeConPiedras: sure (9:46:57 PM) babar: but i'm happy to trade that pawn off (9:47:01 PM) babar: since it's weak (9:47:08 PM) CafeConPiedras: for no compensation? (9:47:09 PM) babar: so i think u'd be better served just gettin all ur pieces out (9:47:12 PM) babar: and onto good squares (9:47:18 PM) CafeConPiedras: i mean you get an attack on my knight (9:47:20 PM) babar: well it's a faraway pawn by itself (9:47:28 PM) babar: that i have to spend resources defending (9:47:43 PM) CafeConPiedras: if that were really true you would have just let me have it (9:47:47 PM) CafeConPiedras: but [ a5 ] is obviously strong (9:47:50 PM) babar: well no but (9:47:53 PM) babar: u know what i mena (9:47:57 PM) CafeConPiedras: sure (9:47:57 PM) babar: it's not going anywhere (9:48:03 PM) babar: u have p and fianchettod b (9:48:05 PM) babar: behind it (9:48:13 PM) babar: and it can become a weakness u can focus all ur d00ds on (9:49:07 PM) babar: passed pawns are nice if they can (9:49:09 PM) babar: attack and (9:49:13 PM) babar: u can combine off em to make threats (9:49:14 PM) babar: etc (9:49:23 PM) babar: but that guy didn't seem like that to me
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ] , [ N f3 ]  Start your game as usual. Big shocks like 1. [ h4 ] just make you look like an idiot and also they lose.
 [ d4 ] , [ d5 ]  Main line French. Occasionally someone will play 2.[ N f3 ] but this is the usual line.
 [ N c6 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ B c4 ]  7. [ B e2 ] O-O 8. O-O d5! 9. ed [ N x d5 ] 10. [ N x d5 ] Qxd5! is an interesting pawn sacrifice.
 [ B x f6 ] , [ O-O-O ]  ?! I realized after this move I just completely screwed my previous plan of the "free" knight on d4... yay me.
 [ Q h5 ]  [ K h8 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ B f6 ] , [ B d6 ]  Things are not very nice now.
 [ N c3 ] , [ N a6 ]  I suppose if King wasn't there [ c6 ] would be prefered square as having knight on the edge limits effectivness.
 [ B g6 ] , [ N x g5 ]  I should have played 9. [ f5 ] immediately I don't know why I considered this knight move to be more important. Now Black has one last chance to save the bishop.
 [ B c6 ] , [ N x f6 + ]  ? Better was 14. [ R x e8 ] when 14... [ Q x e8 ] allows 15. [ N x f6 ] when Black has to retake with the g-pawn. Otherwise 14. ...[ B x e8 ] puts Black's bishop on a bad square and the good bishop falls with 15. [ N x f6 ]  [ Q x f6 ]  [ c3 ]  [ R a d8 ] , [ d4 ]  ? Better was 16. [ R x e8 ] (again) when Black can't divert White's attention from the d-file. White also has to watch out for his N on f3. He shouldn't allow Black to give him doubled f-pawns.
 [ Q x d8 + ]  [ R x d8 ] , [ d3 ]  Wanting to trade bishops
 [ K x h6 ]  [ g5 + ]  [ K x g5 ]  [ K h1 ]  [ K g4 ]  [ K h2 ]  [ K f3 ]  [ K h1 ]  [ R g6 ]  [ K h2 ]  [ R g7 ]  [ K h1 ]  [ K f2 ]  [ K h2 ] , [ R h7 # ]  
 [ R d1 + ]  [ K e4 ] , [ R f4 + ]  The crushing attack! Now Andreiksen's king's safety is in jeopardy.
 [ B x c4 ] , [ b x c4 ]  Leave black a nice column to press on but I can easily defend [ b2 ] with Q K and R. Now [ g x f5 ] seems indicated. But I wasn't incisive enough.
 [ R d g1 ]  [ N x a2 + ]  [ K d1 ]  [ N c3 + ] , [ K e1 ]  I created a brief break to do what I want to do.
 [ K f1 ]  [ R e8 ] , [ B e2 ]  ? Closing off the e-file but probably I should not have taken the crucial decision to exchange my strong d-pawn for his a-pawn just before the time control. I create a new passed pawn but the pawn on [ d5 ] was way stronger than the pawn on [ a2 ] will be.
 [ B x b4 ]  [ B x b6 ] , [ R d2 + ]  Starting with this move. But either way I still have a mating sequence.
 [ N x c3 ]  [ b x c3 ]  [ R f e8 + ]  [ K f1 ]  [ B x c3 ]  [ B x c3 ]  [ Q x c3 ]  [ R c1 ]  [ Q x a3 ] , [ R x c7 ]  Alternative variation: 19. [ R a1 ] [is one last hope] [ Q b2 ] 20. [ R b1 ] $19
 [ Q d5 ] , [ R h f8 ]  Black has a dangerous-looking setup but white actually can force a win in this position. The first sequence is relatively obvious but can you find the follow-up move as well?
 [ Q d7 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ Q d8 ]  [ B x e7 ]  [ Q x e7 ]  [ f4 ]  [ b6 ]  [ R a e1 ]  [ Q d6 ] , [ f5 ]  Maybe this advancement is the logical one but would I have better thing to do at this stage on hindsight?
 [ R g3 ] , [ Q h5 ]  look at his rook at a8.....pmpl it doesnt do nothing
 [ B x d5 ]  [ B x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ B x g7 ] , [ N f4 ]  Instead of taking back the bishop with 15...[ K x g7 ] black looks to continue his original plan by bull rushing white's kingside.
 [ N x c5 ]  [ Q x c5 ] , [ d4 ]  Threatening an exchange for once he does white will have better control of the center despite not being castled or completely developed. So I think that black is already starting to become overly confident as we saw at the intro of this annotation.
 [ Q x h3 ] , [ R x g7 ]  Capturing material. He can win the pawn on [ [ [ e3 ] ] ] however doing so isn't easy. Rx[ [ [ e3 ] ] ] gets met with Qd5+. After that black can only go to the 8th rank after which I can play [ R g8 + ] In the best case it's checkmate in the worst case he loses his queen for my rook. If the pawn on [ [ [ e3 ] ] ] falls because of [ Q x [ e3 ] + ] then after trading queens i can capture on [ h3 ] to equalize material. He can put my king in check a few times but it can easily escape and defend my 3 pawns leading to a more or less equal endgame again. Because of the variations I just mentioned capturing the pawn on [ [ [ e3 ] ] ] currently isn't very appealing. That being said Black's position is still favorable.
 [ Q e2 ]  [ N x c4 ]  [ d x c4 ]  [ O-O-O ]  [ B e3 ] , [ K b8 ]  playing things too safe... Bxe4! ([ B x a7 ] Qc6!) might already win; for Black that is... Whites' only advantage is development for now...
 [ B x g3 + ]  [ K f1 ]  [ Q f6 ]  [ R b1 ]  [ N d4 ] , [ N d5 ]  I had to distrurb the queen since moving his night to [ f3 ] could have been devastating.
 [ d4 ]  [ B c4 + ]  [ K h8 ]  [ N e2 ]  [ d x e3 ] , [ Q x e3 ]  Now Black is up positionally and materially.
 [ f x e5 ] , [ B x e5 ]  forced since I'm threatening [ R x f4 ] White's bishop is almost like a pawn now.
 [ a3 ]  [ B d6 ] , [ g3 ]  Forced - there's no other way to defend h2.
 [ g5 ]  [ d4 + ]  [ K d2 ]  [ h x g5 ]  [ f x g5 ] , [ K d5 ]  Then he gets worried about my pawn majority instead of pushing me further back with 48...[ c3 + ]  [ h4 ]  [ K d6 ]  [ h5 ] , [ K e7 ]  Black reasons that since my King can't do anything about the pawns he can get rid of that majority.
 [ B e4 ]  [ B f2 ]  [ R f1 ] , [ B g3 ]  With these bishop moves I get to attack [ [ e5 ] ] while keeping the white king in the corner. P[ [ e5 ] ] is dead.
 [ N x c7 ] , [ R a c8 ]  Only one place for the knight to go...
 [ O-O ]  [ N x b6 ] , [ R e8 + ]  This move turned out to be a crucial one but I don't think I realized it at the time. I think I was just trying to take back the rhythm of the game.
 [ d4 ] , [ R e1 ]  I am trying to get that Q
 [ N c1 ] , [ N d4 ]  looking for [ c2 ] (check) then a1. if white moves king to ([ d1 ] in order to not lose rook) then it is pawn c2... forces [ K e1 ] then [ Q c3 ] wins the game for black
 [ c6 ]  [ d4 ] , [ d6 ]  2. for year may immediate response was [ d5 ] which the B10 but the past year I been playing [ d6 ] which give me a more defense approach and put the game in the B12 variation.
 [ N c e3 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ N d5 ] , [ Q d7 ]  I think 16.. [ B x d5 ] was best though that still leads to the loss of the [ e5 ] pawn and a likely win for White. In this position I thought quite a bit about how to continue the attack. I knew I was much better but couldn't figure out the best way to continue. Then it hit me. White can just win a piece. Never overlook the obvious.
 [ N h3 ] , [ b6 ]  I have no idea about this opening
 [ N e2 ]  [ B x e4 ] , [ O-O ]  My king is now nice and safe I can start to deal with the threat from those pawns and try to prevent black from castling
 [ B x b5 ]  [ N x b5 ] , [ b6 ]  So I come up with another plan. The idea being is that she can't take due to my [ R a8 ] so I'm threatening to win a pawn which if it happens I'd have a dangerous passed pawn which would be overwhelming for white.
 [ d5 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ e6 ] , [ O-O ]  Castling the King into safety before proceeding with queenside development.
 [ f6 ]  [ Q d4 ]  [ B d7 ] , [ Q d2 ]  Didn't like my queen out there.
 [ f x e5 ] , [ d6 ]  Playing against the Frome I learned early not to take the second offered pawn.
 [ K x d5 ]  [ R c3 ]  [ K e4 ]  [ R x b3 ] , [ R d5 ]  or Ra6: nothing can save [ a5 ] any longer...
 [ c5 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ N g5 ]  White's attack is premature. 4. [ d3 ] or 4. [ N c3 ] is simpler although it offers little hope of immediate advantage.
 [ B x f4 ]  [ e x f4 ]  [ N x f4 ] , [ f x e4 ]  ? Another bad mistake. Black overlooks...
 [ B d7 ] , [ c3 ]  A usual White relies on solid pawn structure as a basis to go forward from in the middlegame
 [ g x f3 ]  [ N g6 ]  [ Q a4 ]  [ R e6 ]  [ R e2 e3 ]  [ N f4 ] , [ Q x f4 ]  43... [ Q x f4 ] Forced; Black was threatening nate!
 [ R c4 ]  [ R x b5 ] , [ R x a4 ]  52. ...... [ R x a4 ] - with the queenside pawns now off the board all I have to do is defend my kingside. Salvation may be at hand!
 [ B x h2 + ] , [ K h1 ]  Now he sees the danger! But it is to late.
 [ R h g1 + ]  [ K h7 ]  [ Q x a7 ]  [ N b c6 ]  [ Q d7 ] , [ Q x e5 ]  -1!
 [ K b7 ]  [ K g5 ] , [ N f7 + ]  A HUGE screw up. [ N g8 ] is MUCH better. Little mistakes like that in this type of a position mean everything. Now after [ K g6 ] I will probably resighn- lose my 4th game against him
 [ f x e3 ] , [ N g4 ]  It is better to castle first.
 [ Q d1 ] , [ Q e5 ]  thanks but no thanks could not trade out because he had the advantage
 [ a x b6 ]  [ a x b6 ]  [ R b2 x b6 ] , [ Q f7 ]  I would have played [ R a3 ] pinning the knight to the queen hoping to complicate things slightly.
 [ e3 ] , [ N f6 ]  I see the hole a [ e4 ] and get ready to occupy it if I wish.
 [ R d6 d7 ]  [ Q c6 ] , [ Q x f7 ]  Now the threats are of the mating kind.
 [ K x h7 ]  [ R f3 ]  [ f5 ] , [ R h3 + ]  This never really helps me out in the end. I need that pawn on G6 at some point later. Just shows how losing even a single pawn can unravel a plan.
 [ b5 ]  [ R c8 ]  [ a4 ] , [ a6 ]  I don't know how if this was a good move or not. It just seems right to play so I did.
 [ N f3 ] , [ N h5 + ]  what's can white do here?
 [ c4 ]  [ O-O ]  [ a3 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ b4 ] , [ b5 ]  14...[ R f d8 ] to develop pressure in center or ...[ a5 ] to weaken/attack white's pawn mass are to be considered. ...[ b6 ] is ok too... but this gives away a pawn: 15.cxb cxb 16.[ Q x b5 ] with material advantage.
 [ N f3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ e3 ]  [ c6 ]  [ c3 ]  [ N b d7 ]  [ N b d2 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ Q c2 ] , [ b6 ]  White has several options here but opt for safety first
 [ K c8 ] , [ B x c4 ]  Many things look devastating for white; black will be mated soon.
 [ d x e4 ] , [ N x e6 ]  well ok I will play [ N x e6 ] I would have preferred to wait one more move. Also I would of rather [ N c6 ] and creating an unbalance but thought that I might end up losing my knight so I'll threaten blacks queen and rook
 [ B b5 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ e6 ]  [ f x e6 ]  [ d x e6 ] , [ N f6 ]  I thought black had escaped the attack my thoughts of capturing the rook with my bishop which i had intended is no longer available as my queen is unprotected. However after a while I saw my next move
 [ B e5 ] , [ B d6 ]  Only move.
 [ N x e5 + ]  [ K f8 ] , [ Q h5 ]  He is going for the king. Not many moves to prevent and keep bishop and knight in play for further planning.
 [ e x f5 ]  [ B x f5 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ B d8 ]  [ a4 ]  [ B e4 ]  [ N f4 ]  [ h4 ]  [ B e1 ]  [ g3 ]  [ h3 ]  [ B c7 ] , [ R d4 ]  finally Whites' position is opening up...
 [ b x c4 ]  [ Q x c4 ]  [ R c8 ]  [ Q b3 ]  [ R b8 ]  [ Q f3 ] , [ e6 ]  Black now marches his pieces up the field.
 [ Q c4 ]  [ R x b7 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e5 ]  [ Q a6 ]  [ R b4 ]  [ B f8 ]  [ R a4 ]  [ Q b6 ]  [ R g1 ] , [ R d7 ]  Black mobilizes the Rooks and has the advantage for the first time
 [ N c6 ] , [ O-O ]  14. [ f4 ] [ B x b2 ] 15. [ R b1 ] [ B a3 ] 16. [ R x d7 ] [ R a b8 ] 17. [ R x b8 ] [ R x b8 ] looks good for Black since [ N a5 ] is very effective if White does 0-0.
 [ N e6 ]  [ f3 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ f2 ]  [ N x g5 ]  [ K x g5 ]  [ c4 ]  [ K f6 ]  [ b4 ]  [ f1 = Q + ]  [ B x f1 ]  [ N x f1 ]  [ K e2 ]  [ N g3 + ]  [ K f3 ]  [ N h5 ]  [ c5 ]  [ d x c5 ]  [ b x c5 ]  [ K e5 ]  [ c6 ]  [ b x c6 ]  [ d x c6 ]  [ K d6 ]  [ K g4 ]  [ K x c6 ]  [ K g5 ]  [ K d6 ]  [ K x g6 ]  [ N g3 ]  [ K g5 ]  [ N x e4 + ]  [ K f4 ] , [ N f6 ]  
 [ B e3 ]  [ B b6 ]  [ N b d2 ]  [ N e7 ]  [ B x b6 ] , [ a x b6 ]  8. ..... [ a x b6 ] - bishop trade.
 [ a4 ]  [ O-O ] , [ h3 ]  ?! This looks to me like a complete waste of a move. I can't see that White gains anything from it and it creates a weakness in his kingside.
 [ d x c5 ] , [ Q a5 + ]  Rule: Don't bring your queen put too soon!
 [ B g2 ] , [ B x g4 ]  I take the bait and ...
 [ N x e6 ]  [ Q d6 + ]  [ N f4 ] , [ N d7 ]  This move is to offset the lack of the knight to be willing to participate.
 [ a6 ] , [ B x f6 ]  This way is similar but preserves more attacking power. Is it a mistake to swap a reasonably well placed dsb for a knight here? I was looking to break up the linked knight hence weakening blacks defence. As my dsb wasn't that active in threatening his king directly this seemed a reasonable exchange to me
 [ B x f1 ] , [ R e f8 ]  Threatenes 43.[ R x f1 ] but the only sucess with this move is the start of my rook
 [ Q x d5 ]  [ a4 ]  [ R f h8 ]  [ h4 ]  [ g x h3 ]  [ e ]  [ p ]  [ e4 ]  [ R x e4 ]  [ R x e4 ] , [ Q x e4 ]  then the GG goes up..
 [ e3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ N c3 ]  9. [ N c3 ] - but at least here I manage to develop with an attack on that evil besom!
 [ B b5 + ]  [ B d7 ]  [ B x d7 + ] , [ N b x d7 ]  Black has a comfortable position.
 [ N d2 ] , [ R b8 ]  Another way to hunt the [ b2 ] pawn.
 [ B x f4 ] , [ N g f3 ]  a bit of a pointless move
 [ Q h5 ] , [ B e2 ]  Preparing to move the knight to threaten Queen again.
 [ a6 ]  [ h4 ]  [ b5 ] , [ h5 ]  Already pushing!
 [ g x f5 ]  [ N g5 ] , [ Q f6 ]  15 .............. Qf6?? - Ion stated here "It transpires that up to here Black's game was still playable but this move was a complete miscalculation." The aim of this move was to try and drive away the knight on e5. This move loses a piece because black's foremost f pawn is pinned to the black queen.
 [ R x e6 ]  [ B x e6 ] , [ Q e2 ]  I like this move but the GK computer considers the immediate [ N d4 ] even stronger. In any case Black is now lost.
 [ K f2 ] , [ K g4 ]  This is the point. Now the pawn on [ g2 ] prevents the white king maintaining the opposition.
 [ b x c6 ] , [ B d3 ]  interesting that white's not going for my [ f7 ] square
 [ Q c6 ] , [ Q f4 + ]  now i have him on the run with three attacking pieces
 [ N e2 + ]  [ K h1 ] , [ N x g3 + ]  Now: the principles say I had to retake with the h pawn: it opens an escape way for the K it keeps [ f2 ] as a future supporter of e5... but I was looking for blood.
 [ B x e5 ]  [ R x e5 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ R g5 ]  [ g6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ a6 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ f6 ] , [ R g3 ]  I could've done [ N d6 + ] but I was in no mood to exchange my aggressive knight for my opponent's bishop that had yet to be developed.
 [ Q e1 ] , [ R a c8 ]  Now I decided not to take on [ g2 ] immediately but to increase the pressure on [ c2 ] by developing my last piece. White can't try to swap the c-pawn for the d-pawn because of the back-rank capture.
 [ d4 ] , [ N f6 ]  I was expecting Black to play [ e5 ] but this is perfectly playable as well!
 [ b x a4 ] , [ b x c5 ]  And now I'm up 3 points and it's a question of who can play better without their queen.
 [ B g4 ] , [ b4 ]  What I like about this opening is it keeps the centre free of pawns. This makes it ideal for bishops to beam down the long diagonals. Here I'm preparing to do just that with my black bishop.
 [ Q x d3 + ]  [ K x d3 ]  [ g5 ]  [ K e3 ]  [ h5 ]  [ K f3 ]  [ b5 ]  [ c3 ]  [ K f7 ]  [ K g3 ] , [ K g6 ]  Here I resign as I can't think of how I can stop black from promoting a pawn.
 [ R h2 + ]  [ K f1 ] , [ Q f3 ]  With many mating threats hanging in the air.
 [ e5 ]  [ Q e6 ] , [ Q f3 ]  I think it was here that I started to see my only chance and decided to go for it full throttle. When I am behind like this I like to throw everything I have at one attack and hope it work out Kamikaze style.
 [ Q f6 ] , [ Q d4 ]  That was really probably the best defense I could find [ R c3 ] could have been played but then that was allowing the Queen to comfortably sit on [ f6 ] and if [ Q c3 ] was played [ e x d5 ] opens up a threat on the White Bishop whose sensible move is to recapture then Black plays [ B x g4 ] and down goes another pawn.
 [ N e5 ] , [ g5 ]  The pawn was what I was hoping he would see.
 [ N a4 ] , [ B b4 ]  Hoping white will let me play a quick c6...
 [ a6 ]  [ N b5 a3 ] , [ b5 ]  !? Nail in the knights coffin.
 [ B b3 ]  [ a5 ]  [ d4 ] , [ c4 ]  the Sicilian rulez...
 [ N g f6 ] , [ B g5 ]  The pins begin. Remember my aim here is always to get whatever tries to develop if possible. This will also allow me to wreck black's structure and create pawn weaknesses.
 [ a4 ] , [ N a5 ]  He might now follow with [ [ c5 ] ] before returning the knight to c6. [ [ c5 ] ] would prevent a possible [ b4 ] from me but might weaken the [ [ d5 ] ] square as well as make a backward [ d6 ] pawn. And after I move the bishop he won't play [ c6 ] followed by [ [ d5 ] ] to contest the center because I could trap the knight with b4.
 [ d4 ]  [ e x d3 ]  [ e ]  [ p ]  [ c x d3 ]  [ h5 ] , [ B h3 ]  Rather than 15. [ B h3 ] I think it may have been better to move [ B f3 + ] (something I did in a later game with some success). This could have been followed by 16. [ B d5 ] threatening the Queen.
 [ b4 ] , [ R a c8 ]  And I play this. The idea being that in general you want to play your R behind the Q.
 [ N f7 ] , [ Q g8 + ]  Desperately throwing checks at black... Clearly nothing better to do...
 [ f3 ]  [ h x g4 ] , [ h x g4 ]  White hates to open the h file but the alternative (fxg4) is worse. Then black plays ...[ B h6 ] and ...[ R h e8 ] to pile pressure on e3.
 [ K e7 ]  [ Q g7 + ]  [ K d6 ]  [ R d1 + ]  [ K c6 ] , [ B f3 # ]  nice to end it with a bishop mate
 [ R d1 + ]  [ K e7 ]  [ R e1 + ]  [ K f6 ]  [ R h1 ] , [ K x f5 ]  After clever move 32 this one is a tactical blunder. The last white pawn could wait; it certainly wasn't going anywhere. 35. ... Rg2! forces a rook trade after 36. ... Rb1. Getting rid of white's last piece (even at an even trade) would have been preferable to chasing a mere pawn.
 [ R x f1 + ]  [ K x f1 ]  [ N e3 + ]  [ K f2 ] , [ N x f5 ]  And now there were none. It is really over here since you have no attacking pieces. A stalement is always a possiblity though.
 [ B x c5 ] , [ N a4 ]  knight on the rim is dim...
 [ a3 ] , [ b5 ]  !? Risky but I think probably necessary. Black *must* achieve queenside counterplay and he has no time to lose.
 [ N d5 ]  [ d4 ]  [ d6 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ B g4 ]  This is the main line so far.
 [ N d2 ] , [ R b4 ]  Hmm. This move looses I think.
 [ c x d4 ]  [ Q a4 + ]  [ B d7 ]  [ Q x b4 ] , [ a5 ]  [ d x c3 ] is slightly better.
 [ N e1 ] , [ B x b3 ]  If [ R a3 ] [ B c4 ] and the exchange is ok to me.
 [ Q x d4 ]  [ B g7 ] , [ B g5 ]  The two main choices are 9 [ B g5 ] and 9 Be3. Both choices could lead to same position that is reached in the game.
 [ R c8 ] , [ Q x c8 ]  Nothing but equal. White is slightly better after 16. [ Q x d8 ] R[ f x d8 ] 17. [ B a6 ] [ R a8 ] 18. Bb5.
 [ K f2 ] , [ N e5 ]  This position looks very aggressive for black although white has plenty of counterplay however I couldn't see a knock out blow so this move [ N e5 ] aims to remove the bishop and so doubles the pawns on the c and e-files which should give me an advantage in the endgame
 [ K e2 ]  [ R x g3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ R c3 ] , [ N e7 + ]  39. [ N e7 + ] - another spite check.
 [ R f d8 ] , [ N b6 ]  My knight is dancing around a little bit
 [ B d2 ]  [ Q f6 ]  [ h4 ] , [ B e5 ]  His rook is in peril and so he is once again forced to move.
 [ N f d2 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ B b4 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ B x d5 ]  [ B x d5 ] , [ Q x d5 ]  The first skirmish of the game yields an even exchange.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ d3 ] , [ B c5 ]  White takes aim at [ f6 ] black at f3.
 [ a3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B d2 ] , [ B f6 ]  White forces the knight off and is probably planning b4. Black however wants to grab the a pawn.
 [ R x g2 ] , [ R c2 ]  Releasing the black king but with the aim of driving the rook to an unfavourable position.
 [ K g1 ] , [ R b2 ]  .
 [ c6 ]  [ R d1 ]  [ N b d7 ] , [ e5 ]  Black's passive opening is now going to fall apart.
 [ B x c2 ]  [ R d e1 ]  [ R a c8 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ R c d8 ]  [ B f3 ]  [ f6 ]  [ e x f6 ]  [ R x f6 ]  [ R e c1 ]  [ B d3 ] , [ R f2 ]  Forced. --------- Forcé.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B c4 ] , [ B c5 ]  The "Quiet Game" will soon turn not so quiet.
 [ B e3 ] , [ d5 ]  Making the long awaited pawn break in the center.
 [ B a5 ] , [ g x f4 ]  The best chance. My opponent not 100% sure that taking on [ c7 ] led to a won ending decided to make everything safe by playing....
 [ B b5 ] , [ B b7 ]  If 9. ... [ a6 ] 10. [ B c6 ] just for fun. I have to be very careful not to have this bishop trapped. Of course I am prepared to exchange it with the knight since it is not likely to have a great game against the fiachetto.
 [ Q f7 ] , [ B e5 ]  the good bishop open the file preventing black to castle
 [ Q x d7 ] , [ R x a3 ]  I capture black's queen on [ d7 ] while black's rook captures my pawn at a3.
 [ Q d8 ] , [ O-O ]  Development part 1 done - next rooks and taking over the center
 [ K f3 ] , [ c5 ]  31. ........ Passed pawns must be pushed.
 [ N f6 ]  [ B b3 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ d4 ] , [ c6 ]  7. ...... [ c6 ] - I shore up [ d5 ] but I am a bit concerned about Henry being exposed on the e column.
 [ O-O ]  [ b5 ]  [ B b3 ]  [ d6 ] , [ N c3 ]  another possibility is [ c3 ] aiming for [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ d3 ]  [ h6 ] , [ N h4 ]  this is kind of a risky maneuver white undertakes here. it clearly aims to jump to [ g6 ] but if black plays ... [ N a5 ] the horse will be danger. instead 9 [ B e3 ] is worth a try.
 [ g6 ]  [ e4 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ h6 ] , [ B h4 ]  5. [ B h4 ] - maintaining a potential pin on the [ f3 ] knight should the [ e7 ] pawn move.
 [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ f5 ]  2. ...... [ f5 ] - an unusual line a gambit. I decided to accept the gambit and see what happened.
 [ Q b5 ]  [ Q e2 ] , [ R f8 ]  This simply wastes a tempo for black. Note that the [ c4 ] rook is pinned by the black queen.
 [ d4 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B d2 ]  [ e6 ]  [ e3 ] , [ B e7 ]  If I am lucky he will move his King Bishop out before shielding g2.
 [ R c3 + ]  [ K b2 ] , [ d3 ]  29. ... [ d3 ] prepares Rc2. [ B x b3 ] is interesting too but the Bishops pair is too precious.
 [ Q b6 ] , [ N b d2 ]  The [ b2 ] pawn is poisoned as known... except that now it isn't because of the [ f4 ] bishop. First overlook prize is mine...
 [ K g1 ]  [ e x f4 ]  [ R x c4 ]  [ R x c4 ] , [ B b2 ]  Aha! Forcing the return of the exchange
 [ N c3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d3 ] , [ N f6 ]  I wouldn't put my knight here. I would move pawn to [ e6 ] and then knight to e7. The knight on [ f6 ] becomes a target later on.
 [ c5 ]  [ d4 ] , [ c x d4 ]  The first move actually made in the game -- an obvious and natural one too. This is a regular sicilian thus far with just a different move order.
 [ N x b5 ] , [ c4 ]  Development would be better in this position.
 [ Q e5 + ]  [ K f3 ]  [ e4 ]  [ K g4 ]  [ K e2 ] , [ K g3 ]  things are coming to an end my king is blocking his escape
 [ B x f5 ] , [ h x g4 ]  My good friend Matt just shook his head when he realized that I knew that I had dodged a bullet. With a chuckle to himself he rids himself of a pawn island.
 [ B g7 + ]  [ K g8 ] , [ Q x f7 # ]  
 [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ a6 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N x c6 ]  [ b x c6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ d5 ]  [ c4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ Q a4 + ]  [ Q d7 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ Q x a4 ]  [ N x a4 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ B e3 ] , [ O-O ]  White has the advantage of the better pawn structure Black having three pawn islands against two. It is true that the isolated d5-pawn is a passed pawn which is usually an asset in the endgame but here there are still many pieces on the board and the d4-square is controlled by White. With inaccurate play on the latter's part the d5-pawn could become a real asset for Black but objectively it must at this stage be regarded as more of a liability. The other important aspect of the pawn structure is that White has a queenside majority which potentially can yield an outside passed pawn.
 [ N e7 ]  [ B b4 ] , [ c5 ]  Rather than passively defend the knight with [ R f e8 ] Kramnik sac's a pawn in exchange for a good attack through the centre
 [ c x d3 ]  [ e ]  [ p ]  [ B x d3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O-O ]  [ B c2 ]  [ B c4 ] , [ Q x d6 ]  Trading active piece for an inactive one.
 [ K f1 ] , [ N d2 # ]  26. ..... [ N d2 ] MATE!! Sadly white opts for sudden death. Chris is a piece for a pawn light in the final position and with the endgame approaching this would have no doubt been decisive in Gerhard's favour anyway. As snap mates go this one is a beauty! Well played Gerhard!
 [ B c4 ] , [ B e7 ]  ?? - Let's call this an easter egg. I was adjusting pieces when he called "touch move." I can't recall if I said adjust or not but I allow it.
 [ a5 ] , [ R b4 ]  If [ B x c5 ] The queen takes it back with check so I don't have to fear for my rook. It shields the [ a5 ] pawn from his queen's defence so maybe I can press it with Qc7.
 [ Q c7 ] , [ R f1 ]  To stop Black 0-0.
 [ O-O ]  [ N h6 ]  [ h3 ] , [ N f7 ]  8. ..... [ N f7 ] - not much happening.
 [ B e2 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ B f3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ Q a4 ]  [ B x c3 ]  [ B x c3 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ B x e4 ]  [ d x e4 ] , [ b4 ]  White's pawns a quite persuasive here. I'm not sure I've done a good job developing this line 9... [ N e4 ] seems like a mistake.
 [ N f6 ] , [ c3 ]  ?! Again [ R d1 ] was called for. There is no pressing need for [ [ c3 ] ] since [ c2 ] [ d4 ] and [ b4 ] are adequately covered. Even if the [ f3 ] Knight moved and Black did manage to get a Knight on [ d5 ] White could then play [ [ c3 ] ] with tempo and drive it away.
 [ Q x d3 ]  [ N x e1 ] , [ N x e1 ]  And I win the exchange (this game helped me recognize the superiority of a bishop and a knight against a rook in many positions)
 [ f4 ]  [ K h1 ]  [ N g6 ] , [ b5 ]  bad move because i lose a pawn... i should have waited and tried different moves to prepare b5... but a pawn won't make me resign!!!
 [ B x c1 ]  [ B d4 ]  [ R x c2 ]  [ b4 ]  [ B b2 + ]  [ K b1 ]  [ R d2 + ]  [ N e4 ] , [ B x e4 # ]  
 [ K f8 ]  [ d x c6 ]  [ b x c6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ R d8 ] , [ Q g5 ]  ok i see that i have a good position So i decided to to switch queens
 [ c x b4 ]  [ N d1 ] , [ B b7 ]  Putting pressure on the [ e4 ] pawn and tying my opponent down to defending and.. not attacking which is where i want him to be
 [ Q c2 ] , [ Q c7 ]  I noticed I might have better chances on the kingside somewhere around here.
 [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ d6 ]  [ e4 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ h3 ]  [ a6 ] , [ a4 ]  Preventing [ b5 ] which makes Black's job of getting untangled much more difficult.
 [ c5 ]  [ R d c7 ]  [ d3 ]  [ R c d7 ]  [ c4 ]  [ R d4 ]  [ R c8 ]  [ R d d7 ] , [ R e8 ]  The BR cannot stay on [ c8 ] of course.
 [ e5 ] , [ g4 ]  [ h x g4 ] [ h x g4 ] to pull the King to the wrong side
 [ N c6 ] , [ B x f7 # ]  After 8. [ Q x f3 ] I entered a handful of conditional moves. I expected 8. ... [ e6 ] or even 8. ... [ f6 ] but I threw in the wild ones just in case the unexpected happened. And it did. Black saved his rook and I got an email notification that I had won a game by checkmate. As it would happen I just finished annotating a game where I as black won white's rook in the aforementioned Orangutan game and white resigned on move 9 making it my second fastest win on Gameknot. This game which I won just two days later ties for that second place honor but since this game ends in checkmate it is my fastest checkmate on GameKnot.
 [ N f5 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N d5 ] , [ B x d5 ]  I been told that bishops are stronger than knights. However I feel as though this is a situation where the trade would benefit White more so than Black.
 [ N f4 ] , [ N f6 ]  Bringing the Knight to a nice square while stopping the development of black's knight.
 [ N a6 ] , [ B x a5 ]  Black having cut off the R's defence of the p White snaffles it and attacks the [ N c3 ] but she has diverted her B off her best squares.
 [ a3 ]  [ B x c3 + ]  [ b x c3 ] , [ N x d5 ]  ...Bishop is blocked now so have to look at Q side finachetto...
 [ Q x e5 ]  [ N x e5 ] , [ h5 ]  I do not know what he wants in this position.
 [ K f5 ]  [ K c6 ]  [ R d8 ]  [ d6 ]  [ K e6 ]  [ R e4 + ]  [ K f5 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ K g5 ]  [ K c7 ]  [ R f8 ]  [ d7 ]  [ R x f2 ]  [ d8 = Q + ]  [ R f6 ]  [ R e5 + ]  [ K g6 ]  [ Q g8 + ]  [ K h6 ]  [ Q g5 + ]  [ K h7 ]  [ Q x f6 ]  [ K g8 ]  [ R g5 + ]  [ K h7 ] , [ Q g7 # ]  
 [ R h g8 ] , [ K f3 ]  The bishop is getting annoying and must be removed.
 [ f x g2 ]  [ K x g2 ] , [ R f3 ]  ..from here I am thinking black is won. The queen and rook will be a serious headache and white must give up its powerful bishop for the equally strong knight...
 [ B x d4 ] , [ B g5 ]  [!] This move is good since after [ B x g5 ] there would be checkmate on f7.
 [ N e7 ] , [ O-O ]  OK my knight is unpinned. If my opponent wont castle then I have a killer move Nd5!
 [ Q h6 ] , [ N b4 ]  (?)Black decides to attack now that my queen is out. I think [ B f8 ] would be smarter trading a bishop for a passed pawn on the 7th rank. GK says [ N d4 ] is optimal 13. [ g5 ] [ N f5 ] 14. [ e x f5 ] [ B x f5 ] 15. [ d x c4 ] [ N d7 ] 16. [ R h2 ] [ Q a5 + ] 17. [ B d2 ] [ Q c7 ] would result.
 [ N c3 ] , [ B g7 ]  Now that Tal's fiancetto is complete he can add the next ingredients that composes the alchemy of his inferno.
 [ B d6 ] , [ f5 ]  I was a little surprised that White would want to lock into this pawn chain which completely devalues the B on the long diagonal.
 [ d6 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ Q x d4 ]  [ N x d5 ] , [ B x d5 ]  10. [ B x d5 ] - a lot of dust has been cleared. The Wicked Witch is now in a very active position indeed placed on [ d4 ] she hits at [ g7 ] for starters. Glenda (my queen) by contrast is still on her home square. She is sometimes known as Glenda the Defender because of her usually defensive role but look out that is not always the case!
 [ f5 ]  [ g x f5 ] , [ g4 ]  This was my last weapon...
 [ N f x d4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ B x d4 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ R c1 ]  [ B x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ R a e8 ]  [ R f e1 ] , [ N e4 ]  Here i hoped that the isolated pawn would have given me more attacking chances on e4... Fortunately I was right
 [ R e2 ]  [ Q c1 ]  [ Q c8 ] , [ Q g5 ]  Again white's back-and-forth attitude adds a little bit of depth to his position.
 [ B e3 ]  [ d6 ] , [ Q d2 ]  ready to long castle
 [ h4 ]  [ Q f6 ]  [ g5 ]  [ Q f5 ]  [ B h3 ]  [ Q f7 ] , [ R g1 ]  White probably intended to do pawn to [ g6 ] on the next turn and threaten my queen again.
 [ B c2 ] , [ Q h4 ]  18. ….. [ Q h4 ] - again # is threatened on f2!
 [ R x g3 ] , [ f x g3 ]  Now White has two connected passed pawns which should be enough to win...
 [ N f5 ]  [ Q b6 ]  [ Q x b6 ]  [ B x b6 ] , [ N g3 ]  To prevent castling so that I can contest the b file.
 [ e5 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N b6 ]  [ a3 ]  [ d4 ]  [ N e4 ] , [ f5 ]  I feel like this was one of my first decent moves in the game. I made a good step at controlling the center here while the en passant means he gave up a key central square that was really annoying me. The downside was that it weekened my kingside. In retrospect maybe I should have worked on castling.
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ] , [ c4 ]  As black I really need to figure out what to play against 2. c4.
 [ e x d6 ] , [ N g5 ]  This blocks the c1-[ h6 ] diagonal and protects the last remaining [ f4 ] Stooge as well as putting some evil White designs onto the [ d6 ] pawn. (MINEFIELD #3: Obviously 14.Rx[ d6 ] was not a sane option.)
 [ K f3 ] , [ R g3 + ]  And Black sacrifices his second rook in order to delay mate.
 [ b5 ] , [ N e7 ]  I continue on developing rather than taking the b pawn inorder to gain tempo and to kingside castle.
 [ N d6 ] , [ R b2 ]  ...but now he allows my R to grab the column.
 [ R x h4 ]  [ Q f3 ]  [ R x h2 ]  [ g3 ] , [ c6 ]  What when in doubt push a pawn? P[ f7 ] is undefended.
 [ c4 ] , [ R a d8 ]  You have to know when to stop pushing your luck. I cannot go on with my attack right now.
 [ Q x g5 ] , [ Q x c7 ]  ?? walks into forced mate but i don't think the white king can avoid the noose much longer
 [ R b7 ]  [ R c6 ]  [ R f7 ]  [ N c8 + ]  [ K b8 ]  [ a6 ]  [ R f5 + ] , [ K b6 ]  White cannot advance the Pawn to [ a7 ] forcing the King to [ a8 ] yet because a forced exchange of the Rooks would end in a draw.
 [ N g7 ]  [ Q x h7 + ]  [ K f8 ]  [ Q h8 + ]  [ K f7 ] , [ R f6 # ]  beauty isn't it?
 [ Q x e7 ]  [ Q x c5 ]  [ Q x c5 ] , [ R x c5 ]  Now white has an advantage he just needs to convert it.
 [ B d4 ]  [ a6 ]  [ Q f5 + ]  [ K g8 ]  [ Q x d7 ] , [ R x d7 ]  What do you know he *did* blunder away his Q! Now I'm back about even. The passed Pawn is still a concern though.
 [ N x h8 ]  [ Q g5 ] , [ d4 ]  white is practically won. 8. [ B x g8 ] works too.
 [ g x h3 ]  [ Q x h3 ] , [ R e1 ]  Moving my rook out of danger
 [ Q d5 + ]  [ K h8 ]  [ B d4 ]  [ N b c3 ] , [ Q c6 ]  Intending [ B x c3 ] [ N x c3 ] [ Q x c3 ]  [ Q h5 ] , [ h3 ]  White is in trouble now
 [ a5 ] , [ Q x b4 ]  A mistake as the rest of the game will show.
 [ Q e2 + ]  [ K h3 ] , [ Q h2 # ]  
 [ N x b5 ]  [ N x b5 ]  [ B a6 ]  [ b3 ]  [ B x b5 ]  [ c x b5 ]  [ O-O ] , [ Q x d7 ]  well i am still down quite a bit and resignation is a thought
 [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B b5 ] , [ N f6 ]  In this position he is trying to develop.
 [ K x g5 ] , [ Q d8 + ]  now checkmate in 2-3 14. [ K h5 ] [ Q h4 # ] 14. [ K g4 ] [ Q h4 ] 15. [ K f3 ] [ Q e4 # ] 14. [ K f4 ] [ Q h4 ] 15. [ K f3 ] [ Q e4 # ] Thanks fr your attention!
 [ N c6 ] , [ B e3 ]  Again I don't expect black to keep trading material while he's down. So I figure I will develop my bishop a little and open up my queen's rook. I wouldn't mind the exchange either if black wants to trade knights.
 [ B b5 ] , [ a6 ]  Now this makes me happy as it's where Erika stops copying her opponent. My guess is that this is where she took previous notes about that and maybe realized it was starting to happen again. So she stopped herself and went after the N.
 [ N c3 ] , [ b4 ]  Smarter move here is actually all the way back into [ b1 ] or maybe even [ a2 ] but he's a hungry greedy horse and his eyes are bigger than his stomach.
 [ Q x c8 + ]  [ K f7 ] , [ h3 ]  ??? Unbelievable blunder by white destroys whatever he has been building from the beginning...
 [ N b2 ]  [ Q c6 ]  [ N d3 ] , [ e4 ]  Look at what a mess this move makes. If white's knight retreats the bishop on [ c4 ] falls. If white captures with 30. Rxe4? black simply recaptures with 30. ... [ N x e4 ] and gains the exchange for a pawn. This might be white's best alternative though.
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ d x e4 ]  My instinct is to take back with the knight...
 [ R f8 ]  [ N f7 + ]  [ R x f7 ]  [ Q x f7 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ Q h5 + ]  [ B h7 ]  [ Q x e5 ]  [ f x e5 ]  [ R f7 ]  [ a5 ] , [ R x h7 + ]  Black forfeits
 [ g3 ] , [ N c5 ]  No hurries in exchanging.
 [ R a8 ] , [ R x d4 ]  !!
 [ K h7 ] , [ N g5 + ]  In this position I set three conditional moves for mate. 38. ..q[ x g5 ] 39. q[ x e7 + ] k[ [ [ h6 ] ] ] 40. r[ h8 + ] n[ [ h7 ] ] 41. rxh7#. Or 38. ...k[ [ [ h6 ] ] ] 39. n[ f7 + ] k[ [ g7 ] ] 40. n[ e6 + ] k[ x f7 ] 41. rf8#. Or 38...k[ [ g7 ] ] 39. nc[ e6 + ] k[ [ [ h6 ] ] ] 40. n[ f7 + ] k[ [ h7 ] ] 41. rh8#. Sweet.
 [ B x c3 ]  [ B x c3 ] , [ d6 ]  Now I can castle.
 [ R b1 ] , [ R e7 ]  20. ...... [ R e7 ] - guarding the attacked b pawn. Would [ b5 ] have been an improvement though?
 [ B d6 ] , [ Q g4 ]  14. [ g3 ] [ Q f6 ] was necessary.
 [ Q x g5 ] , [ N f3 + ]  
 [ f x e5 ]  [ R x f8 + ] , [ K x f8 ]  Now he may aswell just resign the rook can easily swipe up all of the pawns whilst the knight is virtually powerless.
 [ B g1 + ] , [ K e4 ]  A shame too because the rest of this game had been fascinating active top-level (for me anyway) play. At this point though Black simply converts his material advantage and crushes my feeble remainder.
 [ R c3 + ]  [ R d3 ]  [ B c4 ] , [ R x c3 ]  With that mission accomplished. I got the rook off the board was it perfectly played probably not. Was it the perfect plan probably not. Baby steps for white.
 [ B e6 ] , [ e4 ]  Bolstering my knight on [ d5 ] Black will have to move his [ c6 ] knight if he wants to chase me away with [ c6 ]  [ f3 ]  [ c6 ]  [ N e3 ]  [ N h5 ] , [ K f2 ]  Everything is secure on the kingside but Black owns the queenside dark squares.
 [ R x c1 ]  [ R x c1 ]  [ h4 ] , [ f3 ]  and this is my surprise... I felt really comfortable with the next four-five moves. And for the first time in the game I started to consider winning
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ f4 ] , [ B c5 ]  Black refrains from 2...[ e x f4 ] which leads to wild play.
 [ N x b3 ] , [ N x b3 ]  Black isn't out of the woods yet. White still has a looming presence on the h-file.
 [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ d3 ] , [ c x d3 ]  Taking is essential because the king needs to remain on the white squares and off the c file. The black queen is on the dark squares meaning no direct checks on a diagonal.
 [ N b d7 ]  [ R e2 ] , [ Q c7 ]  18. ...... [ Q c7 ] here comes the Wicked Witch of the West ssss - she is threatening Qg3+. My queen Glenda The Defender moves one square to [ e1 ] to defend against this.
 [ K x d8 ]  [ B g5 + ]  [ K c8 ]  [ R c1 + ]  [ N c6 ]  [ R x c6 + ]  [ K b8 ] , [ Q c7 # ]  Thanks to kgbsknik to let me reach the checkmate! I appreciate that
 [ b5 ]  [ B x c5 ]  [ d x c5 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ c4 ]  [ Q e3 ]  [ B x d5 ]  [ R x d5 ] , [ Q e7 ]  some careful thought was necessary here as there are some possible pins which reduce the viability of an [ e5 ] by white.
 [ N d5 ] , [ N b4 ]  10...[ N h4 ] is strong here as it aims to exchange the white knight on [ f3 ] which is much stronger than the black one on g6.
 [ B x e4 ] , [ Q e6 ]  but im not a fan of defending so i decide to chance it and set up my own attack
 [ K x e3 ]  [ R e8 + ]  [ K d2 ]  [ R e2 + ]  [ K c1 ] , [ N e4 ]  ? Wrong. The right move ought to have leapt to the eye: 23...f2! But the fact is I already had this knight invasion lined up and wasn't looking for alternatives. Let that be a lesson!
 [ O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ a5 ] , [ N c3 ]  Black played 13. ... [ a5 ] to bring his rook to [ a6 ] to bear pressure on my pawn on c6. This knight move lets me defend the pawn much more aggresively than the passive [ R c1 ] would have.
 [ B c3 ]  [ K d7 ] , [ K f3 ]  29. [ K f3 ] - Henry tries to get closer to the centre like his royal counterpart.
 [ Q x f7 ] , [ R g8 + ]  I'd seen how [ h8 ] was better than [ f8 ] but didn't see that coming. Under the circumstances my opponent put up a strong if forlorn defense.
 [ b4 ] , [ a5 ]  Poor choice on my part as the following moves prove.
 [ K f2 ]  [ h2 ]  [ R c1 ]  [ h x g1 = Q + ]  [ R x g1 ]  [ R x g1 ] , [ K x g1 ]  Wins a knight for a pawn leaving black ahead a bishop and a pawn ahead.
 [ B e2 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ B g3 ]  [ N d6 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ B x e2 ]  [ Q x e2 ] , [ N e4 ]  A strong move.
 [ Q b4 + ] , [ N c3 ]  Allows [ Q x b2 ] but Q[ x R a8 + ] is also coming. I won't have played it nevertheless: 17... [ Q x b2 ] 18. Q[ x R a8 + ] [ K e7 ] 19. Q[ x B h8 ] Q[ x R a1 + ] 20. [ K d2 ] etc. and he can get some annoying series of checks with the Q. Still I'll be up and threatening BxNf6#.
 [ B c8 ] , [ R x h6 ]  only just in time: I liked this better then a direct Nh2; this would have shut off Rh1...
 [ R x f6 ]  [ Q g4 ]  [ Q e8 ] , [ N b5 ]  Or Rae1. Black could now try to defend with 15... [ Q f7 ] 16. [ R a e1 ] [ Q h7 ]  [ R a e1 ]  [ B f8 ] , [ B g5 ]  Now the black position collapses. Now if 17... [ R f5 ] 18. [ N h4 ] [ Q f7 ] 19. [ N x g6 ] [ Q x g6 ] 20. [ R x e6 ] [ Q x e6 ] 21. [ B x f5 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ N x f6 ]  [ Q x e6 + ]  [ K g7 ] , [ N g5 ]  Or [ d5 ] with the idea of [ a6 ] then Nbd4. Also interesting is Nxa7.
 [ R d6 ] , [ N e6 ]  ! With the much needed knight maneuver everything is protected and the [ e7 ] rook is trapped!
 [ B c7 ] , [ R x d1 ]  Another mistake by White. He should avoid piece exchanges at all costs.
 [ K b3 ]  [ f8 = Q ] , [ a2 ]  Black is almost there...
 [ K e7 ] , [ Q x g7 + ]  Catch your magic moment!
 [ K e8 ] , [ Q e2 ]  Looking at the [ b5 ] square and protecting the [ g2 ] pawn which may be threatened on the long diagonal
 [ f3 ] , [ N d6 ]  I like this place too. The knight "sees" more than it controls many white squares around and let the f column opened.
 [ f x e4 ]  [ N g5 ] , [ B f5 ]  Instead black decides to develop which also nets him a strong centre but allows me to stick an annoying pawn at [ e5 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ d5 ] , [ f3 ]  Contesting black's centre. If I get to trade my centre is similar to that of black and if he decides to trade I will develop my queen and create more open files which may be used later to create strength out of my isolated passed pawn.0
 [ K e8 ]  [ h x g7 ]  [ R g8 ]  [ Q e5 + ] , [ B e6 ]  33. ......... [ B e6 ] - I block a check with Fou Leblanc - Freddy has just announced # in 7. Here we go again!
 [ N b6 ] , [ b3 ]  Again didn't know what to do so I cut off his knight. I'm aware that this creates a weakness for my knight and rook.
 [ e x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ Q x d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ e5 ]  [ c5 ]  [ Q d3 ]  [ N g4 ] , [ B e3 ]  ??? bad move on my part
 [ R a8 ]  [ B c2 ]  [ N g6 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ R b8 ] , [ N c4 ]  Just dancing at this point.
 [ B g5 ] , [ g6 ]  9. .......... [ g6 ] - tries to drive the [ f5 ] knight away but .......
 [ e4 ] , [ N f6 ]  This is the Alekhine's Defense. Black tempts White's pawns forward to form a broad pawn centre with plans to undermine and attack the white structure later in the spirit of hypermodern defence. White's imposing mass of pawns in the centre often includes pawns on [ c4 ] [ d4 ] [ e5 ] and f4. It's an aggressive choice by my opponent.
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ B b4 ]  [ N x c6 ]  [ b x c6 ] , [ Q d4 ]  I dislike bringing out the Queen this early. Notice that I immediately put your Queen under attack forcing your next move instead of free choice to make your own attack.
 [ Q d7 ]  [ Q b7 ]  [ R e4 e7 ]  [ Q x d7 ]  [ R x d7 ]  [ R d3 ]  [ d4 ] , [ h4 ]  37. ... [ Q d7 ] 38.[ Q b7 ] R4[ e7 ] 39.[ Q x d7 ] [ R x d7 ] 40.[ R d3 ] [ d4 ] 41.h4! ... More petting myself on the back ... This move helps to restrain a possible advance of 9K’s kingside pawns. I did not want 9K to beat me to the punch by advancing his pawns and cramping mine.
 [ B g2 ]  [ c6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ e6 ] , [ e4 ]  So now White has better development AND more space for his pawn.
 [ B x d5 ] , [ Q x d5 ]  I wanted to keep the bishop on [ b3 ] to keep [ c2 ] solidly defended.
 [ K e3 + ] , [ K g3 ]  Preventing BK's escape route via f4.
 [ a6 ]  [ R b8 ] , [ K f2 ]  Trying to get his king into play. However it is too late. The pawn is all but gone.
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ c4 ] , [ c6 ]  ...normally i would go in for a Benko but sure why not try something else..
 [ B x f3 + ]  [ g x f3 ] , [ R e8 + ]  Better than Qe8.
 [ Q x b6 ] , [ R x e7 ]  Black's pieces are disorganized and cramped. Notice especially the effect my [ d5 ] pawn has on his bishop.
 [ K g7 ]  [ f4 ]  [ Q d6 ]  [ f x e5 ] , [ Q x e5 ]  Position is still very even.
 [ h3 ]  [ R x d5 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ B x d5 ]  [ R d1 ] , [ f3 ]  Here white resigns. He has to return the the material he has gained with interest for example 50.[ R x d5 ] [ f x e2 ] 51.[ Q e1 ] Qf4! 52.[ Q x e2 ] [ Q f2 ] 53.[ Q x f2 ] [ e x f2 ] 54.[ R d1 ] [ B g3 ] and the white rook is tied up defending against [ f1 = Q ] so black's can just march the c-pawn down to [ c2 ] and play ...[ B f4 ] and ...c1.
 [ R h g1 ]  [ R a d8 ]  [ Q b4 ]  [ Q x b4 ] , [ a x b4 ]  I felt like black had too many weak pieces to defend at this point so simplifying the game by eliminating the queens wouldn't make much of a difference for me
 [ O-O ] , [ B e7 ]  preparing [ N f6 ] to over protect [ d5 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N g3 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ R f e1 ]  [ B f6 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ R f e8 ]  [ B x d5 ] , [ c x d5 ]  this move seems terrible at first but black has the resource of rerouting the bishop to [ c5 ] which is exactly what was done. Another note of merit is that with proper play white can deprive black of this resource.
 [ B x f5 ]  [ g x f5 ] , [ B g5 ]  This then is the crucial position from which numerous variations can arise. Every time I've played this line over the board this position has been reached in about 10 minutes or so and at this point my opponent has stopped for a lenghty think. Before we look at the possible continuations it is worth assessing the situation. By exchanging the knights on [ f3 ] and the bishops on [ f5 ] black has managed to improve his pawn structure and weaken white's. The central pawn phalanx could be very threatening indeed in the end game and so black has every reason to be optimistic. White on the other hand must base his play around getting control of the c and or g files and infiltrating his queen into black's position. The game is on a knife edge.
 [ K e1 ] , [ K c3 ]  Too late White. Now Black's king is so far advanced that he does not have to retreat the rook he only has to defend it with the king. However I was not planning to capture White's pawn with 23...[ R x c2 ] as this is met by 24.[ R d1 ] preparing for 25.[ R d7 ] and hoovering up all my vulnerable pawns on the 7th rank. I had far too much to lose if I allowed that to happen.
 [ Q c7 ]  [ R d4 ]  [ B d6 ] , [ B f4 ]  21. [ B f4 ] - this move prevents [ B x h2 + ] but allows a pawn fork which I execute on the next move.
 [ O-O ]  [ O-O ] , [ Q e7 ]  Interesting. I was expecting [ N c6 ]  [ Q d8 ] , [ B x f8 ]  Wins the rook
 [ d4 ] , [ e x d4 ]  Aww dang...I'm not fond of this opening. Brutes sending their special lady's out to avenge pawns and what not...what's the world coming to? But the world is not fair and white gets to lead the dance. .............................................................................................. Blake84120 Wrote: [ N f3 ] is fairly common here and the Danish Gambit (3. c3) is also playable as is 3. Bc4. At this point it's premature to assume white is sending his lady out to avenge pawns. .............................................................................................. It's not too early to assume anything because I wrote this note long after the game was over. But...correct me if I'm wrong this so called [ N f3 ] [ B c4 ] [ c3 ] "danish gambit" none of those moves will recover that lost pawn right? Now that he's come this far he gotta bring the queen out here so far as I can see.
 [ K e6 ]  [ f x e5 ] , [ d x e5 ]  This leaves black with a passed central pawn that will eventually win the game. Also the white knight now only has one attacking move available namely d5.
 [ Q e8 ]  [ Q x a7 ]  [ K g6 ] , [ B e5 ]  reestablishing the pin on d7. However white could ahve also played [ B x d7 ] but sometimes it is better to keep the threat hanging over their head.
 [ N e7 ]  [ d4 ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ c x d4 ] , [ B b6 ]  good now the bishop is not aiming at anything at all now to focus on the queen
 [ O-O-O ]  [ Q e2 ]  [ R h e8 ] , [ f4 ]  Forcing the Queen to the other side of the board where Black probably wanted to take it anyway. And to make the move even worse badly weakening my Kingside structure.
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ B b5 ]  Sicilian: Rossolimo Attack. I often play [ B b5 ] against the Sicilian to avoid standard opening lines.
 [ B e6 ]  [ g7 ]  [ B g8 ] , [ K g5 ]  All white pieces reside on black squares which make it easiest for white [ g7 ] is protected by way of [ Q f6 + ] against ...Kf7.
 [ R d3 ] , [ B b2 ]  ACK! Another blunder!!! [ R d2 ] and it's over!!!
 [ b4 ] , [ f4 ]  Discarding his doubled pawn to force through a passed h-pawn
 [ N d5 ] , [ d4 ]  ...in return for a solid centre.
 [ N e4 ] , [ B x e1 ]  ?? dammit! I played this move way too fast and now White is gonna make a comeback! Black should have played [ d4 ] (pinning the knight) followed by [ Q d5 ] with the threat of mate in the next two move.
 [ d x e5 ]  [ B x e5 ] , [ N f3 ]  attacking the bishop
 [ Q c2 ]  [ R c8 ]  [ R b1 ]  [ f5 ]  [ e x f5 ]  [ g x f5 ]  [ N f4 ]  [ B h6 ] , [ N e6 ]  this is a fork. very nice tacticle move.
 [ K e7 ] , [ N b5 ]  Going wild again. Not [ N x e4 ] with a pinned knight. And overlooking...
 [ h4 ] , [ N c6 ]  I insist [ c5 ] is better.
 [ R h1 ] , [ g6 ]  with the same [ N h5 + ] intention.
 [ c x b3 + ] , [ K d1 ]  !? No check on the next move that's all I need...
 [ Q x d4 ] , [ N c6 ]  Developing with an attack gaining a bit of tempo.
 [ K h6 ] , [ B e3 + ]  Fourth check.
 [ c5 ]  [ c4 ] , [ N c6 ]  2. ..... [ N c6 ] - this game has transposed into a Symmetrical English. I now decided to develop a piece and prepare [ e5 ] of which I play next move.
 [ B e8 ]  [ N h2 ]  [ B g6 ] , [ R b a1 ]  I didn't like having to do this.
 [ K b8 ] , [ Q d3 ]  Still protecting the two pawns but now also pressuring the weakened light squares [ f5 ] and g6.
 [ N d7 ] , [ N x d7 ]  Rather than retreat I simply capture.
 [ N g5 ] , [ B h6 ]  again I have to concetrate to keep my knight in place.
 [ d6 ] , [ e x d6 ]  ...and indeed it is the queen's pawn that steps forward so I capture it. It looks as though I am going to be pegged back again...
 [ g x f4 ]  [ N x b6 ] , [ c x b6 ]  21. ....... [ c x b6 ] - I now trade off my knight for that dark square bishop. It untangles Julia's queenside pawns but I am the exchange up and have just traded off another set of pieces so I think it was worth untangling those footmen. As in my previous note the [ f3 ] pawn is now free to move.
 [ N c3 ] , [ B g6 ]  I expected this. I am 1-2 moves away from completing development this does nothing very threatening. The bishop is really poorly placed on [ g6 ] and will soon trade for a knight.
 [ d5 ] , [ e x d5 ]  8...[ e x [ d5 ] ] 9.N[ f x [ d5 ] ] [ N e5 ] 10.[ B e2 ] [ N x [ d5 ] ] 11.[ c x [ d5 ] ] [ d6 ] 12.[ b4 ] [ B f6 ] 13.0-0 [ c5 ] 14.[ d x c6 ] [ b x c6 ] 15.[ B b2 ] [ d5 ] 16.[ R c1 ] [ R b8 ] 17.[ B a1 ] [ B d7 ] 18.[ Q a4 ] [ R c8 ] 19.[ Q a6 ] = (0.16) Depth: 28 07:24:59 8281mN
 [ N f6 ]  [ B g5 ] , [ g6 ]  In this position I prefer the fianchetto bishop and a strong castle. I wasn't attracted by [ e6 ] blocking my light square bishop completely and pinning my [ f6 ] knight
 [ N d6 ]  [ Q d1 ] , [ N c4 ]  Note the strength of the knight. It is truly a beautiful piece on [ c4 ] preventing white from advancing the weak [ c3 ] pawn and liberating the bishop. The immediate threat is Nxb2.
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e4 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ f3 ]  [ e x f3 ]  [ N x f3 ] , [ c6 ]  THE ZIEGLER DEFENSE Black makes a useful move and keeps flexible with the Bishop on c8. He's waiting to see what White will do with his Bishop on [ f1 ] and react appropriately.
 [ O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ a4 ]  [ a6 ] , [ B x f5 ]  Loses tempo better first 10. [ a5 ] Rc8...
 [ B x e3 ]  [ N x e3 ]  [ B g6 ] , [ B f3 ]  Starting an ill-conceived plan to win a pawn. Better would have been [ N c4 ] exploiting the weak dark squares.
 [ K e7 ] , [ B g5 + ]  There is nothing 'wrong' with [ Q x e5 + ] and will probably also lead to a won position but I felt as if I'd like to bag more than a pawn even if some of the pressure on Black's position is alleviated in this line
 [ K g1 ] , [ N g4 ]  Attacking [ e3 ] the base of the pawn structure. Black has kept tempo dictating the pace of the game and preventing Qa7.
 [ e4 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B x c4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ d x c5 ] , [ Q a5 ]  This looks correct but it gives white a slight advantage because he can harass the queen.
 [ K c7 ] , [ N f7 ]  While this is not a forcing move it does keep the king blocked from using ([ d8 ] d6) while opening a line for the queen to reach [ c5 ] ( pawn supported square) to further the attack. Note that there would be trouble for white if not for the pawn at [ f3 ] which blocks (...[ Q d1 ] ).
 [ K g7 ] , [ R c5 ]  Expecting 41...Bd4?.
 [ B e7 ]  [ N f4 ]  [ R h7 ] , [ N g6 ]  Down a Pawn White tries to reclaim the initiative.
 [ h4 ]  [ R f e8 ]  [ g3 ] , [ N e6 ]  The pawn on [ d5 ] is pinned to his queen and therefore cannot capture the knight without loss of material.
 [ Q e7 ]  [ B g5 ] , [ B x f2 + ]  ?? Julio played this because he thought that it won a piece. I'm familiar with that method as it's very similar to how I thought against blitzkov during the misstep which he annotated. But like that game black had no backup for the B. So it was just one attacker against 2 defenders and the result is that this will cost him a piece for pawn. That's a major advantage for white especially at her rating.
 [ c6 ] , [ a4 ]  A quiet move. It begins to build a defence against Black's queenside pawns but it also lets the rook come out.
 [ K b4 ]  [ N g6 ]  [ K a3 ] , [ N x f4 ]  who cares about these pawns??? why don't you approach to b3?
 [ Q x c3 ]  [ Q x c3 + ] , [ b x c3 ]  White now has doubled pawns to contend with. A future weakness for Black to target.
 [ K c1 ] , [ Q b6 ]  Threatening ...[ R a1 ] and ...[ Q d4 ] which is devastating if allowed unchecked.
 [ d5 ]  [ N a5 ]  [ B x a7 ]  [ K b7 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ B x c3 ]  [ b x c3 ]  [ N a6 ]  [ B x a6 + ]  [ K x a6 ]  [ K d2 ]  [ N c4 + ]  [ K e2 ] , [ B b5 ]  Now he's harrassing my king
 [ R f6 + ] , [ K e8 ]  [ K g8 ] means definitely losing the rook on [ c1 ] and giving the pawn on [ d6 ] a chance to turn into something nasty...and so Ke8. And so the bang to follow.
 [ N f3 ] , [ B e7 + ]  Keeps the rook in place until the knight moves away.
 [ N e4 ] , [ Q e2 ]  White could exchange queens but people say it is unnecessary when N is on [ e4 ] ...
 [ N x g7 + ]  [ K c7 ]  [ N e6 + ] , [ K b8 ]  Black resigns since White wins back material equality while the king remains trapped and with mate threats.
 [ Q x c4 ]  [ N b6 ]  [ Q e2 ]  [ f6 ]  [ N h4 ]  [ g6 ]  [ R a d1 ] , [ f5 ]  More solid is 17...[ R d1 ] followed by d5... here black hopes to get a central pawn majority rolling while defending the kingside.
 [ B c5 ] , [ N f3 ]  !? inviting a push pawn
 [ Q h5 + ] , [ g6 ]  Forced.
 [ R f2 + ]  [ K g1 ]  [ R a2 ]  [ b6 ]  [ K f3 ] , [ b7 ]  Of course! Black cannot prevent both pawns from queening. But Black does have a drawing trick.
 [ d4 ]  [ c6 ]  [ e3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ N d2 ]  The knight chooses [ d2 ] so that I can still play [ c3 ] and complete the stonewall.
 [ b6 ]  [ K e3 ] , [ N d5 + ]  29. ...Nd5+. Some danger for white's g-pawn here so...
 [ h3 ] , [ B b7 ]  [ h3 ] has minimised my kingside threats but at the cost of dubious pawn structure for white. I now transfer my desire to controlling the center preparing to play [ d5 ] whilst connecting my rooks
 [ Q e1 ] , [ a4 ]  I'm not sure what he is trying to do!
 [ R e8 ]  [ d4 ]  [ d5 ] , [ e5 ]  In order to gain space and therefore freedom for an attack on the K-side White has given up some significant gains that were already in hand such as control of [ b6 ] and the control of the half-open a-file. Will his positional judgment prove correct? In this game not quite.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B c4 ] , [ N f6 ]  I played two knights again which confused the heck out of me.
 [ Q c2 + ] , [ K e1 ]  Only move.
 [ R d f1 ] , [ B x c5 ]  Finally Black swaps off the Bishop for the Knight.
 [ Q x g4 ]  [ Q d4 + ]  [ Q x d4 ] , [ c x d4 ]  Exchanges like this won't help white's cause. Down by the exchange and a pawn white really needs to keep material on the board.
 [ B d7 ]  [ Q x b4 ]  [ Q x e5 ] , [ N c3 ]  White made this move with the hope of catching his opponent in another trap.
 [ B c5 ] , [ Q d5 ]  Now that he has moved his bishop to [ c5 ] and I have a good protection for my rook and a chance to attack the [ h7 ] square I am ready to move my queen back.
 [ N c5 ]  [ f3 ] , [ N e6 ]  Would be pretty dumb for taking the knight because it would either give him a tempo or a strong center.
 [ N c4 ]  [ N x c4 ]  [ Q x c4 ]  [ N e7 ]  [ e4 ] , [ a6 ]  It looks like a stupid move and probably is. But white's queen and rook share a diagonal and whether or not P[ d4 ] was ever played black needs support for [ B b5 ] (which ultimately occurs on move 18--four moves away).
 [ B f6 ]  [ b5 ]  [ Q c5 ]  [ B x d4 ] , [ Q x d4 ]  I fell for his trick.
 [ K x c1 ] , [ N b8 ]  Starting yet another long trek to b3.
 [ B x e7 ]  [ Q x e7 ]  [ N x d7 ] , [ Q x d7 ]  I don't at all mind this swapping down.
 [ B x b4 + ] , [ Q x b4 ]  I noticed then that it was a check and I needed to go for the bishop not my target the rook.
 [ R f3 ]  [ Q e7 ]  [ R f h3 ]  [ B c8 ]  [ Q f2 ]  [ N e8 ]  [ R f3 ]  [ N g7 ] , [ R h h3 ]  Not 29 RxNP B-[ Q2 ] and the Rook is trapped.
 [ B e5 ] , [ B f4 ]  In my very last hope of making things complicated for Jack I play this. As my idea is to use my K as a weapon with my B. And then I'd try to use that with my [ c4 ] and [ d5 ] with what I mentioned about pawn chains to attack his K. The goal of course would be to mate. But if Jack figures that out and plays 44...[ B x f4 ] then all that I had is officially gone. And that is exactly what happened. Afterwhich I resigned because his b pawn would advance and promote. And before that happens I'm the one that's going to timeout as he had 6 or 7 minutes against my 4 minutes.
 [ a x b5 ] , [ N x d3 ]  Black plays a 'zwischen' move before taking back on b5. The first book I ever read on chess was Weapons of Chess by Bruce Pandolfini. The zwischen or inbetween move and other tactical concepts I learned from that book played a large part in shaping my early chess. Had White played [ B d2 ] earlier he would have been forced to recapture with the pawn creating an isolated b-pawn.
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ a6 ]  [ f3 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N b3 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ N b d7 ]  [ O-O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ g4 ]  [ b5 ]  [ K b1 ]  [ N b6 ]  [ g5 ]  [ N h5 ]  [ N a5 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ B d7 ] , [ Q b4 ]  Alternative variation: 17. [ B d3 ] [ [ b4 ] ] (17... [ R a b8 ] 18. Q[ [ b4 ] ] [ g6 ] 19. [ R h g1 ] [ R f c8 ] 20. [ N [ b3 ] ] [ B d8 ] 21. [ N d2 ] [ a5 ] 22. [ Q h4 ] [ [ b4 ] ] 23. [ N e4 ] [ B b5 ] 24.

[ Q f3 ] [ b3 ] 31. ax[ b3 ] ax[ b3 ] 32. cx[ b3 ] [Kanefsck G (2400) -Cativelli G/Buenos Aires 1998/EXT 2002/0-1 (37)]) 18. Qx[ [ b4 ] ] [ R f b8 ] 19. [ Q d2 ] [ B d8 ] 20. [ N c6 ] [ B x c6 ] 21. [ d x c6 ] [ d5 ] 22. [ c3 ] $14
 [ N a5 ]  [ Q b8 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ Q b7 ] , [ e4 ]  I am beginning to think that black is getting tied down on the q-side so an advance in the centre and k-side will put him under a lot of pressure.
 [ d4 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B b4 ] , [ Q c2 ]  ?! While the analysis doesn't mention anything in my mind this is an inaccuracy. Of course not every single guideline should be followed as there's so many that sometimes conflict with one another. The only idea behind it is to get your pieces out castle and establish mobility. And there are also exceptions where it must be broken to win material of it leads to mate or losing material. This isn't one and in my mind this is the most important guideline of them all. I don't know why black got his Q out this early as nothing's being threatened. But it does not develop nor help him with development. Now chicoboy can use that time to get his pieces into a play while white wasted time with this move. With it black should have a small advantage at this point.
 [ R h3 ] , [ c5 ]  This frees up some space but now Black has a weakness on d5.
 [ B x d7 + ] , [ Q x d7 ]  I should have captured with my N instead.
 [ N b3 ]  [ K d1 ]  [ N x c1 ]  [ K x c1 ] , [ N h5 ]  My plan here was to play 19...[ N [ f4 ] ] here with the idea of 20...[ N e2 + ] and from there I'd then try to figure out what else I could do. And the computers next move allows me to bring the N to [ f4 ] but since white's next move stops the check I refrain from responding with 20...Ne2.
 [ d4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ Q e2 ] , [ c x d4 ]  Forgot about that...
 [ N x d2 ]  [ Q x d2 ] , [ Q x a4 ]  Bye-bye pawn. :( But I'm still up a material point :)
 [ Q x d7 ] , [ R x e5 ]  wonderful. One of my beloved is gone. And now?
 [ R d1 ]  [ Q x c4 ] , [ Q x e4 ]  now i realise
 [ c3 ] , [ B b6 ]  defending the R on [ d8 ]  [ N x a4 ]  [ R x d8 + ] , [ K x d8 ]  ?? 26... [ B x d8 ] would have avoided White's forking check from [ d1 ] (as wazzu85 commented in his resignation note)
 [ d3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N d2 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N g f3 ] , [ N c6 ]  This threw me as the normal move here would be ...[ c5 ] and this wasn't what I was expecting. Alternative variation: 4... [ c5 ]  [ g3 ] , [ d x e4 ]  I wasn't happy to see this move it's not something I know anything about and I don't usually enjoy playing exchange variations.
 [ K g3 ]  [ R h8 ] , [ B c1 ]  i must activate my bishops.
 [ B f4 ]  [ a5 ] , [ B e5 ]  19. [ B e5 ] - renewing the pressure on g7.
 [ Q d7 ]  [ N x e7 + ]  [ Q x e7 ] , [ N d5 ]  I wanted a queen in the center.
 [ R c3 ]  [ R b4 ]  [ K c5 ]  [ R e4 ]  [ g4 ] , [ R e5 + ]  Winning the h pawn.
 [ b x c4 ] , [ N e5 ]  ..this is where i wondered if [ N [ f3 ] + ] would lead to some winning fun. gxf [ Q x h3 ] and how does white deal with either fxe [ f3 ] or exf from black mating in one..
 [ a3 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ e x d5 ] , [ e x d5 ]  But now Black has an isolated P.
 [ R d f8 ] , [ d4 ]  Rybka loves this move too.
 [ a x b4 ] , [ N d3 # ]  and good mate...
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ d4 ]  Somewhat old-fashioned but it does open lines quickly. In this case it is Black who exploits this!
 [ K h1 ] , [ R f c8 ]  bringing in the heavy artillery...
 [ K d3 ] , [ g4 ]  free up a little space for my king to get through huh?
 [ f5 ]  [ e x f6 ]  [ e ]  [ p ]  [ Q x f6 ]  [ B x c6 + ] , [ b x c6 ]  11. ...... [ b x c6 ] - after a bishop trade black has queenside pawn islands to go with his 1 pawn deficit.
 [ g x h5 ] , [ N x f5 ]  winning the exchange!
 [ K h8 ] , [ Q e5 ]  This position is similar to one discussed a couple moves ago but the placement of the Black queen doesn't matter since White's discovered check threat defends against possible queen checks from Black.
 [ K a3 ]  [ K d2 ]  [ K b2 ]  [ K d3 ]  [ K b3 ]  [ K d2 ] , [ K x c4 ]  Black gets a pawn. Material is even but black king is a bit better positioned
 [ N c5 ] , [ Q x d6 ]  ...and remove it giving me the slightest of advantages - a single pawn.
 [ B f1 ] , [ d3 ]  this is getting uneasy for White: interference from [ B g7 ] is only a matter of time...
 [ B b4 ]  [ h4 ]  [ B x c5 ]  [ B x c5 ] , [ R b e1 ]  Threatening to open the e-file with [ f5 ]  [ R e d1 ]  [ Q b6 ]  [ R d2 ]  [ Q a5 ]  [ R c2 ]  [ R h5 ]  [ R b1 ] , [ e5 ]  I felt that I was winning after this move.
 [ N b d2 ] , [ h6 ]  Time to leave the DB. Only three games reached this position; 10... [ h6 ] 10... 0-0 and 10... [ B h5 ] were played once each all three games being Black wins.
 [ K e3 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ B b4 ] , [ g6 ]  The pawns have closed the K-Side and now his Knight threatend to attack them as my Pawns block my bishops
 [ e6 ] , [ B h7 ]  An interesting decision. White clearly intended to take on [ g6 ] and wreck black's kingside. Black withdraws the bishop out of harm's way but allows white to winkle his king out into the open.
 [ e3 ] , [ B b4 ]  So let's go for it. My dsb will be the "bad" bishop so it can be always exchanged for one knight.
 [ e6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ c5 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ N f3 ]  2. Develop pieces rapidly so that they add to the control of the center.
 [ N d6 ] , [ f4 ]  I felt unsure about a direct Rxe5+: unjustified but I had a plan...
 [ K g3 ]  [ b4 ]  [ a6 ] , [ a4 ]  
 [ B f2 ] , [ B d8 ]  avoiding the possible [ B c5 ]  [ R b3 ] , [ Q d7 ]  now we can exchange queens
 [ e6 ]  [ e3 ] , [ f5 ]  Until now we have a standard opening. Here Black departs from the standard response which would have been 3...Nf6. However he plays it on the next move.
 [ R c1 ]  [ c6 ]  [ N c4 ] , [ Q x d1 + ]  Up by two pawns with a 3 to 1 advantage on the queenside the only thing standing between me and an easy win is all the white pieces. Fortunately white seems willing to trade them off.
 [ B c8 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ R a e1 ]  [ Q c8 ]  [ R x e8 + ]  [ B x e8 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ Q f5 ]  [ c4 ]  [ Q h5 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ B x c7 ]  [ R c8 ]  [ Q f4 ]  [ Q a5 ]  [ Q g4 + ]  [ K h8 ]  [ N h4 ]  [ Q g5 ]  [ Q x g5 ]  [ f x g5 ]  [ B g3 ]  [ g x h4 ]  [ B x h4 ]  [ R x c4 ]  [ d5 ] , [ B x h4 ]  So in a case like that all that matters is how long the game lasted and what happened. It was 28 moves and in the end I wound up losing at least a piece and pawn which was enough for me to resign as there was nothing else to learn from the game. In the actual game though I lost a piece as well as my Queen without compensation which is why I resigned. The moral isn't what's in the annotation itself but rather in the actual annotation. And what it boils down is how I actually lost a piece. The problem was that I had my B and Queen tied down which is how he won that. So the lesson to be learned is what I learned a while ago. It's not a good to tie down and restrict your own pieces. As that gives you problems which your opponent can exploit.
 [ K f7 ] , [ B x c6 ]  ...and exchange it off.
 [ Q c7 ] , [ N d f3 ]  Just in time as foreseen.
 [ R x e3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ] , [ Q x d5 ]  Offering to exchange Queens with the same motivation
 [ R x g7 ]  [ R x e3 ]  [ R x e3 + ] , [ K x e3 ]  The White bishop Black figures could be dangerous later so Black figures to start clearing the board. That said his knight is still trapped.
 [ f5 ] , [ B f1 ]  Vacating [ g2 ] for the king. Perhaps white is better with exf...
 [ c5 ]  [ c3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ N g f3 ]  7. [ N e2 ] is more usual here; I like this line where I tempt black with the offer of a free pawn - 7. ... [ Q b6 ] 8. O-O cd 9. cd NxP?! 10. NxN QxN 11. [ N f3 ] with a natural attack. I've played this line four times between here and over the board games winning each time.
 [ R x e5 ]  [ g3 ] , [ R e1 ]  Finally through.
 [ K b2 ]  [ Q x e6 ]  [ Q x c7 + ]  [ K a8 ] , [ Q x h7 ]  One less. Black can't take any other pawn from me now. I am -1. It could be worse but it's all about technique!
 [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ O-O ] , [ B x d5 ]  Your white bishop is much better than his knight on the open board! This is trading a good bishop for a decent knight and centralizing the black queen. Also your knight will now be attacked twice so you'll have to move it to f3. (Black has initiative) 9. [ N x c6 ] [ b x c6 ] 10. o-o leaves white with a small advantage due to black's pawn weakness.
 [ Q e3 + ]  [ K h2 ] , [ Q x c3 ]  I lose another pawn.
 [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ] , [ d4 ]  3. [ d4 ] - fairly standard Sicilian Defense.
 [ K b4 ]  [ K e2 ]  [ K c3 ]  [ B a6 ] , [ B g1 ]  I need my bish outta there...
 [ Q e2 ]  [ Q x d5 ]  [ R d1 ] , [ R c6 ]  Tiviakov stated that an active defense was Black's best chance and recommended 31...e4.
 [ c3 ] , [ f6 ]  And with [ c3 ] and his queen not out I can strike at the middle right away. Usually [ f6 ] would have to come at a safer time if lsb's were off the board and whites queen had roaming ability.
 [ Q d5 ] , [ Q c6 ]  Another error. Black tries to free the game of queens and to promote his own pawns but his defence would work much better if there were queens on the board. This is a debatable decision so please comment if it is right or wrong. White is forced to trade.
 [ B f4 ] , [ c x d4 ]  Exchanging the pawn to not have the burden to protect it later giving the possibility to dismantle the 3 linked pawns. My plan here was: 16.[ c x d4 ] f5! 17.O-O [ f x e4 ] 18.[ Q d2 ] [ N x e5 ] 19.[ B x e5 ] [ e x f3 ] 20.gxf3.
 [ K h8 ]  [ Q x e4 ]  [ R f8 ]  [ R x f8 + ]  [ Q x f8 ] , [ g6 ]  ? Again why close lines around the enemy King? [ Q x d4 ] is a much nicer way to maintain a pawn advantage since …[ K x h7 ] just exposes Black's King. Now Black does a great job exploiting the stalemating possibilities afforded him/her by White's own misguided pawns.
 [ Q g6 ]  [ B f4 ] , [ B g4 ]  Now the White Queen's only option is retreat.
 [ N f6 ] , [ N f3 ]  The black queen isn't in the best of places
 [ Q x b2 ]  [ R b1 ]  [ Q f6 ]  [ c x d5 ] , [ B d7 ]  Clearing the back rank. Black needs to post a rook on the e file.
 [ Q d4 ]  [ B x f3 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ R e1 + ]  [ B e4 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B x c6 ]  [ Q x c6 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ g x f6 ]  [ g3 ]  [ B e5 ]  [ Q d1 ]  [ Q e6 ]  [ N d2 ]  [ f5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ K h8 ]  [ N g5 ]  [ Q f6 ]  [ h4 ]  [ B x g3 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ f x e4 ]  [ f x g3 ]  [ Q b6 + ]  [ K h1 ]  [ R a d8 ]  [ Q h5 ]  [ Q x b2 ]  [ Q e5 + ]  [ f6 ]  [ Q d4 ]  [ R d7 ]  [ R e f1 ]  [ R g7 ]  [ R x f6 ]  [ Q x a1 + ]  [ K h2 ]  [ R x f6 ]  [ Q x f6 ]  [ Q x a2 + ]  [ K h3 ] , [ e3 ]  Had my opponent seen this he could have had a draw here. I shouldn't have captured on a2.....Maybe [ K g8 ] or [ h5 ] to give my king an outlet to avoid the draw.
 [ K g7 ]  [ N b7 ]  [ K f8 ]  [ K f3 ]  [ K g7 ] , [ K e3 ]  I realize that the kingside is safe so my king heads towards the action.
 [ f x e6 ] , [ N d4 ]  simply Black cannot take pawn. ie. NxP
 [ g5 ]  [ Q h3 ] , [ Q c2 ]  Sacrificing the bishop to attack his pawn structure
 [ B c4 ] , [ N f6 ]  Continuing opening and threatening pawn
 [ N b3 ]  [ B b7 ] , [ N c5 ]  23. Nc5! - In his favour!
 [ e5 ] , [ d4 ]  This is my style opening it's not stable but really effective for short parties.
 [ R x a1 ]  [ R x h2 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ R b2 + ]  [ N e2 ] , [ R h6 ]  Everything is winning but this is the best.
 [ N c3 ]  [ B x c3 ] , [ d x c3 ]  Another problem this time in my pawn formation. I need to get rid of double pawn. [Computer: 8. ... [ N g e7 ] 8. ... Bxc3? - interesting that double pawn is not problem]
 [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ B e3 ] , [ B g7 ]  Oistrakh has now cleared the way for castling.
 [ N d2 ]  [ a5 ]  [ N d3 ]  [ R f d8 ] , [ N f2 ]  Trying to take control of [ e4 ] and removing itself from the Rook skewer.
 [ K e1 ] , [ B x c3 + ]  ! Trade when you're ahead in material.
 [ B b5 + ]  [ B d7 ]  [ B x d7 + ]  [ Q x d7 ]  [ N x d7 ] , [ K x d7 ]  All forced from [ K e8 ] white still has position and material.
 [ B x c4 ]  [ N x h7 ] , [ R a8 ]  Black exploits the lead in development and bishop pair even though the game is still even materially in a near endgame White faces a strong attack.
 [ c3 ] , [ B d6 ]  7. ....... Bd6? - in hindsight [ B b6 ] was better but I wanted to bolster my [ e5 ] pawn.
 [ K f1 ] , [ B h3 + ]  Forcing king to e2...
 [ a x b5 ]  [ Q x a8 ]  [ N x d7 ] , [ Q x d5 ]  White could trade queens now and whould have a comfortable situation but is still eager.
 [ B d3 ] , [ Q d6 ]  At this point moving the Queen was more for show than anything else.
 [ a4 ] , [ h4 ]  Wasting time. I thought Kc3[ x c2 ] should win but after 46. [ K c3 ] [ a3 ] 47. K[ x c2 ] [ a7 ] 48. [ g6 + ] [ K x h6 ] 49. [ g2 ] [ a1 = Q ] [ g8 = Q ] black can probably hold the draw. (edge-pawns are drawish anyway and queen engames as well so this endgame doubly so). [ a4 ] may still draw but it gives me chances I don't really deserve
