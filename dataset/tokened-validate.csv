 [ Q x d7 ] , [ B e2 ]  Developing her remaining piece. The only issue is that the remaining piece is her bad bishop since her pawns block it in but Sue is ahead which compensates for that.
 [ Q x h2 + ] , [ K f1 ]  Now my blindness. I didnt' considered 21. ... Rf8. Now he can save the knight winning a second piece. Say 22. Ng3. But then I can take [ R x [ f2 ] ] and mate. And if he protects [ f2 ] with 23. [ R e2 ] Qh1#. And if 22. [ N e7 ] I simply play [ K d7 ] while 22. [ f3 ] loses the queen. It appears as if even if white has a move he can't use it to save the game. The only choice seems to be 22. [ K e2 ] since after Qx[ f2 ] 23. [ K d1 ] QxQ 24.QxQ e6[ x f5 ] and despite the quality black pawns should win but the game is still playable. But meybe black has an even better choice: after 22. [ K e2 ] Nxf7... what? The threat is to win the white queen with the knight after the discovered check. So let's take a look at the possible moves for white. A) 23. [ R [ h1 ] ] doesn't help after [ N x [ h1 ] ] and now white have to choose between 1) 24. [ K d1 ] [ Q g1 ] 25. [ Q e1 ] QxQ 26. KxQ and after RxN black wins or 25. [ K e2 ] and Q[ x R a1 ] or even 25. ... [ Q g4 ] 26. [ K e6 ] RxN and white cannot take the [ N [ h1 ] ] because of [ R f5 ] [ K e2 ] and [ Q g2 ] winning the rook or 2) 24. [ K d6 ] [ Q h3 ] and now white again have to choose between 25. [ N e3 ] N[ f2 ] 26. [ K e2 ] Q[ f3 ] 27. [ K e1 ] Q[ x R a1 ] winning or 25. [ Q e3 ] QxN 26. [ K d2 ] Q[ f2 ] 27. QxQ and black wins because can save the [ h1 ] knight both with RxQ or NxQ (28. [ R f1 ] Rf6!). Last chance for white: B) 23. [ Q b4 ] threatening the rook... but while the simple RxN balances the material [ N e4 ] or [ N g4 ] require more work (23. ... [ N g4 ] 24. [ K d3 ] RxN 25. [ R x e6 ] R[ f3 ] 26. [ K c4 ] [ N e3 ] 27. RxN ([ K c5 ] [ R f5 ] and mate...). I didn't see it. Did I lose the occasion to be a Morphy? :-))))))
 [ B d7 ]  [ N b5 ]  [ B x b5 ] , [ B x b5 + ]  Gaining the bishop pair in an open center game.
 [ K g1 ]  [ g2 ]  [ R h2 ] , [ K g3 ]  Now white has only pawn moves or losing his rook.
 [ R x a5 ]  [ R f8 ] , [ g4 ]  Prevents (27...[ R f1 ] ).
 [ O-O ]  [ B e2 ] , [ c5 ]  [ e5 ] is the main line
 [ B c6 ]  [ Q h3 ]  [ K g7 ] , [ R g3 ]  Good move - if white Queen attacks the rook will prevent checks from the black Queen. At the same time the pressure on [ d3 ] is stronger
 [ R x e7 ] , [ R d8 + ]  ...and line up another potential checkmate...
 [ R x e2 ] , [ Q x e2 ]  33. [ Q x e2 ] - Glenda is still eyeing up that [ e8 ] square threatening to come down on it with check and menace the black kingside pawns possibly even the queenside pawns should the Wicked Witch of the West block her check on e8. But Hector has other ideas he decided to give his king some luft with 33. ...... g6.
 [ g x f6 ]  [ Q x f6 + ] , [ K e8 ]  (anything else loses the rook)
 [ Q e2 ]  [ a5 ]  [ N x e5 ] , [ K f8 ]  Check mate coming up !
 [ R e1 ] , [ N d4 ]  Now the knight "forks" the bishop and the pawn.
 [ h6 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ a4 ]  [ R b1 ] , [ B x a3 ]  I'm not sure if that pawn was an oversight or if it was a calculated loss. I had to think quite a bit about whether I should grab it or whether that would just cost me time. It seems like 22. [ Q b1 ] would have put a watcher on the b-pawn without abandoning white's own a-pawn.
 [ N b5 ] , [ Q e8 ]  Queen exchange proposed
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ e5 ]  I gain a free pawn.
 [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ] , [ Q x d5 ]  I have an advantage in development and a better center. Therefore I have to be aggressive or these advantages will dissipate.
 [ Q x e7 ] , [ R a d1 ]  I try to salvage the situation.
 [ R f8 ]  [ N x d6 + ]  [ K d7 ]  [ N x b7 ]  [ g6 ] , [ N x c5 + ]  I did anticipate Perry's last move I kept in mind that this won another pawn since he is in check.
 [ f5 ]  [ K f2 ]  [ f4 ]  [ R d3 ]  [ R e4 ]  [ N c2 ]  [ R c4 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ K a5 ]  [ K f3 ]  [ K b6 ]  [ K x f4 ]  [ K c5 ]  [ K e3 ]  [ R a4 ]  [ N e6 + ]  [ K c6 ]  [ N d4 + ]  [ K c5 ]  [ N c2 ]  [ K c4 ]  [ N b4 ]  [ R a7 ]  [ K d2 ]  [ R h7 ]  [ K c2 ]  [ R h2 + ] , [ R d2 ]  White believes he can win with the Knight Pawn and King. They can now be coordinated. Eventually the Knight will have to land on [ c7 ] providing either checkmate with the Pawn on [ a7 ] or preventing the King from going to [ a8 ] and either obtaining a stalemate with no place to move or blocking the a-Pawn from promotion. The Pawn may never reach promotion but will be the key to winning the game.
 [ B g8 ]  [ h6 ] , [ R d5 ]  ?? but it is difficult to find a god move anyway. [ f4 ] probably
 [ O-O ]  [ d6 ] , [ B g5 ]  I already don't like my asset but hey let's see what can I do with it. Now BxN would be annoying.
 [ Q x d3 ]  [ Q g3 + ]  [ K d1 ]  [ R f2 ]  [ N d2 ]  [ N c4 ]  [ N x c4 ]  [ e2 + ] , [ K d2 ]  The pawn promotion could become a real threat here.
 [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ d6 ] , [ d3 ]  game evenly poised..
 [ K d6 ]  [ K g1 ]  [ f5 ] , [ K f2 ]  I would have played 37 Re8.
 [ c x d5 ] , [ R e1 ]  i thought he would eventually play this. im probably not the only player accustomed to facing this rook slide over.
 [ N f7 ]  [ e6 ] , [ N d6 + ]  49........... [ N d6 ] - this knight fork wins the bishop on f5. I now move my king to [ d3 ] out of range of any further spite checks from the steed. Black cannot prevent h8/Q next move so he throws in the sponge. Another much needed victory for my team!
 [ g4 ]  [ K b4 ]  [ R x b6 + ]  [ K x a4 ]  [ R b7 ]  [ K a3 ] , [ R d7 ]  Threatening r[ d3 + ] winning the loose Knight on [ e3 ]  [ N c2 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ R c8 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ a4 ]  [ g5 ]  [ K b2 ] , [ N b6 ]  Here i was getting a bit desperate. I decided to try a crazy idea and it turned out to be an amazing idea.
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ] , [ c3 ]  The time control on this game was 20 minutes to each player. I have seen this move in several blitz games but I really do not know what the 'proper' response is. He is offering free pawns for easy development and attacking chances. My own experience suggests that taking the second and third pawn offered is dangerous.
 [ B e6 ]  [ R x e4 ] , [ a5 ]  this move has no hope...
 [ c6 ] , [ O-O ]  What started as an English opening has transposed into the fianchetto variation of the King's Indian. Black's normal KID plan of attacking on the K-side is very difficult against the white fianchetto setup so instead black should look for play on the Q-side in this variation
 [ b5 ]  [ c x b5 ] , [ a x b5 ]  ...and we exchange pawns creating a hole...
 [ K h5 ]  [ R b5 ]  [ R f3 + ]  [ K g2 ] , [ K g4 ]  ? Black tries to throw the win away!
 [ N x f4 ] , [ N d6 + ]  Oh great. He just blunders away another piece.
 [ B x a1 ]  [ R x a1 ]  [ K b7 ]  [ a5 ] , [ R d a8 ]  If white opens the a file he will lose control of it.
 [ h5 ]  [ B x e4 ]  [ f x e4 ] , [ K x e4 ]  Being up a rook for two pawns ( 3) was a more complicated ending than when I was up a bishop for a pawn ( 2) and now I have an even simpler ending where I'm up a simple pawn ( 1) for a simple win.
 [ N f4 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ h4 ]  [ h6 ]  [ N x g6 ]  [ N x g6 ]  [ h5 ] , [ N e7 ]  In the last few moves white has gained some space weakened some light squares on black's king's side and removed the light-squared bishop which was protecting them.
 [ g4 ]  [ R d x c1 ]  [ R x c1 ] , [ R x c1 ]  The smoke of battle has cleared and Holm's material advantage is decisive. "Resigns" would probably be Partos's best alternative but he drags the game out for a bit longer.
 [ N e4 ] , [ Q f3 ]  Threatening [ Q f7 ] checkmate.
 [ B e7 ] , [ O-O ]  Now that his King is safe Najdorf can begin operations.
 [ e4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ B b4 ]  So what is the advantages of french opening corresponding to winawer opening.We will briefly see.
 [ a4 ] , [ a5 ]  ? Loses the exchange but perhaps his bishop is worth more in this position than the rook?
 [ g5 ]  [ h4 ]  [ f6 ] , [ h x g5 ]  25. hxg5!! My best play of the game. Horse sacrifice to lead to mate in 9. I will be truthful and say that I didn't see the exact mate but I knew opening the f-h files would lead to a mate just not exactly how yet.
 [ B d7 ] , [ O-O ]  But black didn't take the bait so I castle kingside and we both continue with our development.
 [ Q g7 + ] , [ K e8 ]  Forced.
 [ N x c5 ]  [ B x c5 ]  [ a x b4 ] , [ B x b4 ]  This way the black pawn is not a threat anymore.
 [ N c4 ]  [ B x h5 ]  [ Q a5 ] , [ B x g6 ]  Black now has a 2-move checkmate ([ Q x a2 ] and Qa1#). But it isn't forced so even though it's black's move black cannot play 22. ... Qxa2??? or he loses instantly to white's 1-move checkmate 23. [ Q x h7 # ]  [ h6 ] , [ g x h6 ]  Black played the only move that postpones his demise and he's still threatening his own 2-move mate.
 [ c4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ d4 ] , [ e x d4 ]  usually a variation Black wants to try: the Nordic gambit...
 [ Q x e7 ] , [ Q f1 + ]  ?? Wow!! What a turn around. I guess my opponent thought O.K. I will still be up a piece after 24. [ K x f1 ] [ d1 = Q + ] 25. [ Q e1 ] Qxe1+. However that is not the case....
 [ Q f3 ]  [ Q d7 ] , [ B d2 ]  15. [ B d2 ] - Fou Lenoir finally emerges and the rooks are connected.
 [ N b6 ] , [ b3 ]  I was clear that Black's plan was [ N c4 ] attacking the Bishop. 15. [ b3 ] stopped this.
 [ f x e6 ]  [ B x e6 ]  [ Q g3 ] , [ h5 ]  I believe this was to have the possibility of playing [ h4 ] though I don't find this move all that attractive if I where black I'd deal with the problem with my [ g7 ] pawn.
 [ d x c5 ] , [ d x c5 ]  Finally the N is away from b6!
 [ Q a6 ] , [ R f d1 ]  The only move and I think you'll agree the most logical one.
 [ R d e1 ] , [ B x h6 ]  Sacrifice for reason
 [ B c4 ]  [ e4 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ O-O ]  A very bad blunder here. If you are under 1500 think about black's next move.
 [ e3 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ h3 ]  Too much simmetry but I can't expect more.
 [ Q x g5 + ]  [ K h7 ] , [ Q x f6 ]  White is up 2 secure pawns and has strong threats of attack. [ f4 ] [ R a e1 ] [ R e3 ] [ R g3 ] [ R f3 ] etc... Student Body Right... all hands on deck.
 [ Q h6 ] , [ Q g4 ]  Now I have an attack on the open file.
 [ f3 ]  [ B e8 ]  [ O-O ]  [ h6 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ g5 ] , [ B h2 ]  Him moving that knight will reveal an attack no my queen. Need to do something about it
 [ B x h6 ]  [ B x d7 ]  [ R a d8 ]  [ B h3 ]  [ g5 ]  [ h x g5 ]  [ B x g5 ]  [ R g1 ]  [ h6 ]  [ Q a4 ]  [ a6 ]  [ Q b3 ] , [ R x d3 ]  This will become a race to see who can destroy the most pawns.
 [ b3 ] , [ N a6 ]  NOW black develops....
 [ Q h5 + ] , [ K e7 ]  Why not 19...g6? 19...[ g6 ] 20.[ Q x h7 ] [ N x f1 ] 21.[ R x f1 ] and there's no doubt about the winner.
 [ Q b6 ] , [ N b3 ]  5. [ N b3 ] (I move the knight out of the way)
 [ N c3 + ] , [ R x c3 ]  Forced or loses the R with check.
 [ K d7 ]  [ N c5 + ]  [ K e8 ]  [ a4 ]  [ b x a4 ]  [ R x a4 ]  [ N g6 ]  [ R x a7 ]  [ h5 ] , [ N e6 ]  Actually with the black king pinned against the wall white must push him into a corner or mate with the knight AND bishop. This is more easily accomplished with the king which probably requires taking out black's knight. But I would ignore the black knight now and focus on getting the king into position.
 [ g x h5 ] , [ R x h5 ]  White's attack is more or less irresistible here.
 [ N c5 ] , [ B x h5 ]  White will now either win a pawn or ramp up pressure on the pinned piece with [ N x h5 ] and Qf3.
 [ Q g4 ] , [ O-O ]  get the rook into this.
 [ K g8 ]  [ R d1 ] , [ R f2 ]  Not a good move but prevents him to move the bishop for a moment.
 [ R x d5 ] , [ N x d5 ]  now is too late fore 22...Qd8?? because of 23.Nef4-Qf8.24.Nxf6+exf6.25.[ Q x h7 # ]  [ R e8 ] , [ N e f4 ]  there is no danger form the black on C file for a while so Karpov brings the other knight to the attack on the king side .
 [ N x d7 ] , [ R x d7 ]  The next few moves involve White checking me in various places with the Queen and me interposing with my rook.
 [ c5 ] , [ c4 ]  Charge
 [ R c8 ] , [ B b6 ]  A classic move! Neutralizes a and b pawns on the spot. Meanwhile the pressure on [ c5 ] also means the instability of the d pawn making a total of four weak pawns.
 [ h4 ]  [ b5 ] , [ h x g5 ]  CAPTURE! Now I'm only 2 points behind.
 [ R h1 h2 ]  [ Q f3 ] , [ Q c5 ]  ...threatening [ R x f2 + ] winning...
 [ e4 ] , [ b5 ]  Not going down so fast
 [ R h e1 ]  [ R e8 ] , [ c3 ]  I really enjoyed what black does here......
 [ R x c1 ]  [ Q x c1 ]  [ Q x d4 + ]  [ K h1 ] , [ Q c5 ]  Attempting to trade queens. I would have brought out the knight instead.
 [ b x c3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ B f4 ]  [ a6 ] , [ R e1 ]  Just completing development from both sides. Alternative variation: 12. [ a4 ] [This gets played much later in the game but is probably beneficial now to stop the b5-pawn advance at least for the time being.]
 [ f x e6 ]  [ N x e6 ] , [ Q a5 ]  Leontxo says [ Q b6 ] could be "the correct one" but not why. The attack on [ b2 ] doesn't seem very promising. But white should lose a tempo in order to save the [ e6 ] knight and it is beyond my ability to say what would happen.
 [ a x b4 ]  [ a x b4 ] , [ g5 ]  The play of the position is clear. Both sides will attempt to break the pawn chain from the base of the enemy's pawn chain by maneuvering minor pieces to help with pawn advances and attacking. It's only a question of who can generate the most activity and break the chain more effectively.
 [ K e7 ] , [ a6 ]  and push
 [ h6 ] , [ N h3 ]  And black has managed to marginalize my steed. White's problems abound now. The DSB is still blocked in there seems to be little going for my kingside attack and I exchanged my best-positioned piece.
 [ R b a8 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ R x a2 ]  [ b4 ]  [ R a a8 ]  [ b x c5 ]  [ Q x c5 ]  [ B d5 ]  [ R a c8 ]  [ Q f3 ]  [ B f6 ]  [ Q h5 ]  [ R d7 ]  [ Q f5 ]  [ R a7 ]  [ B b3 ]  [ B d8 ]  [ R e3 ] , [ Q d4 ]  Bait. If [ R x d4 ] then [ R a1 + ] after white blocks with his rooks it is mate.
 [ a x b4 ] , [ B x b4 ]  Black snatches another pawn.
 [ B h7 ]  [ e4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ f4 ]  [ B b4 ]  [ g5 ]  [ N f d7 ]  [ a3 ]  [ B a5 ]  [ b4 ]  [ B c7 ]  [ b5 ]  [ O-O ]  [ g x h6 ] , [ Q h4 + ]  Rather than recapturing with the pawn and leaving the g column open.
 [ c x d4 ]  [ B c4 ] , [ N c6 ]  Protecting and developing.
 [ e4 ]  [ c6 ]  [ d4 ] , [ d5 ]  Caro-Kann which I am trying to learn.
 [ B x f3 ]  [ Q x f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ d5 ] , [ N d4 ]  Black makes this move centering his knight with tempo however it is very vulnerable to being trapped with c3.
 [ a5 ] , [ f4 ]  The threat is 25 P-[ B5 ] N-[ B1 ] 26 B-[ K2 ] P-[ N3 ] 27 PxP PxP 28 R-K[ B1 ] R-[ R2 ] 29 Q-B6.
 [ d5 ] , [ N c3 ]  So this is the move that I currently favor. Other ideas are [ e x d5 ] (exchange variation) and [ [ e5 ] ] (advance variation). The problem with the [ e x d5 ] is that it often leads into drawish positions. Move [ [ e5 ] ] is in use today but the idea to make black's position narrow doesn't really work. You see it pretty often but black has very good brakethrough opportunities mainly the instant [ c5 ] (Steinitz variation). Then there is [ N d2 ] which leads into various French Tarrash lines. I haven't really played them but this move is fairly popular now and is considered as a good option. But if I've understood correctly this Tarrash variation theory is actually an real art on its own. There are a lot of other options too but the classical (Nc3) is the most popular.
 [ N a4 ]  [ N c8 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ g6 ]  [ Q f3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ h5 ] , [ N x g6 ]  Hm I don't see it. Knight for two pawns? Oh when black moves the rook white can snag the [ h5 ] pawn too. Three pawns. I guess it is a fair exchange then. 20 moves before the first capture.
 [ b x c3 ]  [ d x c3 + ] , [ K c2 ]  I expected [ R d2 + ] [ K b3 ] c2... and I could have resigned (or accept the game with a new black queen on the board trying to give it for a rook...). My queen is in a horrible position.
 [ e6 ] , [ B f1 ]  ? Undevelops
 [ N c7 ]  [ B a1 ]  [ B f6 ] , [ K h2 ]  21. [ K h2 ] (I decide to move my king onto the second rank because my wall of pawns has moved up and it makes the king look less exposed)
 [ K e6 ] , [ R e8 + ]  Why not [ h7 ] instead? It becomes clear that even with a strong middle game my opponent has faulty endgame execution. Only the endgame REALLY matters.
 [ Q e2 ] , [ h5 ]  I feel it is time to open up White's position a bit. Since White has already weakened his King's protection I will weaken it even more.
 [ Q c7 ] , [ B x f6 ]  he tries to double pawn me but im not gonna open up my king to an easy check/checkmate situation
 [ R x f2 ] , [ B x f2 ]  It looks like an unnatural recapture but I wanted to reroute the Bishop to a better diagonal and also remove it from being hit by the pawn in case Black recaptures in the center. Black can't activate his Rook anyway because of dxc5.
 [ g x f6 ] , [ O-O-O ]  White gains control of the only open file which could be significant.
 [ R e7 ]  [ N f5 ]  [ R e4 ] , [ B d6 ]  considered moving the bishop to [ c7 ] to lure the rook out to [ c8 ] then I could make the knight pin the king and rook... but of course there's Black's 2nd rook
 [ h6 ] , [ B g2 ]  preparing castling...
 [ B e7 ]  [ R c2 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ Q b2 ] , [ f6 ]  (JC) Black's play hereabout is weak; it lacks force and there seems to be no well-defined plan of attack. It is true that these are the most difficult positions to handle in a game. In such cases a player must conceive a plan on a large scale which promises chances of success and with it all it must be a plan that can be carried out with the means at his disposal. From the look of the position it seems that Black's best chance would be to mass his forces for an attack against White's center to be followed by a direct attack against the King. He should therefore play ... QR-[ K1 ] threatening ... P-KB4. If White is able to prevent this plan then once Black has fixed some of the White pieces on the K side he should quickly shift his attack to the Q side and open a line for his Rooks which once they enter into action should produce an advantage on account of the great power of the two Bishops.
 [ c x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ] , [ B b1 ]  A move of hidden meaning: Black assumes this to be a cheap shot for mate on [ h7 ] however it forces black to open the a1-[ h8 ] diagonal...
 [ B d5 ] , [ Q h5 ]  Since I am almost completely developed I decide to bring the Q out. Normally I wouldn't threaten mate in one like this because it's generally not a good idea to do something so obvious that could be driven off. This however is the exception because I am giving her yet another test to my opponent. Why? From some of Erika's past games and annotations I see that this is another weakness that needs to be improved. For example in one particular Erika's opponent got a SM against her because she missed the threat. So making moves like this will actually help her. I want black to see the obvious attacks and threats so that she knows what to do in situations like this. This is part of me trying to teach reachforgold to look ahead and start seeing what the opponent. That way you can defend against threats like this.
 [ O-O ]  [ O-O ] , [ d3 ]  The thought was to drive away the knight but [ d4 ] attacking the bishop and defending the [ d5 ] knight is better.
 [ N b4 ]  [ a3 ] , [ g6 ]  Realizing his knight was a major liability Black smartly decides to sacrifice it.
 [ K f7 ]  [ R d7 + ]  [ K f8 ]  [ R a d1 ]  [ R a3 x a2 + ]  [ K g3 ] , [ b4 ]  loses the game
 [ e5 ] , [ K f2 ]  Thematic opening to this point.....
 [ N x c4 ] , [ b x c4 ]  Which my opponent spitefully decides to ruin.
 [ N f3 ] , [ b6 ]  This has worked and I now no longer have the knight on the 5th row. White's knight has gone back to [ f3 ] and I push my pawn to [ b6 ] giving my king a place to safely castle and move out of the centre.
 [ R x e5 ]  [ R x e5 ]  [ B x e5 ] , [ N g4 ]  ??! Black throws several pieces to the wolves at once striving for counterplay with the threat to White's Bishop and the fork at [ e3 ] but it is not enough.
 [ B x c4 ] , [ N e4 ]  Black is trying to simultaneously create an outpost for his knight and open a space to move his pawn to drive away the knight on [ e5 ] ...
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ B b5 ]  Standard Ruy Lopez nowt wrong with that I usually go to [ c4 ] rather than [ b5 ] but thats just personal preference.
 [ O-O ]  [ d3 ]  [ d5 ] , [ B b3 ]  i have to keep this treat on [ f7 ]  [ c3 ] , [ B g4 ]  surprise it' becoming hard for white but it give me a oportunity to keep my white bishop whith [ B c3 ] [ c2 ]  [ B c2 ]  [ d4 ] , [ N d2 ]  i dont take the [ [ d4 ] ] paw because i prefer he do it ... - [ [ d4 ] ] x [ [ c3 ] ] [ b2 ] x [ [ c3 ] ] - ... B[ [ c3 ] ] !
 [ N x b6 ] , [ c x b6 ]  cxb is better then axb in my opinion it makes the 2 pawns less vulnerable.
 [ c6 ]  [ d x c6 ]  [ b x c6 ] , [ N c3 ]  15. [ N c3 ] - after a pawn swap my knight retreats to c3.
 [ d4 ]  [ B g7 ] , [ c4 ]  I wanted to take this into KID lines [ c4 ] gives it more of a [ [ d4 ] ] type feeling. I originally played [ [ d4 ] ] so this is good for me.
 [ b4 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ B x d7 ]  [ Q x d7 ]  [ N b5 ]  [ B a6 ]  [ a4 ] , [ R c7 ]  I also looked at [ R c4 ] here but [ N d6 ] causes problems.
 [ B g7 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ] , [ N c6 ]  5. ... [ d6 ] 6. [ N d5 ] [ N f6 ] 7. Nxf6... Where's the Sicilian Maffia when you need them... Enters the Sicilian Dragon accelerated no less...
 [ Q a4 ]  [ Q b6 ] , [ N e5 ]  Whites speculative attack here is too premature and is just wasting valuable moves.
 [ B f3 ] , [ B c3 ]  When up in material it is not important to make threats. The correct move is maybe castling. Also attacking with 2 pieces against an army spells disaster.
 [ O-O ]  [ N e7 ]  [ N b d2 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ Q x a4 ] , [ c3 ]  Looking for takes I castled [ B d5 ] then takes but of course he could not take which is what happens.
 [ c4 ]  [ K b6 ]  [ R b f1 ] , [ B e4 ]  ! Immovable. White's position is decidedly cramped.
 [ R x f6 ] , [ e5 ]  and [ e5 ] ...
 [ a6 ]  [ B a4 ]  [ Q x b2 ]  [ N c2 ]  [ Q b6 ]  [ B b3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N e3 ]  [ c4 ]  [ N x c4 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ R d1 ]  [ b5 ]  [ N d2 ]  [ Q d7 ]  [ R g1 ]  [ e5 ]  [ R g4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ R g3 ]  [ N h5 ]  [ R g4 ]  [ f5 ]  [ e x f5 ]  [ Q x f5 ]  [ B d5 ]  [ R a7 ]  [ h4 ]  [ Q x d3 ] , [ N c4 ]  Black could save the queen with [ Q c2 ] but PxN also nets a rook. Queen for rook and knight. Eight points for eight.
 [ K g2 ] , [ R g8 ]  I bring the rook out.
 [ Q x f4 ] , [ Q a5 ]  For some reason I decided to play [ K b1 ] here to help defend that pawn. Maybe my second worst move of the game (the worst coming later.) A friend of mine watched me make the movie and actually luaghed out loud... On my score sheet I listed it as Kb1??????? Not only does this not help defend it sets me up to suffer all kinds of crazy tactics without much of an escape route.
 [ K x f5 ] , [ R d3 d5 # ]  
 [ K g1 ]  [ Q x e4 ] , [ R f e1 ]  Black must trade queen for rook. Black's two extra pawns won't prove a match for white's knight.
 [ B d6 ]  [ N g f3 ]  [ O-O ] , [ N e5 ]  Both sides develops their pieces.
 [ N b4 ]  [ R a1 + ]  [ K c2 ] , [ R a2 + ]  Forced. Any queen move loses a whole rook to Rxa1.
 [ a4 ]  [ B c6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ B x e4 ]  [ d x e5 ] , [ d x e5 ]  4 points! All is lost...or is it?
 [ R h7 ]  [ R b2 + ]  [ K g1 ] , [ K g3 ]  Threatening checkmate
 [ K f5 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N d2 + ]  [ K e2 ]  [ N c4 ]  [ K f3 ] , [ N d6 ]  Now White can only hold onto his b-pawn at the price of condemning his Knight to a miserable square.
 [ e2 ] , [ R e1 ]  ?? Much better was [ R h1 ] this doesn't even get the pawn white would still have a hope because of his passed pawn after [ R h1 ] maybe. It has already been said this is my worst game of chess.. From there: [ R h1 ] [ e1 = Q + ] [ R x e1 ] [ B x e1 ] Nbd4! (blocking the d pawn so that the knight on [ e6 ] can block the rook making [ R g8 ] suggested which would then create [ b3 ] and [ N g5 ] to folow with the idea of [ N e7 ] to at least get some compensation) Maybe white can make chances with his passed pawn although his back rank is still weak. From here it is hopelessly lost.
 [ Q x a5 ]  [ Q x a5 ]  [ N x a5 ] , [ R x a5 ]  mate is threatening
 [ N x b3 ]  [ Q x b3 ]  [ c5 ]  [ R x d8 ]  [ R x d8 ]  [ R d1 ]  [ B x f3 ]  [ g x f3 ] , [ Q x h4 ]  23 [ R d1 ] Idea was to compete for the d file control but simply underlined weakness of [ h4 ]  [ R x d8 + ]  [ Q x d8 ] , [ K g2 ]  26 Move into end game with White weak pawn structure a handicap.
 [ Q c5 ] , [ R e1 ]  And I try to put pressure on his K side instead.
 [ B a3 ] , [ B e7 ]  I am not exactly sure why he did not capture my DSB but I will force an exchange with 8.[ B x e7 ] Qxe7. At this point I am almost completely back to normal with only minor cold symptoms.
 [ g6 ]  [ R h8 ]  [ K g5 ]  [ a5 ]  [ b x a5 + ]  [ K x a5 ] , [ N d2 ]  He's coming to help on the far side my Knight can escape...
 [ Q c7 ] , [ O-O ]  White gets his King to safety.
 [ B x c4 ] , [ c5 ]  This move is contrary to my intention of keeping things complicated giving white a chance to trade queens if he wants simplification. But I felt I needed to challenge his center.
 [ B x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ b6 ] , [ N x d4 ]  The game is still about even right now in my opinion.
 [ a3 ]  [ N b c6 ]  [ b3 ]  [ N a5 ] , [ R b1 ]  Paying the price of taking the wrong rook. Now black has all his pieces active...
 [ B c8 + ]  [ N x c8 ]  [ Q x a4 + ]  [ K d8 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N g e7 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ h6 ]  [ B f6 ]  [ R g8 ]  [ O-O-O + ] , [ N d6 ]  Black's only move.
 [ B e7 ]  [ O-O-O ] , [ O-O ]  Now that both sides have castled it's time to start the attack.
 [ h6 ]  [ Q e1 ] , [ Q a5 ]  Deep Blue brings its Queen out to get in a better attacking position. So far black has been on the attack the whole game as white just sits back and creates a strong defense.
 [ N c6 ] , [ e4 ]  my favourite opening
 [ K f7 ] , [ f x e5 + ]  opening up the f file for the rook
 [ N e4 ]  [ B f5 ] , [ N d4 ]  White's pieces are extremely active.
 [ N c4 ] , [ B x c4 ]  This would make more sense if I take with Rook here: 25...[ R x c4 ] 26.e5! and he would get my h-pawn while keeping comfortable position.
 [ K h8 ] , [ c3 ]  Black later claimed that this move was the one losing the game for white but really I don't see any way to save the Knight on d4. I think the position was lost earlier. Maybe 14. [ b3 ] was bad already weakening the support in the center. 14. [ R b1 ] was another option to save the b-pawn.
 [ d5 ] , [ c4 ]  I open with the Queen's Gambit a very popular opening in recent times.
 [ Q x d4 + ] , [ K h1 ]  Practically forced... but now my Bishop will fall as well. I should probably resign...
 [ a6 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ f6 ]  [ B x f8 ] , [ K x f8 ]  So that was all an overly complicated exchange. The two bishops combined with the doubled pawn may give Black an advantage.
 [ B e6 ] , [ N e g5 ]  Putting pressure on the e-file immediately
 [ N f3 ] , [ N c6 ]  Thinking Spanish.
 [ O-O ]  [ N x f2 ]  [ R x f2 ]  [ B x f2 + ]  [ K x f2 ]  [ N d4 ] , [ N x e5 ]  Ever an optimist looking at bxp and then bringing the other knight in to harass. Forgetting one small thing however....
 [ N x e5 ]  [ Q d4 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ b4 ]  [ O-O ] , [ h3 ]  ? White is too far behind in development for these kinds of moves.
 [ e6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ d5 ] , [ N c3 ]  This was Fischer's main choice against the French ... after he gave up playing the King's Indian Attack formation from early in his Chess career.
 [ R e2 ]  [ Q h6 ]  [ h3 ]  [ R e7 e5 ]  [ R b2 ] , [ R g5 ]  a common trap where he attempts to take the H pawn by pinning its defender to my king
 [ B b5 ] , [ R c7 ]  Having changed my plan I should have taken some initiative by playing [ Q [ a4 ] ] taking it away form the weak c column. It is not a good plan but better than the one I choosed. Altro piano fasullo scambiare l'alfiere bianco. Dovevo giocare D[ a4 ] approfittando che non poteva subito fare a6.
 [ R e1 ] , [ b5 ]  6. .... [ b5 ] - now the lsb is driven back.
 [ K h4 ] , [ c6 ]  And the trap is sprung.
 [ B d7 ] , [ Q e2 ]  the computer does not say anything here but considers white loses its 0 50 advantage.
 [ K d7 ] , [ R x f2 ]  and White is now only one material point down - a pawn a rook and two bishops for a queen a knight and a pawn (12 points v 13 points) Now this is where this game starts to get interesting...
 [ B f3 ] , [ N b5 ]  ? attacking the pawn but also releasing it
 [ Q a4 ] , [ B d7 ]  ?? [ c6 ] was advisable.
 [ R d c1 ]  [ B b4 ]  [ R x c8 ] , [ R x c8 ]  Alternative variation: 30... [ Q x c8 ] 31. [ K h2 ] (31. [ Q f2 ] [ Q c4 ] $19) 31... [ B c4 ] 32. [ Q f2 ] [ B x b5 ] 33. [ a x b5 ] [ Q c4 ] $19
 [ B f4 ]  [ a6 ]  [ N x d6 + ]  [ Q x d6 ]  [ B x e5 ] , [ Q x e5 ]  Bloodshed ends here. Probably not good as I traded when behind.
 [ R h5 ] , [ K g7 ]  Planning on [ f6 ]  [ e x d5 ] , [ d4 ]  Transposing straight back into a boring Exchange French position.
 [ b5 ] , [ B b3 ]  6. ... [ b5 ] is the main line continuation of the Closed Defense and white plays along with 7. [ B b3 ] not that there was much else for white to do.
 [ N f8 ]  [ h3 ] , [ K h8 ]  Making room for [ N g8 ] and f5. A weird way to proceed but my opponent is not taking advantage of my passive game.
 [ B x f4 ]  [ e x f4 ]  [ N h5 ] , [ B x b3 ]  Stoping any [ N d4 ] idea's
 [ Q d7 ] , [ Q c4 ]  defending the bishop indirectly preventing the black queen from infiltrating and protecting the a pawn.
 [ K f6 ] , [ R x d7 ]  Black chooses to lose the rook a questionable choice. White pounces while he can.
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ N f6 ]  Following GameDB here
 [ B g6 ] , [ B d1 ]  The LSB is away !
 [ N x b3 ] , [ a x b3 ]  Pawn for Knight
 [ Q c2 ] , [ N d4 ]  Gaining another tempo.
 [ K d6 ] , [ R e8 ]  Again looking for equal or better compensation.
 [ a5 ]  [ N x f6 ]  [ g x f6 ] , [ B h4 ]  22. [ B h4 ] - keeping the [ f6 ] pawn pinned to Freddy's dsb. I bring Henry out to [ e2 ] next move.
 [ Q d7 ]  [ R b7 ]  [ R c7 ]  [ R b b1 ]  [ Q c8 ] , [ B d3 ]  Protecting the pawn on a6. I am not sure if this is the best move here staying solid making black move slowly improving the position. The computer says it is fine though. Mostly I now I was having a bit of a hard time coming up with a plan on where to break through.
 [ B x e8 ] , [ d x e8 = Q + ]  Hey there is my queen!
 [ e4 ]  [ d6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ h3 ]  [ c6 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ N b d7 ]  [ O-O ]  [ Q b6 ]  [ b3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N h4 ]  [ h6 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N f5 ] , [ Q d8 ]  Thrusts and feints.
 [ Q e5 ]  [ Q f6 ] , [ Q c7 ]  The trade of queens would not be beneficial to White at this time. Instead the queen heads for the seventh rank from where it can be a pain in Black's side.
 [ N c5 ] , [ f3 ]  or the more prosaic defensive move..
 [ B x e2 ] , [ N x e2 ]  Not only did I consider taking back with the Q but 13.Qxe2? was almost played. What stopped me from doing that is the fact that my [ d4 ] pawn is hanging. By capturing this way it is protected.
 [ f x e4 ] , [ N x g4 ]  14.n[ x e4 ] wins the exchange however my dark square weaknesses would force me to give the exchange back. Even so I think I would emerge with an advantage. 14.n[ x e4 ] n[ x e4 ] 15. f[ x e4 ] [ b x a1 ] 16.q[ x a1 ] and I don't see how I can stop 17.[ b h6 ] threatening mate. 16...[ [ f6 ] ] loses the pawn and the only way to block the queen on the diagonal is to wait for [ b h6 ] so that I may push my pawn to [ [ f6 ] ] allowing white to capture my rook. I still appear to be OK but I think capturing with the pawn as white did in the game was a lot better for me. Now the knight in being attacked by the bishop. The next move is forced.
 [ B a5 ] , [ Q e2 ]  This is my last preparing move for my attack preceding two beautiful sacrifice that I really enjoyed. Do you see it?
 [ R a b1 ]  [ b6 ]  [ R b5 ] , [ N x e4 ]  Now black eats the e pawn (finally) and threatens the [ c3 ] pawn. White cannot seem to save it. In retrospect black's better move here would have been [ B c4 ] forking the two rooks. I moved too quickly - I had my sights on the e pawn and didn't really consider the alternatives. White's best move now would be 16 [ N x e5 ] claiming a pawn for himself.
 [ R x e2 ]  [ R x e2 ]  [ g3 + ] , [ K g4 ]  Going for the [ h2 ] pawn.
 [ B x d6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ R h e8 ] , [ R d1 ]  White's main goal now is to trade down all the major pieces while maintain his solid pawn lead. The rook move pins the bishop so black can either leave it there or move the king to free up his vital piece.
 [ R h8 ]  [ N g4 ]  [ N x g4 ]  [ f x g4 ] , [ e5 ]  Of course threatening my free pawn. It's isolated. Will I be able to keep it? If I can't black's majority will winn in the long run!
 [ Q f6 ]  [ h x g5 ]  [ h x g5 ]  [ R x e1 ] , [ R x e1 ]  The rooks are exchanged off which does not immediately affect either side but consolidates Black's material advantage.
 [ N c4 ] , [ N e4 ]  A nice little move....
 [ K g5 ] , [ B e3 + ]  mooving the goodbishop back into the attack!
 [ B e3 ]  [ N x e3 ]  [ f x e3 ] , [ Q d6 ]  At this point I am just playing with more pieces than you. Your queen side bishop and knight haven't moved at all. All the pawns you spent time moving are gone. See here that my knight and bishop are attacking the same square on h7. That is the square that needs to be defended. Here you just opened up your queen to be taken after 16.Bxh7+. But the real problem is that I am attacking with 3 pieces and my queen you only have your queen and rook doing the work.
 [ B c3 ]  [ a5 ] , [ O-O ]  gets his king out of the center - access is hard for black on the king side
 [ Q a1 + ] , [ K b3 ]  I think [ K b4 ] would have been better.
 [ N f3 ]  [ N h5 ]  [ d4 ]  [ Q f6 ]  [ N d5 ] , [ Q g6 ]  should have considered e5[ x d4 ]  [ Q x e4 ] , [ Q x h5 + ]  setting up for things to come with 2 hanging nights
 [ c x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ d x c5 ]  [ B x c5 ]  [ e3 ]  [ h5 ]  [ B e2 ] , [ Q h4 ]  The queen was the only piece protecting Pd5. [ N f6 ] might have been better. Black has good control of the center strengthening that is usually a good idea.
 [ B c4 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ e5 ]  Pushing with a pawn..
 [ e3 ]  [ a6 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ c x d4 ] , [ N x c6 ]  You should attempt to avoid moving the same piece repeatedly in the opening! You moved your DSB twice and the K-Knight 3 times only to trade him off. This gives me a nice lead in development.
 [ g5 ]  [ B x f8 ]  [ R x f8 ]  [ N g6 ] , [ N e7 ]  Black is trying to deliberately lose the exchange to try and effect the pawn structure but 30...[ R d8 ] is probably better.
 [ g x f5 ]  [ c4 ] , [ R x a2 ]  I was giving serious thought to [ Q g2 ] resulting in Q-R swap and advancing my pawn... but saw that I didn't have enough time to get there !
 [ Q x f1 ]  [ b x c5 ]  [ Q f4 ]  [ Q x f4 ]  [ B x f4 ] , [ B e6 ]  battling for every pawn
 [ b4 ] , [ R b8 ]  pinning the pawn
 [ Q x e3 ]  [ c6 ]  [ Q x a7 ] , [ R b a8 ]  White cannot save a2...
 [ B d3 ] , [ N c6 ]  Developing with an eye on d4.
 [ b x a6 ]  [ R e b8 ]  [ R b7 ]  [ R x b7 ] , [ a x b7 ]  The Pawn on [ b7 ] will tie down Black´s pieces for a while and give time for re-grouping. Now 22. - [ R x a3 ] could be answered by 23. [ Q b2 ] with a double-threat of [ N b5 ] or promoting the Pawn.
 [ c x b5 ]  [ a x b5 ] , [ B x b5 ]  Now I've managed to sneak a pawn.
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ c3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ] , [ c x d4 ]  By attacking when I wanted him to he allowed me to put my pawns in optimal place. The experts say this is a good spot to be in with 2 central pawns guarding [ c5 ] through f5.
 [ Q x g1 + ] , [ K x g1 ]  All according to plan. White's and back's pawns are at a standstill Black's bishop cannot steal any of white's pawns for the bishop only runs on black squares and all the white pawns are on white spaces so now it's time to get the king and the rook involved.
 [ Q g3 ]  [ B a6 ] , [ N c3 ]  If I had maintained the pawn on [ c3 ] black would've been stifled.
 [ N b d7 ] , [ Q d2 ]  I really want to move [ e4 ] but the bishop on [ g4 ] was a problem
 [ R c b1 ]  [ R f g8 ]  [ R f2 ]  [ R a7 ]  [ R b6 ]  [ Q e8 ]  [ R x a6 ] , [ R b7 ]  White has won a pawn. I (black) was still hopeful of a positive result.
 [ O-O ] , [ Q b3 ]  Attacking the knight. The queen does often come to this square in English positions If I were white I might have started thinking about which pawn advance I wanted to make but this move isn't bad and I'm not sure what I would do myself so I'm not going to be overly critical of this move the only potential down side being that if white choses to make advances on the queenside then this move may slow it down a little
 [ O-O ] , [ e5 ]  and the attack begins... i always look to play [ e5 ] as early as possible especially if i have succeded in getting my rook onto the d file before black has castled...
 [ K f1 ]  [ B h3 + ]  [ K g1 ] , [ K f3 ]  Note it is essential that once you get the King on the lowest ring you are to push him into a corner with the color of your bishop. My bishop is a light bishop so that the only corner I can mate him is the white corner.
 [ K e6 ]  [ d5 + ]  [ K d6 ] , [ K g3 ]  ...and his king lines up my pawn and knight...
 [ N e2 ] , [ N d7 ]  Pawn on [ e5 ] was big pain bigger then help of [ e4 ] pawn.
 [ R e7 ] , [ R a e1 ]  played with two intentions to prevent knight attack on c pawn and having a loss later and also making the center strong
 [ B c2 ] , [ R a3 ]  Preparing an advance to b3.
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ f5 ]  ?! The key move of the Latvian Gambit. Black gives up a pawn (and generally more) in exchange for open lines and a developmental advantage.
 [ Q x f4 + ]  [ Q e3 ]  [ Q g4 ]  [ R d g1 ]  [ Q h4 ]  [ R g3 ]  [ e5 ]  [ R h3 ]  [ Q g4 ]  [ R g1 ]  [ R d5 d1 + ]  [ R x d1 ]  [ Q x d1 + ]  [ K b2 ]  [ h5 ]  [ R g3 ]  [ Q h1 ]  [ Q f2 ] , [ h4 ]  It can only Been a Desperate shortage of time that prevented karpov's resignation at this point.
 [ c5 ]  [ a x b4 ] , [ c x b4 ]  ....with your only compensation being a pawn.
 [ Q d3 ] , [ N b4 ]  This moves devastates white since if 16.[ Q d1 ] BxN 17.[ R c1 ] BxR 18.QxR ....;or 16.[ Q [ b5 ] ] BxN 17.[ R a c1 ] (Rec1) [ a6 ] 18.[ Q a4 ] [ b5 ] 19.[ Q a3 ] BxR 20.RxB NxPc!
 [ h3 ]  [ b5 ]  [ Q d2 ] , [ Q h4 ]  White's queen wants to play to [ g5 ] but black doesn't want her there. This move keeps the white queen at bay and adds more pressure on white's castle.
 [ B x f5 ]  [ e x f5 ] , [ N f6 ]  18. ....... [ N f6 ] - this knight develops at last.
 [ K h3 ]  [ a6 ]  [ K g4 ]  [ a7 ]  [ R a8 ]  [ R f7 ]  [ b4 ]  [ R b7 ]  [ b3 ]  [ c6 ]  [ b2 ] , [ c7 ]  Ratkop pulls a rabbit out of his hat! Well done.
 [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B b5 + ]  [ B d7 ]  [ B x d7 + ] , [ Q x d7 ]  5. ...... [ Q x d7 ] - after this plethora of exchanges I find myself a clear pawn up on the next move. William eschews playing into The Annotation Project which deals with a queen sac for two pieces. The player with the queen would find himself suffering from passivitis and must work out how to escape from the bind. However this does not happen in this game.
 [ d x e6 ]  [ f x e6 ] , [ e5 ]  My Pawn's a bit vulnerable on [ e5 ] I'm hoping that I will be able to make some use of it's cramping effect before it is eventually taken.
 [ B x f6 ]  [ g x f6 ] , [ N e x c5 ]  I chose this knight to make the capture as 20. N[ a x c5 ] [ f5 ] is awkward for White to meet. Now White is threatening 21. [ B f3 + ] [ K d6 ] ([ K b5 ] 22. [ c4 + ] [ K a5 ] 23. b4#) 22. [ N x b7 + ] winning the queen.
 [ Q f7 ]  [ d4 ]  [ Q c4 ]  [ B b2 ]  [ Q e2 ] , [ Q f2 ]  This move should lose since dontru has [ B x h2 ] check. Luckily he rewarded my bad move with one of his own.
 [ N b3 ] , [ d4 ]  One more pawn to go.
 [ h x g6 ] , [ R f1 ]  The f-file is my only source of counterplay but thanks to my hasty pawn exchange Black has a good rebuke to my plan.
 [ e5 ]  [ d3 ] , [ d5 ]  Already I am worried about my commitment to a large pawn center...
 [ B e7 ]  [ g3 ] , [ O-O ]  My own development is now complete. I have a slight edge in space so my objective will be to try and keep White cramped.
 [ O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ b6 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ a6 ]  [ h3 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ N d7 ] , [ B h6 ]  Obviously going quickly for a lot of pressure.
 [ R c4 ] , [ R f5 ]  ...allowing me to play this.
 [ B b7 ] , [ Q d3 ]  Provoking yet another Black weakening.
 [ K c2 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ R f5 ] , [ N f d7 ]  Knight guard!
 [ B x d4 ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ N f5 ]  [ g6 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ R h8 h3 + ]  [ K e2 ] , [ B c4 + ]  Now that the knight is removed it is safe to play my fine skewer tactic.
 [ Q e3 ]  [ B c8 ]  [ K f1 ]  [ Q e8 ] , [ B c2 ]  [ K e2 ] was better centralising whites king.
 [ g4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ g x f3 ]  [ e x f6 ] , [ f x g2 ]  I'm not sure why he decided to take [ g2 ] before qxf6.
 [ Q e2 ] , [ N d4 ]  didnt think he was going to push it but the next few moves are obv
 [ K b5 ] , [ N d5 ]  Another attempt but...
 [ B e5 ]  [ B x e5 ]  [ d x e5 ] , [ N f3 ]  Continuing with her development and threatening my [ e5 ] pawn.
 [ O-O ] , [ Q b6 ]  I pin the pawn on [ d4 ] "removing" a defender of the knight. I also put some pressure on b7.
 [ B f5 + ]  [ K h5 ]  [ B x e4 ]  [ K h4 ]  [ B g2 ]  [ K g3 ]  [ R f3 + ]  [ K g4 ]  [ a5 ]  [ K h4 ]  [ a6 ]  [ g4 ] , [ R f8 ]  I like [ R f7 ] better it distracts black from the fact the king is about to be pinned against the rook.
 [ d x c4 ]  [ R f3 ]  [ N g4 ]  [ B d2 ]  [ Q a7 ]  [ K h1 ]  [ R a3 ]  [ h3 ] , [ e4 ]  I can take the pawn and black will take the a pawn -- and I dont see anything good
 [ g x f5 ] , [ N g3 ]  Gatting my knight out of its potential imprisonment
 [ B g4 + ]  [ K g3 ]  [ h5 ] , [ N x c5 ]  he took my bishop my then it's check again..
 [ g3 ]  [ B h6 ] , [ f4 ]  The only singular move for White that would let me keep my knight. 17. Rc1/c3/[ b1 ] would allow ...B[ x N d2 ] which I didn't want to exchange or allows Black to push the d-pawn with an attack. 17. [ B b5 ] could transition into the line I had in mind on the next move but still allows 17...BxNd2.
 [ R b8 + ]  [ K c7 ]  [ R b7 + ] , [ K c6 ]  I suspect Petrosian saw White's reply but wanted to be put out of his misery. 35... K-[ B1 ] 36 RxBP RxP ch 37 KxP is futile.
 [ a6 ]  [ e5 ]  [ Q e7 ]  [ O-O ]  [ b5 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ R f e1 ]  [ B d5 ]  [ B b1 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ h3 ]  [ R a c8 ]  [ N h2 ]  [ Q g5 ]  [ N g4 ]  [ h5 ] , [ N e3 ]  For the longest time I was looking at [ Q d3 ]  [ N e7 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ Q e4 ]  [ g6 ]  [ R d3 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ R g3 ] , [ N x c3 ]  ?
 [ Q e7 ]  [ R e1 ] , [ O-O-O ]  When the two players castle on opposite sides this always makes for a sharp game. This is probably because you can easily use pawns to help attack the enemy king's position if those pawns aren't shielding your king at the same time!
 [ Q a4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ Q a3 ]  [ R c8 ]  [ B b5 ] , [ a6 ]  Before developing the knight Black wants to get rid of the possibility of Ba6.
 [ R h7 ]  [ N d1 ] , [ O-O-O ]  Black's king castles to safety but leaves the [ f7 ] pawn with one less support.
 [ K x h7 ] , [ Q f3 ]  waste of tempo If at all Q had to be played better was [ Q h5 ] . Black now takes the initiative with
 [ R e1 ] , [ N d4 ]  The rook moves from frying pan to fire and Black's developed pieces are keen to spring into action and gang up on the knight.
 [ N e7 + ] , [ K f8 ]  Going after the N. In this position I most likely would've played 35...[ K h8 ] only because Jack Stockel told me that in general bringing the monarch to the corner is part of K safety. I recently learned however that this is not always true. In fact despite what I said or the response I like black's his intentions better because black attempts to gain tempo in the process.
 [ N g6 + ]  [ K g7 ] , [ R c3 c7 + ]  white has a few spite threats but i
 [ d3 ] , [ N d4 ]  Why not? [ N c3 ] and [ e4 ] have made this square an important one for black to have since there are no pawns that can immediately chase off pieces.
 [ K h8 ]  [ f5 ]  [ b5 ] , [ h4 ]  The Pawns proceed onward against the denuded K-side. Marco can only look on helplessly.
 [ R b3 ] , [ K c2 ]  This is where I realize white is in trouble. I want to advance the a-pawn and promote him but my rook is in the way. How I wish that rook were on [ a2 ] right now. White cannot force a promotion on the kingside with the pawn majority because black's king is over there. In fact if I'm not careful that king could destroy white's pawns if allowed to - fortunately white's rook dominates the 5th rank shutting out the black king. White's king cannot run to the support of the kingside because if he makes one move away from [ b2 ] he let's black play R[ b2 ] followed by [ R x g2 ] and [ R x h2 ] and then he'll have no kingside to support. In fact I worried that black might be able to play for a 3-move-repeat draw by bouncing back and forth between [ b3 ] and e3. Up by two pawns and I'm faced with a draw?
 [ R f2 + ]  [ K d1 ]  [ Q x b3 + ]  [ K c1 ] , [ d3 ]  Pins the knight. Black's queen is not as active as she would like but White has more problems with the mobility of several pieces.
 [ Q c6 ]  [ Q d4 ] , [ b6 ]  pointless. better is to get his pieces out safely.
 [ N c6 ] , [ d5 ]  Not sure about that last move as it opens the diagonal up for my bishop
 [ d4 ] , [ N x f3 + ]  I was so relieved that my opponent missed this that I immediately traded off that knight hardly thing about my move.
 [ K c4 ]  [ Q a4 + ]  [ K d5 ]  [ R b5 + ]  [ K c6 ]  [ Q a6 + ]  [ K d7 ]  [ R b7 + ]  [ K c8 ] , [ Q a8 # ]  What a Game! Thank you for reading! Please rate and comment.
 [ B x a3 ]  [ N x a3 ]  [ O-O ] , [ c5 ]  Mistake white closed the situation with no advantage for him [ c x d5 ] was far better and then he could attack through his half-open c file!
 [ d4 ] , [ N f6 ]  White to play.
 [ c4 ]  [ h4 ]  [ d3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ h3 ]  [ g5 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ a5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ c6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ g4 ]  [ N d2 ]  [ g3 ]  [ Q e2 ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ B x d4 ] , [ b6 ]  White has nice development. Black enjoys playing with his pawns--not a single back row piece has been played yet.
 [ N f4 ]  [ Q h4 ]  [ N e d5 ] , [ N g5 ]  Once again a nice little combination by Black to gain space; White hoping Black will overlook the obvious 19.[ Q x h7 # ]  [ N f3 ] , [ Q x h4 ]  A good move trading a under developed piece for a developed piece.... I was disappointed at this point while Black was solidly gaining space while conservatively nursing his two pawn advantage.
 [ N d6 ] , [ B d7 ]  There are times I love this game.
 [ K e2 ] , [ Q b2 + ]  decide to set myself up for a retreat downwards - my opponent could actually force a stalemate here but he's higher rated and thinks his attack has enough punch but I can't find a win here yet
 [ R x c4 ]  [ g5 ]  [ K f1 ]  [ K g6 ]  [ K e2 ]  [ f6 ]  [ f4 ]  [ N e7 ]  [ f x g5 ]  [ f x g5 ]  [ K f3 ]  [ N f5 ]  [ R b4 ]  [ K h5 ]  [ R b6 ]  [ N d4 + ]  [ K e3 ]  [ N f5 + ]  [ K e4 ]  [ N g3 + ]  [ K e5 ]  [ N e2 ]  [ R b5 ]  [ K g6 ] , [ R b6 + ]  Of course my king has to stay with the pawns - even if I find myself in a mating net!
 [ Q c6 ] , [ N h7 ]  Bishop exchange would have made less sense.
 [ N d8 + ] , [ K g8 ]  The only move. [ K e8 ] doesn't work now because there is no escape through [ d7 ] anymore.
 [ R c c8 ]  [ R h5 ] , [ f6 ]  [ R g8 ] is better. with the move that black played the 7th row is very weak. black resigned due to [ R h7 + ] foloowed by [ N x d6 + ] or simply taking the [ b7 ] pawn. nevertheless there was clearly an advantsge to white even if black played Rg8: 30... [ R g8 ] 31. [ N [ a5 ] ] [ B a8 ] 32. [ N b3 ] B[ b7 ] 33. [ N d2 ] [ R a8 ] 34. [ N f3 ] [ f6 ] 35. [ R a h1 ] [ B c8 ] 36. [ K g3 ] [ a5 ] 37. [ R h7 + ] [ R f7 ] 38. [ R x f7 + ] [ K x f7 ] 39. [ R h7 + ] [ K e8 ] 40. [ N d2 ] [ a4 ] 41. [ N c4 ] +-.
 [ d x c5 ] , [ h3 ]  Winning the piece back
 [ O-O ] , [ N a6 ]  10. .....Na6?! - Ion stated that "This would have been better a move earlier too. Now the knight has nowhere to go after 11. a3. Hmm Ion what about Nc7? Although it seems that the knight may not be able to go anywhere significant after that on [ c7 ] it does prepare an advance of the black a and b pawns and the possibility of undermining the queenside pawn chain by playing an eventual b5.
 [ K e7 ]  [ K c4 ]  [ R h2 ]  [ a4 ]  [ R b2 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ R c2 + ]  [ K d3 ]  [ R c5 ]  [ B f5 ] , [ K f6 ]  and White gave up. It's a hopeless position for him even though there are no obvious immediate threats from Black.
 [ Q b6 ]  [ B d4 ] , [ Q d6 ]  ?? And he gives me another chance. This time I take it.
 [ B e3 ] , [ g5 ]  All of Black's minor pieces are "bad."
 [ c4 ] , [ e5 ]  Classical English is one of the save Openings of the World. But its tricky.
 [ K h6 ]  [ b x c5 ]  [ Q d6 + ] , [ Q b6 ]  white resigend... thanks mk for this very nice game. I studied a lot!
 [ K d6 ] , [ R h7 ]  This position has also reppeated itself three times.
 [ B g4 ] , [ B f1 ]  The strongest continuation says Fritz 10!!
 [ R f7 f5 ]  [ K h1 ]  [ B f7 ]  [ Q g4 ]  [ h5 ] , [ N x g5 + ]  Forced sacrifice
 [ B e7 ] , [ Q e2 ]  I looked for the knight to jump to [ e5 ]  [ f4 ]  [ B x e5 ]  [ Q x e5 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ Q c3 ]  [ R c8 ] , [ N a3 ]  I think the natural [ N d2 ] was better
 [ B g7 ] , [ c3 ]  I'm not in a hurry for e4. I should but I like to play very solidly against the black's dsb.
 [ R a d8 ] , [ f x e6 ]  Questionable move in an attempt to weaken the control of the mid-field.
 [ c3 ]  [ f6 ] , [ K d2 ]  Now the genius (or flop) sequence:
 [ R x c6 ] , [ B a4 ]  Harassing my rook but it only allows me to setup the final combination.
 [ B g7 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ O-O ]  Aiming to get the Black King to safety before he commences the dismantling of the 3 Stooges taking centre stage.
 [ B a3 ] , [ B x b5 ]  I'm kind of an impatient guy and don't like standstills.
 [ R a b1 ] , [ N c6 ]  I am out of ideas so I'm toying with [ N d4 ] to invite white to trade off his bishop pair.
 [ R x e6 + ]  [ K d7 ] , [ R a e1 ]  Allowing [ R x h2 ] .
 [ R f1 + ]  [ K h2 ]  [ B g1 + ]  [ K g3 ]  [ R g8 + ]  [ K h4 ]  [ B f2 + ]  [ g3 ] , [ B x g3 # ]  
 [ a4 ] , [ e5 ]  Same players different colors. Interesting opening by my opponent but I stick with my favored tactic.
 [ f5 ] , [ d4 ]  maybe the first real mistake closing up the position will probably only help white.
 [ R a3 ]  [ h6 ]  [ h3 ]  [ g5 ]  [ a5 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ B c1 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ N d2 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ N c4 ]  [ N x c4 ]  [ B x c4 ]  [ g4 ]  [ h x g4 ]  [ N x g4 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ B d2 ]  [ b5 ]  [ a x b6 ]  [ e ]  [ p ]  [ Q x b6 ]  [ N a4 ] , [ Q c7 ]  I have to be very honest; Black is having trouble keeping things together; [ f4 ] is already very worrying...
 [ K b4 ]  [ K c6 ]  [ K c4 ]  [ K d6 ]  [ K d4 ] , [ K e6 ]  38. [ K e6 ] - Henry tries to get over to the kingside as quickly as possible but his opposite number will pip him at the post!
 [ Q h4 ]  [ R f4 ]  [ B e6 + ]  [ K g7 ] , [ Q h3 ]  Alternative variation: 43. [ B g4 ] [ Q f3 + ] 44. [ B x f3 ] [ R x h4 + ] 45. [ K g2 ] [ e x f3 + ] 46. [ K x f3 ]  [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ c4 ] , [ e6 ]  Queen's Gambit Decline: Orthodox
 [ c3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ c x d4 ] , [ c x d4 ]  8. [ c x d4 ] - this pawn exchange is quite common in the Advanced French.
 [ R f e8 ] , [ R e1 ]  you are losing the game over this pin
 [ d5 ]  [ N b4 ]  [ a3 ] , [ N a6 ]  Without support from the queen the knight is now pushed back completely to the edge of the board without great prospects.
 [ K h7 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ f5 ] , [ B f7 ]  A last-ditch attempt.
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ e6 ] , [ N c3 ]  Probably expecting a benoni
 [ Q f3 ]  [ Q x d4 ]  [ f6 ]  [ N e2 ]  [ b5 ]  [ B c1 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ N g3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ R b3 ]  [ Q g4 ]  [ h3 ]  [ Q h4 ]  [ Q b6 ]  [ R a b8 ]  [ Q x e6 + ]  [ K h8 ] , [ Q g4 ]  Trading off queens
 [ f4 ] , [ f5 ]  symmetrical
 [ K g3 ]  [ R b2 ] , [ a7 ]  ...this move gives it all away. Forced mate in 4...I didn't even see it until the checkmating move.
 [ Q a5 + ] , [ c3 ]  [ B d2 ] and [ Q d2 ] all amount to the same thing. The knight is lost.
 [ N d4 ] , [ N b4 ]  If 19. P[ x b4 ] then 19. ... [ B x d4 ] and 20. ... Q[ x b4 ] and black has gained a pawn. Meanwhile I threaten the undefended bishop at [ d3 ] and a nice little fork at [ c2 ] (puts three pieces on White's pinned knight on d4).
 [ N g5 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ K b8 ]  [ f4 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ Q x f7 ]  [ B x g4 ]  [ h x g4 ]  [ R g h8 + ]  [ K g1 ] , [ R d c8 ]  Now THAT seems like a questionable move.
 [ R h1 ]  [ R h6 ] , [ h4 ]  I don't know why Carlsen played this since his h pawn didn't seem attacked. At first I thought that it was to get a passed pawn with 25.hxg5??. And as with Erika's annotation combined with ION's comment I figured out that this unplayable because of 25....Rxh1.
 [ K d2 ] , [ N d3 ]  Had to put it back.
 [ K c7 ]  [ R g3 ]  [ R h7 ]  [ R g8 ]  [ a5 ] , [ f5 ]  This was my plan. My Q wil leave his post but only when it would be too late... (or so I thought!)
 [ B x d6 ]  [ c x d6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ b5 ]  [ a3 ]  [ B e4 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ R x e4 ]  [ R d1 ]  [ R x g4 + ]  [ K f1 ]  [ R h1 + ]  [ K e2 ]  [ R e4 + ]  [ K f3 ]  [ R x d1 ]  [ K x e4 ]  [ R d2 ]  [ K e3 ]  [ R x b2 ]  [ R x d6 ] , [ R b3 + ]  White resigns
 [ R x a4 ] , [ h4 + ]  Fischer: I had analyzed mainly 48 P-[ B4 ] ch but Botvinnik's line is best.
 [ e5 ] , [ N f3 ]  Develops the knight and attacks [ e5 ]  [ B b4 + ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B x c3 + ]  [ b x c3 ] , [ Q e7 ]  Probably did that to defend [ e5 ]  [ O-O ]  [ d x e4 ] , [ d x e4 ]  I realized q[ e7 ] might have also been to get the queen off the D-file to prevent a queen swap after the pawn trade.
 [ b x c3 ]  [ b x c3 ]  [ R x c3 ]  [ Q x e7 + ]  [ K x e7 ] , [ g8 = Q ]  White is ahead now queen vs. rook+pawn but now black has the most active advanced pawn. For now.
 [ g3 ]  [ f5 ]  [ Q e2 ]  [ f x e4 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ Q g6 ] , [ O-O-O ]  White take opportunity to connect the rook and secure the open d file.
 [ Q f6 ] , [ N f3 ]  Now it looks like black feels like attacking. At least his queen move unlike mine actually makes an attack without leaving any pieces hanging. I play the obvious defense for the threatened [ d4 ] pawn.
 [ K x e7 ]  [ R f e1 ]  [ a x b5 ]  [ e x d4 + ]  [ K d6 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N h6 ]  [ R e3 ]  [ N g4 ]  [ R x c3 ]  [ R b6 ]  [ R a1 ]  [ K c5 ]  [ a4 ] , [ b4 ]  I had to really think throughout the whole entire game because this is a really good player. I can't afford to make any mistakes.
 [ N f6 ]  [ N d2 ]  [ K g7 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ K f8 ]  [ N x f6 ]  [ e x f6 ] , [ Q x f6 + ]  Perhaps a blindfold and a cigarette? No need to worry about the health risks it'll all be over soon enough.
 [ e x d5 ] , [ N x d5 ]  equal centre but not for too long
 [ Q f5 ]  [ R g5 ]  [ Q h7 ] , [ K f1 ]  Forced
 [ K g7 ]  [ R d2 ]  [ K f6 ] , [ R e2 ]  And now he also cuts off the black king.
 [ N x d5 ] , [ K h3 ]  probably gone wrong with rook move previously as king now moves into it's path but moving king up to try and reach [ h1 ] or at least [ h2 ] to allow rook to come up. feel at the moment this is all in vain and a little late but can't see another option
 [ K c6 ] , [ K b2 ]  Now ill get my king into the action
 [ N d4 ] , [ Q d1 ]  Back in fact to the starting square proving what a silly move [ Q g5 ] was.
 [ d5 ]  [ R a b1 ] , [ R h8 ]  this doesn't accomplish much the bishop just pulls back to a defendable square. And the rook can't do much after.
 [ K b3 ] , [ Q b6 + ]  My king is pushed up against the side.
 [ O-O ] , [ B d2 ]  9.[ b3 ] followed by 10.[ B b2 ] seems like a better way to position the locked in bishop. At some uture time White then may be able to free it when exchanges occur on e5.
 [ Q e8 ]  [ Q h8 + ] , [ K f7 ]  Again I have to play very strong to make my attack successful.
 [ B e2 ]  [ B e6 ] , [ Q c1 ]  Somehow without me realizing it actually happening I've been confined completely to passivity.
 [ N e5 ] , [ N x e5 ]  The exchange of knight draws the DSB out of it's protective cave and into a less secure environment. On [ e5 ] black will have to watch out for f2-[ f4 ] with tempo
 [ g x h4 ]  [ g x h4 ]  [ R e8 + ]  [ K f2 ]  [ R x e1 ]  [ K x e1 ]  [ K e5 ]  [ N e2 ]  [ B x e2 ]  [ K x e2 ] , [ K f4 ]  Even though White has an outside passed Pawn Black wins because of superior King position.
 [ K e1 ]  [ R x f1 + ] , [ K x f1 ]  I think [ B x f1 ] would have been better
 [ c x b6 ]  [ f x e4 ]  [ R d4 ]  [ f3 ]  [ R x b4 ]  [ R d1 + ]  [ R d4 ]  [ R b1 ]  [ b5 ]  [ K g3 ]  [ b4 ]  [ R b2 ]  [ a5 ]  [ K g4 ]  [ R d3 ]  [ K f5 ]  [ R x f3 + ] , [ K x e5 ]  a dangerous decision from Black...
 [ h5 ]  [ K e6 ]  [ h4 ]  [ R h5 ]  [ R c3 ]  [ R x h4 ]  [ R x e3 + ]  [ K d5 ]  [ R c8 ]  [ f5 ]  [ c3 ]  [ K d4 ] , [ R c e8 ]  At this point the game is basically over. White played an extremely poor mid and late game. He allowed joeyjp to pin his bishop against his rook. This caused both his bishop to be blocked by his own pawns and his rook to be blocked by his bishop. Joeyjp then had the opportunity to develop his pieces and take advantage of white's mistake. Good job joeyjp! Good win! Hope everybody enjoyed this!
 [ c5 ] , [ e5 ]  11. [ d x e5 ] would mess up my pawn-structure while awaiting 11. ? [ e x d4 ] 12. [ e x d4 ] [ e3 ] would bring me in troubles.. Let's develop my bishop to [ e2 ] (only field available since 11. [ B b5 ] would straighten black's pawn-diagonal) to prepare the castling..
 [ e5 ] , [ a3 ]  ptitroque: Hmmm hmm It seems that they plan to attack our queenside... I consider 12... [ Q c7 ] : completing our developpement by joining our rooks and protecting our DSB in cas if they trade the central pawns. 12... [ [ e4 ] ] seems also playable more aggressive. They'll have to respond energically if they want to avoid 13... e3. which would put them in troubles. a_random_guy: Another option 12...[ [ a4 ] ] to slow down white's advance on the queenside. ptitroque: @ a random guy 12... [ [ a4 ] ] ? Do you mean 12... [ a6 ] or 12... [ [ a5 ] ] What about if white answer 13. [ [ e4 ] ] ? I suppose that both could be played a_random_guy: Oops I meant 12...[ [ a5 ] ] yeah. roneshet: d4? Taking more controll over the center of the board
 [ K c8 ]  [ R a8 + ]  [ N b8 ]  [ B a7 ] , [ K d8 ]  About the only option for black to continue the game.
 [ Q x d1 + ]  [ K x d1 ] , [ N c6 ]  [ B x c4 ] [ N x e5 ] seems pretty equal to me but White further overextended his position trying to hold the e5-pawn which is a big mistake especially since he has a misplaced king and I will get a huge lead in development
 [ B f6 ] , [ N x d6 + ]  with the pawn moved out bishop can't do as much damage. I decided getting a knight off the table was a better move.
 [ O-O + ]  [ K e6 ]  [ R a e1 ] , [ R h f8 ]  Now I wanna exchange cause I'm UP.
 [ e6 ] , [ e3 ]  I won't force e4... still. I am happy with [ e3 ] and c3.
 [ h3 ]  [ B h5 ]  [ c4 ]  [ B x f3 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ B x g2 ]  [ B x g7 ]  [ B x f1 ]  [ B x f8 ]  [ B x h3 ]  [ B x d6 ] , [ Q x d6 ]  The position in material quite equal but my king is raped and I cannot fight against the black king for winning time. - It was a very-very blundered game of me - but the opponent had good eye to get the chance what I gave. Gratulations anyway!!!
 [ g4 ] , [ R g3 ]  The bind is getting tighter.
 [ R x e1 ]  [ R x e1 + ] , [ K f2 ]  I thought about 47...[ R c1 ] but that seemed to take the Rook out of the game.
 [ R x b4 ] , [ c3 ]  And after the fork Arnett just went back to his previous idea.
 [ B b7 ] , [ h4 ]  The thematic move! Aronian style.:-) The positon is absolutely malicious because now only 10. ... [ h6 ] would have been enough to prevent black from a tactical disaster.
 [ B d3 ]  [ K e3 ]  [ B c2 ]  [ K f4 ] , [ d5 ]  38. ........ [ d5 ] - a pawn move. Dmaestro has no further safe pawn moves so it looks as though we may have to play out the 50 move rule.
 [ N f7 + ]  [ K g7 ]  [ N x d6 ]  [ R x a2 ] , [ N e4 ]  is this a draw position ? if you have any idea tell me about it
 [ B x c6 ]  [ N x c6 ] , [ R x d7 + ]  That was a nice sequence by White to gain a Pawn.
 [ Q d2 ] , [ c x d4 ]  I am at a loss for finding this opening anywhere. I'm down to Queen's Pawn Game or Closed Game being my best options. So from here I'm just winging it. White bumped his queen up to [ d2 ] let's make her move twice and commit herself to the center where I can pick on her a little.
 [ B d7 ] , [ N d c4 ]  Waiting development move. Found N[ x B d7 ] is not satisfying.
 [ e4 ] , [ g6 ]  We've played so many openings I often don't have a firm plan. Here I am simply intending to quickly castle.
 [ R x b8 ]  [ R x b8 ]  [ K x b8 ] , [ g x f4 ]  41. [ g x f4 ] - I now remove one of Bob's pawns there are still three black pawns on the board however and I am really worried about the a pawn especially as Henry is on the wrong side of the board.
 [ c x d4 ] , [ Q x d4 ]  But I was surprised to see the computer capture with the Queen (especially at this level) One thing you should not do is bring the Queen out early but what's important is what you see from the runners (especially tactical-abyss). What it shows is that they can deviate from the guidelines and get away with it but the walker (lower rated players ought to not deviate which is why it's about knowing their principles.)
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ B c4 ]  This is my favorite opening to play. 3. [ B c4 ] puts pressure on [ f7 ] pawn which only the king defends. I also play this when black does 2... [ N c6 ] just to be different and not do the Ruy Lopez that everyone expects when I reach for the bishop.
 [ d x c6 ]  [ e ]  [ p ] , [ Q c7 ]  Now that the c pawn is passed Black blocks it with his queen
 [ N d7 ] , [ R a5 ]  very ambitious; better Ra1...
 [ a4 ] , [ b x a4 ]  White tries in vain to break up the [ d3 ] bishop outpost but only succeeds in granting black a passed pawn (hint hint the winning move will come from that passed pawn!)
 [ f x e6 ]  [ f x e6 ] , [ N g5 ]  ! The Black kingside is under huge pressure and White is already winning either the [ h7 ] pawn or the [ e6 ] pawn.
 [ N e6 ] , [ R x e6 ]  ! [ B x d6 ] was also possible but I like the hidden threat of a revealed check - possible from this move.
 [ N c3 ]  [ b6 ]  [ N b5 ] , [ B b8 ]  The bishop and pawn were forked only one move saves them both.
 [ Q e7 ] , [ R a1 ]  Black moves his queen to [ e6 ] and is attacking the rook which retreats to a1.
 [ Q x e4 + ]  [ K a1 ]  [ Q e2 ] , [ Q x e2 ]  This time blk is successful in removing the Qs
 [ N e4 ] , [ g4 + ]  Alternative variation: 25... [ f6 ] $5 $16
 [ K e5 ]  [ K e3 ]  [ f4 + ]  [ K f3 ]  [ K f5 ] , [ K f2 ]  48. [ K f2 ] - again the white king is being forced backwards.
 [ c5 ]  [ f4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ N g5 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ Q x g4 ]  [ N x g4 ]  [ B x f7 + ]  [ K d7 ]  [ B e6 + ]  [ K c6 ]  [ B x g4 ] , [ Q e8 ]  The first diversion from my game against untateve in which 9... [ e6 ] was played. That is also the move I have encountered more often. This alternative prevents a knight incursion on [ f7 ] but has the disadvantage of further delaying the development of Black's minor pieces.
 [ N f3 ]  [ d5 ] , [ c4 ]  The Reti opening. As in the Queen's Gambit White is trying to remove Black's QP and thereby lessen his control over e4.
 [ N x c7 + ]  [ Q x c7 ]  [ Q x f7 + ]  [ K d8 ] , [ Q f8 # ]  The moral of this game? Don't be greedy!!
 [ N x f4 ] , [ e x f4 ]  I was expecting gxf and then black has a column opened on W castling. But this seems to be good as well allowing BB in [ g7 ] to help with the attack.
 [ N x d5 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ R e1 + ]  [ K f8 ]  [ d3 ]  [ h6 ] , [ B f4 ]  Getting rid of the dangerous bishop
 [ h5 ]  [ g x h5 ]  [ g x h5 ]  [ h6 ]  [ N f5 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ N x g7 ]  [ K x g7 ]  [ B x h6 + ]  [ K h7 ]  [ R h g1 ] , [ N g8 ]  This it turned out stemmed the tide a little longer and I had some hopes at this point of surviving the attack.
 [ h5 ]  [ K c6 ]  [ N e6 ]  [ K b7 ]  [ R g8 ] , [ a8 = Q ]  I smile thinking I can draw.
 [ g6 ]  [ R a e1 ] , [ R c8 ]  Another blunder by Cobo reducing the King-side defences still further.
 [ Q b3 ] , [ R c8 ]  I'm trying to use the opened Q-side to my advantage by securing attacking routes.
 [ N e2 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ f4 ] , [ K h8 ]  ? waste of tempo. I should have developed my Q-side pieces.
 [ R f3 ] , [ a4 ]  Still without seeing the point of it.
 [ N f4 ]  [ R g x g7 ]  [ K f5 ] , [ N c6 ]  Bringing the knight back into the game.
 [ Q h2 ] , [ R a e8 + ]  Increasing pressure but black may be better off with Bxh1.
 [ d x e5 ] , [ d x e5 ]  surely to get the queens out altogether will it work?
 [ g6 ] , [ c5 ]  Freezing Black's b-pawn.
 [ N g4 ] , [ h3 ]  It's hard to know for sure what whites best move is here but I don't think this is it
 [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ] , [ a6 ]  Usually black plays 4...[ N f6 ] and 5...[ a6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ N f6 ]  The Sicilian Najdorf is my favourite reponse to 1.[ e4 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B e7 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ b5 ] , [ B b3 ]  Last 'bookmove'.
 [ g x h5 ]  [ g x h5 ] , [ e6 ]  Although not a passer with my other two pawns this one is just as dangerous as I will explain.
 [ Q x d1 ] , [ Q f2 # ]  Mate. Lessons to be learned. Don't play too slow in the opening try to get your pieces out and your king into safety. Also : careful about moving the f pawn. This weakens your King's defence.
 [ Q f6 ]  [ N f4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ Q d8 ]  [ B g2 ]  [ N x g3 ]  [ h x g3 ]  [ R b8 ] , [ a4 ]  My passed pawn is now well-defended...and I don't need to worry about my opponent's knight any more...
 [ N d4 ]  [ B x f5 ]  [ N d6 x f5 ]  [ R e1 ] , [ R e8 ]  Reluctant to allow white control of the e-file.
 [ N x d5 ] , [ Q b5 + ]  And yet another in between check (and a second queen move in the opening!) however this one is not so easy to counter as [ N c6 ] gets countered by [ Q x b7 ] getting the pawn with tempo on my knight and 7.... [ Q d7 ] also leads to [ Q x b7 ] and the loss of a rook as well. [ B d7 ] leads to [ Q x d5 ] losing my knight and so the only decent option was...
 [ f5 ] , [ B b7 ]  Jenkins is ignoring the K-side where the danger lies.
 [ e3 ]  [ b5 ] , [ c5 ]  White closes the center early. The natural plan for Black would be to strive for the e5-breakthrough.
 [ e3 ]  [ R g8 ]  [ b3 ]  [ R a8 ]  [ g3 ]  [ R h8 ]  [ h3 ]  [ R b8 ]  [ f4 ]  [ R g8 ]  [ c4 ]  [ R a8 ]  [ b4 ]  [ R h8 ]  [ g4 ]  [ R b8 ]  [ e4 ]  [ R g8 ]  [ d3 ]  [ R a8 ]  [ a4 ]  [ R h8 ]  [ d4 ]  [ R b8 ]  [ h4 ] , [ R g8 ]  With Jabborg's pawns regrouping on the 4th Rank it will be interesting how Carslberg will respond. If he decides to advance his front line it would surely be a merciless pawn battle similar to that of the famous pawn battle between Count Gok and Proffessor of Flimanin Science Peetabob Haphomski.
 [ R e e8 ]  [ h8 = Q ]  [ R e x h8 ] , [ R x h8 ]  The rook finally releases all that pent up energy.
 [ Q d5 ]  [ Q x d5 ] , [ e x d5 ]  I expected this to happen ... 24. [ e x d5 ] [ B x f1 ] 25. [ R x f1 ] Rf-[ e8 ] 26. [ R f6 ] Ra-[ d8 ]  [ R x f1 ] , [ f5 ]  ... but changed my mind and advanced the f pawn with the support of the rook.
 [ B f2 ] , [ e5 ]  He has to protect his knight.
 [ N f6 ] , [ f4 ]  I know only one way.
 [ N c3 ] , [ N c6 ]  Knights Developed White- [ N c3 ] Black- [ N c6 ]  [ Q f3 ] , [ N f6 ]  White Queen advances to F3 black counters with Nf6. At this stage and now that my Queen is out square C2 is really appealing to black.
 [ Q x b7 ] , [ N h5 ]  Thinking about what to do I decide to attack his [ B f4 ] by placing my N on the rim.
 [ Q h5 ]  [ Q g4 ]  [ Q x g4 ]  [ f x g4 ]  [ N g5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ R c3 c8 ] , [ N e6 ]  This threatens the R but White does not have to respond immediately because of the check in his back pocket.
 [ h3 ]  [ O-O ] , [ O-O ]  Bringing the kings to safety.
 [ e6 ] , [ N b d2 ]  I know little variations of the KIA... thus I use this one [ N b d2 ] helps in center.
 [ R f d1 ] , [ Q h4 ]  Now the white king is in my ring
 [ Q g4 ] , [ Q d2 ]  supporting the bishop i should have gone here first.
 [ Q c8 ] , [ N g5 ]  ?! doesn't really accomplish anything.
 [ N x g3 ]  [ Q d1 + ] , [ B f1 ]  Maybe this was the black's idea in the first place. But I doubt this is an improvement over the last comment's position. I do threat some perpetual but now being +1 I am thinking again in victory!
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ N c3 ]  I don't normally like playing 3 knights or the 4 knights opening but didn't see anything better at the time.
 [ N h3 ]  [ K g6 ]  [ R g1 ]  [ R h5 ]  [ N e2 ] , [ N d7 ]  Alternative variation: 27... [ K f7 ] $17
 [ B x f2 + ]  [ K d2 ] , [ d4 ]  Advancing my pawns and trying to trap the bishop with h6.
 [ a4 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ a x b5 ]  [ B x b5 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ c6 ]  The problem with trying to protect the forward c pawn is a general lack of development and weakening of position as we see here
 [ N g3 ]  [ B g6 ] , [ B c2 ]  defending [ e4 ] and preparing for Nh5.
 [ B g3 ] , [ h6 ]  I didn't dare to play the Qa4-b4-Nxb4-cxb4-[ B x b4 + ] not while [ d2 ] is still all that covered.
 [ R x e6 ]  [ R x e6 ] , [ N e3 ]  This N goes to [ f5 ] he wants to take my B. I don't want to take it off the diag so easily.
 [ B g6 ] , [ d4 ]  This sacrifices a Pawn in return for a quick attack.
 [ N f3 ]  [ f5 ]  [ g3 ]  [ c5 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ Q x d4 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ Q d3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ d4 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ d x c3 ]  [ Q x c3 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ Q c4 ] , [ N x e5 ]  the offer white accepted it but could not foresee the consequences.
 [ R f8 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ R f6 ]  [ Q d5 ]  [ R a7 ] , [ Q g8 + ]  Good but maybe not the best. I think that with accurate play black can still get a draw here.
 [ g6 ] , [ d3 ]  The opening is now a Closed Sicilian.
 [ d3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ a3 ]  [ b6 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ N x c6 ]  [ B x c6 ]  [ B x c6 ]  [ d x c6 ]  [ R b1 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ b4 ]  [ c x b4 ]  [ a x b4 ]  [ B e5 ]  [ B d2 ]  [ N g4 ]  [ b5 ]  [ c5 ] , [ f3 ]  16. ... [ N f6 ] 17. [ f4 ]  [ R x a6 ]  [ Q b7 ] , [ R a3 ]  My plan was as follows: 27. ... [ R x a6 ] 28. [ Q b7 ] [ R a3 ] 29. Rd-[ a1 ] but instead I took the pawn at f7.
 [ K g2 ]  [ g4 ]  [ B d1 ]  [ N f4 + ]  [ B x f4 ]  [ R x f4 ]  [ b3 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ K g3 ] , [ R h8 ]  [ K g5 ] would have saved Pg4. 26. [ f3 ] Rh8. 27. Pxg4--white would not do this because R[ x R f1 ] for free.
 [ N c6 ] , [ N f3 ]  And it turns out to be nothing since this is what Tom plays with 3...[ N f6 ] If he had played 4.[ N c3 ] first then it would've been a full transposition since he would be transposing as well.
 [ d5 ] , [ O-O-O ]  While I attack my opponent's kingside he begins a central counter attack. This is usually a good idea if one wants to have counterplay whatsoever
 [ B x d5 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ N x d4 ] , [ B x d4 ]  For similar reasons White exchanges off my Knight. I have a slight advantage in development but the position is fairly even.
 [ B e7 ]  [ g3 ] , [ B d6 ]  The bishop comes back to base having done its job on the kingside. Now white must take the bishop off the c1-[ h6 ] diagonal and in its absence black will break the position open to get at the weakened white pawns.
 [ K h2 ] , [ N f6 ]  free spaces for queen and [ B b7 ] to come back on the other side
 [ Q x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ B d2 ] , [ N f6 ]  Again threatening Nxd4. Though Anand would have the threat [ R x c7 ] once the knight moves.
 [ d4 ] , [ R f4 ]  Not. Good to pressure the pawn though.
 [ K c2 ]  [ K d5 ]  [ N b3 ] , [ R h1 ]  Once again threatens ...b4. White tries to hold this up for as long as he can.
 [ N c3 ]  [ Q a5 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c6 ]  [ B d2 ]  [ Q d8 ] , [ N f3 ]  Already white is way ahead of black in piece development.
 [ N x e5 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ e4 ]  [ Q d6 ] , [ a4 ]  played to stop a possible ... [ b5 ] which I dont want to see as it would undermine my strong center
 [ N x d4 ] , [ N x f4 ]  ?! stronger is 21...Qf6. Black's move here helps solve White's h4-knight problem.
 [ Q g3 ] , [ Q f5 ]  [14 min left] This is the only correct move for black in this position as it counters [ R e5 ] threat as well as [ B h6 ] threat. 22... [ B h5 ] 23. [ B f6 ] [ B g6 ] 24. [ B x d4 ] would allow white to survive.
 [ R b5 ]  [ a4 ]  [ R a5 ]  [ R d2 ]  [ R x a4 ] , [ K x d5 ]  45. [ K x d5 ] - pawn trade.
 [ B x d5 ]  [ R x d5 ]  [ c3 ] , [ c4 ]  I think white's plan was to pin the black knight to the undefended black rook on [ d4 ] then attack the knight with a pawn winning material. It doesn't work because black has a counterattack.
 [ Q e2 ] , [ R h7 ]  It is natural to defend the f-pawn given that the knight no longer helps it from e5.
 [ N d3 + ]  [ K g3 ]  [ c4 ] , [ R c6 ]  If he take my pawn there's just no way that my knight can take alone all of his pawns. I don't know why I'm not resigning.
 [ R e2 ] , [ g4 ]  I intend to open the h-file and line up my Rook.
 [ d4 ] , [ N f6 ]  My friend chooses not to fight the battle on Classical lines.
 [ b5 ]  [ B d2 ]  [ R f6 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ R b8 ]  [ R h h3 ] , [ c5 ]  I am hoping to exploit the third rank.
 [ Q a6 ] , [ B b3 ]  On hindsight I should have foreseen [ B b3 ] and done something more useful instead of giving him a free tempo.
 [ Q e2 ] , [ B b4 ]  What now again?
 [ c3 ]  [ Q b6 ]  [ Q e2 ] , [ O-O ]  11. ..... 0-0 - potential pressure on f2. Already white cannot castle kingside due to the [ g1 ] square being commanded by the BQ and black's dsb. Chris frees himself from it on the next turn however with 12. b4.
 [ R e1 + ]  [ K f4 ] , [ B d1 ]  Nowadays I would know better than to try and squeeze a win out of such a simplified ending.
 [ g3 ] , [ Q f6 ]  Here comes my Queen..
 [ d4 ]  [ Q e2 ]  [ d3 ]  [ c x d3 ] , [ c x d3 ]  The Q must move again. Black has gained substantial time.
 [ B x f6 ] , [ g x f6 ]  ? Another mistake I had to accept that I would be a piece down. Now White finishes it....
 [ B x e5 ] , [ B x f6 ]  When you are down you should trade pawns not pieces. A more interesting play would have been [ d4 ] or perhaps exd5.
 [ R b5 ] , [ a x b3 + ]  Computer actually prefers [ a3 ] I would be interested in your views!
 [ f x e3 ]  [ f x e3 ]  [ Q x e3 ]  [ Q e1 ]  [ Q x e1 + ] , [ K x e1 ]  45. [ K x e1 ] - there seemed to be nothing better than to exchange queens. With the Witch so close to Henry I felt Old Matey's cold stinking breath all over me!
 [ N d4 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N x f3 ]  [ g x f3 ]  [ N e7 ]  [ R g1 ]  [ N g6 ] , [ d4 ]  I dont see the point in this move. It does allow the bishop out but why not just d3? Maybe white saw a line like [ c x d4 ] [ B g5 ] [ [ f6 ] ] ex[ [ f6 ] ] gx[ [ f6 ] ] and then Rxg6. However this dosnt work as instead of [ [ f6 ] ] black can play the simple Be7.
 [ K x f3 ]  [ R x c6 ]  [ h5 ]  [ R c3 ]  [ K e2 ]  [ R c2 + ]  [ R d2 ]  [ f3 + ]  [ K d1 ]  [ R c8 ]  [ R b2 ]  [ K e4 ]  [ R b5 ]  [ R h8 ]  [ R f5 ]  [ R h6 ]  [ K d2 ]  [ d3 ] , [ R f8 ]  ?? very weak move! gives black the chance to get the f white pawn but i can't see a reasonable move
 [ Q d5 ]  [ Q c6 ]  [ Q e6 + ]  [ K c7 ] , [ R c2 ]  thinking to win early
 [ d5 ] , [ c4 ]  The Queen's Gambit - my favourite opening. In itself this is not a gambit as White can force the pawn's recapture with 3.[ Q a4 ] and 4.[ Q x c4 ] but this continuation is useless and rarely played.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d4 ] , [ N d7 ]  This was back when I played the Hanham Philidor move order. White gains an edge now with [ B c4 ] after best play.
 [ R c8 ]  [ a7 ]  [ R a8 ]  [ K d4 ]  [ K c6 ]  [ R a6 + ]  [ K b7 ]  [ R x e6 ]  [ R x a7 ]  [ K x d5 ] , [ K c8 ]  44......[ R a2 ] activating the rook was much better.45.Re7ch [ K b6 ] 46.[ R x h7 ] [ e3 ] 47.[ R e7 ] and though a pawn up blacks activity offers compensation
 [ K g2 ]  [ g4 ]  [ f x g4 ] , [ h x g4 ]  At the time I thought this position hopelessly lost for white. However a look at a free on-line ending database shows me that actually white can draw with [ N f2 ] with careful play. All other moves lose.
 [ Q e2 + ]  [ K a7 ]  [ Q f2 + ] , [ Q b6 ]  68. [ Q b6 ] - After being on this square for many moves Glenda is finally able to cover her other half.
 [ B f8 ] , [ N e g5 ]  I am perplexed. I don't really understand what black was doing with 7. ... Bf8. The bishop seemed well placed fianchettoed with an attack on [ d4 ] supported by the black queen. Maybe he wanted to play to b4? As for my response I am thinking knights on [ g5 ] and [ e5 ] are fairly imposing (although I haven't figured out how to save them both from black's simply pushing his [ f7 ] pawn to [ f6 ] and forking them).
 [ d5 ] , [ Q c2 ]  I threat to win a central pawn. Developing in the meantime. Now [ N d2 ] or [ N g5 ] can be emergency plans if needed.
 [ Q x f4 ]  [ e x f4 ] , [ N b2 ]  Since all is said and done now I bring my N back to its homepage since I'm ready to do so. This implies that there was absolutely no rush because what I outlined earlier.
 [ R x e8 + ]  [ Q x e8 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ Q g6 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ Q f7 ]  [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ R e7 ]  [ N e2 ]  [ Q e8 ]  [ K f1 ]  [ b6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ R x e1 + ]  [ Q x e1 ]  [ Q x e1 + ]  [ K x e1 ]  [ K f7 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ K e6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ a6 ]  [ K e2 ]  [ h6 ]  [ K e3 ]  [ g5 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ f5 ]  [ N f2 ]  [ K f6 ]  [ b4 ]  [ b5 ]  [ N d3 ]  [ K e6 ]  [ h3 ]  [ h5 ]  [ c3 ]  [ K f6 ]  [ a3 ]  [ g4 ] , [ h4 ]  I decide not to take the pawn as it would prove costly and he would queen.
 [ c x d4 ] , [ B x d4 ]  10. [ B x d4 ] - pawn trade.
 [ g3 + ]  [ h x g3 ]  [ h x g3 + ] , [ K e1 ]  Black's passed pawn is born.
 [ N c3 ] , [ Q d8 ]  leaving White ahead in development
 [ N x g7 ]  [ K x g7 ] , [ d5 + ]  the threat with his rook to my queen will me give time and opportunity to place my queen on the good start square
 [ Q b6 ] , [ Q c2 ]  I know that this move defends [ b2 ] of course but I am shocked that he did not do this with 14.Rb2. Normally pawns like these are defended by one of the rooks in positions like this.
 [ b5 ] , [ B d5 ]  Trying to set up [ B e4 ] then [ B c2 ] threatening the pawn on a4.
 [ c6 ]  [ Q x e5 + ]  [ N e6 ] , [ Q x h8 + ]  here is the rock
 [ K x g7 ]  [ B x f6 + ]  [ Q x f6 ]  [ Q x f6 + ]  [ K x f6 ]  [ N d5 + ]  [ K g7 ]  [ N x b4 ]  [ R d8 ] , [ N d5 ]  This seals the centre and cramps blacks pieces.
 [ R g3 + ]  [ K h7 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ N e4 ] , [ N x f8 + ]  With check so you can't get my rook.
 [ R x d7 ]  [ Q g8 ] , [ c6 ]  Black had to make some breathing space for king.
 [ N f4 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B x f4 ]  [ e x f4 ]  [ B x h3 ] , [ B x c6 + ]  He did not fall for the trap and did not take the bishop. Good job.
 [ N f3 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ B d5 ]  [ c6 ] , [ B e4 ]  This Bishop is beautifully centralized.
 [ Q c7 ]  [ B x d5 ]  [ Q x d6 ]  [ R x d6 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ R x d5 ] , [ b3 ]  Protecting the pawn.
 [ N x e5 ] , [ N x e5 ]  I was waiting for black to make another mistake.
 [ B x e7 ]  [ N x e7 ]  [ h2 ]  [ R x h2 ] , [ R x e7 ]  As expected this will now be the R & P endgame battle! The question is did Caruana memorize the Dvoretsky Endgame Manual?
 [ Q x d2 ]  [ R b1 + ] , [ K e2 ]  I make the move but it's over. I know it. But then someone at the end gets checkmated and I resign. It was good but I blew it on turn 22. No shock but I wish I could have taken that one back. So I resign He was talking about chess personalities about 3 weeks before at our school. I pinpointed his personality and then asked him how one could beat that type. He said by forgoing subtle games and forcing that person to make sharp distinct moves with lots of pros and cons. Which I tried but that's also a way to lose quicker as well. At least I can say I was going to go 40 turns against a guy who came 10th in the world open.
 [ B e4 ] , [ K g3 ]  The bishop moves out of the knights reach so the King must defend [ f2 ] although it wanted to move towards the centre anyway so this is no problem.
 [ Q h4 + ] , [ g3 ]  that ' s all no more danger. this attack is too early and give me a chance to castle (even if the castle is now weak
 [ N f5 ]  [ B x f5 ] , [ e x f5 ]  Yes the pawn is weak and it actually could impede a king side assault instead of help it but the e-file is open. Black should play [ B e7 ] and castle before any real pressure builds.
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ g6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ e4 ]  [ d6 ] , [ f4 ]  I like the 4 pawns attack against the KI.
 [ R x f7 ] , [ R x e8 + ]  White clearly has a vastly better position as this RP endgame approaches but I will continue to make occasional comments.
 [ b x c5 + ]  [ K x c5 ]  [ h4 ]  [ b4 ]  [ h5 ]  [ a5 ]  [ B e8 ]  [ c6 ]  [ N d2 ]  [ K b5 ]  [ h6 ]  [ K a4 ]  [ B x c6 + ]  [ K a3 ]  [ N c4 + ]  [ K x a2 ]  [ N x a5 ]  [ K a3 ]  [ h7 ]  [ b3 ]  [ N x b3 ]  [ K x b3 ]  [ R d4 ]  [ K c3 ]  [ R e4 ]  [ K d3 ]  [ K d1 ]  [ K c3 ]  [ K e2 ]  [ K b3 ] , [ K d2 ]  
 [ N c2 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B g5 ] , [ N g4 ]  Aha! Sacrificing the queen. White cannot play 15. Bxe7??? or he will lose instantly to 15. ... Bxf2#.
 [ N x d5 ]  [ B g2 ]  [ N x c3 ] , [ b x c3 ]  and black has effectively exchanged his centre pawn for my b-pawn. Not a great idea in my opinion
 [ Q e6 + ]  [ K f8 ]  [ R h8 + ]  [ Q x h8 ] , [ Q f7 # ]  Thanks for looking hope you liked it. Comments are welcome
 [ N a4 ]  [ B x a4 ]  [ Q x a4 ] , [ N d4 ]  He now has complete control on my center
 [ N e3 ] , [ R f7 ]  Why is Black retreating? He must think I'm going to resign any move now.
 [ B x d7 + ]  [ K b8 ] , [ R x c6 ]  Mate is now essentially forced although there are a couple of variations.
 [ B g6 ] , [ B b5 ]  Analysing this position 9. [ d4 ] cx[ d4 ] 10. Nx[ d4 ] Nx[ d4 ] 11.Qx[ d4 ] was better for white.
 [ Q e3 + ]  [ K b7 ]  [ Q x f2 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ h7 ]  [ Q h8 ]  [ Q f7 ] , [ R d8 ]  And now none of Black's pieces can move for a while
 [ K f3 ]  [ Q f6 + ] , [ K x g4 ]  That's better. Mate is in sight. All forced moves now.
 [ c3 ]  [ R e2 ]  [ Q c1 ] , [ R x g2 + ]  Snap! Suddenly I had invaded on the 2nd rank White's king was beleaguered and White's position didn't look so easy to win after all.
 [ d x e5 ] , [ Q x d8 ]  Yep: there go the Queens. White could have tried the quite playable 8.[ Q c2 ] but then one would be inclined to wonder why the exchange on e5.
 [ N c3 ]  [ e6 ] , [ f5 ]  Here I was inspired by an idea that originated with Bobby Fischer. He observed that in this opening if black's king's knight is developed to [ f6 ] there is a shortage of good squares to move it to after that so harassing it with a pawn can be quite effective. It looked to me like the same was true for his knight on g6. So in spite of his pawn on [ e6 ] I attack with my f-pawn.
 [ N x a4 ]  [ B d1 ]  [ N x c3 ]  [ Q x c3 ] , [ N a2 ]  The bishop move came a day late dollar short. Now the fork is set....
 [ N c2 ]  [ K d3 ] , [ R f2 ]  Easy19's comments after this move: "we got a cool mate with a knight now 38.[ [ c5 ] ] [ [ d5 ] ] 39.[ [ a4 ] ] [ K f3 ] 40.[ a5 ] [ N e1 # ] or 38.[ b3 ] [ K f3 ] 39.[ [ c5 ] ] [ [ d5 ] ] 40.[ [ a4 ] ] Ne1#"
 [ B x f6 ] , [ Q x h2 ]  Looks can be deceiving. This is not a wasted Queen move grabbing a lowly pawn! Black aims to force a draw...
 [ h3 ]  [ K g1 ]  [ R g2 + ]  [ K h1 ]  [ R f2 ]  [ K g1 ] , [ R g2 + ]  hoping for a draw
 [ e x f6 ] , [ B x f6 ]  22. exf6?! wasn't exactly a blunder but it is a very dubious strategy. Now black has a half-open file with a rook aimed right at white's exposed king and black's DSB gains a lot of freedom too.
 [ e5 ]  [ N e8 ]  [ B h6 ]  [ N e7 ]  [ B x g7 ]  [ N x g7 ]  [ Q h6 ] , [ N g f5 ]  I just wanted a strong knight on f5.
 [ c5 ]  [ f5 ] , [ B a3 ]  [DK] I've convinced myself that the crux of my attack must be against d6. If I can unlodge [ d6 ] and remount an attack against the center (e5) before your pawns come raining down then I feel I might have a chance. It feels like a race that is critically hinged on timing. I was looking for moves that might hinder your attack but the best defense I can come up with is a quick counterattack. If I can force you to make defensive moves then your attack will necessarily be slowed.
 [ e3 ] , [ B f5 ]  I smell a stonewall forming.
 [ B x c6 + ]  [ b x c6 ] , [ f x e4 ]  11. [ f x e4 ] - now I take the knight.
 [ e x f6 ]  [ g x f6 ]  [ K d4 ]  [ K d6 ]  [ K c3 ]  [ K c5 ]  [ R h4 ] , [ f5 ]  Too quick. Requires deep analysis though. Computer really likes …[ R a3 + ] but the obvious [ K b2 ] needs a lot of thought to refute.
 [ B x b7 ] , [ R a d8 ]  Possibly no tthe best move but it puts the rook on a half open file and resigns the white queen to defending a pawn
 [ e4 ] , [ N h6 ]  Hippopotamus opening; a favorite of mine.
 [ B b5 ] , [ Q x b5 ]  I could hear my Bishop snickering as it disappeared down the Queen's gullet.
 [ d3 ]  [ R f d1 ]  [ a4 ]  [ c6 ]  [ R d5 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f5 ]  [ K f8 ]  [ N x h6 ]  [ K e7 ]  [ N f5 + ]  [ K e6 ]  [ N g7 + ]  [ K e7 ]  [ N f5 + ]  [ K e6 ]  [ e4 ]  [ R d d8 ] , [ R c5 ]  Preparing to play Rd5.
 [ K d2 ] , [ K d5 ]  If white's bishop was better placed I couldn't have come through here.
 [ K x h7 ]  [ R h1 + ] , [ R h4 ]  White resigned here.
 [ N e7 ] , [ R a d1 ]  ! I now have full control of the central files.
 [ N b4 ]  [ f3 ] , [ g x f3 ]  The Knight move is too late. Black give a pawn to open up Whites belly with a kidney punch
 [ a3 ]  [ N b c6 ] , [ f4 ]  too late to close this Sicilian: Black is unleashed...
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ g6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ e4 ]  [ d6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B e2 ]  [ e5 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N b d7 ]  [ O-O ] , [ N c5 ]  The starting position.
 [ O-O ]  [ O-O ] , [ N c3 ]  I was afraid of d5.
 [ N x f5 ] , [ e x f5 ]  Bring another pawn to the weakend king side
 [ O-O ] , [ Q c7 ]  A mistake by black....best was [ R e8 ] 10[ d5 ] [ N e5 ] leading to only a slight advantage for white
 [ B x f3 ] , [ Q x f3 ]  [ g x f3 ] would have been bad as it would expose my king.
 [ d5 ] , [ N f3 ]  The mainline of course being 3. [ e d5 ] This move tempts black to play 3... [ d e4 ] but after either 4. [ N g5 ] or 4. [ N e5 ] white has a very solid knight in the center that will take time to remove meanwhile cramping black's development severely.
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ g6 ]  That was when I began to think. I was actually engrossed in thoughts on the third move I had often played 3.[ f3 ] threatening with King's Indian Defense. However this opening couldn't scare Topalov off as he was used to it moreover that was what he reckoned on. That is why I decided to play at sight. I went for a position I had a definite idea about but never met in practice and frankly speaking had never seriously analyzed.
 [ h8 = R + ]  [ N x h8 ]  [ B x h8 ] , [ c3 ]  It's getting closer...
 [ B x e4 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ Q x e4 ]  [ f6 ]  [ Q x g6 + ]  [ Q x g6 ]  [ N x g6 ]  [ f x g5 ]  [ N x f8 ] , [ K x f8 ]  It is beyond me why Black is allowing White to go on an exchanging spree. It is usually taken for granted that generally the side that is ahead on material benefits from exchanges.
 [ R e2 ] , [ N g6 ]  16. .......... [ N g6 ] - Ion stated here "I've had a look at the game and I reckon you might have had the whisker of an edge in the early middlegame. A line like 16...[ c6 ] 17.[ N e4 ] [ B g4 ] 18.[ N e d2 ] [ B x f3 ] 19.[ N x f3 ] [ R d6 ] and then pile on White's isolated d-pawn would have given you the initiative (assuming the line is correct). "
 [ Q a5 ]  [ B d2 ] , [ Q c7 ]  since the queen was safe enough from an attack with a N move ...exd 11.cxd [ B g4 ] should be considered. it is not clear that the queen is better placed on [ c7 ] than [ d8 ] when weighed against the probable move of the dark squared bishop. White is also one move closer (for free) to doubling the rooks on the open file.
 [ B f3 ]  [ e5 ] , [ f x e5 ]  Brigadecommander gave an alternative to this move: My idea was based on 14.[ N f5 ] not fxe5. That is a direct attack on the black king is it not? Does Black then have to play 14....[ B x f5 ] ?. And White then would play 15.[ e x f5 ] correct?. Now blacks d-pawn is still backward Whites LSB is released and aimed right at [ d5 ] and [ d6 ] is under attack. By 14.[ f x e5 ] white un/cramps Blacks position for him. Klaus: on 14.[ N f5 ] [ B x f5 ] 15.[ e x f5 ] [ R a c8 ] white has to play [ f x e5 ] to get Power to my e pawn and in the center. After [ d x e5 ] we have the same position. Myevilluck: I didn't play 14. [ N f5 ] because I didn't like the way it started to look. My line was something like: 14. [ N f5 ] [ B x f4 ] 15. [ e x f5 ] [ R f c8 ] 16. [ R h e1 ] [ e4 ] 17. [ B x f6 ] [ B x f6 ] 18. Bx[ e4 ] [ R a b8 ] It's still very drawish but I figured the other way gave me a shot of him being a little inaccurate.
 [ B f5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ e6 ] , [ g4 ]  Characteristic of Kotronias's robust approach. The risk is that White overstretches himself by advancing his kingside pawns leaving his King exposed at the back.
 [ R a2 + ] , [ K g1 ]  This is where I like my kings.
 [ c x d4 ] , [ N e7 ]  Hmm blocks in dsb looks like my opponent is either cramping himself or looking for a Qside battle
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ] , [ f4 ]  After the match-up as normal I checked the internets and discovered this is called the "Sicilian - Grand Prix Attack". Not something I'm familiar with again. At the time although I was shocked to see it instead of something like [ N f3 ] it seemed unsound to me. It looks to me like a quick d5. . .
 [ Q c4 ] , [ Q d7 + ]  53. [ Q d7 + ] - Glenda keeps the BK busy when she can.
 [ R c4 ] , [ B d7 ]  The bishop is starting to become more useful! Additionally this move clamps down on the c6-square preventing White's pawn from advancing any further.
 [ Q g5 ]  [ d7 + ]  [ K d8 ] , [ B d6 ]  threatening e7#black has to give up his queen which loses on the spot. His only try is [ Q h5 + ] but nothing can be made of it. Black should resign here.
 [ b x a3 ]  [ Q d8 + ] , [ Q x d8 ]  The dragon is forced to weaken his attack or fear losing the fight all together
 [ f5 ] , [ N e6 ]  Again trying to tempt me to open the f file. Black never really gets any play as much as he tries white's got a space advantage and active pieces.
 [ B b7 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ d6 ]  [ b4 ]  [ N b d7 ] , [ N b3 ]  The knight is not going to be very useful on queenside but it is not clear what kind of plan white should be playing.
 [ B b7 ]  [ B d3 ] , [ R g8 ]  Who matters about castling?
 [ N e4 ] , [ Q a5 ]  With a nominal threat of 11. ... [ N d4 ] or 0-0-0
 [ e x d5 ]  [ d6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ Q f6 ] , [ Q e1 + ]  [ Q e1 ] forks the king and the knight gobbling the knight.
 [ d x e5 ]  [ f x e5 ] , [ N g8 ]  Black could not take the pawn with the knight because of Bf4. And again should have just castled. But now even worse is about to happen! Black 's moves lead to...
 [ R x g2 ]  [ N x g2 ]  [ Q x g2 ] , [ h4 ]  Now I just advance the h pawn and I create multiple threats
 [ B d7 ]  [ B b3 + ] , [ K f6 ]  ??
 [ c3 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ h3 ]  Preparing an escape square for the bishop
 [ a4 ]  [ K b2 ]  [ a x b3 ] , [ a x b3 ]  I think I've got to take with the pawn; otherwise [ Q g4 ] causes me too much trouble.
 [ N a7 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ c6 ] , [ B a3 ]  Here coming a discover attack. Black Queen and Rook would be in danger.
 [ B g2 ] , [ B g7 ]  We both play the logical follow-up move.
 [ B f5 ]  [ N h4 ]  [ B d7 ] , [ O-O ]  White gets his own King to safety.
 [ N c6 ]  [ a4 ]  [ b x a4 ] , [ R x a4 ]  11. [ R x a4 ] - another pawn trade.
 [ d x e3 ]  [ R x e4 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ Q d8 + ]  [ K g7 ]  [ Q d4 + ]  [ N f6 ]  [ f x e3 ]  [ Q e6 ]  [ R f2 ]  [ g5 ]  [ h4 ] , [ g x h4 ]  This wast lasker's sealed move. It was not the best . His chance to draw was to play Kg6. Any other continuation should lose
 [ h3 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ B a3 ]  I activate my bishop with a gain of tempo.
 [ Q x f3 ] , [ R f e8 ]  White is attacking the black pawn at [ e7 ] which is a fork of black's king and the rook at c8. That's the only thing that saves his rook on [ a1 ] from the discovered attack. However all is not lost this fork was anticipated and is now prevented. And though white's rook will escape white will not remain unharmed.
 [ K h8 ] , [ Q x g5 ]  Where the pin on [ f6 ] proves decisive.
 [ B c5 ]  [ R e1 ] , [ f4 ]  More material falls off. One way or another here Black wins at least the exchange. White opts for what seems to be the least expensive way.
 [ a5 ]  [ h5 ]  [ a4 ] , [ h x g6 ]  I remember having a good reason for not taking FxG but I cannot recall... Do you agree that HxG is stronger...?
 [ B f5 ] , [ R b1 ]  12. [ R b1 ] - Dave then said in the chat that he wanted to probe my defences. After a long consideration I decided the best way to meet this move was to advance my pawn to b6.
 [ f5 ] , [ N x c6 ]  Capture to do 2 things. 1) To double his pawns on the c file 2) to open up the bishops diagonal to his king
 [ R x c7 ]  [ R e c1 ]  [ h6 ] , [ B x f6 ]  Forced to take it.
 [ B c2 ]  [ R c8 ] , [ a3 ]  The white shows your plan a3-[ b4 ] to controlling [ c5 ] square. I can play Nc6-[ a5 ] to [ c4 ] but I do not like decentralising the knigth
 [ R x f3 ] , [ Q c6 ]  A meaningless threat. Again I think the Queen would be better positioned on c5.
 [ g5 ]  [ K g2 ]  [ K g7 ]  [ R c4 ]  [ f6 ]  [ g4 ]  [ R c3 ]  [ R e4 ]  [ b3 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ b2 ] , [ K f1 ]  ? The king should remain with the forward pawns.
 [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ] , [ d4 ]  The Chekhover variation (B53) from the Sicilian I like this move a lot it's opening good lines for white and weakning the queenside of the black player EDIT : It isn't the Chekhover variation it's the main line (thanks to fatcat)
 [ N c6 ] , [ e5 ]  starting with the pawn
 [ B c1 ]  [ g4 ]  [ Q g3 ] , [ Q x e4 ]  33. ...... [ Q x [ e4 ] ] - Glenda comes out of hiding and turns white's [ e4 ] pawn into dust. She also defends the pawn on g4.
 [ N e3 ] , [ g6 ]  At this point I was actually considering offering a draw... My confidence just wasn't there for the win. I had my hands full covering all the different angles.
 [ R x e2 ] , [ Q x g2 ]  of course
 [ B x d3 ] , [ R e3 ]  ?! 32.[ R e6 ] even wins a pawn for White but probably Black has enough activity to hold the draw. But at least White could have tried it. But maybe White having defended the whole game was content with a draw. Now Black can reach the draw quite easily.
 [ B c4 ] , [ h6 ]  I assume Black feared 6 [ N g5 ] [ d5 ] 7 Nxf7!? and the Fried Liver Attack. Wouldn't want to be Black in a blitz game in that situation but in a correspondence game it might be fun to test one's defensive prowess in that line.
 [ B c5 ]  [ B d5 ]  [ R c1 ]  [ e4 ] , [ c4 ]  why would white do that. if white wants a chance to draw the game he must change bishops from the opposite color not the same...
 [ e7 ]  [ R b8 + ]  [ K c7 ]  [ R b7 + ] , [ K c8 ]  and black resign in view of F[ c6 ] [ e8 Q ] BxQ KxR. Nakamura finished the exhibition in 2 hours with 18 win and 2 draw. Thanks for looking hope you enjoyed. Don't hesitate to give comments and 1 star rating. ^^
 [ O-O ] , [ B c5 ]  I change my pieces where I can because the position is closed so my knight must be better then whites' bishop - what now out on game stands.
 [ B x e7 ]  [ N x e7 ] , [ Q d6 ]  15. [ Q d6 ] - Glenda immediately siezes the opportunity to bravely get on her broomstick and fly into the enemy camp. It will not be as easy as it looks to eject her though. Black protects his knight with his KR.
 [ d3 + ]  [ B x d3 ]  [ B x a1 ] , [ B x g6 ]  White decides to trade bishops even though he's behind.
 [ K f8 ]  [ O-O ] , [ N f5 ]  Knight on [ h8 ] is trapped
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ B b5 ]  Ruy Lopez (Spanish opening) (C60)
 [ e3 ] , [ B c1 ]  Alternative variation: [equally bad is ] 44. [ B e1 ] [ B g7 ] 45. [ K b2 ] [ K e4 + ] 46. [ B c3 ] [ B d4 ]  [ K b2 ]  [ B g7 + ]  [ K a2 ]  [ B d4 ]  [ B f1 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ e2 ]  [ B d2 ]  [ B f2 ]  [ B f4 + ] , [ K d7 ]  winning a bishop
 [ Q g3 + ]  [ K d2 ] , [ B x g4 ]  My bishop is not lost because of...
 [ a x b4 ]  [ a x b4 ] , [ e5 ]  Occupying the centre and preparing ...[ B e6 ] at the cost of weakening [ d6 ] and possibly d5.
 [ c6 ] , [ B f4 # ]  
 [ Q f3 + ]  [ K h2 ]  [ Q f2 + ]  [ K h3 ]  [ Q f3 + ]  [ K h2 ]  [ Q f2 + ]  [ K h3 ] , [ Q f3 + ]  36. ...... [ Q f3 + ] - after the hypnotic last few moves I break the trance by declaring the game drawn on the grounds of Threefold Repetition because my opponent set up conditional moves. Even though I am still four material points to the good and am more than 100 points north of my opponent's rating there is nothing better than to settle for the perpetual. My opponent extracts a 3.8 rating point tariff off me taking me below 1850. Thankfully a dour high draw against a Class B 1900+ player cancelled out the lost points here. There will soon be another annotation posted. In that game Henry will get the fright of his life again from the Wicked Witch of the West this time against a Class D player. Thankfully that game will end in victory for Yours Truly but not without some heavy weather. Anyhow hope you have a good read and are enjoying this beautiful English spring weather! Bye for now - Joanne
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N x e5 ] , [ c6 ]  This simply loses a pawn - [ d6 ] (Nf3) [ N x e4 ] is much better here
 [ N c8 ]  [ Q a4 + ]  [ K e7 ] , [ Q c2 ]  21. [ Q c2 ] - Glenda hides herself from possible rook attack but not for long!
 [ R x a2 ]  [ Q x a2 ]  [ R c1 ]  [ R d8 ]  [ Q e5 ]  [ R x d3 ]  [ Q x c7 ]  [ Q x b2 + ]  [ R c2 ] , [ R d2 + ]  I thought this was very good. Forcing a trade of rooks and attacking my king.
 [ N f3 ]  [ g5 ]  [ h4 ]  [ g4 ] , [ N e5 ]  5. [ N e5 ] - this is the Kiezeritzky Variation. An alternative is the Allgaier Gambit which is [ N g5 ] where the knight is sacrificed for two pawns to expose the BK in my case my seafood-loving king Henry!
 [ N b6 ]  [ B d3 ] , [ N b x d5 ]  10. ..... N[ b x d5 ] - this pawn could not be sustained. Things are gonna start hotting up over the next few moves.
 [ f2 ] , [ N e8 ]  My knight is now targeted by his rook which would create major danger as the rook will then target [ g7 ] again. White knight to [ f6 + ] is also something to keep in mind. However
 [ R b2 ] , [ R x a3 ]  
 [ B b7 ] , [ B g5 ]  Plan develop bishop before e3. Goal: Set up king side attack with all pieces.
 [ B b4 ]  [ a3 ]  [ B a5 ]  [ b4 ] , [ B b6 ]  The aim is to attract defense pawns in the advanced position to block other pieces
 [ N f6 ] , [ N f3 ]  2. [ N f3 ] - out come the horsies!
 [ R f8 ]  [ N g7 ]  [ K g2 ]  [ R f6 ]  [ B c3 ] , [ K e7 ]  This was out of hope rather than expectation...
 [ N f3 ]  [ g5 ]  [ h4 ] , [ g4 ]  4. ..... [ g4 ] - fairly standard play so far but now here comes the .......
 [ N x e7 ]  [ K x e7 ] , [ R h e1 + ]  We haven't reached 20 moves yet and it's already an end game - or will be very shortly. Salo Flohr used apparently to describe as 'titanic struggles' the games of Grandmasters that featured a series of even exchanges until the handshake over the bare Kings remaining on the board. For the spectator - who may have paid money to see the giants have at it - the absence of struggle would have come as more than a disappointment. At this point I rather thought this game was going the same way and was regretting my choice of opening.
 [ e6 ]  [ B b2 ] , [ N f6 ]  Everything until now is fine and quite common that's where the fun begins.
 [ e5 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ h6 ]  [ N g e4 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ g5 ]  [ Q h5 ] , [ B x e5 ]  He doesn't know it yet but black just lost with that move.
 [ K d3 ]  [ N x b7 ]  [ K e4 ] , [ h5 ]  !! The key to my whole [ N a5 ] plan. The h5-pawn will drop. But my king has time to hold the [ f3 ] pawn and the knight arrives in time to stop it being swapped off. 74 [ K f5 ] ... [ K d5 ] 75 [ K g5 ] ... [ K e4 ] 76[ K x h5 ] ... K[ f3 ] And black wins. If white tries to play [ K h4 ] [ h3 ] and trade the g-pawn off then black has time to play [ N d6 ] [ N f5 ] ! and force the king away from the h3-pawn's defence.
 [ e4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ d x e4 ] , [ B x e4 ]  You must admit my style is weird :)
 [ B c7 ] , [ d4 ]  Oh yes he caught me. Oh well...
 [ R e8 + ]  [ K d3 ]  [ f6 ] , [ K d2 ]  34. [ K d2 ] - preparing Re1.
 [ R x e5 ] , [ B x e5 ]  Now it's all over but the shouting.
 [ e3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N f3 ] , [ c5 ]  Committing to queenside play.
 [ B c6 ] , [ R e8 ]  White attacks the vulnerable [ b7 ] pawn but Black counters with [ R e8 ] which threatens a discovered attack skewering of White's queen...Black is slowly uncoiling like a snake preparing to strike...
 [ R b1 ] , [ R d4 ]  I wasn't realy sure what he was doing here except from maybe trying to put more pressure on the [ e4 ] square. He would have been down on exchanges so this didn't really make much sense to me. Maybe he had something up his sleeve.
 [ a3 ]  [ B x h3 ]  [ R x h3 ] , [ N d7 ]  Black wants the N to go to c5.
 [ f5 ]  [ R e5 ]  [ R g4 ] , [ R x f5 ]  32. ......... [ R x f5 ] - another white pawn bites the dust.
 [ e4 ] , [ Q e3 ]  Moving to cover [ c3 ] but black has a resource.
 [ R b6 ] , [ d6 ]  Blocks the rooks involvement and the prospect of promotion could become a real thorn in blacks side.
 [ g4 ]  [ B g6 ]  [ N a4 ] , [ c x d4 ]  Uh oops. A brief review is in order. 1. Can you force mate? (No). 2. Can you prevent force mate? (None appears imminent). 3. Can you take a high value piece (HVP)? 4. [And this is critical here] Can you prevent your opponent seizing a HVP? Something should be done to prevent N[ x Q b6 ] like [ Q c7 ] or Qd8. [ Q c6 ] is ok too if NxP[ d4 ] then QxNa4.
 [ B c2 ] , [ c5 ]  10. ........ [ c5 ] - a queenside expansion and I have a lead in development.
 [ B x c5 ]  [ Q x c5 ] , [ b4 ]  Last resource but now just by retiring the Q I have no way out. Of course but... where to retire the Q? Nowhere to prevent a N's check. He can take it... the next move.
 [ N d4 ]  [ R e4 ]  [ Q h3 ]  [ R c e8 ]  [ K f2 ]  [ Q g6 ]  [ R g1 ]  [ R e4 e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ R e5 e7 ]  [ N h4 ]  [ Q b6 ] , [ b4 ]  White is having trouble making progress but this simply weakens the a pawn
 [ N x b3 ]  [ Q x b3 ] , [ Q c8 ]  Qc8? I dont see a real significant reason why the opponent would do this move. Engine suggests Bc6.
 [ R e1 ]  [ K h8 ]  [ Q f3 ] , [ N g4 ]  17. …… [ N g4 ] - trying to ward off any frontal attacks to my king's position.
 [ R h8 + ]  [ K g7 ]  [ R b8 ] , [ d4 ]  The reason being is that with this move black's passer on [ d4 ] is protected by his Q. And black can clear a path by moving his [ [ d3 ] ] Q to allow ...[ [ d3 ] ] and if white protects and attacks after with [ N b4 ] black can answer with ...[ c5 ] not just attacking the N but achieving another pawn chain in the process.
 [ K c5 ]  [ b3 ]  [ K b4 ]  [ b2 ]  [ B g6 ]  [ N c6 + ]  [ K b3 ]  [ N d4 + ]  [ K x b2 ]  [ K d6 ]  [ K c3 ]  [ N e2 + ]  [ K b4 ]  [ N x g3 ]  [ K a5 ]  [ K e5 ]  [ K x a6 ]  [ K f4 ]  [ B e8 ]  [ g4 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ N f5 ]  [ B c6 ]  [ g3 ]  [ K b6 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ B h1 ]  [ N f5 ]  [ K c5 ]  [ K e3 ]  [ K d5 ]  [ N h4 ] , [ K e6 ]  I don't know if was important to dodge Black's check move. But to error on the right then to error wrong
 [ B x c3 ]  [ b x c3 ]  [ N e4 ] , [ Q g4 ]  ! Double threat in [ e4 ] and g7.
 [ f x e5 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ Q x e5 ] , [ Q e2 ]  Now the game begins to get interesting with a knight sacrifice. After I had played [ Q e2 ] I began to worry as I had seen the discovered attack a second after I had clicked submit. But after a while I had seen it was actually going to give me a better game if the knight was taken if he played b4.
 [ Q e4 ] , [ B d4 ]  Finally I achieved where I wanted to be and I'm already threatening a checkmate. Also at this point I saw a winning tactic.
 [ O-O ] , [ B d4 ]  I take a good diagonal while I can.
 [ g6 ] , [ Q h4 ]  With that being said I would've continued with 19.[ Q h6 ] but I like this move just as well especially since her [ N f2 ] is about to become a monster.
 [ f3 ]  [ O-O-O ]  [ N d2 ] , [ B h6 ]  11. ..........[ B h6 ] - black is fully developed and the dsb controls a vital diagonal which will ensure a lethal queen check on [ e3 ] later on. White is still to castle and his lsb is still blocked in. White is also in grave danger of being pinned on the e file.
 [ K f8 ]  [ Q h8 + ]  [ R g8 ] , [ Q f6 ]  Now i think the next move by black is a rook-move
 [ h x g1 = Q + ]  [ R x g1 ]  [ Q f3 + ] , [ K e1 ]  Forced.
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ d6 ] , [ N c3 ]  Book play in the Old Indian Defense.
 [ e6 ] , [ b3 ]  ? His position is becoming weaker with every pawn move. Develop!!! If a pawn must move at least move [ d2 ] so two pieces can be developed.
 [ f x e4 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ B b4 + ] , [ K e2 ]  We can see white is looking pretty screwed now that Black has the tempo.
 [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ B c4 ] , [ e6 ]  looks like the beginning of the Ruy vs. the sicillian def.
 [ N b5 ]  [ B c5 ] , [ a4 ]  17. [ a4 ] - to avoid my knight getting trapped.
 [ c4 ]  [ Q b7 ] , [ N c3 ]  The knight returns to c3.
 [ e x d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ R a d8 ] , [ Q b3 ]  ? allowing black to keep an extra pawn
 [ R c2 ]  [ R f1 ]  [ R d2 ]  [ a6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ Q e4 ]  [ B x f2 + ]  [ R x f2 ]  [ R d1 + ]  [ K g2 ]  [ B d5 ]  [ Q x d5 ]  [ R x d5 ] , [ a7 ]  
 [ B x g2 ]  [ c7 + ]  [ K x b7 ]  [ R b1 + ]  [ K c8 ]  [ B x a6 + ]  [ K d7 ]  [ Q b5 + ]  [ K e7 ] , [ B a3 # ]  
 [ N f6 ]  [ B b2 ]  [ B d6 ] , [ d3 ]  8. [ d3 ] - preparing Nd2.
 [ B d6 ] , [ B x d7 ]  ...which I remove...
 [ d3 ]  [ B c5 ] , [ B e3 ]  White: Time to start chasing the Queen around while developing my pieces.
 [ R f1 ] , [ N a6 ]  15. ..... [ N a6 ] - bit worried about the WR and Glenda being on the same file. I do a Risk Assessment and decide that she is OK there for now and decided to clear the decks on my back row.
 [ c6 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ b3 ]  [ h5 ] , [ B a3 ]  White is probably right to bypass BxP[ h5 ] as this opens black's rook file on white's castle. While this moves leaves the white knight undefended white can counter with a pawn fork. White's castle pawns suffer and white doubles pawns but also attacks the [ d6 ] pawn.
 [ e5 ] , [ B f8 ]  I found this move in a database I have to admit and I really liked it so I decided to try it. Isn't it why these tournaments are for?
 [ B g3 ] , [ N d e7 ]  21... [ N d e7 ] B does not have many choices as W's dominance on the a8-[ h1 ] diagonal is significant. The choices are to release the Q Rook from behind that pin by the W King's Bishop but give up that isolated Pawn on a7. That Pawn is often a winner for B in many variations where B is successful in launching a Q-side attack. But here it is totally stalled. So the only other choice for B is to reinforce the Knight at [ c6 ] and maintain the block on that diagonal. What will give first?
 [ B x f7 + ]  [ K f8 ] , [ Q b5 ]  Terrible move and served no purpose. I should have gone Bxe8.
 [ Q x h1 ] , [ Q f8 ]  At this point I think I might have done best to abandon the knight and move the a pawn forward so my king can escape
 [ N e5 ] , [ R x b7 ]  Restoring material equality and invading my seventh rank. It's all in good measure since the pawn centre has been fixed the Bishop pair isn't doing much at the moment and the best pawn has been preserved.
 [ B e6 ]  [ N c e3 ]  [ f5 ]  [ g x f6 ]  [ e ] , [ p ]  Otherwise ...[ f4 ] would be a strong threat.
 [ R h e1 ]  [ R a c8 ]  [ Q g3 ] , [ R x c2 + ]  I dont' know if this is the BEST move in this position but it will lead to a winning position
 [ Q e4 + ] , [ K h8 ]  the finish might have been 27 [ g3 ] hx[ g3 ] 28 [ h3 ] [ R d e8 ] 29 [ Q a4 ] Qd7! with mate to soon follow or the taking of the knight if 30 Qa3.
 [ Q c3 ]  [ R f6 ]  [ d4 ] , [ g5 ]  Now I start pushing my pawns forward mainly to get them promoted but even if that fails I should be able to get into a more advantageous position than the one I'm in right now.
 [ B d7 ]  [ Q e2 ] , [ R e8 ]  13. ..... [ R e8 ] - placing a black rook on the same file as King Les and his better half. Les must watch out for a possible pin down the e column.
 [ N f6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ e6 ] , [ B g5 ]  The idea behind the bishop move is to exchange the defender of the e4-square and play e4.
 [ c6 ]  [ Q x c6 ] , [ R a d8 ]  hoping to provide my bishop with some backup
 [ g6 ] , [ B x e4 + ]  16. [ B x e4 + ] - nice to close the material deficit to just two points. Look how the ecclesiastical brothers Fou Leblanc and Fou Lenoir are lined up on the BK.
 [ R b4 x b7 + ]  [ R x b7 ] , [ c x b7 ]  ...as you can see.
 [ h3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N b5 ]  [ N b4 ]  [ c3 ]  [ N b d5 ]  [ Q e5 ]  [ N b6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ N x c4 ] , [ Q x c5 ]  both having equal material
 [ Q h6 ] , [ d5 ]  He could trade queens on [ h7 ] and win another pawn
 [ O-O ] , [ c3 ]  Black finally castles behind a somewhat weakened defence. The computer actually has me ahead but it didn't feel that way as I drive away one Knight.
 [ B e7 ] , [ N x d5 ]  White is just losing material here.
 [ c5 ] , [ g5 ]  !? I should be assigning my resources to the taming of the passed pawn rather than going after irrelevant pawns on the other side of the board. I rationalised to myself that since black woldn't want to trade rooks on the h file my rook would have enough time to reactivate my.
 [ d6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ b6 ] , [ d4 ]  I'm trying to start an attack
 [ d4 ] , [ f5 ]  I don't play the Dutch Defense anymore after getting a cramped position from this game now I think that 1...[ c5 ] is the sharpest move against 1.[ d4 ]  [ e3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ Q h5 + ]  [ g6 ]  [ Q d1 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ f4 ]  This move locks the center and kingside from expanding so most of the expansion ideas will lie on the queenside.
 [ O-O ] , [ f x e6 ]  If 9... QxN? 10 R-[ K1 ] wins the Q.
 [ B x a1 ]  [ Q x a1 ]  [ N x c5 ] , [ Q d4 ]  Good move. Your attacking my knight and pawn while preparing for [ B c3 ] to threaten mate.
 [ Q c8 ] , [ Q b4 ]  Now it looks interesting to give a knight for two pawns and getting at least two connected free pawns. The question is whether to play a move like [ Q a6 ] before or not. It is better because it puts the queen to a more active place and raises the opportunity to get 3 connected free pawns.
 [ O-O ] , [ e5 ]  9 [ [ c3 ] ] was probably the best try. Weaker was 9 0-0-0 [ a6 ] 10 [ [ c3 ] ] [ b5 ] 11 [ B b3 ] [ b4 ] 12 cx[ b4 ] cx[ b4 ] 13 [ N c4 ] [ a5 ] with the threat of ... [ a4 ]  [ d x e5 ] , [ B x e5 ]  this hands black the two bishops but 10 [ N x e5 ] is well met by [ N a5 ] gaining the two bishops that way.
 [ R d8 ] , [ Q e1 ]  The only meaningful place for the queen
 [ h6 ] , [ R a b1 ]  White continues to organize for a queenside strike.
 [ e x d5 ] , [ Q x d5 ]  Worth a '!'
 [ h3 ] , [ B d7 ]  [ B f5 ] would have been better but Anu wanted the queen behind the bishop for the threat of [ B x h3 ] later on. However I still recommend Bf5.
 [ K d4 ]  [ R g3 ]  [ R x g5 ] , [ R e3 ]  After good maneuvering by black this endgame has been converted. The white king now has no shot at stopping the f pawn because of the rook on the e-file and the white rook can't move off the 5 column or the black king can advance and capture the [ g4 ] pawn.
 [ Q e5 + ] , [ K d7 ]  And now white has no checks. His rook on [ g6 ] is en prise as is his pawn on b2.
 [ N d4 ]  [ Q g5 + ] , [ K d6 ]  A Queen trade on [ f6 ] would probably would have won him the game...
 [ N x d7 ]  [ K x d7 ] , [ B x d6 ]  I almost played 21.[ N x g5 ] but this is the move that would've won back material. And that was also one of the reasons I didn't say anything right away about 19...Kc6?? Play it wrong and she wins back a piece for pawn. I couldn't allow that because if I'm not at the best she isn't going to learn. The idea is to teach chess in it's most difficult form.
 [ K g2 ]  [ Q f1 + ] , [ K h2 ]  Now RxB would have been decisive but I wanted to go further.
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ d5 ] , [ b5 ]  One of my favourites
 [ N f3 ] , [ B g4 ]  Another reasonable alternative here is 3... g6. I prefer the more common move I played here.
 [ B h4 + ]  [ g3 ]  [ B f6 ]  [ b5 ]  [ d5 ] , [ Q a4 ]  I like [ Q b4 ] a little better. The bishop behind the queen make for a formidable array though black could easily block with [ B e7 ] and there is always the entertaining possibility black may overlook BxRf8.
 [ d x e5 ] , [ d x e5 ]  ?! I think this is probably a mistake; Black now cannot avoid the loss of a pawn. Probably 7...[ B x f3 ] 8.[ Q x f3 ] [ d x e5 ] was a better move order as now White can break the pin with tempo. So Black is the first to miss a quick safety check and the balance swings in White's favor.
 [ d5 ] , [ g5 ]  The computer calls this a mistake - 20. [ [ g5 ] ] [ c x d3 + ] 21. [ K f2 ] [ Q h8 ] 22. [ Q x h8 + ] [ K x h8 ] 23. [ N g3 ] [ B c5 + ] 24. [ K g2 ] [ R f b8 ] 25. [ R b1 ] [ R b4 ] 26. [ K f3 ] [ R a b8 ] 27. [ B b3 ] [ R x b3 ] 28. [ a x b3 ] [ R x b3 ] 29. [ R b d1 ] [ K g7 ] preferring 20. [ B c2 ] [ R f d8 ] 21. [ [ g5 ] ] [ Q h8 ] 22. [ Q x h8 + ] [ K x h8 ] 23. [ N e3 ] [ c x d3 + ] 24. [ K x d3 ] [ R a7 ] 25. [ e x d5 ] [ c x d5 ] 26. [ B b3 ] [ R a d7 ] 27. [ R h c1 ] [ K g7 ] My idea was to push the black queen away if I could
 [ K b2 ]  [ K a6 ]  [ R c4 ]  [ K b6 ]  [ R c3 ]  [ R g2 + ]  [ R c2 ]  [ R g3 ]  [ R d2 ] , [ K a5 ]  At this point the game was agreed a draw. White will have a very difficult time advancing his pawns.
 [ b6 ] , [ N c3 ]  Trying attack on Queen side.
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ B b5 ]  Sicilian-Rossolimo Variation. I had just learned the opening.
 [ e6 ]  [ B g5 ] , [ R f8 ]  Black moves his rook for no discernible reason.
 [ N c6 ] , [ K e1 ]  Frees up my dark Bishop. I figured that it was bad to have 4 of my back row pieces still unactivated.
 [ R f d1 ]  [ B x f4 ] , [ g x f4 ]  The g-file has been opened. Now White just needs to bring a rook to the g-file.
 [ K g3 ]  [ R b8 ]  [ b6 ]  [ B x b6 ]  [ a x b6 ]  [ R x a3 + ]  [ R x a3 ]  [ R x b6 ] , [ R a7 ]  Now I have evened the position and pinned his king to the back rank unless [ h6 ] then Kh7.
 [ c5 ]  [ b x c5 ]  [ b x c5 ]  [ R x c5 ]  [ R b7 + ] , [ K g6 ]  Because black had already moved off of the back rank he wasn't trapped like white's king.
 [ R f d1 ] , [ c5 ]  With pieces off the board and a Bishop staring at the queenside Black needs to start thinking about pawn action.
 [ Q x b7 ] , [ N a5 ]  Perhaps the only choice? But it takes the Knight out of the fight. A Knight on the rim is grim.
 [ B b2 ]  [ R x e3 ]  [ B d4 ] , [ R x g3 ]  
 [ B x f8 ]  [ Q x f8 ]  [ f4 ]  [ B f6 ] , [ Q e3 ]  Attacking the weak point
 [ N g5 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ N x e6 ] , [ f x e6 ]  Better was 9...nf6.
 [ K f4 ] , [ g3 # ]  Jamie told me he's been really busy with work lately and I think luck played a big part in this victory. I will attempt to learn all of my opponents' professions and time my games accordingly. Teachers= end of May/early June. Accountants= early to mid April. Astronauts cowboys and world presidents... I got nothing.
 [ R x c4 ]  [ N e2 ] , [ R x a4 ]  I knew it.
 [ c5 ] , [ B x f7 + ]  At least I'll get a pawn and disturb his king.
 [ c x d4 ]  [ c x d4 ] , [ N b4 ]  15. ... Nb4! Nice move! now 16. ... [ N c2 ] will get me into trouble as my attack is not yet strong. 16. [ R e c1 ] is usual play move; 16. [ R e c1 ] [ R x c1 ] 17. [ R x c1 ] Nxa2! strong move! if 17. [ Q x c1 ] [ N d3 ] 18. [ Q d2 ] [ N x f4 ] my attack neutralize. Hmm.
 [ R x a7 ]  [ R b6 ] , [ R a5 ]  White now wins the other weak pawn that he created on the 5th move!
 [ N b3 ] , [ N g e7 ]  ...but then I decided this plan was too passive. This was a mistake. I had to keep my bishop even if it meant to leave the knight trapped on his home square. I didn't like it at all so I realized my previous plan was pure crap. Ok. So I'll act as if it all was part of a plan (sometime it works and surely makes your opponent think a lot more :-))) (Don't try it with good players!)
 [ K g8 ] , [ Q x f6 ]  This is peculiar. The computer analysis says that this was a blunder??? I agree with what others say about the computer analysis "The computer is not always right " and I certainly agree with that in this case. I do not see how this is a blunder at all. I'm thinking maybe the computer feels that white lost the quickest way to checkmate or something but white is just positioning himself for checkmate. It will be over in 3 moves anyway and I am certain the computer messed up here.
 [ e x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ Q x d4 ] , [ N f6 ]  ?! This however is where I wind up getting myself into trouble. This is where I hyperfocus on development since the idea is as Carlson taught develop your pieces get the K to safety and control the center. Now as I still must be specific GAC showed a game in a private annotation where a GM did not do that any of that violated all the principles and wound up losing quickly. I kept that in mind and decided that I didn't want to end up like that GM. So I figured that this was best. But what I had to keep to in mind which I forgot here is that there are exceptions to the guidelines which sometimes you can't follow if a threat looms. I overlooked it. And while this is not a passer I learned something as I always thought it required a passed pawn. What I learned is that you don't need a passer for a pawn to be considered dangerous. I overlooked that and hyperfocusing on opening guidelines has left this N en-prise. However it is worse then it appears as I'm about to explain.
 [ R x a2 ] , [ R a8 # ]  
 [ K e1 ] , [ N x h1 + ]  Only one move again now it looks bad.
 [ N e4 ]  [ Q e3 ] , [ f5 ]  Black confessed afterwards that [ f5 ] was a poor decision.
 [ B f5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ B g4 ] , [ N b d2 ]  Wiki recommends 4. ... [ e6 ] to shore up the center followed by 5. ... [ c5 ] to challenge the center. Black instead opts to pin the white knight losing a tempo by moving his bishop a second time. In return white defends with the queen's knight a move I got no doubt from the GK DB though I don't like it much myself. Now white's queen's bishop is blocked. More to my taste would have been 5. [ B f4 ] followed by 6. Nbd2. I don't see anything wrong with that move order but the DB doesn't favor it.

 [ K c3 ]  [ e x d4 + ]  [ Q x d4 ]  [ Q x e4 ] , [ Q x e4 ]  He had to do this because I had [ Q c2 ] and that would be very inconvenient for him. Also his g pawn is under alot of pressure.
 [ R x b1 ]  [ R x b1 + ]  [ K h2 ] , [ B d3 ]  Now the knight must be sacrificed as well. 0-1. This game illustrates how to convert advantage in space. White found himself behind in development and with less space. His attempts to exchange pieces cost more time and he was not able to match the activity of the black piece swhen the final break game.

 [ B x f6 ]  [ Q x f6 ]  [ N x c7 + ]  [ R x c7 ] , [ Q x c7 ]  18. [ Q x c7 ] - after exchanging his dsb for my king knight white wins the exchange. But that is only for starters. I would have also been a whole rook down because [ B e7 ] was the only way to avoid immediate mate. Rather than resign on the grounds of ruinous loss of material I simply allowed sudden death on the next turn. So that is Game 1 lost and although Game 2 against The Brigadier was a marginal improvement I still managed to get Fou Leblanc trapped and found another way for Henry to cop Old Matey. However despite this loss and the other two losses I am about to annotate I am keeping my chin up - cheers and bye for now - Joanne
 [ Q e3 ]  [ B x f1 ] , [ K x f1 ]  white has to take with the king otherwise the h pawn falls. Although unable to castle this shouldn't be too much of a problem with the centre blocked.
 [ g4 ] , [ N c2 ]  I could have played 30. ... [ N x f4 ] to capture at least one pawn in exchange for the doomed knight. But I think adjacent passed pawns on the queenside is a better way to gain a pawn. I truly expected white to defend with 31. [ R e4 ] which allows my knight to escape his doom with 31. ... [ f5 ] 32. Px[ f5 ] [ N f6 ] and now white must save his rook but all the squares on the 4th rank are covered so he cannot continue to protect his pawn at b4. End result an even exchange of pawns and black's knight escapes with that deadly pair of passed pawns on the queenside.
 [ h6 ]  [ h4 ]  [ h5 ]  [ f4 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ K f2 ] , [ R e7 ]  A move showing I don't know where to go.
 [ R b1 + ] , [ R b6 ]  Black doesn't fall for it and forces white to spend a number of moves taking the knight at [ a1 ]  [ R x b6 + ]  [ a x b6 ]  [ K d2 ]  [ h6 ]  [ B h4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ K c1 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ B d5 ]  [ g5 ]  [ B g3 ] , [ h5 ]  I expected 26... [ N h5 ] here as I think it is in black's favour to take one of my knights off the board. This seems to help white slightly.
 [ e5 ]  [ g3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ B g2 ] , [ f5 ]  3. ...................... [ f5 ] - in response to The English Opening Ion decides to expand on the kingside. Maybe there are possibilities of a kingside attack but black must be very watchful of action down The Fool's Mate Diagonal particularly from the enemy queen in the opening. This formation is his favorite response to the English Opening. Having had some affinity with the Dutch Defence this is a very aggressive line. A good example of the way the game can develop is cormel vs ionadowman played a couple of years ago.
 [ Q b7 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ B x d5 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ h6 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ R d2 ] , [ c4 ]  ! Freezes White's Q-side pawns.
 [ N d6 ] , [ R f4 ]  this is the worst!!!!
 [ N x d4 ]  [ a6 ]  [ B e2 ] , [ Q x g2 ]  Stealing a pawn. The consequences are grievous.
 [ e4 ]  [ R d2 ] , [ g5 ]  Advancing to squeeze the kings position.

 [ f6 ]  [ g x f6 + ]  [ K x f6 ]  [ b4 ] , [ B d1 ]  39. [ B d1 ] - played to halt the advance of my b pawn.
 [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ e x d6 ]  !? Change of plan from me - it's not a bad move really but perhaps I ought to have stuck with my plan?
 [ d3 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ c3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ N e7 ]  [ B x c5 ] , [ N x d5 ]  I could've just taken his offending bishop but this seems to clear out the centre a bit and I should hopefully be a pawn up.
 [ R c6 ] , [ R d7 ]  preparing the eventual [ N c7 ] to protect [ b5 ]  [ R b6 ]  [ N c7 ]  [ a4 ]  [ b x a4 ] , [ b x a4 ]  This is the last threat by white. If it does not succeed it is over.
 [ e4 ]  [ c6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ d5 ] , [ e5 ]  The Advance Variation.
 [ B b7 ] , [ c x d5 ]  I take out his remaining center pawn.
 [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ g6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ B g7 ]  Kings Indian defence black will look to quickly get the king castled then see where they will later seek play
 [ R d6 ] , [ R e4 e2 + ]  ...and attack the king...
 [ g3 ]  [ Q e7 + ]  [ Q e2 ] , [ B d6 ]  It's astonishing how bad white's play allows me to play confortably without any of the Qside pieces developed.
 [ B e7 + ] , [ B d6 ]  Just loses but 41... [ K c6 ] 42. [ B x b4 ] is also bad.
 [ B f8 ]  [ Q h4 ] , [ N x b4 ]  Black got two pawns due to [ N a6 ] so ...
 [ K d7 ] , [ R e f8 ]  I reunite my rooks. Boy this is tough and taking some time to work out. Cat and mouse at the moment.
 [ c3 ]  [ b5 ] , [ B c2 ]  considered [ B b3 ] but the text move secures the [ e4 ] pawn
 [ B e7 ] , [ N f5 ]  I prefer 0-0 with [ f4 ] [ Q e2 ] and e5.
 [ N x d6 + ]  [ K d7 ]  [ Q x g7 + ]  [ K x d6 ] , [ R f6 # ]  The overall morals to this story is that it's important to be aware of all threats made by your opponent. That's important because she started with an advantage early on but lost it by allowing white to take away her weakest pawn. This also applies to John because he overlooked a Knight fork by playing 22.e4?? That fork would've lost a P+R for a bishop which would've given Sue back her advantage. But the other lesson is even though you generally don't want to liquidate pieces when behind there are times where this is a must. So to figure this out it's important to evaluate what piece is more dangerous. With that being said had Sue allowed an exchange with 24...[ Q e8 ] she might have gotten counterplay. Even if not she would've lasted longer. @knightrider62: This is also important to keep in mind in case you wind up with a similar situation in the future. The idea being is that it's essential to access the positions carefully. If you can remember this and the other lesson you will make further improvements faster then you might realize.
 [ d6 ]  [ d3 ] , [ Q e7 ]  Not sure if this is the best move. He should have moved out his bishop and got it developed before involving his queen.
 [ b x c4 ]  [ d x c4 ] , [ e4 ]  he gets the center but strangely enough I don't feel any danger here.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ d3 ] , [ d6 ]  counterattacking
 [ b4 ] , [ N g4 ]  i saw a possibility for a queen sac and a quick mate i was just hoping that fedayn won't see it
 [ Q x g2 ]  [ K b1 ] , [ Q h3 ]  Offering the exchange of queens. I have a strong attack going on not to mention that I'm a piece and 2 pawns up.
 [ f5 ] , [ R h1 ]  Again white is focusing on pawns instead of notices the threat to his bishop.
 [ h x g3 ] , [ K c7 ]  And now he starts centralizing his K. Of course it's not centralized yet because in order for you to be able to do that my K would have to be forced on one square which would allow mate. But that's his plan.
 [ Q e8 ]  [ Q b3 + ] , [ Q f7 ]  And if White is going to offer me a chance to swap queens you bet I'm going to take it.
 [ B d3 ] , [ d x e5 ]  Starting to split apart White's center.
 [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ] , [ c x d4 ]  A nice center for white already.
 [ b5 ] , [ R g c1 ]  It is better to leave the phantom of an attack on the h column (I have no time to double the rooks on the h column... do I?)
 [ B h4 + ]  [ K d2 ]  [ c6 ]  [ R g4 ]  [ B f6 ] , [ R a g1 ]  Doubling on the g-file.
 [ N c5 ]  [ N x c5 ] , [ R x c5 ]  19. ....... [ R x c5 ] - now one pair of knights.
 [ K d2 ] , [ R a b8 ]  The queen doesn't look lost does it? Alas its either the King or the Queen.
 [ K c6 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ K b5 ]  [ K d4 ]  [ K a4 ]  [ K c3 ] , [ B b5 ]  But black once again "sees" it. The game is over.
 [ e x f3 ]  [ g x f3 ]  [ Q g5 + ] , [ K f2 ]  believe it or not i felt secure though they are a lot of threats here. but black misses some material...
 [ e x f4 ] , [ R e7 ]  At least it keeps the R safe.
 [ K g6 ]  [ R x e7 ]  [ b5 ]  [ R x d5 ] , [ R d8 ]  and i'm a knight up
 [ N f6 ]  [ b3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ B b2 ] , [ c6 ]  I won't comment much on the opening; it's a very reserved Anglo-Indian setup. Unbeknownst to me at the time we stay on-book for the first ten moves or so.
 [ c5 ] , [ c3 ]  gambit not accepted.
 [ B x e4 ]  [ Q e6 ]  [ B x c6 ]  [ b x c6 ] , [ Q b3 + ]  ...white gets a chance to take a sting out of the attack....
 [ K f7 ] , [ Q h5 + ]  But this is a good check as it is hard to attack the white queen while it is on [ h5 ]  [ K g8 ] , [ B d3 ]  [ b d3 ] is an excellent move it develops a piece which needs developing and threatens [ Q h7 ] mate!
 [ K d6 ]  [ g5 ]  [ K c5 ]  [ g4 ]  [ K b5 ]  [ g3 ]  [ B x g3 + ]  [ K x g3 ]  [ K x a5 ]  [ K f4 ] , [ K x b4 ]  
 [ N e4 ] , [ g6 ]  desperately seeking for [ K g7 ] and releasing Rh8...
 [ d x e5 ] , [ N e8 ]  This move further binds me up
 [ d4 ] , [ f5 ]  The Dutch Defense.
 [ B c2 ] , [ e4 ]  Just classical control of squares. White can only retreat.
 [ N e2 ]  [ R f7 ]  [ N f4 ]  [ R f6 ]  [ N x g6 ] , [ R x g6 ]  If Black is foolish enough to exchange Rooks the King ending remaining is an easy win.
 [ N e5 ] , [ B e2 ]  again - don't want to swap pieces - need to stay attacking
 [ B f4 ] , [ N d4 ]  This is probably not a good move. I was looking around and suddenly realized that I had few good moves and white's control of the center was better than I had credited him. This breaks that up a bit but at the cost of doubling my pawns on the d-file. I reasoned that with an open c-file I would launch a rook fusillade at the backward white c-pawn enticing it forward to allow one of my d-pawns to exchange for it. Still a weak plan. In retrospect I really should have played something like 10. ... [ a6 ] followed by 11. ... [ b5 ] and then maybe developed my queen's bishop.
 [ N f6 ] , [ N c3 ]  interesting symmetry I also chose not to take
 [ f5 ] , [ g3 ]  So was start as a standard Dutch defence
 [ N b x d7 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N b6 ] , [ d3 ]  I'm pretty sure a master would find fault with these moves. But Black is wanting to recapture the piece and control the center. Black also worries a bit about getting castled.
 [ g x h5 ] , [ Q f4 ]  And that is also why Goryachkina plays this.
 [ h6 ]  [ g x h6 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ h x g7 + ]  Sweeping aside the flimsy Pawn shield.
 [ N e5 ] , [ B x e5 ]  I'm thinking that with the central squares closed up with pawns having a knight and bishop against two bishops may help me out.
 [ B e2 ]  [ g6 ]  [ f4 ] , [ h5 ]  black is still pawn pushing?
 [ R h1 + ]  [ K g7 ]  [ K c3 ]  [ R d8 ]  [ R g1 + ]  [ B g6 ]  [ K b3 ]  [ R d5 ]  [ R e1 ] , [ R d4 ]  Intending ...Re4. There's little White can do at this point; Black's advantages steadily grow with accurate play.
 [ N c3 ]  [ e6 ] , [ a3 ]  Restraining Black's dark-squared bishop.
 [ K d6 ] , [ N e3 ]  The WT Knight is looking to post on [ g4 ] and BL needs to move his own Knight now to avoid losing his h pawn.
 [ N x f5 ]  [ e x f5 ]  [ e3 ] , [ B d6 ]  preparing for [ Q c7 ] aimed at [ h2 ] black is planing to ram my king side with pieces and probably pawns as his pawn structure doesn't foresee anything good in the endgame
 [ B e3 ]  [ R b8 ] , [ R d2 ]  holding D-pawn readying [ R d4 ]  [ K h7 ] , [ K f2 ]  I decide on K to hold K-side
 [ R a d1 ] , [ R x a2 ]  ...like this. Now white can do RxB but I don't think it was good for him. But all this STILL allows [ N e7 + ] [ K h8 ] NxB cxN Rxd5. So my plan survived only because my opponent spared me.
 [ K f8 ] , [ B x g8 ]  As it turns out black's queen has only one space 17. ... [ Q d7 ] to which she can run in which case white's bishop escapes perhaps to [ e6 ] with an attack on the harried black queen. Black might try to diffuse the situation with 17. ... [ Q x e1 ] 18. [ R x e1 ] [ R x g8 ] though white would meet that with 19. [ Q d8 ] [ K g7 ] 20. [ Q e7 ] [ K h8 ] 21. [ Q b7 ] [ N a6 ] 22. [ R e7 ] and mate to follow.
 [ e6 ]  [ R x e6 ]  [ R e4 x e6 ]  [ f x e6 ]  [ R x e6 ]  [ K f7 ]  [ R c6 ]  [ d3 ]  [ R x c5 ]  [ d2 ]  [ R d5 ]  [ K x f6 ] , [ R x d2 ]  Black has still a favorable position being one pawn up
 [ d5 ] , [ c x d5 ]  I couldn't see any reason not to take it. Possible sequence of [ N x d5 ] [ b x d5 ] [ Q x d5 ] [ R x e2 ] [ R x e2 ] Qxb8. Trades out a lot of material and I end up 5 as well as having a pawn 2 moves away from going the distance.
 [ B f5 + ] , [ K b3 ]  The king is quite safe here.
 [ b6 ]  [ b4 ]  [ R a b8 ]  [ R a b1 ]  [ b x c5 ] , [ d x c5 ]  The pressure on the Queen side pays out. Now White's pawn advantage is getting very big.
 [ N x b5 ] , [ B b7 ]  Now white must expend a tempo to keep the knight. I haven't lost my passed pawn as of yet. which I would believe blacks advantage at the moment.
 [ Q g3 ] , [ B b8 ]  Black guards his bishop on a safe square foreseeing danger for his dsb. 10. f4-[ h6 ] f6-[ [ h5 ] ] 11. g3-[ [ [ g4 ] ] ] d7-[ f6 ] 12. h6-[ g5 ] f6-[ [ [ g4 ] ] ] 13. g5-[ [ e7 ] ] g4-[ [ [ e5 ] ] ] 14. d4-[ [ [ e5 ] ] ] f8-[ e8 ] 15. g2-[ [ [ g4 ] ] ] e8-[ [ e7 ] ] 16. g4-[ [ h5 ] ] b8-[ [ [ e5 ] ] ] 17. e1-[ c1 ] c6-[ c5 ] 18. c2-[ c3 ] b7-[ b6 ]  [ B x h7 ] , [ c3 ]  The last try.
 [ B b2 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ Q e2 ]  [ d5 ] , [ O-O-O ]  White has adopted an unconventional opening and has gotten a passive position. No tactics for black are immediate but Crafty-20.14 gives the position -.54 suggesting 6... b5.
 [ K d8 ]  [ R d7 + ] , [ K c8 ]  I dont' want perpetual check.
 [ Q x f1 ]  [ R f8 ] , [ Q x a6 ]  Gaining one more pawn. Pawn grabbing felt dangerous but I eventually decided to go for it under the premise that my pieces can protect the king if they coordinate in the next few moves.
 [ N x d3 ]  [ R x d3 ]  [ R c7 + ]  [ K g6 ]  [ R c6 ]  [ R x a3 ] , [ R x b6 ]  I'd be late to save the last pawn but I can create some pressure on white.
 [ B g5 ]  [ R g8 ] , [ B f6 ]  At the same time I'm still about my [ e5 ] which I shouldn't be.
 [ B x d4 ]  [ O-O ] , [ B x f6 ]  I think that this was a mistake because It left me with an uncoordinated knight and a Bishop vs. the Bishop Pair
 [ a x b3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ R d1 ] , [ B g5 + ]  Probably not black's cleverest line. What I really want to do is trade places with my queen and bishop getting the bishop on [ d8 ] to drive off white's knight from b6. But it would take a bit of maneuvering maybe with [ Q c7 ] B[ d8 ] [ Q e7 ] - if white would even sit still for it. But this pointless check with [ B g5 + ] is just wasting time mostly though it does give a little room for the king's rook to come out and play.
 [ N c3 ] , [ O-O ]  It seems like a very bad idea to castle kingside as my h rooks file is open and he has already moved the pawns defending his king.
 [ R b8 ]  [ K f2 ]  [ R b5 ]  [ g4 ] , [ R b e5 ]  41. ..... [ R b e5 ] - trying to attack down the e column but it does not come off.
 [ B x f5 ] , [ c6 ]  Black's final mistake is fittingly a pawn advance. This opens the door for one more tactic.
 [ f x e5 ] , [ N b7 ]  Black is intent on pushing around the white queen. White could respond with PxP[ [ f6 ] ] threatening the black queen in turn. Nothing is protecting the [ e5 ] pawn except the queen and it will be lost if she moves to a4. However PxP[ [ f6 ] ] could be answered by QxPe4. White would remain down a pawn but the queen would be free to travel to the other side of the board--Qh5+. Black would probably interpose the pawn (Pg6) answered by some other great move. P[ f7 + ] maybe.
 [ N f3 ] , [ Q x e4 + ]  I captured his pawn to make us level.
 [ d5 ] , [ c4 ]  [ c4 ] the Queens gambit move.
 [ e x d4 ] , [ g4 ]  ...so White immediately responds by kicking my knight. I get an exchange which should be in my favour but my attacking prospects are being rapidly whittled away.
 [ Q b5 ]  [ Q b1 + ]  [ K h2 ]  [ Q x b3 ]  [ Q e8 + ] , [ K h6 ]  This is White's only good plan an attempt to trap the king.
 [ O-O ] , [ R e8 ]  now i like my position here i developed 3 pieces while my opponent developed 2 of them and my rook is controlling semi-opened file
 [ e x d5 ] , [ c x d5 ]  Well how about that! black has managed to create an isolated pawn. Here black is slightly better because of his superior pawn structure. But white is not without chances since the [ d5 ] pawn is well defended and cramping black's position. In short this is a very double edged position.
 [ K g7 ] , [ h4 ]  A tricky move bringing in some square control and a little threat to the bishop. Black could play 33...[ h6 ] but then the position becomes even more closed although not immediately terminal this could speed that result. This move also prevents a back rank mate on the white side of the board.
 [ B c4 ] , [ Q d7 ]  Was this move to protect f7? If so not necessary at this stage.
 [ B x g6 ]  [ c x d6 ]  [ N x c8 ] , [ R x c8 ]  now i am way behind but i still have my queen.
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ B b5 ]  White is playing a very aggressive opening.
 [ b3 ] , [ N d7 ]  Keeping it simple. If instead q[ e5 ] [ h4 ] q[ a1 + ] doesn't get anywhere and I can't see any result from the [ B h6 + ] check. Now there are lots of threats including n[ b6 ] where nx[ b6 ] ax[ b6 ] looks unstoppable and there'll still be an attack after k[ b1 ] n[ x a4 ] b[ x a4 ] qxa4. Very hard to defend now for white.
 [ B g2 ] , [ Q b5 ]  Solves the skewer but perhaps allowing the [ b7 ] pawn to fall was a quicker way to open up lines to the white king.
 [ N f5 ]  [ N x f5 ] , [ B x f5 ]  YIKES! That just happened! I win the Exchange!
 [ B g7 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ R c1 ]  This position is was played in the game Aronian-Topalov London 2015 as said. Topalov played 13 ... Bd7. My rival takes another way and I must "think" with my own head. This thinking is to follow the Aronian idea of push the h-pawn and play [ Q d2 ] making a tandam Be3-[ Q d2 ] against the dsb.
 [ Q x d5 ] , [ B x c6 + ]  This is the most common move here; White hopes to weather the storm. 7. [ B f1 ] is now too passive and usually leads to Black victory in past games in the database.
 [ e3 ]  [ e5 ]  [ d3 ] , [ d5 ]  He's letting me gain centre control maybe to launch a side attack later
 [ O-O-O ]  [ B b7 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ c5 ] , [ d5 ]  White threatens to block off my bishop so I feel I need to exchange this annoying pawn off.
 [ d5 ]  [ N x e6 ]  [ f x e6 ] , [ g5 ]  This was a mistake as the flank attack now fizzles...
 [ Q e8 ]  [ Q f4 ]  [ R g8 ]  [ Q h6 ]  [ Q f7 ] , [ e6 ]  any retreet of the black queen causes mate 34...Qf8.35.Qxh7+-Rxh7.36.[ R x h7 # ] black was crushed in this game and now black trys to earning time but no use .
 [ Q d6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N b6 ] , [ Q b3 ]  [Carlsen seeks to fully employ his pieces before determining the pawn structure on the queenside.] In that sense 16.[ b x c6 ] [ b x c6 ] (intending to create a backward pawn on c6) would be premature. Black would benefit more from opening of the position.
 [ e x d4 ] , [ Q x d4 ]  As predicted. I can't see a good move for Black. Perhaps retreat; it still has power pieces a plenty gather them all round the king and make a defiant last stand hoping for an error in the meantime. Pawn to [ e5 ] maybe for a defensive jab to give it time to achieve this end. [ c5 ] another option.
 [ h x g6 ] , [ Q x g6 + ]  Now it is definitely forced mate.
 [ R x f8 + ] , [ R x f8 ]  And white resigns. I was a little surprised as [ Q g1 ] has some possibilities. All in all a good game from my teammate utvols1:) I'm sure he will repay the favor........ - Thomas PS - Allen if this is you reading this - forget about that payback business. I'm gonna get you again:)
 [ N e5 ]  [ e x f4 ]  [ g x f4 ] , [ K b1 ]  With the K on [ c1 ] White cannot play [ Q x f4 ] due to [ N d3 + ] winning the Q.
 [ N f6 ] , [ c3 ]  looks slow but was designed to play [ d4 ] and hold the middle whilst giving the freedom for the [ a4 ] bishop to move. In hindsight this seems unnecessary.
 [ R a4 ] , [ R x g3 ]  Finally I remove a pair of major pieces.
 [ N d x e5 ]  [ N x e5 ] , [ B x e4 ]  Is your move (a) 20. Nxf7; (b) Qxg4; (c) [ Q x e4 ] or (d) [ N x e4 ] ?
 [ B x a1 ]  [ d4 ] , [ B x d4 ]  bishop up
 [ B x c4 ]  [ B x b4 ] , [ R d7 d4 ]  ? Now I'm giving back all of my material. Are you trying to draw Ali?
 [ R a e1 ] , [ R d e7 ]  I am not willing to relieve my influence on the second row.
 [ R c2 ]  [ R f d8 ]  [ Q a1 ] , [ N e8 ]  12. ...... [ N e8 ] - interesting. This move was recommended in the World DB but according to Gameknot Analysis this is an innacuracy. It does make the knight more passive I must admit.
 [ N g e7 ]  [ R f e1 ] , [ R d8 ]  good move!!! the [ d4 ] pawn is actually important for black and to defend it is a good move. 0-0-0 would have been a suicide
 [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ] , [ g6 ]  I like this style of opening although I may when given time adopt something different in the future
 [ B x d3 ]  [ Q x d3 ]  [ e6 ] , [ B f4 ]  All perfectly fine moves by both so far.
 [ Q e6 + ]  [ K h7 ]  [ g4 ]  [ R c1 ] , [ R h3 + ]  34. Rh3+! - unfortunately Henry now succumbs to a mating net before my plan can be executed.
 [ K e6 ] , [ Q g8 + ]  the final blow...
 [ d5 ]  [ Q x b4 ]  [ d x e4 ] , [ N x e4 ]  I am only down one pawn now.
 [ N d7 ] , [ d5 ]  (?!) This looks rather premature to me. Clearing away the centre as it does one is left with rather an arid looking game with neither side able to establish an ascendancy. Well appearances can fool you as you will find out! Better might have been to develop the dark-square bishop to [ e3 ] or f4.
 [ R b5 ] , [ R e5 ]  Offering again to exchange Rooks.
 [ f6 ] , [ R a8 ]  Hoping to exchange the last two rooks.
 [ K x c8 ] , [ R c f1 ]  Guarding the Pawn with a Rook.
 [ B a6 ]  [ N e2 ] , [ N c6 ]  Ok so now my pawn structure is in ruins but I've got a few options left I guess. I considered [ B g5 ] here but I thought you'd likely just [ h6 ] and force me to trade to put your Q at [ f6 ] which doesn't seem attractive for me. I would expect you'll castle as well and start moving to exploit the pawn at f3. Coaching note: a good alternative here would have been [ B a3 ] to prevent my 0-0 for a while You know I did look at that but discarded the idea since the block with [ [ d6 ] ] was so easy and then I lost the right diagonal from its current position. [ [ d6 ] ] didn't look like it would inconvenience you at all.
 [ Q d1 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ d5 ] , [ e x d5 ]  Maybe [ N c3 ] would have been better for white here instead of capturing at d5.
 [ Q e8 ]  [ B x a8 ] , [ N e7 ]  A good move I thought bringing the Knight in and of course the Queen is doing nothing wrong defending it
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ] , [ Q h5 ]  Problem number 1. Why are we moving at Queen at move 2? Bad idea. Because the Queen is the most valuable piece on the board she is also the most vulnerable because you can't trade her for anything other than another Queen which means she is now going to start running.
 [ Q g3 ] , [ g x f4 ]  Again my threat is stronger.
 [ N x e2 ] , [ c5 ]  !? The mainline suggests [ g6 ] instead but I wanted to try this one. I bet I'll find time to castle short asap.
 [ e x f6 ]  [ Q x e2 + ] , [ B x e2 ]  Batman used the king. The bishop seems like the wiser option.
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ c4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ N b d7 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ c6 ]  Most common book line to this point
 [ e5 ] , [ N d7 ]  The only possibility is moving the knight away but where to? 9...[ N h5 ] loses after 10.g4. 9...[ N g4 ] is tempting but after 10.[ B f4 ] and 11.[ h3 ] the knight needs to escape to [ h6 ] and this is bad for me. 9...[ N [ e4 ] ] weakens my center too much (10.[ N x [ e4 ] ] [ d x [ e4 ] ] 11.[ B x e7 ] [ Q x e7 ] 12.[ N d2 ] and I cannot save the pawn while the knight at [ e4 ] will have a nice outpost). So only 9...[ N d7 ] remains but this move is actually quite nice: defends [ c5 ] attacks [ e5 ] and breaks the pin on the [ c6 ] knight.
 [ f5 ] , [ Q f2 ]  Threatening the knight but the knight can be relocated.
 [ N e8 ]  [ O-O-O ]  [ f6 ]  [ g6 ] , [ h6 ]  15. ..... [ h6 ] - Joe dare not play PxP due to PxP disc. ch. Joe defends by moving his h pawn up but now I have a sacrifice planned which will lead to #3 if accepted.
 [ N e3 ] , [ N f6 ]  As I now develop another piece.
 [ B d5 ] , [ R f7 ]  You know already that wasn't the wisest move but if you hadn't said anything I might have missed it. I'd anticipated you coming down that f file and reckoned I had enough to defend it I wasn't at that time thinking of bxr but your comment made me look harder.
 [ N x a8 ]  [ R x a8 ]  [ a5 ]  [ a6 ]  [ Q b3 ]  [ R d8 ]  [ R a4 ]  [ h6 ]  [ Q c3 ] , [ Q x h3 ]  Finally I take it
 [ N c3 ] , [ N f6 ]  Another move with the same piece this should give me the lead in development
 [ N h4 ]  [ R b1 ]  [ h6 ] , [ g x h4 ]  not one of the best move put using the check to my advantage
 [ R x c4 ] , [ R c8 ]  Now I have to guard my base Pawn on the Q-side.
 [ K h8 ] , [ Q g8 # ]  
 [ Q e2 ] , [ Q x e2 + ]  I went for the queen swap off as it would put him in a weaker position.
 [ B x c3 ]  [ B x c3 ] , [ B f3 ]  A dangerous looking move but with little or no actual effect. Instead it may have been good to go after the trapped white knight.
 [ B f7 ] , [ e4 ]  B out of the way I can finally play [ e4 ] myself. I'm not sure about [ f3 ] first but slowness is punished too often.
 [ Q x h1 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ d4 ]  defending [ e5 ] and freeing the dark bishop
 [ R f e1 ]  [ b5 ] , [ B b3 ]  king is not safe so i have to swap king/root so i hv to take action move out bishop and night
 [ K c7 ]  [ R d2 ]  [ K b6 ]  [ R d1 ]  [ K b5 ] , [ K c2 ]  Conceding further ground but after 77. [ R d2 ] Fine points out 77 ...[ R c5 + ] 78. [ K b3 ] [ R c g5 ] and there is no defence against the exchange of rooks: 79. [ K c3 ] [ R [ g2 ] ] 80. [ R d1 ] [ R g1 ] 81. [ R d2 ] R5[ g2 ] etc.
 [ N h4 ] , [ K h8 ]  white still can't take the bishop for the very same reasons so the black king steps aside to allow a rook access to the g file
 [ e x d5 ]  [ e4 ] , [ Q e2 ]  Now the pawn is pinned to the king and can't take the Knight.
 [ g4 ]  [ N x g4 ]  [ h x g4 ]  [ B x g4 ] , [ B x c6 + ]  this exchange has a purpose for if he takes my bishop-
 [ K h8 ] , [ Q e8 + ]  Black can: - block with [ B f8 ] to lose yet another piece [ Q x f8 + ] [ K h7 ] [ N e7 ] [ h5 ] the most stubborn [ Q g8 + ] [ K h6 ] [ N e6 ] [ R d8 ] [ Q g7 + + ] - move the king [ K g7 ] [ N e6 + ] [ K h7 ] [ Q f7 + ] [ K h8 ] [ Q g7 + + ] - move the king [ K h7 ] [ Q f7 + ] [ K h8 ] [ N e6 ] [ R d7 ] [ Q x d7 ] [ K g8 ] [ Q e8 + ] [ B f8 ] [ Q x f8 + ] [ K h7 ] [ Q g7 + + ]  [ K h7 ]  [ Q f7 + ]  [ K h8 ] , [ N e6 ]  bringing in the knight for the kill
 [ Q x d5 + ] , [ K g7 ]  Kg7? This move gives White a 3 point material advantage lead. Again instead of [ K g7 ] black makes the game even with … [ K h8 ] 24. [ Q x e5 + ] [ K g8 ] 25. [ Q d5 + ] [ K h8 ] 26. Qe5+.
 [ K e7 ] , [ N d6 ]  [ N c7 ] was tempting but all the time black had the chanche to play [ R b8 ] depriving me of b5's control... why help him?
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ] , [ c4 ]  Not the best possible mve Best moves (according to GK database): [ N f3 ] or [ c3 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ d3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N d4 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ B g3 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ B h4 ]  loss of tempo..
 [ K e4 ] , [ b4 ]  I was anticipating [ K f6 ] as this is the best move although I noticed my opponent taking a while on this move (we were both online) so he perhaps calculated this line as a losing one (which I think it is) so wanted to try something different however this is a bad blunder allowing me to stroll arround gobbleing up his pawns
 [ B b6 ] , [ Q b3 ]  menacing the knight an the king
 [ c x d3 ] , [ N x d3 ]  The rook on [ b2 ] has to be careful now.
 [ d x c6 ]  [ b x c6 ]  [ B a4 ]  [ B x c3 + ] , [ b x c3 ]  Black gives away the pair of bishops.
 [ b x c6 ] , [ B d4 ]  Better than 12. [ B h6 ] which can be met by a capture on c3. Also playable is [ N x d5 ] but I like the idea of exchanging these bishops first.
 [ a3 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ N b3 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ e4 ] , [ O-O ]  8. ..... 0-0 - after getting my pieces out I tucked Henry away on the kingside. I plan to fianchetto Fou Leblanc on [ b7 ] which I manage to achieve in a couple of moves from now.
 [ h5 ]  [ K g2 ]  [ R f3 ]  [ N a4 ]  [ B d6 ] , [ B e1 ]  21. [ B e1 ] - I am getting more and more bottled up.
 [ d5 ] , [ f4 ]  Sacrificing for development.
 [ R b f8 ]  [ B d1 ]  [ Q d8 ]  [ N e2 ] , [ Q c8 ]  threatening the h3-pawn. White must prevent this!
 [ R a c8 ] , [ Q d2 ]  A better square for the white queen in my opinion.
 [ e4 ]  [ N b4 ] , [ Q d1 ]  My opponent smelled out my plan.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ] , [ f4 ]  He plays the kings gambit. He was actually the person who inspired me to play it myself. I have won games with it.
 [ B f5 ]  [ Q b5 + ]  [ B d7 ]  [ Q x c5 ]  [ N h5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ b6 ] , [ Q x d5 ]  Pins the bishop
 [ Q e2 ]  [ Q e7 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ O-O-O ] , [ O-O-O ]  So both sides have castled and now we need to find plans.
 [ R b8 ] , [ Q d2 ]  With the idea of f4-[ f5 ] and [ B h6 ] at some stage.
 [ Q g6 ]  [ N g3 ] , [ a5 ]  A loss of time.
 [ Q x e4 ] , [ B x e4 ]  17. ....... [ B x e4 ] - queen trade. White is gonna have a job to avoid losing a pawn here.
 [ K b3 ] , [ K d3 ]  This should slow his pawns just long enough.
 [ a x b5 ]  [ a x b5 ]  [ R x a8 ]  [ B x a8 ] , [ N x b5 ]  pawn recaptured - and looking at [ c4 ]  [ N a5 ] , [ Q a4 ]  now here I'm going out on a limb - not sure I have enough development for this bold move... but if you make the wrong decision there are some great opportunities... If you make the correct replies... then the most I can hope for is a draw..
 [ B x e4 ]  [ d x e4 ] , [ Q x e4 ]  Now my queen is free and looking to h7. All of a sudden my position is even better than hers! The main point: I keep the [ g5 ] pwan that happened to become a key piece for me. Without it I'm crushed! I already devoted a lot of time just to get here but the best is still to come.
 [ R b a6 ] , [ f4 ]  ! I suddenly felt a lot less happy about my position because I started to worry a bit about an eventual [ e5 ] coming up. I wanted to prevent that at all cost because it would activate the whole White army which is prepared for an attack right through the center. Obviously I should have known that this move was coming up at some point and probably I should have been prepared for it.
 [ d4 ]  [ e x d3 ]  [ e ]  [ p ] , [ c x d3 ]  as expected.
 [ B x d3 ]  [ c x d3 ]  [ e6 ] , [ d4 ]  Unbelievable. After such suspect opening play white has established a very solid position.
 [ h5 ]  [ K f2 ]  [ h4 ]  [ R a4 a6 ]  [ K h7 ]  [ R a1 a5 ]  [ h x g3 + ]  [ K x g3 ]  [ R f c8 ]  [ R c5 ] , [ R c b8 ]  taking the open line...
 [ K f7 ]  [ K c1 ]  [ K f6 ]  [ K d2 ]  [ K e5 ]  [ K e3 ] , [ h5 ]  "Passed pawns must be pushed"! Black sets his main asset in motion.
 [ B f4 ]  [ R a e8 ]  [ h3 ] , [ B f6 ]  Black is choosing to apply pressure on the King-side. Black's counter attack will be unsuccessful because white holds an advantage in the center.
 [ B x a8 ]  [ B x e5 ]  [ B x e5 ]  [ Q x e5 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ Q g5 ]  [ Q d5 ] , [ Q g6 ]  Black is well advised to avoid even material trades now down a rook.
 [ e6 ] , [ Q h5 ]  As I said a cheap trick which is easily parried but it's worth a shot surely..?
 [ e6 ] , [ B f4 ]  I wanted to play 3.[ B f4 ] in order to develop it before i close the return home with a later possible e3.
 [ N d5 ] , [ B a4 ]  ! This is where the game turns against Black.
 [ B d4 + ] , [ K h1 ]  but White is not out of the woods yet!
 [ N x d5 ]  [ B x d5 ]  [ Q f5 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ B e3 ] , [ Q f6 ]  White Queen is getting more attacks.
 [ a x b4 ] , [ a x b4 ]  34. [ a x b4 ] - another pawn trade.
 [ B g5 ] , [ B e7 # ]  Mate. I think White's moving the pawn to [ e4 ] was a key move in this game. If White had left that pawn alone and instead moved the pawn on f forward one (therefore threatening my queen when she was on [ e5 ] and blocking her path) this checkmate could have been avoided and I would have had to find another method of attack. Another key aspect of this game is that White didn't utilize the b-column knight at all; for most of the game the pawn on [ c3 ] blocked the knight's best method of getting on the board.
 [ B x d1 ]  [ Q c4 ] , [ Q e5 ]  Black continues his attack disregarding the defensive idea like 21..e6.
 [ b3 ]  [ e5 ]  [ B b2 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ e3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ B x c6 ]  [ d x c6 ]  [ h3 ]  [ N e7 ] , [ g4 ]  Very ambiguous. 7. [ N f3 ] would have been safer followed by castling.
 [ K b1 ] , [ N a4 ]  The N is safe here (b3?? Nc3+) and [ b2 ] would be attacked soon.
 [ R d6 ] , [ B x e6 ]  If 24... QxB 25 RxQ secures a winning material edge. So Black tries 24 RxB...
 [ K x h7 ]  [ B e4 + ]  [ K g8 ] , [ h6 ]  Kitrich reckons that black is now completely busted. Do you agree?
 [ b x c5 ]  [ B x c5 ]  [ d x c5 ] , [ Q x c5 ]  he accepts sacrifice.... rest is history
 [ Q f5 + ] , [ Q e6 ]  ...but have to put up some defence...
 [ Q a5 + ] , [ K f1 ]  [ K d1 ] might have been better so the h rook could have egress. White though has a lot of power focused across the board with both those bishops.
 [ B d2 ] , [ B x d2 + ]  Black plays as I was hoping for:)
 [ B x f7 + ]  [ K x f7 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N f g5 + ]  [ K g8 ] , [ c3 ]  This pawn move is so obviously wrong that the trap must work only with the unwary or in a blitz game in Washington Square Park. (If the d pawn takes the knight [ Q b3 ] wins.)
 [ R d3 + ]  [ K g2 ]  [ R b3 ]  [ R e4 ]  [ R b2 + ]  [ K g1 ]  [ R b1 + ]  [ K f2 ]  [ g5 ]  [ K g2 ]  [ R b2 + ]  [ K f3 ]  [ R b3 + ]  [ K g2 ] , [ R b2 + ]  Draw Agreed white cannot leave his h pawn to hang in order to continue the game and black doesn't want white's king to contribute to the endgame efforts. I had a little under 5 minutes left on my clock here. A back and forth kind of game hope it was somewhat interesting. Please comment if I missed something I only spent about an hour or so on this so I'd appreciate the help. Thanks!
 [ N f3 + ]  [ K g2 ] , [ R g8 ]  Threatening 24...[ N x h4 + ] and a devastating attack.
 [ N a4 ] , [ c5 ]  roneshet: [ B b1 ] We can't put our B on [ c2 ] or [ e2 ] because it will lead to losing one of our pawns... [ B b1 ] as far as I can tell is the only viable move. ptitroque: [ B b1 ] Yes I see no other solution
 [ B c5 + ]  [ Q d6 ] , [ Q x d6 # ]  And mate. I think I played pretty well this game but if you find an error please comment.
 [ R x c5 + ]  [ K f6 ]  [ R c7 ]  [ K e6 ] , [ c5 ]  and with that white is guarunteed the win. black must exchange else Nd4+! wins the rook and [ R d8 ] leads (via c6) to a position whereby black must exchange the rook for (at best!) two of the pawns or the knight
 [ R c8 ]  [ R c5 ] , [ R e8 ]  After the exchange the pawn on [ c5 ] would kick the knight to a less active square and White would be clearly better.
 [ R f1 ]  [ Q x e3 + ]  [ K h1 ]  [ N f2 + ]  [ K g1 ]  [ N h3 + ]  [ K h1 ]  [ Q g1 + ]  [ R x g1 ] , [ N f2 # ]  
 [ d x e5 ] , [ N e4 ]  My only hope is tactical play and hope that the opponent makes a mistake.
 [ d6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ h6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ c6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N f6 ]  [ h3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ Q f3 ] , [ N x e4 ]  Now he got a pawn up offering the Knight and I have only the Queen to grab it. But if I do so he will push the d pawn then a fork I have pull back the Queen and he will take the Bishop and he will depend the pawn. So I took the f pawn.
 [ R f e1 ]  [ N x e6 ]  [ R x e6 + ] , [ K f7 ]  Again the less dangerous position for black. I'm not playing to win but to hold would be a kind of victory for me.
 [ b5 ]  [ a x b5 ]  [ a x b5 ]  [ N a3 ]  [ N a7 ]  [ b4 ]  [ R c8 ] , [ K g2 ]  I thought the R on [ e8 ] square wasn't so much helpful.
 [ g3 ]  [ B h6 ]  [ g x f4 ]  [ B x g5 ] , [ f x g5 ]  Black willing to take a loss of a pawn for exchanging a active knight for his bad bishop; although there were variations which he could have recouped it.
 [ B d7 ]  [ a4 ] , [ Q b6 ]  A powerful square for the queen to be on
 [ N f5 ]  [ R e4 + ]  [ b4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N x e7 ] , [ R x e7 ]  ?? -- The final time pressure blunder and more than enough. After ...[ K e7 ] Black should still draw being able to shepherd his own pawns while slowing the advance of White's. The rest of the game passes without need for further comment.
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ d x c4 ]  [ B x c4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N b d7 ]  [ N b d2 ]  [ c6 ]  [ a3 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ b4 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B b2 ]  [ N b6 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ N b d5 ]  [ O-O ] , [ a5 ]  Trying to get the extra Queenside pawn.
 [ N f5 ] , [ K f2 ]  Trying to get out of the way of the light-square Bishop so White can get his last two pieces into play. Getting the King off the e file also threatens [ Q x e6 + ] without having to worry about a game-ending pin.
 [ B h3 ] , [ B x h4 ]  Let's say that this opens his king's position.
 [ d5 ] , [ c5 ]  White: King_0_Nothing Black: Janheckman
 [ B x f5 ]  [ N c e7 ] , [ B c2 ]  [ B e6 + ] was an option but I did not want to swap pieces after Bf7.
 [ Q a5 ] , [ Q b3 ]  White's pla is to attack [ f7 ] with all th available material and obtain a good trading sequence.
 [ N d5 ]  [ N h6 ] , [ h4 ]  time to retrive my pawn.
 [ O-O ]  [ N b d7 ] , [ B g5 ]  creating an annoyance for black but this should be very easy for black to handle. This move along with it's [ B f4 ] cousin are easy victims for the benoni player.
 [ Q e7 ]  [ K f2 ] , [ R e8 ]  Black aims to control the e file
 [ N x e4 ]  [ B x e4 ] , [ h6 ]  Don't underestimate the value of that pawn! Only 1 place to go for that Bishop now.
 [ R c7 ]  [ R e8 + ]  [ K a7 ]  [ R e6 ]  [ b5 ]  [ R e4 ]  [ b x c4 ]  [ b x c4 ]  [ g5 ]  [ g3 ] , [ h5 ]  [ f x3 ] is advisable for position.
 [ N e x d4 ]  [ R x e8 + ]  [ B x e8 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ R d1 ] , [ N e6 ]  I imagine this move was not anticipated or maybe 23. ...[ B x e8 ] was not anticipated but either way this should be an easy game from here.
 [ B b2 ] , [ N e5 ]  Black knight moves to unpin the bishop and protect the weak [ f7 ] pawn.
 [ B b2 ] , [ N b d7 ]  Continuing his slow buildup...
 [ R b a8 ]  [ Q c6 ] , [ R a e8 ]  Better here was 23...[ K h8 ] which prevents my next move [ Q d5 ] pinning the queen to the king and happily squelching any counter play he has. Again [ Q d5 ] is not the best move but I needed to play it to be comfortable in my winning position.
 [ R x b2 ]  [ N b4 ]  [ R d2 ] , [ K e7 ]  The goalie is out of the penalty box. But someone had to protect that backward d-pawn.
 [ N d4 ]  [ N x f6 + ] , [ d5 ]  If the Bishop had been interposed White would have taken it checking; and on Knight retaking have played [ N d5 ] discovering check and won without difficulty.
 [ a x b4 ]  [ a x b4 ]  [ R x a1 ] , [ B x a1 ]  im not sure of its continuation whether it best moves or not but someething for sure the board give a picture still level on both sides
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ c5 ] , [ c3 ]  When black's c pawn is moved white must move his own in order to be able to answer [ Q b3 ] to Qb6. [ b6 ] weakens dangerously white's dark squares.
 [ B b5 + ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B x c6 + ]  [ b x c6 ]  [ Q e2 ]  [ B h6 ]  [ B c1 ] , [ Q c3 ]  Black is trying to stretch White's defences and overwork his pieces. Notice that attention has completely shifted from the e5-pawn to the d2-knight!
 [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ c x d5 ] , [ d6 ]  Now it's definitely a benoni.
 [ R x d1 ]  [ N e6 ]  [ R a1 ]  [ f5 ] , [ e5 ]  I cant remember why I didn't take [ f5 ]  [ K f7 ]  [ R x a2 ]  [ K e7 ]  [ R a7 + ]  [ K e8 ]  [ K e2 ]  [ N f4 + ]  [ K f3 ]  [ N e6 ]  [ K e3 ]  [ h6 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N x c5 ]  [ R x g7 ] , [ f4 + ]  He tried to trick me by making me capture [ f4 ] enabling him to fork me with n[ e6 ]  [ N e6 ] , [ R g6 ]  Now I can take [ h6 ] too
 [ e x d5 ] , [ Q f3 ]  though ill keep the pressure going with a quick matey thread.
 [ B x c3 ]  [ b x c3 ] , [ O-O ]  Freeing the knight(s).
 [ N d7 ] , [ g x h6 ]  thewrongreason: I don't know if I have anything better then taking on g6. I don't want the Q swarming in but then if I take my K side is destroyed. By how it's playing out I think that the position is looking very bad for black here. I meant on h6. I won't take since I'm starting to see what happens afterwards and your attack would be devastating. With that I think ...[ g6 ] is required here. The reason I won't annotate for a while after this is because I was specifically looking at what how to prevent Joe from landing his Q+R on the g file due to his [ h6 ] pawn. I was thinking about what all of that can do to my monarch based on the overall picture with our last game in mind.
 [ B x c7 ] , [ R x c7 ]  But it is already a lost cause...
 [ N b6 ] , [ R c1 ]  Natural move with a pin
 [ b x c3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ f x e4 ]  [ N x e4 ] , [ N f3 ]  Preventing ... [ Q h4 ] [ N x c3 ] isn't a threat because [ Q c2 ] traps the knight.
 [ N c6 ]  [ R x f8 + ]  [ K x f8 ] , [ a3 ]  Starting a pawn steamroller.
 [ N h6 ] , [ R d g1 ]  I want to control the g-and h-files with my Rooks after opening up.
 [ g5 ]  [ c4 ] , [ B g6 ]  ! Threatening ...[ B e4 ] which I only just noticed after I played the next move I'm ashamed to say.
 [ f5 ]  [ Q f7 ] , [ c4 ]  21. [ c4 ] - and here's another one!
 [ N f3 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ Q b4 + ]  [ K e3 ]  [ N b6 ] , [ R d a1 ]  Threatens to catch the black queen but 16...[ N d5 ] follows.
 [ Q e7 ]  [ O-O ] , [ R a d8 ]  I don't really understand this move.. In my opinion the control over the open c-line is more important..
 [ R g3 ]  [ N e c2 + ]  [ K f1 ] , [ R x e2 ]  Game over white resigns the sac paid off...
 [ N c4 ]  [ N x c4 ]  [ d x c4 ]  [ Q b8 ]  [ K c6 ]  [ Q x c7 + ]  [ K d5 ]  [ Q c5 + ]  [ K e4 ]  [ Q e5 + ]  [ K f3 ]  [ h6 ]  [ K g2 ]  [ R g1 + ]  [ K f2 ] , [ Q e3 # ]  Nothing much of notice happened over those last 8 moves just me constantly putting him in check until mate. I hope I did alright for my first blitz annotation and please give me feedback! I really like annotating these games and I would like to start moving up to some higher level games.
 [ f x e5 ] , [ B x g4 ]  The best move in the situation. though it does have a very big down side of leading to a minor exchange sac two pawns for a Knight.
 [ O-O ]  [ N g e7 ] , [ Q b3 ]  A good alternative is 10 [ a3 ] to enforce b4.
 [ d6 ]  [ d3 ] , [ a6 ]  Best as [ N a4 ] was threatened gaining the bishop-pair advantage.
 [ R e1 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ N h5 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ h6 ]  [ B e3 ] , [ N f6 ]  All that just to teach the white bishop a lesson.
 [ c4 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ a3 ]  Although this discourages Black's minor pieces from coming to [ b4 ] it also creates a weakness at [ b3 ]  [ b5 ] , [ f5 ]  I was still managing to feel quite optimistic at this point though I knew my opponent was quite capable of dealing with me (he beat me last season)
 [ e5 ]  [ N b3 ] , [ Q e6 ]  If [ N c5 ] then BxN and black's control of the center should give him a slight advantage.
 [ B e2 ]  [ N b8 d7 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ h3 ]  Preventing another thematic Alekhine move sequence of ...[ B g4 ] and ...Bxf3. Now black must solve the problem of what to do with his light-square bishop. 13...[ B f5 ] will be met with 14.Nd4.
 [ Q f6 + ] , [ K e8 ]  Obviously [ K f8 ] gets mated and [ K d6 ] still loses to [ R d4 ]  [ K e7 ] , [ R c x d7 # ]  Black's underdeveloped position and greedy queen moves didn't seem like disadvantages when I was down a piece but now I wind up with an extra rook and Black is mated. Development and king safety are the number one factors in wide open crazy positions like this
 [ d4 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ B g4 ] , [ R x b7 ]  i heven't seen this move...after 23.[ R x b7 ] i think "oh no...i lost" but fortunately it's draw
 [ K x b4 ] , [ K f7 ]  I would've played 103...[ R h4 + ] in an attempt to get a draw by repetition. That K would've moved back a few times. However I don't think that white would've allowed it anyway because let's say 103...[ R h4 + ] 104.[ K c3 ] [ R h3 + ] 105.[ K b4 ] [ R h4 + ] now white has say 106.[ K b5 ] which would've prevented the draw. Nontheless however I believe it was worth trying.
 [ R a d8 ] , [ R a d1 ]  21. [ R a d1 ] - centralising my QR as planned.
 [ K f1 ] , [ e2 + ]  at least giving Black one tempo to reorganize...
 [ b3 ]  [ Q h8 ] , [ K g2 ]  24. [ K g2 ] - Henry sidestepps a dangerous pin.
 [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ d4 ]  The wisest answer I almost never face. Now taking the pawn is recommended but I also tried [ B f5 ] even if it not in the spirit of the opening.
 [ h5 ]  [ Q e4 ] , [ g4 ]  22. …… [ g4 ] - the much anticipated pawn storm is coming but that is as far as it gets.
 [ N a4 ]  [ B x a4 ]  [ R x a4 ]  [ b3 ]  [ R a6 ]  [ B d4 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ B x g7 ]  [ K x g7 ]  [ N f d4 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ b4 ]  much better is [ f4 ] or [ g4 ] beginning the ofensive on both sides of the board. Plus giving the K room to move
 [ B x g4 ]  [ d3 ] , [ h6 ]  ...[ N [ c6 ] ] is stronger. also ...[ c6 ] and ...[ N d7 ] as in lines of the afore mentioned openings.
 [ Q e1 ]  [ Q d7 ]  [ B g3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N f4 ]  [ B f8 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ K f7 ]  [ N c e2 ]  [ g5 ]  [ N d3 ]  [ Q e7 ]  [ f3 ]  [ Q a3 ] , [ N f2 ]  My Q was overloaded.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ h6 ]  [ d3 ]  [ B c5 ] , [ B e3 ]  I'm not too keen on this move. It compromises your kingside pawn structure too much. If you want to exchange bishops play [ Q e2 ] first.
 [ e3 ]  [ a6 ] , [ h3 ]  This is to support [ g4 ] and to provide [ B f4 ] a square to retire in case of Nh5.
 [ B e3 ]  [ b6 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ N x d5 ] , [ e x d5 ]  Now I can get in [ c3 ]  [ c3 ]  [ B e7 ] , [ R e1 ]  Not bad but perharps I should have tried [ K h2 ] threatening [ g4 ] next move to win the queen
 [ N x f3 + ]  [ N x f3 ]  [ Q x g4 + ]  [ Q g2 ]  [ B x c5 + ]  [ K h1 ]  [ Q x g2 + ]  [ K x g2 ]  [ g4 ]  [ N h4 ]  [ c6 ] , [ B h6 ]  Again driving the Rook where it wants to go! The computer gives [ B g5 ]  [ R f e8 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ R x e1 ]  [ R x e1 ]  [ R e8 ] , [ R f1 ]  The computer thinks that White should have exchanged Rooks. I am not totally convinced.
 [ R x f8 ] , [ Q h7 # ]  Brilliantly done by Bisguier.
 [ N x d5 ]  [ B x d5 ] , [ N a6 ]  [ N a6 ] drifts out of the database. The typical response (good for black) is P[ c6 ] though in a few games black does well with Pd6. O-O seems to give white an advantage.
 [ Q x b6 + ] , [ a x b6 ]  So this is acceptable with black against a 1800+
 [ B x c3 + ]  [ b x c3 ]  [ N e7 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ Q a5 ]  Attacks the weak [ c3 ] pawn and pins it to the white king
 [ R e7 ]  [ R b4 ]  [ R c7 ]  [ K c2 ]  [ B e6 + ]  [ K d3 ]  [ R d7 + ]  [ K c3 ]  [ R c7 + ]  [ K d4 ]  [ R d7 + ]  [ K c5 ]  [ R d8 ]  [ R b6 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ K d6 ]  [ B e8 + ]  [ K c7 ]  [ R d7 + ]  [ K c8 ]  [ R d1 ]  [ R e6 ]  [ B f7 ]  [ R e7 ]  [ B c4 ] , [ R g7 + ]  62. [ R x h7 ] is also good
 [ e x f6 + ]  [ K x f6 ]  [ N d4 ] , [ f4 ]  wrong time wrong place... better was [ R d6 ] [ R a4 ] Bc8! [ R a e1 ] [ f4 ] [ N e c2 ] Nf5...
 [ N e5 ]  [ f6 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ h6 ]  Black does not fear Nh4. Simply [ R g8 ] gives Black a strong attack if White decides to exchange knight for bishop.
 [ f x e6 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ Q d4 ]  [ N x d3 ]  [ Q x c4 ] , [ R e5 ]  This happens. However I would've captured with 30.[ R x e6 ] But Joe has a reason for doing what he does. And it's important to figure what that would be as that's what theory is about.
 [ K e4 ]  [ N b4 ]  [ d3 ]  [ N x d3 ]  [ K x d3 ]  [ K h4 ]  [ K e3 ]  [ K g3 ]  [ f4 + ]  [ K g2 ] , [ K e2 ]  
 [ Q g5 ] , [ Q b3 # ]  
 [ B x d4 ] , [ K g1 ]  White still has almost no development. It would have been better to keep the king where he was for the past two moves and get his other pieces into the game. Moving the king away more doesn't offer any hope of regaining momentum or trying to get back in the game. It looks like a series of moves just prolonging an inevitable death.
 [ R f h2 ]  [ R c1 ] , [ K h7 ]  Considered resignation at this point. With my king blockaded on the first rank and my rook pinned to the a file I saw no way of stopping black's push.
 [ R x c6 ]  [ B x c6 + ] , [ K x c6 ]  I considered this a winning endgame.
 [ B g2 ] , [ d6 ]  Ok closed game normal setting... subtle long term strategy required. Against such a strong player I'm just out of my confort zone.
 [ N c3 ]  [ a6 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ e6 ]  [ f4 ] , [ B e7 ]  All book play.
 [ a5 ]  [ B c5 + ]  [ K a6 ]  [ R b6 + ]  [ K a7 ]  [ R b4 + ]  [ Q x c5 ]  [ Q x c5 + ] , [ K b8 ]  Good tactical combination which wins white 6 points if he plays [ g x f3 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ R b4 x b7 + ]  [ K c8 ]  [ Q x c6 + ]  [ K d8 ] , [ Q x d7 # ]  Nice mating combo that could have been avoided if 1.) Black hadn't wasted tempos so early with queen moves and moving the same piece multiple times in the opening 2.) Castling if black had have castled earlier he could have had a chance to win I hope you can get some good ideas to use in your game
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ c4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N b d7 ]  [ e3 ]  [ O-O ] , [ R c1 ]  The usual move here preventing Black from playing ...P-[ B4 ] and freeing his game.
 [ g4 ]  [ N e7 ] , [ K f1 ]  30. [ K f1 ] - having allowed a remote queenside passer Henry must go over to the queenside to help round it up if I can.
 [ Q e2 ] , [ N x d1 ]  I think I probably should have captured the rook on [ h1 ] instead.
 [ K x b6 ] , [ R a c1 ]  the last sacrifice the rook is guarding [ d8 ] the queening square. I throw a little bait out and...
 [ O-O ]  [ N f6 ] , [ d3 ]  I believe this is the Giuoco Pianissimo.
 [ K f3 ] , [ a5 ]  Now the rook will come to [ a7 ] and the d-pawn's doomed.
 [ b x c3 ] , [ c5 ]  challenging the center
 [ B e3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ h3 ]  [ N b d7 ]  [ e5 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ B x f7 + ]  [ K x f7 ]  [ N x e5 + ] , [ K e6 ]  A sacrifice I thought to offer much potential
 [ N f3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ a6 ]  Maybe a wasted move but I don't like White bishop on [ b5 ] when I play [ d6 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ B e3 ]  I don't know why my opponent didn't castle.
 [ Q f6 ] , [ f4 ]  a subtle but good move creates an opening for my queen on [ f3 ] where it can attack black's [ b7 ] pawn which would be pinned due to his rook on a8.
 [ Q e2 ]  [ Q x g7 ]  [ Q x f1 + ]  [ K h2 ]  [ B f4 + ]  [ g3 ] , [ B x f3 ]  I think I have him at this point. Material advantage and I'm one turn away from mate. Except...
 [ K g7 ]  [ f x g6 ]  [ K x g6 ] , [ R e2 ]  I challenge his rook so I can remove more blockaders of my pawn while also possibly threatening [ R e8 ] if he moves away.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ] , [ f4 ]  King's gambit offered and accepted
 [ R e1 ]  [ B b3 ]  [ R e2 ]  [ B x c2 ]  [ N x c2 ]  [ R e c8 ]  [ N d4 ] , [ R x a3 ]  Black's pressure has netted another pawn and now the a pawn is passed.
 [ R d3 d7 ]  [ R x d7 ]  [ R x d7 ] , [ B c5 ]  now [ B c5 ] is practically forced...
 [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ] , [ N f6 ]  Sicilian (B54) Prins (Moscow) variation... 5.f3!?
 [ R e1 ]  [ a6 ]  [ R x e4 + ]  [ K d8 ]  [ R h4 ]  [ b6 ]  [ R x h6 ]  [ c6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ d6 ]  [ B g5 + ]  [ K c7 ]  [ R x h7 + ]  [ B d7 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ a5 ]  [ N a3 ]  [ N a6 ]  [ N c4 ]  [ b5 ]  [ R x d7 + ]  [ K x d7 ]  [ N b6 + ]  [ K c7 ]  [ N x a8 + ]  [ K b7 ]  [ a4 ]  [ K x a8 ]  [ a x b5 ]  [ N b8 ]  [ R x a5 + ]  [ K b7 ]  [ B x g6 ]  [ K b6 ]  [ B d8 + ]  [ K b7 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ N a6 ]  [ R x a6 ]  [ c x b5 ]  [ R b6 + ]  [ K a7 ]  [ B c8 ] , [ d5 ]  analyzed it they win the quickest with pawns
 [ K h7 ] , [ R e3 e5 ]  Since all the files are at least half-closed I have to create trouble on the e-file and the fifth rank where I can move to the g-file.
 [ f6 ]  [ c5 ]  [ B c3 ]  [ R d3 ] , [ B e1 ]  My bishop is in danger as my [ a2 ] pawn... Who will win? Was I lost or not? Where was my mistake? I have two threats: Bishop [ g3 ] [ f4 ] [ h6 ] [ g7 ] and mate. But they are a lot of moves. [ R g5 ] then R[ g7 ] blocking his knight in order to defend f7. Are they enough?
 [ Q h5 + ]  [ K d8 ]  [ Q f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ B d2 ]  [ h5 ] , [ b4 ]  Well the b-pawn was finally pushed - too late!
 [ B b2 ] , [ B x h5 ]  Here is a decision Caruana has to make. To take on [ a2 ] or to go after the [ [ d4 ] ] pawn or maybe both eventually? I would personally go after the [ [ d4 ] ] pawn with 40...[ N e4 + ]  [ K g2 ] , [ B x d4 ]  Both players made time control. Caruana still maintains his small edge and a much easier position to play.
 [ d4 ] , [ d5 ]  Challenging the centre. You will note that the French Defence has an analogous opening sequence: 1.[ e4 ] [ e6 ] 2.[ d4 ] d5.
 [ Q h5 ]  [ R c f8 ] , [ K h1 ]  A mysterious king move. Of course there was no danger of Black changing plans and attacking on the kingside since the [ f7 ] pawn cannot move.
 [ g3 ]  [ N h3 + ]  [ K g2 ]  [ N g5 ]  [ h4 ] , [ N e6 ]  Now I have a bit more development and black is back to the position a few moves ago. Not only that but the f pawn can now be taken I think after [ B x e6 ] and Re7.
 [ Q c2 + ]  [ K b5 ]  [ Q c4 + ] , [ K a4 ]  the real point of the combo!
 [ K b6 ] , [ d3 ]  I need to open lines for my bishop and this seemed a little more solid than d4.
 [ N h4 ] , [ B x h7 + ]  That's why I thought it was good.
 [ K x c8 ]  [ K d6 ]  [ g4 ] , [ a5 ]  The white pawns are too quick. Black can play ...[ g x f3 ] and make a queen himself but one move later he'll be checkmated on the back rank by the new queen on a8. Trying to slow White down with ...[ K b8 ] doesn't help either: White plays [ K d7 ] and queens the c-pawn instead. Either way mate is only a few moves away so... Black resigns: 1-0 On the one hand I was pleased to have lasted so long against a much stronger opponent and not made any outright blunders. Equally it's a shame to play so many moves and still end up with nothing... Over and out -- Pikket
 [ R e8 ]  [ e x d5 ] , [ N x d5 ]  If after [ c x d5 ] white should probably continue with [ N b3 ] defending his d pawn leading to a similar position as seen in the game.
 [ K d6 ]  [ Q x d5 + ]  [ K c7 ]  [ B f4 + ]  [ B d6 ] , [ Q x d6 # ]  The final blow.
 [ b x c6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N e7 ] , [ B g5 ]  Playing simple direct chess I'm trying to make Black's development as awkward as possible. This pin starts to keep Black tied up as if his Q moves the K is tied to defending it.If he castles his Q can't move and neither can the N. I was hoping maybe to provoke ...[ f6 ] weakening the K's defence.
 [ N x e3 ] , [ N x e4 ]  ?? It looks like white has gotten a pawn back. But this is a terrible blunder that should lose Erika because Eric will win the Queen for a Knight in return. So as Ken posted in one of your more recent annotations it's not worth this exchange.
 [ N x a8 ]  [ R x h2 ]  [ B x d7 ]  [ R x f2 + ]  [ K e1 ]  [ R c2 ]  [ N x b6 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ R c3 ]  [ N a4 ]  [ R e3 + ]  [ K d2 ]  [ f5 ]  [ B e2 ] , [ d3 ]  That pawn was the black rook's sole support.
 [ O-O ]  [ B b2 ] , [ R e8 ]  This was to prepare [ e5 ] when white may play [ d5 ] and black Knight returns to [ b8 ] in the style of Kings Indian ?
 [ K h8 ]  [ Q e4 ]  [ f5 ]  [ Q x e5 ]  [ Q x c2 ]  [ R d2 ]  [ Q c1 + ]  [ K f2 ]  [ R d e8 ] , [ N e7 ]  I like this move
 [ d5 ] , [ h6 ]  Holding back knight and bishop
 [ R b8 ]  [ N a4 ]  [ Q d6 ]  [ N x c5 ] , [ Q x c5 ]  After this last exchange I have the bishop pair and my opponent two knights. According to the chess theory it´s a small advantage!
 [ b3 ]  [ O-O ] , [ N e2 ]  The queen is now misplaced on [ b5 ] but I have to try and gain control of the a8-[ h1 ] diagonal simply because he wants it.
 [ Q g4 ]  [ R e1 ] , [ B f5 ]  The centre is completely owned by black.
 [ N x a5 ]  [ R a b8 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ R b6 ] , [ N x a7 ]  While anything but obvious now white will come to regret snatching that pawn.
 [ Q c7 ] , [ R e5 x e7 + ]  My opponent by this move decides a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. He settles for winning back the material and taking a draw.
 [ e4 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ c6 ]  [ b4 ]  [ a6 ]  [ B b2 ]  [ b5 ]  [ R e1 ] , [ e5 ]  Advancing [ e7 ] two squares asked for the trouble.
 [ R f g1 ]  [ B b6 ] , [ g4 ]  Committing himself to the attack. With his own K-side position now weakened Anderssen's attack must succeed or he will lose.
 [ O-O ] , [ N b d7 ]  Let's engage the [ f7 ] Pawn... However perhaps [ N g4 ] would have been even better as it let's the bishop stroll around again and cover g5.
 [ N f6 ] , [ e5 ]  As planned.
 [ K g8 ] , [ Q h7 # ]  Mate. An interresting struggle until black's final mistake : 25. ... [ h6 ]  [ K x b5 ]  [ K f4 ]  [ K c6 ]  [ K g5 ]  [ K d7 ]  [ K f6 ]  [ B a2 ]  [ N f5 ]  [ K e8 ] , [ N d6 + ]  Draw agreed. Many thanks for reading this annotation. Please rate this annotation with the star system. Please leave a comment or two to let me know how I am getting on.
 [ B x d4 ] , [ N x d4 ]  Not sure why Black finally decided to trade off his bishop for that pawn - it may give the queen more freedom but can he really afford to lose a piece and allow another of mine closer to his king?
 [ f x e4 ] , [ f x e4 ]  Now if white does Rxp then [ Q g5 ] is strong for black as it puts all his forces aimed at the white king and an overwhelming attack follows.
 [ Q c3 ]  [ Q x c6 ]  [ b4 ]  [ Q x c3 ] , [ N x c3 ]  Trading Queens improves Black's chances of survival.
 [ Q d8 ] , [ Q e3 ]  I didn't want black to be able to try to force a queen exchange.
 [ B a3 ]  [ Q f5 ]  [ Q b4 ] , [ d5 ]  Getting that pesky Knight out of the way.
 [ O-O ] , [ N f3 ]  8. [ B d3 ] [ R e8 + ] 9. [ N e2 ] is of course better... Now pawn [ c4 ] gets lost... However after 8. ... c5! 9. [ N e2 ] ([ d x c5 ] Be6!) [ c x d4 ] 10. [ c x d4 ] dx[ c4 ] 11. Bx[ c4 ] [ N c6 ] all is well for black...
 [ N f6 ]  [ B g2 ]  [ g6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B g7 ]  [ b3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B b2 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ h3 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ N b d2 ]  [ Q c8 ]  [ K h2 ]  [ R d8 ] , [ N h4 ]  trying to reduce black's arsenal while bringing my bishop and f-pawn more in to play.
 [ Q f6 ]  [ B x c8 ]  [ R a x c8 ]  [ f4 ]  [ R c e8 ]  [ e5 ]  [ Q g6 ]  [ Q d3 ]  [ R e d8 ]  [ Q x g6 ] , [ h x g6 ]  I was rather relieved to get the queens off. I thought it would be hard for white to attack my weak doubled g pawns.
 [ B h6 ]  [ R c a1 ] , [ a6 ]  Giving him dominion over the a file but I preserve the pawn structure.
 [ N x f1 ]  [ R x f1 ] , [ N e7 ]  Aiming to put his second knight in on g3. It's not entirely clear if [ g3 ] is that great a square for the knight though.
 [ N x g2 ]  [ R x d8 + ]  [ Q x d8 ]  [ K x g2 ]  [ Q d5 + ] , [ K f1 ]  The final blunder probably [ f3 ] was better
 [ R x c3 ]  [ a5 ]  [ a4 ]  [ B b6 ]  [ R c6 ]  [ B d8 ] , [ R d6 ]  The position is still difficult for white to resolve. The bishop can keep dancing around squares and even [ R d7 ] won't quite resolve the matter.
 [ B c6 ]  [ B x f5 ]  [ Q h2 ] , [ N e8 ]  [ N g4 ] would have been much better here. It would have done the double task of attacking the queen and protecting the [ e4 ] pawn. This was my last (and fatal) blunder. Had I made the [ N g4 ] move I think that I might have been still in the game although clearly still at a positional disadvantage despite my 2 point lead.
 [ R g1 ] , [ R g3 ]  Wanting to trade again.
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ] , [ f4 ]  the Morra Gambit lines: just what I prefer to play with White; so my answer is ready...
 [ d3 ]  [ Q h4 ] , [ N g3 ]  White should have taken Black's knight on [ e4 ] at this point. White should have been on a great outpost.
 [ N a3 ] , [ b4 ]  Black push b soldier in white territory to force le Chevalier blanc to decide
 [ Q e3 ] , [ g6 ]  Preparing to fianchetto the bishop seems like a sound decision.
 [ Q x f4 ] , [ g x f4 ]  (!) White can regroup his knight with Nc3-a2-b4. However he hs targets at [ g2 ] and [ f3 ] which could falter soon with ...[ f5 ]  [ R f d1 ]  [ h4 ]  [ R x d8 + ]  [ R x d8 ]  [ R d1 ] , [ R c8 ]  (!) Topalov keeps his rook to attack [ g2 ] and c2.
 [ O-O ]  [ N b d7 ]  [ d x c6 ]  [ b x c6 ] , [ b5 ]  [ Q x c6 ] is better but White does not have sufficient play for the piece.
 [ N d5 ]  [ B d4 ] , [ Q d8 ]  queen back on the home square for the third time.
 [ R a c8 ] , [ K g2 ]  not doing much: maybe preparing trading Bishops with Bg3...
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ f4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N e7 ]  [ c3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ g3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ B g2 ]  [ O-O ] , [ O-O ]  White chose to play along the lines of the Grand Prix Attack: Black is already running behind in tempo...
 [ B e7 ] , [ h4 ]  Another questionable move by White. White advances the [ h4 ] pawn which compromises the king side pawn structure if White intends to castle in that direction. White might have been trying to prevent moving the knight from [ f3 ] (which is threatening to capture Black's d pawn). however i this position White can simple move [ B f4 ] which still gives him an active bishop although he did allow Black to develop his BSB.
 [ K h6 ] , [ d6 ]  !!! This move decides the game as Black can now choose to die quickly or much more slowly...
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ B b5 + ]  [ B d7 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ B x b5 ]  [ N x f6 + ] , [ Q x f6 ]  Oh no! I'm down 3 points! But wait...
 [ R x a2 ]  [ K f4 ] , [ R e2 ]  Now I was starting to feel worried since my opponent has stopped my plan of reaching [ e5 ] with my king. At this point in the game I tried calculating out what the endgame would be like after 47) [ h5 ] [ B x e7 ] 48) [ B x e7 ] [ R x e7 ] 49) [ R x e7 ] Kxe7. I can't remember my exact calculations but I think I ended up seeing both of us queening with me queening first for one line. Actually my mind kept on wandering through calculations and I don't know if I was thinking perfectly clearly. I'll go through some calculations I've made since the game ended. First off I can't run my h-pawn up the board alone because his king is close enough to catch it. If I try 50) [ K g5 ] to defend my pawn as it comes up the board then my opponent plays 50) ... [ K f7 ] and he can pin my king against the edge blocking my h-pawn. After that he can simply queen his a-pawn and I would lose. The final idea was a rather long one: each of us going after the other's pawn and coming back to the pawns on the d-file. Neither of us moves our pawn because it just wastes a tempo for our king. The variation runs as follows: 50) [ K e3 ] [ K f6 ] 51) [ K d3 ] [ K g5 ] 52) [ K c3 ] Kx[ h5 ] 53) [ K b3 ] [ K g4 ] 54) [ K a4 ] [ K f4 ] 55) [ K x a5 ] Ke4. There's nothing I can do to stop 56) ... [ K x d4 ] and an eventual win by black. I ended up pretty tired after trying to calculate everything out and not seeing a win for me so I went with option number two:
 [ B x f3 ]  [ Q x f3 ] , [ R b8 ]  Wanting to attack my Queen side.
 [ Q x d6 ]  [ e5 ] , [ Q x e5 ]  ?? Thinking that Tom has dodged the bullet though he took here. But this move is even worse as now I will capture on [ a8 ] leaving me a Rook for pawn up. BTW similar to what you saw in my game with tombulous when he took my B and I captured the same way; I kept this variation in mind when playing 10.Nb5. In other words I saw this coming on my 10th move.
 [ N x g4 ] , [ B e6 + ]  8. [ B e6 + ] - fork on BK on [ d7 ] and black knight on g4.
 [ e3 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N h3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ Q f3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ d4 ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ B x d4 ]  [ Q g3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B e3 ] , [ R e8 ]  
 [ R e8 ] , [ N b3 ]  Which is the explanation for this move. I actually made an in game note to try to trade this knight for this bishop. With the board being open in the center I'd speculate that knights are worth about 2 points here and bishops about 4 points rather than 3 and 3. Ideally I want to see the queen come out and cover the bishop here so I could get my exchange. I felt brilliant and crafty at this point.
 [ B e7 ]  [ a3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B d4 ] , [ B d7 ]  +6 and I should think about f6-[ e5 ] to win some manouver space.
 [ g6 ]  [ N x g6 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ Q x f5 ]  ?! I have never seen this before and cannot find literature to support it. Intuitively it seems somewhat inferior as it seems to allow Black to recoup most of his material losses and continue his development with tempo by chasing the WQ around. The question now as it always is in the Latvian is whether Black can find the right moves to do so without falling into a trap.
 [ f4 ] , [ R d5 ]  This is a good move but a little too late I think.
 [ R f x f2 ] , [ N x f2 ]  ?? [ Q x f2 + ] QxQ NxQ KxN exB and the game would have been playable but I made the wrong move again overwhelmend with all the lines I analyzed the moves before I didn't see the obvious...
 [ e6 ] , [ B f4 ]  Develop with tempo.
 [ d5 ]  [ c4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ c6 ]  [ e3 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ Q c2 ] , [ B g4 ]  What for? Bg4-Bh5-Bg6?
 [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ N d2 ] , [ B e6 ]  Slightly better is [ B e7 ] to prepare for castling. The [ d5 ] knight is already defended by Black's queen and [ c6 ] pawn.
 [ g6 ]  [ f x g6 ]  [ f x g6 ] , [ R g7 ]  Stops mate on h2. I could have played [ N x g6 ] or [ R x g6 ] [ R x g6 ] [ N x g6 ] but I wanted my knight centralized
 [ Q b5 + ] , [ N d7 ]  Nice I don't have to worry about my pawn on [ d5 ] anymore :)
 [ R e3 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ f3 ]  [ N x c5 ] , [ R x c5 ]  White no longer has any minor pieces but two Rooks.
 [ Q x f5 ]  [ R x f5 ]  [ N g3 ]  [ R f8 ]  [ R b1 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ R d8 ]  [ R b7 ] , [ d5 ]  Alternative variation: [ Fritz 11:] 32... [ a5 ] 33. [ R b6 ] [ N g5 ] 34. [ N x d6 ] [ K f8 ] 35. [ R c6 ] [ R d7 ] 36. [ a4 ] [ B d2 ] 37. [ K g3 ] [ B e1 ] 38. [ R a6 ] [ N e6 ] 39. [ N e4 ] [ R g7 + ] 40. [ K h4 ] [ R g6 ] 41. [ R b6 ] [ K g7 ] 42. [ R b7 + ] [ K h6 ] 43. [ R b6 ] [ N f4 ] [-1. 33/21]
 [ B c4 ]  [ Q c3 ] , [ R c8 ]  ? I do not know why I played this but it is a blunder. 9...[ B x f1 ] would have been my best move because it would have stopped him from castling. In general you do not want to automatically castle but it is important to have that option according to Natalia Pogonina. If I had played 9...[ B x f1 ] castling would not be a choice.
 [ c5 ]  [ R x b2 ]  [ c x d6 ] , [ c x d6 ]  And white is gonna lose.
 [ h4 ] , [ N f6 ]  I reciprocate with [ h4 ] stopping the h pawn from coming down the h file.
 [ B h3 ] , [ N b d7 ]  Finally developing the knight.
 [ Q d2 ]  [ B f6 ]  [ f4 ] , [ g6 ]  stopping back rank threats.
 [ g6 ]  [ Q d2 ] , [ R f c8 ]  I didn't see any other place for the rook but it's a weak move letting the initiative to white. 22. [ R b7 ] would have been better.
 [ B x a8 ]  [ Q d6 ]  [ Q a4 + ]  [ c6 ]  [ Q x a7 ] , [ Q d5 ]  While making a counter threat on white's rook is admirable QxN followed by QxB will be curtains for black.
 [ B x d5 ] , [ Q c5 ]  White is busted.
 [ K x d1 ] , [ N e4 ]  This doesn't look particularly good for me.
 [ d5 ]  [ c4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ c6 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ N b d7 ]  [ e4 ]  [ Q a5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ B d2 ]  [ B b4 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ a3 ]  [ B x d2 + ]  [ Q x d2 ]  [ Q x d2 + ]  [ K x d2 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B d3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ R h e1 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ R e7 ]  [ B x f3 ]  [ g x f3 ]  [ R a b8 ]  [ R c1 ]  [ R f e8 ]  [ R e3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ R c7 ]  [ K f8 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ R e c8 ]  [ R e e7 ]  [ R x c7 ]  [ R x c7 ]  [ N h5 ]  [ K e3 ]  [ g5 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ a5 ]  [ b4 ]  [ a x b4 ]  [ a x b4 ]  [ N f4 ]  [ b5 ]  [ R a8 ]  [ R c8 + ]  [ R x c8 ]  [ B x c8 ] , [ b6 ]  Observations: 1. Material is even. 2. Both kings are shut off from the Queenside. 3. The white king cannot penetrate the kingside. 4. [ d5 ] will require protection by Black. 5. The bishop cannot protect [ [ d4 ] ] the king will be required. Black's plan: 1. Restrain the bishop. 2. Penetrate the position with the knight using the king to protect e5. 3. Attack on the kingside holding the White king near d3/[ e3 ] by threat to [ [ d4 ] ] so that he cannot restrain the penetration of the black king.
 [ R x h2 ]  [ f4 ]  [ R x g6 ]  [ R c c3 ]  [ R h g2 ]  [ R e f3 ]  [ R g2 g1 + ]  [ K e2 ]  [ R g6 g2 + ] , [ R f2 ]  I have a serious disadvantage in the pawn game (even if we have the same number of pawns). [ R g3 ] is the best move I can see because if he takes then I open up his back ranks to attack. Of course [ R f3 ] is a most wise move.
 [ Q x g3 + ]  [ Q g2 ] , [ Q x g2 + ]  Black has an extra piece so there's no need for him to play ...[ h4 ] and weaken the h-pawn. Once White's position starts to fall apart and he's a piece down the emphasis should be on trying to use the pieces that he's got to grab some initiative not swapping them off. Black is happy playing an endgame with an extra piece and grinding out the win. Simon Webb's excellent book Chess For Tigers explains it beautifully. Tigers will hunt rabbits but rabbits have sharp teeth so you stalk them until they're exhausted. Heffalumps by contrast are stronger than tigers so head for the swamp and hope they fall in before you do.
 [ R e8 ]  [ B d2 ]  [ Q c7 ] , [ d4 ]  Only now do I spot the tactic.
 [ O-O ]  [ b5 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ c x d4 ] , [ e x d4 ]  9. [ e x d4 ] - pawn trade. This now leaves white with an IQP. This could be a target later on but white manages to split up my queenside pawns.
 [ K d4 ]  [ K d6 ]  [ c5 + ] , [ K c6 ]  Now it's a game of cat and mouse since the Queenside pawns are locked up. Who can break through on the Kingside?
 [ O-O ] , [ Q d2 ]  ? failing to notice Black's obvious response
 [ e5 ]  [ N h7 ]  [ Q x h5 ]  [ Q e7 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ c5 ]  [ b x c6 ]  [ e ] , [ p ]  I was thinking to [ B x h6 ] too threaning #.
 [ N a5 ] , [ N d2 ]  Preparing for that I use my N as right now I was happy and at first felt that exchanging my B was the wrong choice. Since after 7...[ N x c7 ] I thought that 8.[ N x c4 ] as opposed to 8.[ d x c4 ] brings my N to an even stronger place then my B was on that square. But my assessment was incorrect here.
 [ R f3 ] , [ R g8 g7 ]  23. ..... I now defend the f pawn and prepare B x [ h3 ] as planned
 [ a x b4 ]  [ c x b4 ] , [ R x a2 ]  Perhaps an immediate [ c3 ] might have been slightly better. For example 23... c3; 24.[ N d f3 ] Ra2! and the [ e4 ] pawn falls opening the a8-[ h1 ] diagonal at the same time.
 [ K d4 ]  [ R c4 + ]  [ K d3 ]  [ R c2 ]  [ K d4 ]  [ a4 ]  [ e4 ]  [ f x e4 ]  [ R f8 + ]  [ K g6 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ K f6 ]  [ R h8 ]  [ K g7 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ a3 ]  [ R e7 + ]  [ K f6 ]  [ R h7 ]  [ K g5 ]  [ R g7 + ]  [ K f6 ]  [ R h7 ]  [ a2 ]  [ R x h6 + ]  [ K f5 ]  [ R h5 + ]  [ K g6 ] , [ R h8 ]  black has the crushing [ a1 = Q ] but runs out of time...
 [ N g e2 ] , [ N c6 ]  A useful square for the knight. This highlights why Black's earlier a7-[ a5 ] was a useful move: Black has control over [ b4 ] which could be a useful square for the knight later on.
 [ R e7 ]  [ Q g6 + ] , [ K f2 ]  
 [ R x d1 ]  [ K x d1 ] , [ K f6 ]  White resigns. The passed pawn can easily be held for black and white can't generate queen side play fast enough because my king or knight can defend the queen side while maintaining the [ e3 ] pawn. I slight improvement would have been g5! locking down the king side. But this is still winning for black.
 [ R d5 ]  [ B x e3 ]  [ N g5 ]  [ R g2 x g5 ]  [ f x g5 + ]  [ R x g5 ]  [ R f6 + ]  [ K h5 ]  [ R x e6 ] , [ B x d5 + ]  And white surrenders.
 [ e4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ e6 ]  Icelandic gambit on tought testing.
 [ K x f7 ]  [ B c4 + ]  [ d5 ]  [ B x d5 + ] , [ K g7 ]  K-[ K1 ] may have been better. Now my King is exposed and blocking my K-side pieces.
 [ Q x e7 + ]  [ K g8 ]  [ Q e6 + ]  [ K f8 ] , [ Q e7 + ]  Tell me what you guys think. gg
 [ R b7 ]  [ h5 ]  [ R b1 ]  [ h6 ]  [ R h1 ] , [ B b6 ]  If 47.Rb3?? likes I originally planned Then the rampant rook tactic comes into play.47.Rb3?? Rf1+! 48.[ K e2 ] [ R e1 + ] 49.[ K d2 ] [ R d1 + ] etc.Same goes for 48.[ K g3 ] Rf3+! 49.[ K h4 ] Rh3+! 50.[ K g5 ] [ R h5 + ] 51.[ K g6 ] [ R x h6 + ] etc.
 [ B x e3 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ N g e2 ]  I develop my knight with the intention to go to [ g3 ] and kick his bishop.
 [ N f3 ] , [ B e7 ]  main line here
 [ b5 ]  [ a x b5 ] , [ Q x b5 ]  Allow white knight to go for c4.
 [ R f d1 ]  [ Q c8 ] , [ f4 ]  Black seems so confined here. His pieces tend to point more queenside than kingside so I was considering a kingside pawn storm later if black allowed
 [ e x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ] , [ O-O-O ]  This is just terrible. I am going to the club in Phoenix next week for an invitational and I need to play a lot better even in blitz.
 [ K f7 ]  [ K e3 ] , [ h5 ]  Nice I should have seen it. I can play Kf to retake with it but then [ g6 ] and I lose a pawn for nothing.
 [ c5 ]  [ f4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ N g5 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ Q x g4 ]  [ N x g4 ]  [ B x f7 + ]  [ K d7 ]  [ B e6 + ] , [ K c6 ]  I'm still undecided which is better: 8...[ K c7 ] or 8...[ K c6 ]  [ B x g4 ] , [ e6 ]  This seems an odd move by Black just chucking a pawn away but it has the benefit of freeing up Black's remaining bishop and possibly distracting White from more dangerous moves with his minor pieces.
 [ N h5 ]  [ B d5 ]  [ R a5 ]  [ b3 ]  [ N f4 ] , [ R b2 ]  Not sure but Rook to [ d1 ] might have been better. In need to pull out the chess board and see where that move could lead.
 [ B h7 ] , [ N e5 ]  His knight has just moved to [ e5 ] an ideal square to course mayhem but my move will be my [ b8 ] knight to [ d7 ] attacking his knight on [ e5 ]  [ N d7 ] , [ N x d7 ]  He then took my knight on [ d7 ] so I remove it with Queen to [ d7 ]  [ Q x d7 ] , [ B g2 ]  Here he plays Bishop to [ g2 ] I will castle long here giving me a rook behind my Queen on [ d8 ] giving me some power on the d file
 [ K c8 ] , [ R e1 ]  Well it won't win black's bishop but it's still development with tempo.
 [ h x g6 ]  [ f x g6 ] , [ K g2 ]  Preparing to move the rook to the h-file. Black needs to act fast unless he wants to get swiftly mated.
 [ B b6 ]  [ O-O ] , [ N a5 ]  Black tries to counter aggressively by attacking White's Bishop.
 [ c3 ]  [ N x f1 ] , [ R x f1 ]  Now the white king cannot castle and it will be very hard for white to join the two rooks.
 [ e6 ]  [ Q e3 ]  [ B g7 ] , [ N f3 ]  Got another piece out threatening check on the next move with my knight and cleared the side out so I can castle if I want.
 [ R d c8 ]  [ R x c5 ]  [ R x c5 ]  [ b4 ] , [ R c1 + ]  18. ...... [ R c1 + ] - I do not want to allow Ion to get a passer on the c column so I decided to lose my rook in this way.
 [ B x e2 ]  [ Q x e2 ] , [ N d4 ]  Saw this coming but not worried
 [ R f6 x f1 ] , [ g x h5 ]  Resignation maybe? It is now mate in one.
 [ h6 ]  [ N x f7 ]  [ K x f7 ]  [ B x g7 ] , [ N c8 ]  Preventing white from taking the N but Joe will now nab h6.
 [ B d6 ]  [ N g f3 ]  [ O-O ] , [ N e5 ]  8. [ N e5 ] - this is the usual spot for a knight in this tournament. It puts a bit of a crimp on black's position.
 [ N x d5 ] , [ e x d5 ]  pressures the [ c6 ] knight
 [ b4 ]  [ f5 ]  [ R c4 ]  [ g5 ]  [ h3 ] , [ h5 ]  32. ..... [ h5 ] - over the last few moves I decided to erect Jo's version of Hadrian's Wall to keep the Barbarians from the Gate! Here the pawns will not be quite so much a target for the enemy rook at least for now.
 [ Q x d4 + ]  [ R x d4 ]  [ a4 ] , [ K c3 ]  Black's pawn is racing for promotion and must be stopped. Seems like my king and rook can team up on him if he advances too far.
 [ K f2 ] , [ g5 ]  Now White cannot play 31 N-[ Q3 ] as 31... N-B7! wins [32 N-[ B5 ] N/7xRP 33 NxN NxN 34 NxP N-N8! and White can resign.]
 [ B b2 ] , [ B b7 ]  Now my development is complete at this point of the game no-one has fired the first arrow or even yelled an insult across no-mans land this is about to change!
 [ a x b4 ] , [ R c c6 ]  This is where I sac my bishop to queen my b pawn
 [ a3 ]  [ R x e8 + ]  [ K f7 ]  [ b8 = Q ]  [ a2 ]  [ Q e5 ] , [ K g6 ]  Mate in two. Solve it!
 [ R e1 ] , [ h5 ]  now my king side pawns will prove their value as I'll push them to promotion
 [ g3 ] , [ R c8 c2 # ]  A pretty mate White's Queen and Knight are punished on the edge of the Board while the King is left at the mercy of the Rooks and Bishop.
 [ R g8 + ]  [ K e7 ] , [ R e8 # ]  But its a forced move and I sat happily imagining blacks fury after his hard work ;-)
 [ B g5 ] , [ B e6 ]  I made a mistake moving 5...Nf6. I should have played 5...[ N c6 ] to be able to move ...[ d4 ] if needed. Now the d pawn was threatened (7.[ B x f6 ] [ Q x f6 ] 8.Nxd5) so I had to defend it. At least there is no [ N [ g5 ] ] threat because the [ g5 ] square is occupied.
 [ Q e6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ c6 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ Q g6 ]  [ N d6 + ]  [ K f8 ]  [ Q f3 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ Q e6 ]  [ N x c8 ]  [ b5 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ Q e8 ]  [ N d6 ]  [ Q e7 ]  [ O-O ] , [ g6 ]  Again when you are threatened try to improved you stand - this time join a piece to the battle.
 [ K e3 ]  [ K b4 ] , [ K d2 ]  I wanted to use Henry to support my pawns but needed him too to avoid promoting. What to do?????
 [ R e3 ] , [ R x e3 # ]  The last move from white will be rook's move to [ e3 ] to block the check from black's rook but it is taken and its checkmate. I wanted to annotate this game as it is my highest rating and I think it was quite a good game. From my side :) I am sure I will hear where I went wrong. And look forward to your comments.
 [ K x g2 ] , [ B e4 + ]  This was an unpleasent move because I just have to admit black really knows how to fight for survival :-) But after looking through it again I realize this isn't really problem...
 [ K g6 ] , [ R g1 + ]  B [ d3 ] [ f5 ] means that the king can probably get safe. Black resigned here due to Q [ g5 ] regardless of where he moves Thanks for reading
 [ N g e2 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ] , [ a6 ]  Castling was the main goal early the opponent did right after me. White wasn't pushing hard especially since it has the advantage with center squares. 6.....[ a6 ] wasn't the best move any comments on a better one??
 [ e5 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ c x d4 ] , [ N d5 ]  Stalling White's central advance and centralizing the Knight.
 [ Q g5 ]  [ Q d4 ]  [ b6 ]  [ N e3 ]  [ R a7 ]  [ R c4 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ f4 ]  [ Q h6 ] , [ R e c1 ]  It's going to be tough for him to keep that pawn.
 [ K f1 ]  [ Q h3 + ]  [ K e2 ]  [ N h2 ]  [ Q f2 ] , [ N f1 ]  attack the [ g3 ] pawn or he can take me up on the offer
 [ R f8 + ]  [ K c7 ] , [ Q e6 ]  Now either the pawns on [ e7 ] or [ e5 ] will fall.
 [ c3 ] , [ B x a4 ]  ...which is exactly what I get doubling my advantage.
 [ B x f3 ] , [ Q d3 ]  My B was forced to retreat.
 [ e5 ] , [ Q a4 ]  Ok I had a light square advantage on the queenside right? So let's use it! IN fact it would have been much better [ N x e5 ] NxN [ Q x d5 + ] followed by QxR or better ([ N f7 ] shielding from the check [ h x g6 ] [ h x g6 ] and speculate with it before taking the rook)
 [ K e6 ] , [ R b d1 ]  Blocking the black king.
 [ B g5 ]  [ b4 ]  [ B x f6 ] , [ g x f6 ]  18. ...... [ g x f6 ] - again I cannot resist to sac B for N in order to do a pawn-busting exercise. Alas I must now retreat my knight to b1. If you look at my above note at move 12 I could have avoided having to do this.
 [ f6 ]  [ e x f6 ] , [ N x f6 ]  Black has cleverly figured out a way to get his N back in a good defensive position.
 [ Q e7 ] , [ f x g4 ]  DEAD preacher
 [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ g6 ]  The game shows a novelty by black in Dragon Sicilian.
 [ N f6 ]  [ d3 ]  [ d6 ] , [ a4 ]  Another unusual move. White is preparing to pawn storm the Black minor pieces on the Queen side. However the attack will take so long to materialise that Black can prepare escape routes for both of the threatened pieces. White has lost another temp which Black can use to continue developing.
 [ Q c7 ] , [ B f4 ]  A strong square for the bishop that prevents black from freeing himself with ...e6-e5. While at the same time x-raying the black queen on c7. In the short term the club's plan was to constrain black as much as possible to deny him the ability to free himself. By denying black his ability to counterattack this would force him to eventually take drastic measures to get something going. However as long as black continues to hide behind his wall of pawns there is not much white can do in the end. So all white can hope for is that black over extends or gets impatient. This is what makes systems like the pirc so hard to play because no one likes the feeling of being squeezed to death.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ c3 ] , [ d6 ]  I don't like what black has done. I think it's too passive unless black plays accurately which he soon does not.
 [ N x c3 ]  [ B x c3 + ]  [ b x c3 ] , [ R d8 ]  ...but now I have some pressure on the colum and I can start thinking in e5.
 [ Q e3 ]  [ B x b2 ] , [ Q x e6 + ]  21. [ Q x e6 ] - white chooses to take the e pawn - very tempting indeed when it involves a check. White has a plan but unfortunately for him but fortunately for me it will backfire big time!
 [ B x f7 + ]  [ K e7 ]  [ B x g8 ] , [ N x g8 ]  and now Black is down three points with no compensation for the lost material (in fact he's worse off with all but the knight undeveloped and his own king hindering the development of his Queen and bishop)
 [ R h8 ]  [ b x c6 ]  [ b x c6 ]  [ N d2 ] , [ R x h2 ]  Better was 40. ...Nf6! guarding the e-pawn while still pocketing White's h-pawn.
 [ K h1 ] , [ N c3 ]  very good move forking queen and rock this is the main power of a knight.
 [ Q x e5 + ] , [ R f4 ]  It is very difficult a game to play. Could I ever save it?
 [ R e f8 ]  [ R e5 ]  [ R h6 ]  [ Q g5 ]  [ R x h3 ] , [ R c5 ]  WHITE HOPING FOR....[ Q b4 ] or [ R c7 ] .....but.......
 [ N x d6 ]  [ c x d6 ] , [ Q b6 + ]  ! inviting the exchange of queens... white has more space but I'm exchanging pieces at a steady pace so he would probably have a lots of problems to solve in the endgame we are reaching it fast!
 [ B d3 ] , [ N e7 ]  Black reached a favourable position...
 [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ N e7 ]  [ c4 ]  [ N f5 ]  [ Q d3 ]  [ h4 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ N d6 ] , [ N b1 d2 ]  The knight comes out again.
 [ N d e5 ] , [ a6 ]  hoping for [ b x a6 ] Bxa6...
 [ N c7 + ] , [ K e7 ]  It's double-check nothing for it but to move the king and lose the rook. Well lose the exchange because I will get that knight.
 [ B c3 ]  [ R d6 x d1 ]  [ R x d1 ]  [ R x d1 + ]  [ Q x d1 ] , [ Q e7 ]  Well now I have a losing endgame with an unusual four bishops + queens formation.
 [ Q x d2 ]  [ R x d2 + ]  [ K g1 ] , [ Q b1 + ]  Black now forces White's next move.
 [ B g5 ]  [ N x f6 ]  [ N x f6 + ] , [ K h8 ]  Best to avoid loosing the rook
 [ Q d4 ]  [ Q f5 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ N c5 ]  [ b4 ] , [ N b3 ]  A fork but I'm not going to remove the minor pieces hoping I may be able to get the queen to attack the bishop as well.
 [ K d1 ]  [ N e3 + ] , [ K e1 ]  15. [ K [ e1 ] ] - Henry moves back to [ e1 ] - [ [ g1 ] ] is now not an option because the file is completely open to the Wicked Witch. I know I should have put Henry on [ [ g1 ] ] but then I would be effectively a whole rook down because of the rook shut in on h1. Still I suppose there are other ways to develop a rook. Henry would have lived a lot longer though.
 [ f4 ]  [ g x f4 ]  [ B x f4 ] , [ B e5 ]  It seemed clever at the time. I didn't anticipate white's reply though in hindsight it seems obvious. I just figured he wouldn't let black take the [ d6 ] pawn so he would have to trade bishops.
 [ R c8 + ]  [ K d7 ] , [ R x g8 ]  6 points and half an hour up the win should be easy now. My watching colleagues were expecting me to force swaps and quickly exploit the extra material. I became obsessed with a king hunt which proved none too easy ...
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ B b5 ]  
 [ Q x c3 ] , [ N x a2 ]  Irritating but accurate where white loses the dark squares.
 [ a4 ] , [ B a6 ]  ... and he didn't see it coming.
 [ a6 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ Q x c2 ]  [ N f7 ]  [ Q x d1 ]  [ R a x d1 ]  [ b5 ]  [ N c5 ] , [ R h e8 ]  Had to choose Rd was 'defended' by my K if you will so I decided to offer that one.
 [ K d7 ]  [ R h7 + ]  [ K c8 ] , [ Q e7 ]  In theory not a bad continuation I just weep for the missed rook check. Perhaps [ e5 ] to bring in some more pawn pressure.
 [ N c6 ] , [ d4 ]  now both central pawns in play
 [ B e3 ]  [ N d7 ] , [ B e2 ]  White develop quietly and postponed the question of the center. After dxe fxe black would have the [ f6 ] square for the knight and [ e7 ] for the bishop with acceptable development. After [ d5 ] the position is locked and black can continue with plan involving [ g6 ] [ B g7 ] N[ e7 ] 0-0 f5. Like Philidor.
 [ O-O ] , [ d5 ]  I bring up my queen's pawn to attack his king's pawn...
 [ N x d1 ]  [ a6 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ c3 ] , [ B b3 ]  14. ...... [ B b3 ] (the start of a plan to win a queenside pawn)
 [ Q h5 + ]  [ g6 ] , [ Q x c5 ]  And end of the game. Or not? I could recover the piece if he lets me.
 [ B d7 ] , [ B c4 ]  I don't want to exchange any more pieces. It will weaken my attacking possibilities.
 [ f6 ]  [ O-O ] , [ f x e5 ]  He really didn't like my pawns I guess.
 [ c6 ]  [ Q c2 ]  [ f5 ]  [ N e2 ]  [ b5 ]  [ c5 ] , [ N a6 ]  Odd move preparing for [ N c7 ] -> [ N d5 ] where it seems quite strong.
 [ b3 ] , [ N c3 ]  Aiming on exchanging the bishop [ b5 ] to destroy white's strong bishop pair.
 [ f6 ]  [ R a b8 ]  [ a6 ]  [ R b a8 ]  [ R b6 ] , [ R h f8 ]  have my pawns up and ready to promote some time soon!
 [ K a7 ]  [ B d5 ]  [ R h1 ]  [ R x b7 + ]  [ K a6 ]  [ K a4 ]  [ R a1 ]  [ b4 ]  [ R x a2 + ]  [ B x a2 ]  [ K x b7 ] , [ b x a5 ]  A tactic which paid off!
 [ Q d1 + ]  [ K g3 ]  [ Q d3 + ]  [ K h2 ]  [ Q d4 ]  [ Q f5 + ]  [ K g8 ]  [ Q e5 ]  [ Q d3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ f5 ]  [ K h7 ] , [ f6 ]  i could not allow him to check on the h2-[ b8 ] line... there are risks of perpetual check
 [ B e7 ] , [ a6 ]  I considered moving the f pawn up to support the e pawn. If [ B x c5 ] followed by [ b x c5 ] then the rook could take the e pawn for free. I decided that another pawn push would do more to make black worry. Chess is a psychological game after all.
 [ Q x e7 + ]  [ B x e7 ]  [ B x d5 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ g5 ] , [ B x b8 ]  ? White is wasting moves.
 [ N f6 ] , [ c4 ]  I did not want to play [ e4 ] and lose the e file. I opted for something slightly different from my recent matches.
 [ B x f3 ]  [ Q x f3 ] , [ O-O ]  The king looks safe right....... wait in a few moves.
 [ Q x d2 ] , [ N a5 ]  The knight makes another attempt ... may be wiser this time. The there is a double threat in this move: (1) the pawn on [ c4 ] is hanging and (2) there is the nice fork on b3.
 [ K e3 ] , [ B c5 + ]  Check.
 [ Q x f4 ] , [ e x f4 ]  Obvious exchange which lets white pawn advance to [ e5 ] to block [ f6 ] tile
 [ Q x d5 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ Q d6 ]  [ Q b7 ]  [ R e1 + ]  [ N e7 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B c6 ]  [ g3 ]  [ B h1 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ f5 ]  [ K x h1 ]  [ f x e4 ]  [ R x e4 ]  [ R f8 ]  [ K g2 ]  [ R f7 ]  [ h4 ]  [ a5 ]  [ K h3 ]  [ R x f2 ]  [ Q g6 + ]  [ K f8 ]  [ Q d6 ]  [ K e8 ] , [ R g4 ]  And it`s over!
 [ Q c1 + ]  [ N f1 ]  [ Q g5 ]  [ N g3 ] , [ Q c1 + ]  At this point I am trying for a draw.
 [ N a6 ] , [ c3 ]  firming up my pawn chain and preventing [ N b4 ] should he be considering it
 [ R b8 ] , [ d6 ]  One step closer... Aware of the attacking opportunities for black down the queenside but it seems to be repelled easy enough. I expected something like: 34. [ d6 ] [ R a2 ] 35. [ B e4 ] [ B x e4 ] 36. [ Q x e4 ]  [ R b1 + ]  [ K f2 ] , [ R b3 ]  Trying to squeeze Henry into the wall.
 [ c5 ] , [ f4 ]  2. [ f4 ] - this is the Scilian Grand Prix. I used to experiment with this against the Sicilian a lot in my OTB games. I played it once on gameknot and was a pawn up against a 1600 player when he timed out on me.
 [ K c3 ] , [ N e4 + ]  ...and again splitting him and the bishop.
 [ B b8 ] , [ B x h7 + ]  The attack begins.
 [ d x c4 ]  [ b x c4 ]  [ R h1 ]  [ K f7 ]  [ Q e1 ]  [ c x b3 ]  [ c x b3 ] , [ Q x e4 + ]  Force the trade of queens and I see a mate involving moving the rook to [ f2 ] check on [ c3 ] with the knight then mate on a2.
 [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ g6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ e4 ]  [ d6 ] , [ f4 ]  The game opening is E76 King's Indian Four Pawns Attack. This opening gains much space for White. Black needs to respond to avoid losing the center.
 [ e x f4 ]  [ N d4 ] , [ Q f2 ]  ! the best square for the queen
 [ B f4 ]  [ N g6 ]  [ e4 ]  [ d x e4 ] , [ Q c3 ]  Now I'm ahead by two Pawns which should be a big enough margin to win. Time to think about trading down and simplifying the game.
 [ N d6 + ]  [ B x d6 ]  [ Q x d6 ]  [ Q e7 ]  [ Q x e7 + ]  [ N x e7 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ a6 ]  [ B x d7 + ]  [ N x d7 ]  [ K e2 ]  [ R c8 ]  [ R h d1 ]  [ N c5 ] , [ B x c5 ]  Better was to keep the bishop; e.g. 17.[ R a c1 ] [ N e6 ] 18.[ N d5 ] etc.
 [ Q a5 ] , [ e5 ]  That seemed to be the only move that makes sense in this position further opening up the centre. I'm not sure whether White really is better in this position I guess with precise play Black can defend and catch up in development?!
 [ Q e2 ] , [ e4 ]  white can't play dxe4?? or else [ R x d1 + ] [ N e1 ] winning a rook
 [ Q x d8 + ]  [ K x d8 ]  [ N x f7 + ]  [ K e8 ]  [ N x h8 ] , [ c x b2 ]  And with that I take right here. This should've waited as now Nathan can do an entire fianchetto in just one move become way ahead in development which is a further advantage to him.
 [ N x b7 ] , [ Q b6 ]  that pawn is now mine and the d file will be open for my rooks
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ] , [ N f3 ]  Classic opening
 [ h7 ]  [ R h5 ]  [ h8 = Q ]  [ R x h8 ]  [ R x h8 ] , [ b2 ]  OK. So white has now evened up the game. Things still looked good for me though. With four pawns one on the 7th rank and a bishop for support my odds of promoting a pawn looked pretty good.
 [ N d5 ] , [ O-O ]  Black completes his development. The Knight on [ e7 ] is vulnerable to the pin...
 [ N g3 + ]  [ K d2 ] , [ N x h1 ]  Taking the rook
 [ N e4 ]  [ B b2 ] , [ N x c3 ]  ? black just wasted 2 moves for this???
 [ K f8 ] , [ K d7 ]  Black resigns as the Pawn will inevitably become a Queen.
 [ R c8 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ b5 ] , [ Q c2 ]  15. Qc2?! - I think this is where I start to go wrong yes this move seems reasonable as it connects my rooks and adds protection to the [ e4 ] pawn but unfortunately Glenda is on the same file as an enemy rook. Michael exploits this over the next few moves. In a post match pm Ion had this to say "There was nothing wrong by the way with snapping up the b-pawn at move 15.Nxb5. Black can try to exploit the WQ's conflict of interest but it costs the exchange: 15...[ Q b6 ] 16.[ Q d3 ] Nx[ e4 ] 17.Bx[ e4 ] Rx[ e4 ] 18.Qx[ e4 ] Qxb5. White's b-pawn is probably unsalvagable so 19.[ R a d1 ] or 19.[ Q e7 ] putting pressure on the centre might be the way to go. Otherwise 15.[ N x b5 ] [ Q b6 ] 16.[ Q d3 ] c4? 17.[ B x b6 ] [ c x d3 ] 18.[ B x a7 ] looks great for White." Hindsight is always 20/20 vision though!
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ] , [ e5 ]  This is the advance variation. Other moves are playable.
 [ Q x g7 ]  [ Q x b1 + ]  [ K e2 ]  [ Q c2 + ]  [ K e1 ]  [ R x b8 ]  [ Q x h8 ]  [ Q x c3 + ] , [ K e2 ]  Black maintains a constant check preventing White from gaining any material.
 [ B b4 ]  [ g5 ]  [ B x c3 + ] , [ b x c3 ]  7. [ b x c3 ] - the black knight must now retreat to [ g8 ] but not before I leave him with a shattered queenside pawn structure.
 [ e5 ]  [ K g3 ]  [ B c8 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ R e7 ]  [ B c6 ]  [ R x c7 ]  [ B x a8 ] , [ a5 ]  ...black has the tempo with threats of Rc3...
 [ d3 ] , [ B x f5 ]  Winning back one of the Pawns.
 [ h4 ]  [ g4 ] , [ B x g4 ]  ?! The sacrifice is bad enough as it is however even if I do want to sac a piece it should have been the knight that I sacrificed not the bishop. However the main idea behind the sacrifice was to leave white in a position where it is very difficult to develop and coordinate the pieces I thought by having my knight on [ g4 ] white would have a difficult time however I guess I just got lazy and didn't put enough thought into it. Because white has a reasonably easy game after this.
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ c3 ]  3. [ c3 ] - this move is the Ponziani Opening this opening is very rarely played at Master Level and is not that well known. This move is intended to support [ d4 ] get dsb out onto [ e3 ] and then queen knight onto d2.
 [ B a7 ] , [ N f3 ]  Bringing the knight back to the king side to engage with the rook
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ] , [ d4 ]  Some players prefer developing defensive positions while others prefer assertive openings that disrupt defensive pieces. With this move I guessed early on that my opponent likes hawkish tactics but only found out later his preference for nervy moves.
 [ f5 ]  [ g x f5 ]  [ B x f5 ]  [ N e1 ]  [ e5 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ B x e5 ]  [ B x e5 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ N d f3 ] , [ Q e7 ]  18. ................ [ Q e7 ] - attacks a pawn so my next move 19. [ K b2 ] is forced.
 [ Q x g1 ] , [ Q d6 ]  Threatens mate on [ e7 ] and also defends the [ h2 ] pawn and therefore preventing the black queen from escaping through there.
 [ R c7 ]  [ B x g7 ]  [ K x g7 ]  [ Q d4 + ]  [ K g8 ]  [ R a c1 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ R x c7 ]  [ Q x c7 ]  [ R d1 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ K f2 ]  [ Q e7 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ Q e5 ] , [ Q x e5 ]  Good chance to get rid of the queens "Destroying Them"
 [ R d1 ]  [ R c c7 ]  [ R x d4 ] , [ g3 ]  covering more squares around my king.
 [ B x c6 ]  [ B x c6 ]  [ d x c6 ]  [ Q c2 ]  [ e5 ] , [ c5 ]  This is a temporary pawn sac designed to expose the double pawns to my queen and rooks later.
 [ g6 ] , [ f4 ]  Hoping at some stage to be able to get in [ e5 ] and cause disruption to the Black set-up.
 [ O-O ] , [ Q d7 ]  I line up for a bishop sacrifice on [ h3 ] but the knight of [ g5 ] must move first to ensure success.
 [ B e7 ] , [ B g5 ]  Here I was thinking about 13.[ K h1 ] but decided to make it later when (if ever) getting forced to do so. 13.[ Q e2 ] also crossed my mind with the idea of 13... 0-0 14.Rxa6! [ R x a6 ] 15.[ B x a6 ] [ R b8 ] 16.Rd1.. most probably it was better then 13.[ B g5 ] anyway. However found these moves too delicate too slow. I was in a rush to win the game.
 [ K b1 ] , [ Q x g3 ]  Both moves more of less forced. So we have returned to material equality but I have given up my good bishop and he has got rid of his bad knight.
 [ c x d4 ]  [ c x d4 ] , [ B g4 ]  pinning the N and threatening to take it depriving the d-pawn of its cover.
 [ e x d4 ] , [ e x d4 ]  Now the next black's plan is to take control of the e file.
 [ Q a5 + ]  [ K e8 ]  [ Q x b5 + ]  [ K f8 ]  [ R b8 ]  [ R x b8 ]  [ Q x b8 + ]  [ K g7 ] , [ b5 ]  28. [ b5 ] - in retrospect I consider this a questionable move. Why not play [ b x c5 ] instead? The pawn would have a rook behind my queen could come back to [ b2 ] in case she needs to defend. But I don't need to defend remember? I'm up a minor piece and a pawn I've chased the Black king across the board and my b-pawn will queen. I've won.
 [ B x h8 ]  [ R x h8 ]  [ N e2 ] , [ f6 ]  17. ...... [ f6 ] - after the horse has bolted the stable door shuts.
 [ K a7 ]  [ a6 ]  [ K b8 ]  [ b6 ]  [ K a8 ] , [ c4 ]  Bringing up the rest of the formation.
 [ K e8 ] , [ N e6 ]  30...Rc-[ h7 ] won't help black because of 31.[ c6 ] bx[ c6 ] 32.Rxc6.
 [ K c1 ]  [ N x h4 ] , [ R x c4 ]  Even if it means giving up my c-pawn. Those doubled pawns give me hope of an endgame win but really giving up both my central pawns was rather foolish.
 [ f4 ] , [ N c4 ]  Well there is an ugly fork on [ e3 ] so I must eliminate his knight.
 [ N c3 ] , [ N f5 ]  The knight can also defend and attack...here the knight gives notice to the White Queen. Move or you lose!
 [ a x b4 ] , [ K f3 ]  I would've played 89.[ K g4 ] to support the pawns. Worth noting is that more often then not one of the main things that makes the K dangerous in the endgame is when it goes in between those pawns as that's where it does a lot of damage in part by strengthening the pawn chain. However this move is better because of what's about to unfold.
 [ R e b1 ] , [ h4 ]  So white now brings his rook to [ b1 ] and rooks are now doubled on the b file. I continue to attack the king by pushing my h pawn to [ h5 ] and attack the pawn at g3. At present I am down 2 points I only have one rook but I have 3 pieces; a pair of bishops and knight against black's bishop and knight and 2 rooks. But I have 6 pawns whilst white has 6 pawns with doubled pawns on e file.
 [ Q a3 + ] , [ K d2 ]  More or less forced. Actually I said I looked at this move and studied but this is a blunder. Best was 32.[ K b1 ] And he said "yes your right :{" The reason is that black will be able to get which will at the very least lose a N. However there is something that I missed there. What I figure out a move later is that white doesn't have to lose his N. Instead there's a different variation that would protect it but he'd still a lose a pawn. So edited this comment a move later.
 [ Q x d2 ]  [ N x d2 ] , [ B a4 ]  Rushing my pieces over to the passed pawn.
 [ a1 = Q ]  [ Q a6 + ]  [ K b2 ]  [ Q x a1 + ] , [ K x a1 ]  Why try to stop it when I have another one ready?
 [ R f3 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ Q f1 ]  [ f6 ]  [ B a6 ]  [ B x a6 ]  [ Q x a6 ] , [ N a5 ]  this move loses a pawn if white plays [ Q b7 ] but i couldn't fid a better continuation.... his move had suprised me as it seemed he was planning an attack kingside
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ f5 ]  ?! The Latvian Gambit. I will not go over the opening lines in detail here; I annotated a series consisting of my first ten games with the opening here on GK so take a look at those for detailed explanation and examples of the opening lines.
 [ N c3 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ Q x d4 ] , [ N c6 ]  I liked the idea of exchanging pawns and developing my knight with tempo
 [ N b d2 ]  [ N c7 ] , [ R a b1 ]  A mistake dropping the exchange. But things were already becoming difficult for white. He should have tried to use the extra material and open the center luckily for me though I had him completely concerned about my side of the board. (The joys of playing 15xx players!)
 [ R c8 ]  [ K f2 ]  [ K f8 ] , [ f4 ]  another attempt to rectify his pawn structure... <<<(Taufiq) Still doing good moves or are there better moves to do ?>>>
 [ Q x b4 ]  [ R c b1 ] , [ Q a4 ]  stronger is [ Q a5 ] or [ Q a3 ] to prevent both [ R b2 ] and Qd2... but is of no matter anymore; [ B d3 ] is getting into trouble......
 [ R b8 ]  [ B d5 ] , [ f6 ]  f6! is unexpected and unexplainable A simple 0-0 would be Ok.
 [ B e4 ] , [ N x e4 ]  Better 20.Be2. The move played just helps blacks plan.
 [ Q e2 ]  [ N x f1 ]  [ Q x f1 ]  [ Q x f4 ]  [ N a3 ]  [ Q x e5 ]  [ B f2 ]  [ B x f2 ] , [ Q x f2 ]  All my minor pieces have been removed. White has gained considerable luft now that there is no direct attack possible at the moment. However he is down a Rook and all 8 of my pawns remain.
 [ B x d6 ]  [ N c4 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B a6 ] , [ Q f3 ]  Now the fireworks start.
 [ Q x h5 + ] , [ K d8 ]  Black has no castling capacity his pieces are dismal and he does not have much in the way of counterplay. I got really confident at this point and believed the game to be set in stone as a win for me. Lesson: don't play ego games with yourself - just play your best until its over.
 [ N f6 ]  [ b5 ] , [ N h5 ]  With my pawn on [ f5 ] the N is safe on [ h5 ] and supports the next planned advance.
 [ a x b4 ]  [ c x b4 ]  [ B x b4 ]  [ K e7 ] , [ g4 ]  Black's DSB has done next to nothing all game and now its position is even more hopeless than ever.
 [ R c6 ]  [ N e8 ] , [ R b6 ]  This however is where I resigned. Up until now I felt that there was more to learn and that I could still try to make things difficult for him just like with Ken once I lost my Queen for Rook. After this move however not only won't that work but there is nothing else to learn. So felt that there was no point in continuing because Bernnie will play 44.[ R b8 ] which is the reason behind this move. After Bernnie plays that he'll either promote or I'll be forced to give up my Rook for a pawn on top of what I've lost. After this game we analyzed this a little and he said that the opening was what did me in. By this though he was implying 21...Bd6?? which is actually the middle game. According to him I was flawless except for that but it was enough to lose. I don't agree about being flawless because of my faulty decision to exchange Queens after which I didn't have my LSB which could've been used to stop this promotion. What it boiled down to was me not considering enough moves of what would've happens becomes something which isn't instructive for this game but in life as well. As the saying goes "Don't count your chickens before they hash." And on top of that inaccuracy I think doing this is what also led to my fatal blunder.
 [ R g6 ] , [ K f7 ]  ? So I try to get his Rook in return. But this is another mistake as he will liquidate. Afterwhich I can resign soon after since I'll only be left the monarch. Much better was 57.[ R h7 ] or 57.[ R f7 ] where this exchange would not have been possible. And now if he promotes even with a Rook I'd still have mine and might be able to hold off against mate. Consequently that would further delay my resignation.
 [ Q a4 + ] , [ N c6 ]  Only one to save the bishop. Now white misses his lsb a lot.
 [ K f7 ]  [ B h5 + ]  [ K e7 ]  [ Q e3 + ] , [ K d6 ]  42. .. [ Q e6 ] would have been followed by 43.[ R e5 ] winning the queen. Other alternatives for black were: i)42. .. [ B e6 ] 43.[ d5 ] winning a piece for white ii)42. .. [ K d8 ] 43.[ R b5 ] threatening [ R b8 ] and mate 1-0
 [ K d3 ]  [ B b1 + ] , [ K c3 ]  ??
 [ N g5 ]  [ h6 ] , [ h4 ]  And... Boom. The 'boring' position is now not so boring.
 [ B x a6 ]  [ Q x d6 ] , [ e5 ]  This is the move I think my opponent overlooked which gains me a piece. Prior to this move I'm still down my Gambited pawn but have had the intiative all game.
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ] , [ e5 ]  Black to play.
 [ K b7 ]  [ B x d7 ] , [ R x d7 ]  Now White is two clear pawns ahead but the advantage is difficult to exploit because one of them is doubled and Black has a remote pawn that soon becomes a passed pawn. I think I should have prevented that from happening.
 [ Q x c3 ]  [ B x e4 ]  [ R f f1 ]  [ N x g3 ] , [ R f2 ]  to avoid the disaster!!!
 [ N g f3 ]  [ N a6 ]  [ N g4 ] , [ N b4 ]  Both Jabborg and Safeway were on their feet (Safeway stood on his chair) rapidly making their moves one spectator present at the game had said 'their hands were a blur!' another spectator had likened this part of the game to a table-tennis match - particularly safeway as he had to occasionally jump to achieve his moves.
 [ c4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ e4 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N x c6 ]  [ d x c6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ g3 ]  [ B b4 ]  [ B g2 ] , [ B x c3 ]  Black wants to keep White from ganging up on the weakling at [ e5 ] with [ N c3 ] [ B g2 ] and [ Q c2 ] so this exchange giving up the Bishop-pair is almost mandatory lest Black bolt right out of the starting gate into a defensive and mostly passive box.
 [ R e h8 ] , [ N c4 ]  My [ B e6 ] is a solid shield for now.
 [ Q d3 ]  [ R e4 ]  [ N d2 ] , [ R g4 ]  black is deftly moving pieces into attacking position. at this point black has 5 attacking pieces trained to the k-side of the board. white should be defeated soon....
 [ b5 ]  [ c x b5 ] , [ N x b5 ]  Nice outpost for the Knight - cant be attacked by pawns
 [ R x b3 ]  [ Q x b3 ]  [ Q c5 ] , [ e3 ]  pawn lost of lost i dismantle his pawn structure
 [ d6 ]  [ R e3 ] , [ B x f7 + ]  A "spite check."
 [ K f6 ] , [ Q h8 + ]  Has Black placed his king on [ h7 ] I could have played 37. [ N g5 ] and mated however I can remove more material and mate all the same.
 [ K e7 ]  [ R h7 + ] , [ K f8 ]  Following triangles because when white checks again the K will move to another file. So he is moving in a triangle by playing ...[ K e7 ] ...[ K f8 ] and ...[ K g7 ] Now Susan Polgar has said that in endgames where you have an advantage with a difficult win triangulation is the way to go. That's why even though I disregarded and eliminated the trigonometry after blocking a certain someone I resumed it again. That is because she said that the trigonometry involving the K it is how you win in complicated positions like this. And with this form of triangulation white will run out of checks as black will get tempo to add insult to injury. The reason being is that after 55...[ K g7 ] if white checks he'll lose his R. So by retreating black will do further damage.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ B c5 ] , [ N x c6 ]  and I capture one of his knights immediately like i wanted
 [ R x e3 ]  [ b6 ]  [ N b4 ]  [ K f8 ]  [ N d5 ] , [ c5 ]  Trying to regain position against White's slightly advanced pawns. White should try to drive off the Black knight.
 [ e4 ]  [ N b4 ]  [ B b5 + ] , [ K f8 ]  I lose the right to castle...but the game has by now progressed so far that this hardly matters. What White's move has achieved is that his pieces can now harrass my king and make me lose tempi while he gains a foothold in my position.
 [ g6 ] , [ N x g6 ]  5. [ N x g6 ] - but now comes another sacrifice. Chris can either lose a whole rook or the exchange as the rook on [ h8 ] is trapped in the corner. Chris accepts the sac and drops the exchange.
 [ B x e5 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ Q g3 ] , [ N g6 ]  after it clears - Black is a pawn up and there is a great center play for him. white is a bit out of the game...
 [ R a b1 ]  [ d x c3 + ]  [ b x c3 ] , [ Q x b1 ]  No! Why?
 [ B g2 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ e4 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ d3 ]  [ d5 ] , [ B g5 ]  This is probably the most sensible way to develop that bishop at this point and it's one of the moves that really established the character of the game...
 [ d x e5 ]  [ R f e8 ] , [ O-O-O ]  Well this was anyway my intention. Now what?
 [ f4 ] , [ B h6 ]  Black doesn't want to exchange blacksquared bishops so there is another plan of defense ..
 [ N h3 ]  [ g6 ] , [ N g5 + ]  !
 [ R x c6 ] , [ N a7 + ]  stronger than a direct Rxc6: never waste a good threat...
 [ Q b4 ] , [ Q d5 ]  So he tries again to exchange queens and I avoid again. Computer agrees with the basic plan but prefers 24. Qc5. It also prefers 24...Q[ x Q b4 ] 25. c[ x Q b4 ] [ R c8 + ] 26. [ K b1 ] [ f4 ] 27. [ N e2 ] [ R c2 ] 28. Rx[ R c2 ] B[ x R c2 + ] 29. K[ x B c2 ] R[ x N e2 + ] with the better ending for Black. I was looking at variations like that but missed 27.....Rc2!
 [ N x c6 + ] , [ b x c6 ]  So I cannot take the rook at [ e4 ] as white captures my knight putting my king in check. I captured the knight with my [ b7 ] pawn.
 [ R d1 ] , [ R b7 ]  Defending the knight and preparing to double rooks. Not 25...Ne5? 26. [ R x c5 ] Rxc5?? Re8#.
 [ N h2 + ] , [ K e2 ]  It's either move out from the deadly dance or let black declare draw after three repeated positions.
 [ N x f1 ]  [ K x f1 ] , [ a6 ]  Black kicks the Knight to try to get his Queen back into play.
 [ N d3 + ]  [ K c2 ]  [ N x e1 + ]  [ N x e1 ]  [ g5 ]  [ N e f3 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ N x g5 ]  [ R h g8 ]  [ N h f3 ]  [ R e2 ]  [ N f7 ]  [ R g x g2 ] , [ N x d6 + ]  needed to get rid of the bishop
 [ N d5 ] , [ O-O ]  What was I thinking castling kingside...
 [ Q c7 ] , [ R b1 ]  a waste
 [ d6 ] , [ Q b7 + ]  Can Black take the rook?
 [ f x e6 ]  [ R x e6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ d x c4 ]  [ Q d7 ]  [ R e7 ] , [ Q c8 + ]  Bad move (Monkey sees check Monkey gives check)
 [ K c5 ]  [ R x f4 ] , [ d5 ]  I have to cope with a simplification. I didn't see [ R a3 ] but [ b4 ] solves black's problems (If I'm right on the fly!).
 [ e x f6 + ]  [ N d x f6 ] , [ d5 ]  !?!?! This could backfire in a slow game but it should work in blitz! In a slow game I would probably play 21. 0-0-0
 [ e4 ]  [ B b4 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ Q c2 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ] , [ N g4 ]  huh? what does this achieve? the N will have to go away anyway after h3.
 [ c4 ] , [ B b4 + ]  Here is the first instance of black playing what I was hoping for. I block with bishop he takes I take with my [ N b1 ] and if he castles I have the opportunity for a big center.
 [ B x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ d6 ]  [ N g4 ] , [ B x f2 + ]  12. ... AL fin y al cabo el bug de [ [ b3 ] ] no tuvo consecuencias: lo curioso es que las negras reaccionaron como si las blancas hubiesen jugado [ [ b4 ] ] tomando el alfil negro en f2. Tal vez la explicación esté en un análisis más profundo por parte de las negras al probar suerte esperando que el rey blanco tomase el alfil lo que parece razonable ya que el caballo en [ g4 ] estaba muy bien posicionado. En este caso auuu fue prudente e inició un rápido "Analize Board" descubriendo así que con el rey en [ [ f2 ] ] las negras podrían jugar C x [ [ [ [ e4 ] ] ] + ] a lo que blancas deberian jugar [ [ d3 ] ] x [ [ [ e4 ] ] ] es decir negras cambian el caballo clavado desde el principio por un peón... pero la dama negra tomaría el alfil en g5. De esta forma las negras acabarían con la iniciativa de las blancas y adquirirían incluso ventaja material de un peón. -0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0- 12 ... After the bug [ [ b3 ] ] did not succeed: the funny thing is that the black reacted as if White had played [ [ b4 ] ] taking the black bishop on f2. Perhaps the explanation is in a deeper analysis of the black to try his hand waiting for the white king take the bishop which seems reasonable since the horse was well positioned g4. In this case auuu was prudent and began a quick "Analyze Board" discovering that with the king at [ [ f2 ] ] Black could play C x [ [ [ e4 ] ] ] + what white should play [ [ d3 ] ] x [ [ [ e4 ] ] ] ie Black exchanges the horse nailed from the principle for a pawn ... but the black lady would take the bishop on g5. This would end the black white initiative and even acquire material advantage of a pawn.
 [ N f5 ]  [ e x f5 ]  [ e x f5 ] , [ N d6 # ]  
 [ f x e6 ] , [ Q x e6 + ]  black can trade down now with [ Q f7 ] but it will leave black down a pawn and with an isolated pawn. [ K h8 ] is out because of the game ending [ Q g6 ] and there is no way to defend mate on [ g7 ] and h7.
 [ R h3 ]  [ f4 ]  [ R h x b3 ]  [ f5 ]  [ R b3 b4 ]  [ R f g6 + ]  [ K h7 ]  [ R g h6 + ]  [ K g7 ]  [ f6 + ]  [ K g8 ] , [ K g6 ]  The computer analysis roundly boos me for this move since it delays an 11-move forced mate from this position. OK OK I did not see it. So sue me.
 [ d x e5 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ Q f4 ]  [ B x d3 ]  [ O-O-O ]  [ B g7 ]  [ R x d3 ]  [ Q e7 ] , [ Q c4 ]  In order to keep the Black Queen from coming into the game.
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ e5 ]  a bad move. what is the idea behind giving awaya pawn like that?
 [ N d b5 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ a3 ] , [ B x c3 + ]  When "the question" is put to the Bishop no retreat here!
 [ d4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ d6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ B e7 ] , [ B e2 ]  untill now this follows GAMEKNOT database.
 [ K f2 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ R f h1 ] , [ R f g8 ]  Moving into position...
 [ B x d7 + ] , [ Q x d7 ]  Artificial-looking but I do believe it is the better recapture. The knight will be developed more actively at c6. So far this position has been reached in M. Carlsen vs Hi Nakamura on at least 3 occasions I know of. You can't get a better endorsement than that!
 [ b x c3 ] , [ c x d4 ]  A critical point in the opening. Black has allowed white to obtain a large central space advantage and with 3 minor pieces on the board he should be looking to trade off pieces to lessen a future attack of white's. This is exactly what this move and [ B b4 ] accomplish.
 [ R e3 ]  [ N g6 ] , [ N e2 ]  Preventing Nf4.
 [ B b7 ] , [ Q e2 ]  He retreats
 [ g5 ]  [ N d2 ] , [ N d f6 ]  Abandoning any claim to [ c5 ] and leaving the [ N e8 ] to hold the fort on [ d6 ] and c7. It is heading for [ h5 ] and possibly [ g3 ] or [ f4 ] to cause complications also freeing my [ B c8 ] which was in danger of being shut in for good.
 [ h x g5 ] , [ K e3 ]  Keeping the king as near as possible from the center
 [ O-O-O ] , [ b5 ]  going to attack on the queen side.
 [ N e6 ] , [ Q g3 ]  Queen redeploys and Black now has a combination (15... [ N x e4 ] 16Nxe4...BxR) that looks very tempting. Little do I realise the body bag will never be recovered...
 [ K c7 ]  [ R b c1 ]  [ R a d8 ] , [ K h1 ]  24. [ K h1 ] - it is extremely difficult to formulate a plan here I end up playing waiting moves which is fatal when down by 3 material points.
 [ N f2 ] , [ e6 ]  11. ... [ e5 ] 12. [ d5 ] and Black falls further back into arrears
 [ B g6 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ B e7 ] , [ B x e7 ]  Forcing a decision. 13... QxB would maintain the possibility of castling but the pin on Black's Knight would remain in place.
 [ B e3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ B e6 ]  Black finally gets a Bishop out though his kingside is still very restricted--his position is somewhat artificially cramped just because of the Queen sitting in the way of everything on e7. With [ Q d8 ] and [ B e7 ] instead with [ N f6 ] to come next move Black's position would look worlds better.
 [ N f6 ]  [ f3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ B g7 ]  We see a strange variation similar to a King's Indian. However he declines [ c4 ] the most popular continuation. I should have exploited this with an immediate ..d5. I did not and he should have went with an immediate e4. He does not however and the game soon shifts in black's favor.
 [ N f3 ] , [ Q e7 ]  My pawn on [ e4 ] is attacked...
 [ B e2 ]  [ B x d2 + ]  [ N x d2 ] , [ Q b4 ]  White will both of his queenside pawns and then black will have connected passed pawns and they will win the game. At this point I was pretty sure the win was "in my pocket" and I started to play moves very quickly without even thinking almost.
 [ B e3 ]  [ N f d7 ]  [ Q b3 ]  [ N b6 ]  [ a4 ]  [ a5 ]  [ d5 ]  [ B x f3 ]  [ g x f3 ] , [ Q d6 ]  good move the black queen on [ d6 ] is in very good position which it attendedto move to [ b4 ] and pressure on the white's queen side.
 [ O-O ] , [ f5 ]  I castle and black pushes his f pawn to f5. I think the attack is on. Black has the DB at [ e7 ] and the queen at [ d8 ] so they are both pointing to h4.
 [ Q d4 ] , [ B c3 ]  Still hoping that I go wrong Carl attacks again. But I have a ready answer for that.
 [ O-O ] , [ b4 ]  Thinking about a queenside pawn attack.
 [ B x b6 ]  [ a x b6 ] , [ B x g8 ]  ?? What on earth is White doing? He has left his king totally exposed! In truth I feared 9. ... O-O for this reason. I need his rook to have trouble developing.
 [ g6 ]  [ Q f3 ]  [ Q e5 ] , [ R a e1 ]  [ c3 ] is voluntarily let to take [ f6 ] as 0-0-0 is no more possible.
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ B e7 ] , [ N e5 ]  Very well played up to now. You have to continue your development. I would suggest 8.[ d4 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ R e8 ] , [ g3 ]  This is a weak move because you open the Kings defence whitout cause. You had to consider the manouevre [ N f2 ] follewed by [ N d3 ] (what you could have done on move 12 already)
 [ a4 ] , [ f6 ]  of course [ [ b6 ] ] was forced; but Black needed [ N g8 ] to be elsewhere at the time real bad and [ N e7 ] was not appealing... now however White gets to play [ [ b6 ] ] and Black will soon crumble...
 [ g3 ] , [ N h6 ]  I continue my development while black builds a king side attack
 [ g3 ]  [ Q g5 ]  [ h x g4 ] , [ R x g4 ]  White is a pawn minus and a very aggressive attack to contend with.
 [ R b3 ]  [ Q c7 ] , [ R b6 ]  29. [ R b6 ] - a pile up on the b column now!
 [ B g7 ]  [ N c1 ]  [ N b d7 ]  [ g3 ]  [ O-O ] , [ K f2 ]  ...big ??? Possible longer term threat of h4-5 but blacks position is solid and now a simple plan...get in [ f5 ] and the king is in trouble...
 [ d x e4 ]  [ N c x e4 ] , [ N d5 ]  plan has been changed for the black. now [ d5 ] is a better place for knight. on general just the front square of an alone pawn is a safe place for opponents knights and bishops
 [ g x h5 ]  [ R x h5 ]  [ N e7 ] , [ N f3 ]  geniusacamel suggested that 15.[ N e2 ] was an interesting alternative
 [ N c6 ] , [ a3 ]  Too many pawn moves for white. Although his position looks solid he is behind devolopement wise and will have a very cramped game.
 [ N f6 ] , [ B c4 ]  4.-[ B b5 ] was better entering into a delayed "Knights atack" variation of the Spanish.
 [ R d f2 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ B d4 ]  [ R d f8 ] , [ a x b5 ]  34. [ b3 ] [ K d8 ] threatening Ke7...
 [ Q x g7 ]  [ R f8 ]  [ Q x h7 ]  [ N c e5 ] , [ d4 ]  I can possibly take the risk with 13...Qxc2!?.
 [ a5 ] , [ Q e1 ]  Disaster! Black can now trade a bishop for white's trapped f rook. White moved the queen here eying black's a pawn but it was a blunder.
 [ Q b1 ] , [ B g4 ]  he`s getting aggressive here so i decide to attack his knight at [ b4 ] with my pawn.
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ g6 ]  Not one of the main lines. The most played moves are 2.. P[ c6 ] 2.. [ d6 ] and 2.. e6. If white plays 3. [ d4 ] now it will become an accelerated dragon.
 [ f x g3 ]  [ e ] , [ p ]  here i realized that it would be a draw kicking myself because i should of won if not for the mistake on move 32
 [ O-O ]  [ B e7 ] , [ N e1 ]  I found that in the DB. It exploit the [ d1 ] [ h5 ] diagonal frees the DSB and enable sa further [ N d3 ] or [ N c2 ]  [ O-O ] , [ B d3 ]  Carrying on with the line
 [ a5 ]  [ Q x d5 ]  [ R x d5 ]  [ R f d1 ] , [ R a d8 ]  I wanted to be the one in control of the d-file when the exchanges had finished.
 [ B e2 ] , [ N c6 ]  developing the other knight.
 [ K a4 ] , [ a3 ]  The pawn moves up and now the king is in checkmate in one move no matter what.
 [ Q x f3 + ] , [ K x f3 ]  now i'm -6 i can't imagine how to win whith a good player
 [ N x e5 ] , [ f4 ]  (???) He just gave me a free piece with no compensation! These knights on his king side will destroy him!
 [ B c2 ]  [ g6 ]  [ B e4 ] , [ N f6 ]  Allowing White to capture would leave a very weak pawn on d5. Already I am not happy about my target on b5.
 [ d4 ]  [ B x a3 ]  [ B x a3 ]  [ Q x a3 ] , [ Q b2 ]  I foresaw this defence and it seems to be enough for white to be safe. Still I have the initiative until now. If rook [ c1 ] [ K d7 ] stops it from giving check and he cannot double them easily.
 [ B d3 ] , [ a6 ]  And this also seems unnecessary and doesn't develop!
 [ Q a5 ]  [ K b2 ]  [ b5 ]  [ B b3 ]  [ Q b6 ]  [ e4 ]  [ a5 ]  [ B d5 ]  [ c6 ] , [ B x f7 + ]  high time something happened...
 [ N x e4 ] , [ B f5 ]  Hmmm is he gonna exchange off pieces this early? i sometimes get uncomfortable with trading off this early i wonder if the opponent just likes to take rather than think..generally speaking.
 [ N e5 + ]  [ K b7 ] , [ g4 ]  this means: black you have to lose e6...
 [ N f6 ] , [ c4 ]  White stakes out control of the [ d5 ] square.
 [ e x d5 ] , [ N c3 ]  The only move White threatens to recover the pawn and exchance of one of the Black bishops which are a substantial advantage in an open position.
 [ B x h6 ] , [ g x h6 ]  Accepting the sacrifice. I didn't feel white had enough material on scene to press his attack to conclusion.
 [ Q b4 ] , [ N d7 ]  20 ...... [ N d7 ] - heading for [ b6 ] but doesn't get there because I considered [ N c5 ] to be a better option. That move precipitates a pseudo sac.
 [ N f4 ] , [ K f7 ]  Open the line for the bishop.
 [ R c1 ]  [ K b8 ] , [ Q e7 ]  Threatening [ Q x c7 + ] and [ f7 ]  [ Q f6 ]  [ Q e8 ]  [ Q f4 ] , [ f5 ]  I completely missed the threat on [ f7 ] again whoops.
 [ N c7 + ] , [ K e7 ]  forced.
 [ N c3 ] , [ B b4 ]  This pins the knight down...
 [ R h7 ] , [ Q f4 ]  Retreat? Never! With his Q gone from the defenses I plan a vicious counterattack.
 [ R c5 ]  [ R e2 + ]  [ K d5 ] , [ d3 ]  At this point I felt that I had lost unless my opponent blundered.
 [ B x a1 ] , [ Q x a1 ]  QxB occupying the long diagonal & threatening Black's g-pawn (though any such attack would allow either Q or R to check the White King on the back row).
 [ B c1 ] , [ N d7 b6 ]  .
 [ O-O ]  [ O-O ] , [ B f4 ]  attacking the d pawn and developping the DSB which is often a problem for white in the Benoni.
 [ h3 ] , [ B f5 ]  Perhaps 16...[ B e6 ] or 16...[ B d7 ] was better; Black is not looking for a center pawn break here. Besides trying to contain White's kingside mass he should be looking for queenside counterplay especially taking advantage of that misplaced [ N b3 ] so 16...[ a5 ] is a good possibility as well.
 [ B d4 ]  [ R f1 ]  [ K d7 ]  [ R f7 + ]  [ K c6 ]  [ B d5 + ]  [ K b6 ]  [ a4 ]  [ c6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ B h5 ]  [ R x g7 ]  [ B g6 ]  [ b4 ] , [ a5 ]  My opponent is wise to my move...
 [ N f6 ]  [ c3 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ d4 ]  [ g4 ]  [ h x g4 ] , [ N x g4 ]  scheming for a better square...
 [ K g2 ] , [ R x f3 ]  30...[ R a f8 ] is better keeping the pin. then swapping all major pieces the extra pawn on each wins makes the win most likely.
 [ Q e2 ] , [ B x e4 ]  Preparing the following mate.
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ B c5 ] , [ b4 ]  The Evans' Gambit. My idea is to drive the bishop to the unimportant [ b4 ] square and play [ c3 ] with tempo attacking it.
 [ Q c2 ]  [ f5 ]  [ O-O ] , [ O-O ]  With both players castled the middle-game phase begins. Znosko-Borovsky in his classic work "The Middle Game In Chess" declares that these kind of positions where the opening is transitioning into the middle-game proper are the most difficult to handle correctly even for grandmasters let alone run-of-the-mill players.
 [ Q b6 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ R x d5 ] , [ N c4 ]  hmmm. 'loose pieces drop off'... while this does make the queen move the queen isn't doing so much there and the knight was maybe better on e5? maybe better to get your rooks activated
 [ N g6 ]  [ N b3 ]  [ B e7 ] , [ N c5 ]  I move [ N c5 ] to lure [ e7 ] bishop.
 [ Q a8 + ]  [ R e8 ]  [ Q a4 ]  [ Q x a4 ]  [ R x a4 ]  [ R d x e5 ]  [ R x e5 ]  [ R x e5 ]  [ R a8 + ] , [ K g7 ]  37. ........... [ K g7 ] - over the last few moves a plethora of exchanges have left me in a R P ending a pawn up. Henry sidestepps a rook check and I drop my rook back next move to defend my b pawn. Can I convert this advantage? Read on ....
 [ N b3 ]  [ d4 ] , [ f4 ]  profiting from the lack of support on a possible [ e4 ] push that loses the d pawn I immediately return the sharpness... I expect to see the standard [ B b4 + ] reply
 [ a4 ] , [ N d2 ]  ...only to move it back. I would probably taken on [ e5 ]  [ K f7 ] , [ K f2 ]  We both centralize our kings
 [ K x f2 ] , [ Q c5 + ]  White: [ K x [ [ f2 ] ] ] Black: [ Q [ c5 ] + ] I took my opponents Knight on [ [ f2 ] ] with my King and he responded by checking my King with his Queen on [ c5 ] and attacking my Knight on c4. This was a very bad move on my part. Going back to move 10 had I taken the Bishop on [ d6 ] with my Knight I would have forked his King and Bishop. This would have allowed me to gain the Knight on [ [ f2 ] ] without losing any material. I noticed this immediately after I made the move but unfortunately it was a blitz game and I was trying to play intuitively. Looking back this may have been my worst move.
 [ b4 ]  [ a x b4 ]  [ R x b4 ]  [ R a3 ] , [ R b6 ]  Now both third rank pawns are defended. I felt I'd missed something...
 [ Q h7 ] , [ R f7 ]  Now white seems to have lost momentum and I can try to get the king to safety.
 [ B f4 ] , [ N c6 ]  relentless: the last developing piece is coming into play...
 [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ B b5 ]  Ruy Lopez my favourite as white don’t really like having it played against me...
 [ Q e2 ]  [ N x e3 ]  [ Q x e3 ]  [ B f8 ] , [ e5 ]  ! Lending support to his mate on [ f6 ] but it appears that Black can close the center with his next move 23...d5!
 [ O-O ] , [ B d6 ]  Trying to drive off my well placed knight.
 [ B e5 + ]  [ K f3 ] , [ R e4 ]  [ g x f5 ] [ e x f5 ] [ R h1 ] [ h5 ] and all is over... so White resigns...
 [ e x d3 ]  [ c x d3 ]  [ Q x d3 + ]  [ B e2 ]  [ Q f5 + ] , [ K g1 ]  Here although material is even I thought Black should have an edge since the N is trapped.
 [ N b6 ]  [ R f8 + ] , [ K e1 ]  trying to hold the knight.
 [ N f4 ] , [ N c5 ]  ! It defends [ g4 ] and attacks e4.
 [ h5 ] , [ B x f6 ]  ...and it works. Just as I overlooked a piece capture earlier Black overlooks this equalizer.
 [ e4 ]  [ c6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e5 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ g4 ]  [ B g6 ]  [ N g e2 ] , [ B b4 ]  With the idea of developing the bishop before playing ...Ne7. However without any specific objective the bishop might as well stay on f8.
 [ R c8 ]  [ R f c1 ]  [ R x c1 + ]  [ R x c1 ]  [ Q b6 + ]  [ Q e3 ] , [ Q x e3 + ]  Queen exchange may not be the best idea given the position of black's minor pieces.
 [ Q x g3 + ]  [ f x g3 ]  [ B x f1 ]  [ K x f1 ]  [ K g6 ]  [ K e2 ]  [ K f6 ]  [ K d3 ]  [ K e5 ]  [ K c3 ]  [ K d6 ]  [ K b4 ]  [ K c6 ] , [ c5 ]  41. [ h4 ] [ g5 ] 42. [ K c3 ] [ K c5 ] Not much one can do in this position.
 [ K x f7 ]  [ Q x d6 ]  [ Q h5 ] , [ e5 ]  i must keep him away from my king!!
 [ B b3 ] , [ B b7 ]  Interesting! As explained I was expecting 6...[ N a5 ] but Black sticks to opening principles avoiding moving a piece twice instead developing her QB on the long diagonal threatening not only to attack my B but also the e-pawn at the same time. Looking this up in my old book on the Spanish by Alexei Suetin I find that this is the Archangel Variation or a modern version of the Møller system. I don't remember ever meeting this before.
 [ g6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B x a6 ] , [ g3 ]  This is an interesting system that I had studied but not actually played against in a real game
 [ d3 ] , [ N c6 ]  two knights to defend
 [ e5 ]  [ f4 ] , [ e x f4 ]  I accepted the kings gambit.
 [ c5 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ h6 ]  [ e3 ] , [ g5 ]  white contines with normal opening as black releases strange pawn formation - bishop retreats here
 [ B d3 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ N b d2 ] , [ c5 ]  Start the fight for the center.
 [ Q f4 ]  [ Q g5 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ N d8 ]  [ Q d6 + ]  [ Q e7 ]  [ Q h6 + ]  [ K g8 ]  [ R d c1 ]  [ N d3 ]  [ R c3 ]  [ N x b2 ]  [ e4 ] , [ f4 ]  I wanted to take his pawn but if I had his next move is rook to g3. He could've forced me to protect me king with my queen and pushed me into a rook-for-queen loss
 [ B x e4 ] , [ d x e4 ]  Very important. If [ N x e4 ] NxN dxN [ Q g4 ] returns the attack to white!
 [ Q e2 ]  [ Q x h1 ] , [ Q f2 ]  Huh. Better was [ Q x e5 + ] I think.
 [ K f1 ]  [ Q h3 + ]  [ K e1 ] , [ R g1 + ]  And this move is really crushing since I am losing my queen now.
 [ a x b5 ]  [ B x b5 ]  [ N x b5 ]  [ N d7 ] , [ Q c2 ]  Not sure why I did this
 [ N c6 ] , [ f3 ]  hmm after this move i directly looked at [ g3 ] square. I hoped to utilize it somehow after i displace the knight somehow.
 [ K f5 ]  [ K h8 ]  [ R a7 ] , [ R g7 ]  Once the Rooks come off the board White will be forced to concede that my defenses have held.
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ N c3 ]  At this point this game would typically go in one of four directions: C46: Three knights game C47: Four knights Scotch variation C48: Four knights Spanish variation C49: Four knights double Ruy Lopez
 [ Q h4 ] , [ h x g5 ]  The queen cannot take the rook on [ h8 ] because of the queen protection from d4.
 [ R x d7 ]  [ Q x f8 + ] , [ R d8 ]  ? Another mistake. Better was 12...[ Q d8 ] 'only' losing two more pawns: 13.[ Q x c5 + ] [ Q c7 ] 14.Qxa7. Now Black will lose a piece and a pawn instead.
 [ Q e3 ]  [ B x e1 ]  [ R x e1 ] , [ N f6 ]  bringing my knight into an attack.
 [ c6 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B d2 ]  [ h6 ]  [ R e1 ] , [ O-O ]  Black should be able to complete development comfortably here--and be up a pawn.
 [ f7 ]  [ R c8 ] , [ R g8 ]  the rest is without commentary. I just convert it
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ] , [ c4 ]  I thought this was a bit unusual [ [ d4 ] ] is I think better so it's 3. [ [ d4 ] ] cx[ [ d4 ] ] 4. [ N x d4 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ d3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ B g5 ]  [ a6 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ B g4 ] , [ B h6 ]  Not sure this was good if I'd taken your bishop I think that would have been good but there was no reason for me to do that as it would let your queen in. So I just ignored it.
 [ R x c3 ] , [ Q d1 ]  18. [ Q d1 ] The rest of the game is a "simplification". White has 4 pieces working while Black has six. With offering trades and gaining better position while enhancing a "winning position". Many a player may start pawn grabbing but not necessary and actually dangerous against a player like Mervyn! He should me a game of his where he was done material adding to 16 points and miraculously checkmated this weary opponent!
 [ a2 ]  [ g6 ] , [ N c2 ]  ready for promotion
 [ e5 ] , [ N f3 ]  I am already impressed with Sue. Not only has she improved but she also remembered this line without needing to memorize anything which is a plus. All I said was that after 1...[ e5 ] 2.[ N f3 ] was the most common response as it can lead to things like the Ruy Lopez or two Knights Defense. In part because 2.[ N f3 ] starts developing very early and as we know one of the important things; even when exceptions to guidelines do occur is that you want to develop your pieces control the center and get the K to safety. This is such an important moral because even GM's have lost by failing to do that.
 [ N e2 ]  [ R x c1 + ]  [ N x c1 ] , [ B x d2 ]  Won the knight here and attacking the other knight.
 [ Q d5 + ]  [ N c5 ]  [ Q x c5 + ]  [ B b5 ] , [ N c6 + ]  And I resigned here because Terence will mate on his next move. My only two options are 23...[ K a6 ] after which he has 24.[ Q x a7 # ] Or 23...[ K a4 ] and then comes 24.[ b3 # ]  [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ N c3 ]  Normally I'd play the Ruy Lopez but I following reversion's advise of trying things different. Afterall this is why he wanted the tourney. The idea being is that 1.[ [ e4 ] ] [ e5 ] and 1.[ [ e4 ] ] [ c5 ] are my main openings. So the idea is learning through different moves. Therefore although rare I answer with the 2 Knights Opening.
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ d4 ]  My rival chose the Scotch opening where the center of pawn is defined soon.
 [ B c5 ]  [ e3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N g e2 ]  [ d6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B b6 ] , [ d4 ]  This is the main aim of the english opening. Allowing black to build a centre knowing that it can be dealt with.
 [ d4 ] , [ N f6 ]  White's 2. [ d4 ] is not as popular a choice as 2. [ e4 ] but serviceable. It occupies the center and prevents 2. ... [ e5 ] and also prevents black from chasing away white's knight by playing his pawn to d4. In return I develop a knight to add pressure to e4.
 [ Q e4 ] , [ Q d6 ]  should have moved the queen yo [ e8 ] or e7... then on the next turn I could have gone [ b x h2 ] and captured white's queen
 [ Q x e8 ] , [ B d4 ]  a useless move...
 [ B e3 ] , [ O-O ]  Strikes a hard pace with respect to development without letting up on the pressure! With the Scandinavian I always go for tension and complication. 8... [ c x d4 ] merely allows white to precipitate a blood bath (9. [ B x d4 ] [ B x d4 ] 10. [ Q x d4 ] [ Q x d4 ] 11. Nxd4) that simplifies things to his advantage.
 [ N x a4 ] , [ Q a7 ]  the idea is to keep an eye on [ d4 ] and the white queen also prepares to push the b pawn if needed
 [ N c5 ]  [ R b6 ]  [ N x b7 ]  [ R x b7 ] , [ R e7 ]  Black wants to play ...[ R c8 ] next but it's too slow.
 [ R c d4 ]  [ R x c2 ] , [ R d4 d7 + ]  there goes another pawn
 [ B x e2 ]  [ N x e2 ]  [ R a d8 ] , [ N d4 ]  16. [ N d4 ] - would [ Q c1 ] have been a better alternative to moving the knight back? A plethora of exchanges now leads to me being a pawn minus.
 [ K b6 ] , [ d3 ]  19. [ d3 ] - opening up the [ c1 ] - [ h6 ] diagonal for Fou Lenoir.
 [ d x e5 ]  [ f x e5 ]  [ Q b6 ]  [ R f2 ] , [ R a d8 ]  Planning to sac the exchange in order to activate the bishops
 [ c4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ B e7 ]  Slow development didn't want to trade my dark squared bishop after some [ B b4 + ] lines
 [ Q e2 ] , [ N f7 ]  To get rid of the dsb
 [ K x f4 ]  [ B d2 + ]  [ K e4 ] , [ B c1 ]  But now it's all over and I resign but I'm not unhappy at all with this game. I think I made a very good fight out of it and even came close to a draw. In the end the exchange sac which complicated the position made the difference. Congratulations for a wonderful game by my opponent who was the deserved winner. Please leave some comments. Thank you for reading hope you enjoyed it.
 [ Q e1 ] , [ N g4 ]  now it s clear! [ e3 ] is the target. but not very dangerous
 [ B g5 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ Q b6 ] , [ O-O-O ]  Here comes the trouble for black...
 [ R x a5 ] , [ R c1 ]  Much better than [ Q b2 ] IMHO. [ Q b2 ] is met with Qa4.
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ] , [ g6 ]  Black wastes no time with prophylactic moves like ...[ a6 ] launching straight into a Dragon formation.
 [ g5 ]  [ N h5 ]  [ f x e4 ] , [ R e8 ]  I still liked preventing the QS mobilization now with [ B b6 ] as I have already played once but there are probably several good continuations to choose from. White's only viable strategy is KS expansion and he must consider his moves carefully.
 [ c5 ] , [ N c3 ]  At this point I was planning on using the Grand Prix attack ( 2...[ d6 ] 3. [ f4 ] [ N c6 ] 4. [ N f3 ] .) As you will see black has other plans.
 [ R b a1 ] , [ Q b6 ]  I move my b rook to [ a1 ] blocking 'A' pawns. Black brings queen to [ b6 ] and takes control of b file. Now the queen has moved so I can start my attack while keeping things on queenside held back.
 [ B g4 ]  [ R a e1 ] , [ R e7 ]  This move makes [ N [ h4 ] ] possible later. Before black played [ R e7 ] white could not play V[ h4 ] since [ N x e4 ] would win a pawn to due the fact that the black queen can capture on h4.
 [ B g4 ] , [ B e2 ]  This pin risks whie losing his [ e5 ] pawn if he had originally played [ d4 ] this would not be an issue
 [ N g2 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ R f e1 ]  Pretty much the only logical move.
 [ Q x e7 ] , [ N x d4 ]  If [ c x d5 ] dxN and [ d6 ] is not enough to compensate (bxce Bxce+ forking the rook...). [ e x d5 ] was dangerous with the black queen still there and [ e5 ] coming soon...
 [ Q e3 + ]  [ K h1 ] , [ f6 ]  defends the rook with another piece.
 [ N c3 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ B f5 ] , [ N c3 ]  Here White has played a small inaccuracy. The proper move is 5. [ N g3 ] which attacks the Bishop and ensures that Black can't powerfully establish his Bishop on [ f5 ] with e6.
 [ B e7 ] , [ N d4 ]  Now I switched my attack to the queenside again.
 [ B x d4 ]  [ N f5 ]  [ B c3 ]  [ R x e1 ]  [ R x e1 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ B f3 ]  [ R x e1 + ] , [ Q x e1 ]  Lasker comes out of the opening and middle game with a decided advantage. The bishop pair and key space control give black a hard position.
 [ f3 ] , [ R x d3 ]  Good choice. The center pawns are more valuable than the side ones--a lesson I learned from your father.
 [ N d5 ]  [ B c4 ] , [ b6 ]  ?? Black can't afford this now. Better was ...Nc7.
 [ h6 ] , [ h4 ]  ...and now I've made Black's KNP backward as 28...[ g5 ] would allow me to take two for the price of one. And my own king would be able to attack the other kingside pawn.
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ e6 ]  [ a3 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ e4 ]  [ O-O ]  [ e5 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ h4 ] , [ B h6 ]  After the opening both sides look ok. However perhaps white has more space.
 [ R g f1 ] , [ R d2 + ]  White moves his g rook over to [ f1 ] and brings the rooks together on the f file. I move my rook to [ d2 ] and check the king protected by the DB at b4.
 [ R c2 ]  [ R a d8 ]  [ R c5 ]  [ R d7 x d3 ]  [ R x b5 ]  [ R d3 x d2 ]  [ a4 ]  [ R b2 ]  [ R x b7 ]  [ R d d2 ]  [ R g3 ]  [ R b1 + ]  [ K h2 ]  [ R d d1 ]  [ R f3 ]  [ h5 ]  [ h4 ]  [ a5 ]  [ K g3 ]  [ R b2 ]  [ f5 ]  [ R d d2 ]  [ f x g6 ]  [ R d x g2 + ]  [ K f4 ]  [ R g4 + ]  [ K e5 ]  [ R e2 + ]  [ K d5 ]  [ f x g6 ]  [ R c3 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ R c4 ]  [ g5 ]  [ h x g5 ]  [ R x g5 + ]  [ K c6 ]  [ R g4 ]  [ K b6 ]  [ R x c4 ]  [ b x c4 ]  [ h4 ]  [ K x a5 ]  [ h3 ]  [ R b1 ] , [ R a8 + ]  
 [ N x d5 ] , [ e6 + ]  in way to win the [ d5 ] knight if the king take back. If nont i will have a very dangerous passed paw
 [ d4 ] , [ g5 ]  This supports the f pawn making it harder for white to open the f file. Also a future [ g4 ] push could dislodge the knight.
 [ N e5 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ f4 ] , [ Q c5 + ]  Black took some time over 14...[ N e5 ] as he also considered d5. He said he knew [ f4 ] pawn move was coming after the [ K e5 ] so the next choice was where to put the Queen for a check. Check to drive King away from defence of Rf1. He said he chose the bolder [ Q c5 ] rather than [ Q b6 ] just to improve Black's presence in the center.
 [ Q a5 + ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ Q x a5 ]  [ N x a5 ] , [ c3 ]  to prevent any [ N b4 ] fork tricks
 [ O-O ] , [ B d6 ]  A bit questionable coz it blocks the d pawn and the bishop is restricted by the e pawn...
 [ K c1 ]  [ Q e3 + ]  [ K c2 ]  [ B e2 ] , [ B c4 ]  Bad move for White; rather than exchanging bishops with no score change or perhaps moving the bishop away out of danger instead I get a free bishop without having to sacrifice my own.
 [ a5 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ R d8 ] , [ K e2 ]  controlling my weak d pawn
 [ h6 ] , [ N e6 ]  11. [ N e6 ] - trying to create a cramp.
 [ N f3 ] , [ f5 ]  Black goes for a "reversed stonewall". I'm just inventing the term. The issue here is that the [ f7 ] pawn was moved and the white diagonal going from [ h5 ] to [ e8 ] can be attacked.
 [ R x a6 ]  [ K d3 ] , [ R a5 ]  (?) Black is about to capture on [ b2 ] so [ b5 ] will be defended anyway. Instead 38. [ R h6 ] [ R e2 + ] 39. [ K f1 ] (not g3) Rx[ b2 ] 40. [ R x h5 ] [ R x a2 ] 41. [ R h3 + ] leaves White two pawns up and with his rook in an active position. Even better the g-pawn can be advanced thanks to its double move without interfering with the rook's defence of c3! The game might continue 41... [ K c2 ] 42. [ g4 ] [ R a3 ] 43. [ g5 ] and now after [ R x c3 ] White exchanges rooks and wins the pawn race. It's even possible that 38. [ R a5 ] turns a winning position into a draw in which case it deserves two question marks but the ensuing endgame is too complicated for me to be certain about whether or not this is the case.
 [ e6 ]  [ R x a2 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ O-O ] , [ N b d7 ]  I was hoping he'd do this as he's weakened his e pawn.
 [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ a6 ]  This move initiates the Sicilian Najdorf Variation a variation on the Sicilian with seemingly endless possibilities. Black's idea behind this innocuous-looking pawn move is to start off a queenside expansion to gain space.
 [ a6 ]  [ Q d3 ]  [ B f8 ]  [ R a c1 ]  [ Q e8 ]  [ Q d2 ] , [ N d8 ]  25. ......... [ N d8 ] - I can do little more than shuffle my pieces around on the back rank. White's pieces are poised for a break through.
 [ Q x g2 ]  [ R x g2 ] , [ K a2 ]  My opponent gave up here. Although he could've played [ N h4 ] he was down a lot of material.
 [ a x b5 ] , [ Q x b5 ]  no other option left; (also) after [ R x b5 ] [ c4 ] and after [ [ e4 ] ] [ N d2 ] leaves [ N a5 ] lost... after [ N b7 ] [ b x a6 ] [ N c5 ] [ b4 ] [ [ e4 ] ] [ b x c5 ] [ e x f3 ] [ Q x f3 ] [ B x c3 ] [ R a3 ] B[ b4 ] c6! Black can start worrying...
 [ f3 ] , [ B x b1 ]  Ando goes for a cooling change
 [ R g5 ]  [ K c4 ]  [ R x f5 ]  [ K x c3 ]  [ R x e5 ]  [ b4 ]  [ R e3 + ]  [ K c2 ]  [ R e2 + ]  [ K c3 ]  [ R e3 + ]  [ K c2 ]  [ R e2 + ]  [ K c3 ] , [ R e3 + ]  Repetative Check = Draw.
 [ K g2 ] , [ N f4 # ]  sha-plow! Knight comes out of nowhere! This may be my favourite mate in a long time. Aw man this was awesome.
 [ Q h5 ] , [ Q x e6 + ]  The passive [ Q g3 ] fails. I have to take my chances.
 [ g4 ] , [ c5 ]  Good black seeks for counterplay on the queenside.
 [ B d7 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N c6 ]  [ a3 ]  [ Q g7 ] , [ b4 ]  ! look at all that energy staring at my team! There's nothing going on for me and my opponent is moving in fast.
 [ e4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ B b4 ]  This was a mini-tournament where this was the starting position for all the games.
 [ B d1 ] , [ Q c4 ]  This threatens to trap my rook with ...[ Q a2 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ h3 ]  This was partly to give my King air and partly to threaten a skewer.
 [ B e7 ] , [ B h4 ]  ?! The bishop has to go to open up the position. I still don't know whether the sac is sound or not. Of course black has the option not to take which might actually be better but I thought the temptation of a hanging bishop would be too much for my opponent.
 [ K x g2 ] , [ N f4 + ]  He could play [ K h1 ] but
 [ h6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B b4 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ d6 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ c3 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ N e3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ d3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ N e7 ]  [ b4 ]  [ B x e3 ] , [ f x e3 ]  Time after time I've seen my opponent get a free f file whilst I'm trapped so this time I accepted the pawn double to try and control the f file.
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ g6 ]  A sort of KID set up? So i assume that my opponent is going to castle on king side. I commence my attack without delay.
 [ f4 ]  [ B h2 ]  [ g4 ]  [ h x g4 ]  [ N g5 ] , [ O-O-O ]  not paying attention...
 [ B x a4 ]  [ B x f1 ]  [ N x f1 ] , [ a6 ]  A waiting move. I don't want to give you anything to respond to and see if you have anything planned. It also once again does restrict a [ b5 ] advance (at least that's what I thought lol..). [ R f b8 ] seems even better according to Fritz 9. At this point the game is won anyway so it doesn't particularly matter. Also what chess engines say is not necessarily gospel. Don't for one second believe that they are always right. (It's just simplification time at this point no need to go ahead with my K-Side attack with me already material ahead).
 [ g6 ] , [ Q d1 ]  Aww poor queen! Anyway White resigned at this point. Why carry on the massacre right? Hopefully this kid went to go improve his game. Or maybe he just needed to get his chess program out to help him - after all we know he didn't get 1927 through his own skill.
 [ N x f8 ]  [ R x f8 ]  [ Q x e6 ]  [ f x e6 ]  [ R x e6 ] , [ B b5 ]  ?? I don't know what I was thinking here. [ R e8 ] would have been fine.
 [ f x e6 ]  [ B f6 ] , [ B g5 ]  According to " how analysis " it is important to have one move we like in the game. It is this one for me mostly because it show that spending hours doingtactics exercices will give a cool feed-back....sometimes.
 [ e6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ B b5 + ]  [ B d7 ] , [ B x d7 + ]  I like to exchange because it earns me an extra move.
 [ f x g4 ]  [ h x g4 ] , [ N c6 ]  Finally developing all of his pieces but it is too late as mate is inevitable
 [ N x g5 ]  [ R x b2 ] , [ N x f7 ]  White molests the black pawns which were easy pickings.
 [ K e3 ]  [ b6 ]  [ K f4 ]  [ g5 + ]  [ K g3 ]  [ K e5 ] , [ h4 ]  White is willing to sacrifice a pawn to separate my paired passed pawns.
 [ Q b5 ]  [ Q c2 ]  [ B a6 ]  [ K h2 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ B x g7 ]  [ K x g7 ] , [ a4 ]  here I (white) offered a draw
 [ b4 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ N d f4 ] , [ b x a3 ]  introducing new trouble on the Queens' wing: pawn [ b2 ] is pinned...
 [ c x d4 ] , [ N c4 + ]  Fork attack to get the pawn?.
 [ Q x f5 + ] , [ K e7 ]  There is actually a rather unintuitive mate in 7 for White here after this move. Black is already done for but that's no excuse for making poor moves!
 [ B x b3 ] , [ N c4 ]  [ B d5 ] and [ Q g7 # ] was threatened...
 [ Q f3 ]  [ R b e8 ] , [ N a c3 ]  Having the knight on [ a4 ] actually become one reason I went for the sacrifice because being able to jump to [ b6 ] was useful in lines where Black allows White's queen to start checking and tries to escape a draw by running to the queenside. But it was already time to give up that pipe dream. If White can get to an endgame perhaps the slightly better pawn structure gives drawing chances (yeah right).
 [ N f6 ]  [ f5 ] , [ g x f5 ]  Not what I expected 19. ... [ e x f5 ] 20. [ g x f5 ] [ g5 ] might have been better.
 [ Q x f3 ] , [ N d2 ]  Another useless move
 [ O-O ] , [ Q c7 ]  Again missing the opportunity to play ...[ b5 ] and ...b4.
 [ f5 ]  [ a5 ]  [ N c8 ] , [ B c6 ]  A little subtlety but I believe the immediate [ B d5 ] is equally good.
 [ N x d7 ]  [ c x d7 + ]  [ Q x d7 ] , [ N b5 ]  this knight isn't really doing alot besides threatening a fork on [ c7 ] if my queen stops watching over it.
 [ Q d6 ]  [ a3 ]  [ N g4 ]  [ B x c5 ]  [ Q x c5 ] , [ Q e2 ]  I left my [ e5 ] p unguarded momentarily. Had he gone [ [ h3 ] ] here it would have been his. I step in and fix the error and white goes [ [ h3 ] ] too late.
 [ N c3 ] , [ Q c8 ]  As Stanley is now building his army around the K. I didn't realize until I go wrong which is about to happen.
 [ B x d3 ]  [ R x d3 ] , [ h3 ]  Taking some precautions for later.
 [ N c6 ] , [ N f3 ]  In hindsight I should probably have played 6.[ N b2 ] to prevent Black's next move - the last trick he has up his sleeve against my Stonewall formation. I would then have continued 7.Nf3.
 [ B x d3 ] , [ Q x d3 ]  ...so we trade our remaining bishops leaving our queens as the only pieces that can move diagonally. I now have 28 points he has 24.
 [ g x f4 ] , [ g x f4 ]  The exchange has opened up an avenue for Black's Queen to attack but also created more flight squares for White's King and undoubled the Pawns.
 [ c5 ]  [ c3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ N b3 ]  I love N in [ b3 ] defending and not being attacked by black´s bishops but... I let that idea run in my mind without questioning it
 [ B x f7 + ]  [ K f8 ]  [ B g5 ] , [ N e7 ]  a poor response. better was 12... [ N x d4 ]  [ R e1 ] , [ B x d4 ]  lists this move as a blunder
 [ N c3 ]  [ B b7 ] , [ O-O ]  8. 0-0 - both sides get their pieces out very quickly and now I decided to put Henry on the kingside. Not the usual cut and thrust of the Dragon or Naijdorf when both sides attack each other's kings on opposite wings!
 [ f x g5 ]  [ R f3 + ]  [ K g8 ]  [ Q x e6 + ]  [ K h8 ] , [ R f7 ]  Now White wins back more than his sacrificed piece.
 [ Q x c6 ] , [ N d4 ]  just to pause again White expected the Black Queen to move.
 [ B b2 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ Q c2 ]  [ B b6 ]  [ a x b4 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ N f4 ]  [ R c8 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ Q x f6 ]  [ R f c1 ]  [ Q g5 ] , [ B x h7 + ]  regaining the pawn and beginning to destroy the black king's protection
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ a6 ]  [ B a4 ] , [ N f6 ]  looking to develop king's side early
 [ d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ a6 ]  Najdorf variation - maybe the best choice if playing Black and wanting to fight for the win.
 [ d x c3 ] , [ R f6 + ]  Or maybe it can't wait since black opted for a preemptive strike. But it will prove to be black's undoing.
 [ e x d5 ]  [ Q x d5 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ a6 ]  A mistake according to Matt: White doesn't intend to put his WB on [ b5 ] anyway so no need to discourage him. Given my problems with my WB later in the game his advice to play 6....[ B g4 ] makes a lot of sense: much more active. As an inveterate Najdorf player I'm over-fond of ...a6.
 [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ] , [ B b5 + ]  NCO-13 comments: ...a safe system avoiding the complications of the open variations. White gains an initiative against imprecise play but otherwise has few prospects for advantage. Since I am looking to tip the scales of advantage in my direction I simply try to be precise and look for the advantage for me.
 [ Q e3 ] , [ f5 ]  I move my queen down to [ e3 ] on the same file as black's king and black's queen also pinning black's knight at e4. Black moves down his [ f7 ] pawn to f5.
 [ Q c6 ]  [ h4 ]  [ f5 ]  [ e x f6 ]  [ e ]  [ p ]  [ + ]  [ e x f6 ] , [ R f4 ]  I'm not sure why I did this move.
 [ Q x c7 + ]  [ R d8 d7 ]  [ Q c2 ]  [ Q b8 ]  [ N c4 ]  [ R d6 d5 ]  [ Q f2 ]  [ Q c7 ] , [ Q x b6 ]  Black's case is hopeless since Kasparov not only has an extra knight but a armada of passed pawns on the queen's wing.
 [ g x f3 ]  [ Q x f3 ]  [ Q f6 ]  [ e5 ] , [ Q x e5 ]  The E-file is now open.
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ a6 ]  [ c3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ B b3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B e7 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ h3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ a4 ]  [ h6 ]  [ B c2 ] , [ b5 ]  I have reviewed the computer analysis of this game and here is where it points to my first mistake. I should have moved [ d4 ] due to center control. This move instead allowed white to dominate the a file and as you'll see I pay for this move later on.
 [ N d6 + ]  [ B x d6 ]  [ Q x d6 ] , [ N f7 ]  a desparate attack on my queen? it is actually very effective given that stupid [ c8 ] bishop
 [ N x b1 ]  [ N c2 + ] , [ K d1 ]  (?!) Perhaps 22. [ K f1 ] was better.
 [ N h4 ] , [ B e6 ]  Retreating the bishop to safety.
 [ B b2 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ e3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ B b5 ] , [ B d6 ]  Mainline of the Nimzo-larsen attack
 [ B b4 ] , [ B d3 ]  ?? A blunder on my part. It allows [ Q x g2 ] and wins material. But I saw some interesting attacking possibilities in this position black's king is still centralised and yes indeed only one move away from castling but if I can prevent that the open center might prove to give black troubles.
 [ g6 ] , [ e4 ]  Loses a pawn for nothing
 [ h5 ] , [ R f2 ]  The white King is still vulnerable and the Knight is stuck. The Black Queen can sneak to the other side with [ Q g7 ] to cause havoc for White!
 [ B x f3 ]  [ B x f6 ] , [ B g4 ]  After the blunder I stopped mentoring shortly as Sue was playing flawless until here. But this is where it resumes. Like before I went back to 14.[ B x f6 ] but this time I did something different. I followed another method from tactical-abyss and my student analyze and play the moves as though I were playing as black. That's because in his visualization thread which is more or less the same way I do it he said the same thing that stalhandske made me do as Homework at WTWLTR. When I suggested a move he made me play as if the opponent's move to figure out why that move was bad. The moral there is also playing as your opponent so that you learn. But this time she got the answer. In it I said You are playing extremely well and after the blunder I made a few days ago which lost a piece for a pawn it was a struggle for me to get back in the game. However after I played 14.[ B x f6 ] you responded with 14...[ B g4 ] The problem is that with this move I can get a pawn back So going back in time before your retreat but after my capture I was thinking of something different. It is good practice as well as per TA's suggestion which is playing on the opposite side (from the opponent's POV.) So let's suppose that I were playing as black. In this position how would I have responded to prevent this? And she accurately said 14...[ g x f6 ] leading to 15.gxf3.
 [ Q c5 ] , [ R e5 ]  This move apparently came as a surprise to my opponent as he now spent a considerable amount of his clock deciding what to do. As for myself I was just trying to survive; I knew that if he ever got his Rooks connected I would likely be dead meat. I briefly considered 23. [ Q x a6 ] [ N x g4 ] or 23. [ B x a6 ] [ Q x c2 ] ch but I never explored these any further at the time perhaps White has some resources available after these moves.
 [ R d7 x d2 ]  [ R x d2 ]  [ R x d2 ] , [ Q x d2 ]  Even after Black takes the advanced QBP I'll still have a 3 to 2 Q-side majority. I plan to advance these Pawns and force one through to the 8th rank.
 [ e3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ d4 ] , [ c5 ]  A sort of queens gambit in reverse
 [ B x g5 ] , [ R e1 + ]  now the stinger...if black moves to [ d8 ] [ b b6 ] is checkmate!! Black is forced to return the piece...
 [ N a6 ] , [ B b2 ]  Pressuring the solo pawn.
 [ g x h5 + ]  [ K x h5 ]  [ R h1 + ]  [ K g6 ]  [ R h8 ] , [ K g7 ]  There are lots of chances for repetition here ( 53. [ R h5 ] [ K g6 ] 54. [ R h8 ] ... )
 [ e6 ] , [ B x c6 ]  According to Stockfish 10 White can do better with 4. O-O.
 [ K x g1 ] , [ R x f7 ]  I've lost the N (and the [ e5 ] pawn) for the dangerous pawn. But I have a pawn and as they say: remove pawns and equal pieces: what's left? A draw!
 [ R a7 ] , [ R e d1 ]  Long story: My Queen is stuck between two guarded knights (one is pinned to the King) and can't move unless I really wanted to lose the game entirely. Next my savage bishop doesn't want to retreat and make-up another plan because he also is attacked 360. I abhor this Rook move and wished I played 21.[ R e8 + ] (If it's safe). Confused?
 [ d5 ] , [ a5 ]  To prevent the Bayonet Attack and prepare ... [ N a6 ] and ... [ N c5 ] attacking the e-pawn.
 [ e x f3 ]  [ N x f3 ] , [ e6 ]  Although black moved here to develop he should have waited and brought his LSB out first. Why? This move will only give him one place to develop his bishop. And he cannot do it without cramming it. Now this is what Jack Stockel meant when he told me not to cram your pieces. That's because it might take him two moves instead of one to get a piece out. Either way however in order for lesplay to complete development black would have to spend more moves then normal to get his pieces out and that is why 4.e5!!. Had that not been played I am sure that black would be almost completely developed. This also shows why it is a good to get things out ASAP and not procrastinate on developing. With that in mind white now has a noticeable advantage because he is more developed and much closer to controlling the center. In fact chicoboy's center is almost completely controlled in my opinion because of where his central pawns are positioned.
 [ K x e6 ] , [ N d1 ]  A sensible choice but 32.[ N d5 ] certainly came into consideration. A possible continuation might have been 32.[ N d5 ] [ K d6 ] 33.[ h3 ] [ h5 ] 34.[ h x g4 ] [ h x g4 ] 35.[ B f1 ] [ b5 ] and Black has the initiative. From here on White might have found it hard to keep both minor pieces e.g. 36.[ B e2 ] (what else?) [ b x [ c4 ] ] 37.[ B x [ c4 ] ] [ R b1 + ] 38.[ K e2 ] (can't afford to lose touch with his g-pawn!) ...[ R b2 + ] 39.[ K f1 ] [ R c2 ] and [a] 40.[ N b6 ] [ K c6 ] or [b] 40.[ B b3 ] [ R c1 + ] 41.[ K e2 ] [ c4 ] etc.
 [ N f6 ]  [ O-O ] , [ c5 ]  (?!) According to the GK engine an inaccuracy. Now was the time to develop the knight to a6. I was hoping for 9...[ d x c6 ] e.p. [ N x c6 ] but expected 9.[ d x c5 ] [ B x c5 ] which I thought was OK for Black.
 [ N b d7 ] , [ e x f6 ]  An alternative is 11.[ g3 ] which frequently transposes after 11... [ B b7 ] 12.[ e x f6 ] but black could try 11... [ R g8 ] there attacking the pinning piece after 12.[ h4 ] [ R x g5 ] 13.[ h x g5 ] black has broken the pin but white can seriously damage black's kingside after 13... [ N d5 ] 14.g6! [ f x g6 ] 15.[ Q g4 ] [ Q e7 ] when white can play Bg2-[ e4 ] building pressure or just take on g6. With white in this opening Kramnik has favored that line but I think most white players prefer to not give black that option.
 [ e x f5 ]  [ e6 ]  [ b x a3 ] , [ e x f7 ]  44. [ e7 ] [ a2 ] and Black will promote with mate
 [ N d7 ]  [ h4 ]  [ h5 ] , [ g5 ]  My opponent weakened his castle-sided pawn structure on purpose a fact that I fully exploited in the end of the middle-game. Perhaps he has a wrong conception of what a strong pawn structure is. Score: +0.18
 [ Q g5 + ]  [ K f2 ]  [ Q h4 + ]  [ g3 ] , [ Q d4 + ]  I got him!
 [ B b7 ]  [ c4 ]  [ a6 ]  [ B x c6 ]  [ B x c6 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ R c8 ]  [ Q b2 ]  [ B a8 ] , [ R a c1 ]  White now has only slight prospects of an attack against Black's King and must keep his hanging Pawns covered.
 [ N b6 ]  [ R b8 ] , [ N x d7 ]  What? All that wasted time to get to [ [ b6 ] ] and now white takes? Why..? Simple enough: white wants to dominate the white squares and black's white bishop is about all that's preventing him from doing so. Besides [ [ b6 ] ] isn't that hot it eyes a buncha useless squares: ([ a8 ] [ c8 ] [ c4 ] [ d5 ] d7)
 [ R x e8 ]  [ R x e8 ] , [ K f1 ]  Whte of course have to meet Re1#. Here I blundered very heavily.
 [ Q x c2 ]  [ B x c2 ]  [ R e8 ] , [ R x e5 ]  closing the game....or not!?
 [ N d7 + ]  [ K f5 ] , [ N c5 ]  If the knight was a light-squared bishop then maybe White could draw by shifting the bishop along the a8-[ h1 ] diagonal but the knight is slow and can be kicked around so I don't think White has a chance here.
 [ K x c5 ]  [ N d6 ]  [ B f3 ] , [ a4 ]  Taking risks to try to win the game.
 [ N b4 ] , [ a3 ]  Black pieces have more freedom of maneuver by now White must repeal it patiently
 [ d5 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ] , [ e4 ]  [ Q c2 ] is another option here but I was happy to have the chance to bring my b pawn to c
 [ B b3 ]  [ O-O ] , [ B e3 ]  And that's when I decide to complete my development.
 [ N f6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ e3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ c3 ]  This is a typical London set up
 [ Q x c6 + ]  [ K f8 ]  [ c x b4 ] , [ d x e4 + ]  Open another column that closes the circle the white king
 [ N d4 ]  [ c3 ] , [ b5 ]  The number of threats in the center of the board is building to a breaking point. Seeing this black applies presure to White's WSB to help reduce these threats.
 [ B d3 ]  [ B x h2 ]  [ g3 ] , [ Q d8 ]  Managed to win his bishop
 [ R x c8 ]  [ R x c8 ]  [ R c1 ] , [ R x c1 + ]  Alternative variation: 22...[ R f8 ] [!?=/+]
 [ N f6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N x e4 ] , [ d4 ]  The Open Defense. I haven't seen this one yet but at least this is one I have the reference material for. 6. [ d4 ] [ b5 ] is standard.
 [ O-O ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B b5 ] , [ N b4 ]  More move threaten move threaten. Is there a way either side can take a more dominant grip on the game?
 [ B x h2 ] , [ R f1 ]  This is a good move too the rook had to move.
 [ R c5 ]  [ K f5 ] , [ R d d5 ]  A problem-like position... but no mate.
 [ B e6 ]  [ N c5 ]  [ B f7 ] , [ Q f2 ]  Now all of a sudden I have a huge attack aiming at his King. He has to play [ Q e7 ] no choice here. Here's the reason why....There are 2 threats going on right now. Of course [ Q x f7 # ] but also Qf6. Remember that bishop on b2? Now he's really strong.
 [ K b6 ]  [ N x c6 ]  [ K x c6 ] , [ K e4 ]  And now the game is going to be drawn. White is up on material but with four black pawns to two for white and bishops of opposite color a win isn't in the cards for anyone.
 [ R h1 ] , [ Q e5 ]  adding to the force.
 [ R f7 x f4 ] , [ d6 ]  White may as well tie up one of Black's rooks and threaten a promotion.
 [ a5 ]  [ b x a5 ]  [ b x c4 ] , [ N x c4 ]  White has a powerful passed pawn.
 [ c4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ B g5 ]  Oh pinning my knight.
 [ N d4 ] , [ B d5 ]  ?! I think that white's main goal here was to nab the pawn right near the R. But @knightrider62: First there are way for black to prevent you from taking that pawn. And what's important is to ask what you're opponent can do and not assume well if I play this then that will happen. Chess is a lot more complicated then that. This is why my coach says "Start Thinking". By this he means don't assume anything. Instead analyze and access the position to see what your opponent can do. Second winning a pawn in that general area will often cause problems for you. Yes you'd win a pawn but black has ways to attack and sometimes win a piece. Now according to the analysis this is an inaccuracy because of black's next move but I disagree. I was making a point but I don't give it as an inaccuracy. And while it doesn't appear so this really is an inaccuracy because after ...BXN normally I'd respond with [ Q x f3 ] but that would be an outright blunder to due d N as it would lose a Q. So now the only other option is to take back with g pawn which opens the K up very early and makes the K susceptible to exposure. While there's no weakness yet there's a strong weakness because when it's opened like that things later on can go in there and attack it. For that very reason I have to agree that best was 9.[ B x d4 ] with the idea that after 9...[ B x d4 ] 10.[ h3 ] [ B x f3 ] 11.[ Q x f3 ] [ c6 ] 12.[ R e b1 ] [ K h8 ] 13.[ N e2 ] [ B e5 ] 14.[ B b3 ] [ Q a5 ] 15.[ R f1 ] [ Q d2 ] 16.[ K h1 ] [ R a c8 ] and white is much safer. The idea is to really analyze and figure out how and why a certain move loses material. A lot of times it doesn't appear so but there are things behind which is why the threat is there.
 [ R e1 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ N x e5 ]  White win a pawn due to the problems black have after Bf4.
 [ B b3 ]  [ b6 ] , [ R g1 ]  not sure what happens here: a failed attempt to castle short?
 [ Q e7 ] , [ R f e1 ]  Black wisely chose not to trade queens while he's down a bishop and a pawn. So it's time to chase her around while getting my pieces into more active roles. I could have played [ B x b7 ] but after black's R(a)[ b8 ] I end up losing my pawn at [ b2 ] which splits my a and c pawns too.
 [ R f5 ]  [ g x f5 ]  [ e x f5 ]  [ B x f5 ]  [ Q g7 ]  [ B x h7 + ]  [ K f8 ]  [ Q x c8 + ]  [ R x c8 ]  [ N e6 + ]  [ K f7 ]  [ N x g7 ]  [ K x g7 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ R e8 + ] , [ K d2 ]  ...and black is out of resources.
 [ K f2 ] , [ Q e4 ]  I do not know why he played this because we know that he is not going to win the [ h1 ] Rook do to my Queen.
 [ Q x f6 ]  [ B e3 ] , [ B x f3 ]  This makes black's advantage vanish. Black's idea is to enter an endgame in which he is supposedly better thanks to white's weakened pawn structure but he oversees that the bishop's pair is more than enough as a compensation. The natural alternative was 18. ... [ R a d8 ] 19. [ Q e2 ] [ c4 ] 20. [ d4 ] [ N c6 ] 21. [ d x e5 ] [ N x e5 ] 22. N[ d4 ] [ B d6 ] and black can build a very strong kingside attack.
 [ N c5 + ] , [ K d2 ]  I tend to prefer [ K c3 ] so if black takes the rook on [ b3 ] white can take back with the king attacking the other knight on a3. This then gives white time to advance one of her pawns.
 [ N x d4 ] , [ B g7 ]  Threatning 6. [ N x d4 ]  [ B x b2 ]  [ R b1 ] , [ B g7 ]  Retreating....
 [ B b7 ]  [ a5 ]  [ K c5 ] , [ a4 ]  The pawn on [ b5 ] is defended by the rook (because he didn't run off to the kingside after that doomed pawn). So onward we march.
 [ d6 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ a6 ]  [ N a3 ]  [ b5 ] , [ N d5 ]  Slightly more popular is 9. [ B x f6 ] but that allows more thematic plans to be adopted by Black. This is more positional and tries to conquer [ d5 ] without giving Black play on the g-file or the possibility to strike in the center with an extra f-pawn.
 [ B x g3 ]  [ h x g3 ]  [ K b8 ]  [ a5 ] , [ b x a5 ]  This queens side is beginning to look exposed
 [ K h1 ]  [ N e5 ] , [ B e1 ]  ?? white did not notice that black is willing to sacrifice the rook and give white a mate. [ B c2 ] was necessary.
 [ Q x b2 ]  [ N x c7 + ]  [ K d8 ] , [ N x a8 ]  And now I'm the equivalent of just a pawn down. Further all my pieces are developed whereas Black still has to get his [ B f8 ] and his rook out. My king position doesn't look so secure but then neither does Black's.
 [ Q x d4 ]  [ N g4 ]  [ R f3 ] , [ N e5 ]  Forking rook and bishop.
 [ N f5 ] , [ R d1 ]  Ok. White defends. But it is almost completely cramped!
 [ N x d7 ]  [ R x d7 ]  [ f6 ]  [ B d6 ] , [ R a8 ]  Now the loss of a pawn materializes.
 [ B g3 ] , [ g4 ]  I continue to retreat my DB down to [ g3 ] and black's g pawn continues to attack white with move to [ g4 ] and attacking knight at f3.
 [ Q c7 ] , [ g3 ]  [ Q c7 ] as supposed to avoid a direct Bf4; Whites' next simple move however 'masks a cunningly new idea' (Botvinnik); nowadays a normal practice against the Sicilian; [ g3 ] [ B g2 ] 0-0 f4... at that time however this was a novelty; and Tal turns it into a trap...
 [ e6 ] , [ d x e6 ]  Instead he tries to open the centre but he misses a tactic.
 [ N d7 ] , [ N d2 ]  21. [ N d2 ] - you would not think I would be struck down by passivitis from here would you ........
 [ B d3 ]  [ c5 ] , [ N f3 ]  now whites development has been completed and the attack will start with Bxh7. but black has a surprise.
 [ Q x c3 ]  [ N x c3 ] , [ N d7 ]  I don't like cramming my N but the only other way to develop would've been bringing it on the rim. I won't do that unless the position demands it which isn't happening here.
 [ f5 ] , [ R h8 + ]  The attack that brought the downfall...
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ c6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ d x e5 ] , [ d x e5 ]  Black didn't chose good opening.
 [ K e6 ]  [ B h2 ]  [ f5 ] , [ f4 ]  34. [ f4 ] - seemed a good idea at the time trying to break up black's pawn wall but black's next move makes me think again.
 [ h x g5 ]  [ h x g5 ]  [ K b2 ]  [ R e1 ] , [ a4 ]  Now Black's counterplay is a couple of tempi slower and there is also one less pawn each on the kingside which enables White to squeeze out a win.
 [ R b6 ]  [ B c5 ] , [ R b3 ]  Alternative variation: 32.hxg5! [ B x b6 ] 33.[ g x f6 ] gxf6? 34.[ Q g6 + ] [ R g7 ] 35.[ Q x f6 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ a6 ]  [ B a4 ]  [ b5 ] , [ B b3 ]  In fact I knew that we'd get to this point. But what Ted does next is something that I haven't seen before.
 [ e6 ] , [ R f f8 ]  And not 27... Rfe7?? 28. [ B b4 ] and the rook is trapped!
 [ R x e2 + ] , [ K f3 ]  I missed this move!! I was a little upset that he found is then I saw ...
 [ N x d4 ]  [ B x d4 ] , [ R x d4 ]  Black could have opted for BxB but white seems in a trading mood and each trade makes black's bishop increase in value. White could protect the rook with P[ f3 ] but that won't stop RxPd2. If white defends the d pawn the a pawn falls. RxR is the best deal.
 [ K d8 ]  [ N x e4 ] , [ Q x e4 ]  this can be no longer a coincedence: also at this point [ N x d4 ] was absolutely winning; after [ Q d1 ] [ Q x e4 ] White is crushed...
 [ a6 ]  [ d3 ]  [ N e3 ]  [ B x e3 ]  [ f x e3 ]  [ N f5 ]  [ K f2 ]  [ N d6 ] , [ b6 ]  !! -- The Rook at [ b2 ] is no longer needed.
 [ N e7 ]  [ R c1 ] , [ N f5 ]  threatening the [ d4 ] pawn
 [ K d3 ]  [ K c1 ] , [ N b6 ]  I'm waiting to see if White can improve his position and win. I don't have anything else to do.
 [ B g5 ]  [ Q d6 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ Q x f6 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N d5 ] , [ Q h6 ]  ...[ Q d6 ] is better and prevents losing the Rook.
 [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ] , [ a6 ]  [ N f6 ] was the main move and White can't play [ e5 ] because of [ Q a5 ] but I preferred to play a more passive flexible setup.
 [ B x g4 ]  [ Q x g4 ]  [ N d7 ] , [ e6 ]  Wedging black by blockading the [ e7 ] pawn on its home square to restrict black.
 [ K h7 ]  [ B x d2 ]  [ R d8 ] , [ B d5 ]  defends against [ R x d2 ] and attacks the base of the pawn chain [ f7 ]  [ R b8 ]  [ B x f7 ]  [ R b2 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ R b3 ]  [ B d4 ]  [ R g3 + ]  [ K h2 ]  [ R g4 ]  [ N x g6 ]  [ R x g6 ]  [ B x g6 + ]  [ K x g6 ]  [ K g3 ]  [ K f5 ]  [ K f3 ]  [ K e6 ]  [ R a6 + ]  [ K f5 ] , [ R f6 # ]  
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ f6 ]  f6? better would be n[ c3 ] or d6.
 [ B b3 + ]  [ K h8 ]  [ B b2 ]  [ Q x d4 ]  [ B x d4 + ] , [ N f6 ]  After 24..[ N e6 ] also possible was Re8! But I went for something simpler but nonetheless still wins.
 [ Q c7 ]  [ h5 ] , [ h6 ]  A novelty but I think that's the error that cost the game to my opponent. This weekeness the King safety the game i was folloing is this: Alternative variation: 16... [ d5 ] 17. [ e5 ] [ N e8 ] 18. [ B x e7 ] [ Q x e7 ] 19. [ g5 ] [ N c7 ] 20. [ R d g1 ] [ R c e8 ] 21. [ B x h7 ] [ K x h7 ] 22. [ g6 ] [ K g8 ] 23. [ h6 ] [ f5 ] 24. [ h x g7 ] [ Q x g7 ] 25. [ Q f4 ] [1-0 Tayeb D (2160)-Rapinel F (2199)/France 2002/EXT 2003]
 [ e x d5 ]  [ B x d5 ]  [ R a d1 ]  [ Q c6 ]  [ B x d5 ] , [ e x d5 ]  isolated pawn
 [ B f8 ] , [ e5 ]  Natural and hard to meet. The [ N f6 ] has no squares and Black is doomed just 15 moves in. If you play through the rest of the game try to guess White's next move in the continuance of his attack.
 [ R f6 ]  [ R b4 ]  [ g6 ] , [ R c4 ]  In my position as black I would have played firstly [ g x [ [ h4 ] ] ] to which I was white would have played [ K x [ [ h4 ] ] ] or secondly c5. I can see Blacks idea that [ [ g5 ] ] plays to Blacks advantage in [ R f4 + ] and White will lose without his Rook so he isnt going to stick around to see [ R f4 + ] happen and therefore take himself off the line and out of the game almost (this is where i said having the pawn on [ h5 ] instead of [ [ h4 ] ] would be better) but if the pawn was on [ [ h4 ] ] then 38...[ [ g5 ] ] 39. [ h x g4 ] [ h x g4 ] 40. [ K x g4 ] and maybe it was better after all but oh well
 [ K g5 ]  [ N e3 ] , [ K f4 ]  ...but for the third successive occasion Black declines to capture waiting like me...
 [ Q f8 + ]  [ K d7 ]  [ O-O-O + ]  [ K c7 ] , [ Q d8 # ]  A useful line to know.
 [ N x f4 ] , [ Q c3 + ]  Postpones the mate threat by checking.
 [ B x f4 ]  [ e x f4 ]  [ R b1 ]  [ f x g3 + ]  [ K x h3 ]  [ g x f2 ]  [ R f1 ] , [ B e5 ]  Be5! Thats what I had in mind when I played 19.. [ N f8 ]  [ R x f2 ] , [ B f4 ]  Cuts out all the white pieces and leaves their king exposed to an attack he cannot survive.
 [ c5 ]  [ e3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ N c3 ]  I was unsure of this line or if it was theory or not. I was expecting c3/Be2.
 [ N d2 ] , [ R e8 ]  Preparing [ N e5 ] blocking the Bishop diagonal.
 [ N e4 ] , [ B h7 ]  Joe: I am the kind of person that's into centralizing both rooks. With that I'm thinking of [ R f e1 ] as that would enable me to play [ R a d1 ] later on. Ken: that overlooks a threat look again. Hint if you play [ R e1 ] one of my knights will move immediately to cause you harm Joe: Yes ...[ N g6 ] is a problem as mate is threatened against me since the Q and N would work well as you later have ...[ Q h4 ] etc. Therefore I think that the position demands Qh3. Even better would be [ [ g3 ] ] though. I can't even play that and the threat is worse as you'll win a second piece in the same way that you won the first piece. Yet there's no good choices that are going to prevent this. That's because if I move the B I lose my Queen so that's not an option. I think the best move available is to give up the N with [ Q g4 ] in returning I'm threatening to take on [ h6 ] which also threatens mate. You can drive it off but I think with some difficulties since your DSB was exchanged. Aside from that I've got no idea what to do. Ken: the only other plausible move is [ [ g3 ] ] but I don't think those variations will be any happier. Joe: It's better but you can still play ...[ N g6 ] or even worse if there's something that I don't know about.
 [ b x a6 ]  [ K x h4 ]  [ a7 ]  [ K g5 ]  [ a8 = Q ]  [ e5 ]  [ B x e5 ]  [ K f5 ]  [ Q f8 + ]  [ K e4 ]  [ Q x f4 + ] , [ K d5 ]  Nowhere to hide...
 [ d3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ h3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ O-O ] , [ O-O ]  Both players castle. White is slightly cramped in his positioning.
 [ N e2 ]  [ R e5 ]  [ N g3 ] , [ R d2 ]  At this point I confess I was lost. I couldn't analyze well now and surely not on a blitz.
 [ N a5 ] , [ B c2 ]  This B has now made 4 out of the first 10 moves which seems to go against all opening principles but it has also caused Black to use at least 3 moves to push it back including putting his knight on the rim where it is dim ... Now the B bolsters [ e4 ] and points indirectly at Black's castled position with plenty of potential for effectiveness later in the game. The Ruy Lopez is typically a slowly developing game with plenty of potential attacks forthcoming once White has established his pieces on good squares.
 [ B d1 ]  [ d x c4 ]  [ B c3 ]  [ N f5 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B e4 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ b5 ]  [ R d1 ] , [ Q c7 ]  allowing the pawn snatch at [ f6 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ R h7 ] , [ N e5 ]  got to get the pieces at the king
 [ d6 ] , [ B c4 ]  the common move in this opening
 [ Q e7 + ]  [ K a6 ] , [ h3 ]  Escaping the back rank mate thus threatening [ N c5 ] "for real".
 [ e5 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N d8 ]  [ b4 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ N e1 ]  [ N h5 ]  [ f3 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ f4 ]  [ N x f4 ]  [ B x f4 ]  [ e x f4 ]  [ R x f4 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ R f1 ] , [ B h3 ]  He gives me his bishop w/ no compensation (except the pawn). My queen and kingside rook can come in to defend his one piece queen attack.
 [ b5 ] , [ d3 ]  I begin by trying to attack the queen. Though my threat may or not be dxe4. A sightly stronger threat is [ N x e4 ] Be5! though I'm not sure I'll have time for that one.
 [ Q f3 ]  [ Q b1 + ]  [ K g2 ] , [ f6 ]  Forced. White cannot be allowed his own [ f6 ] push.
 [ b6 ]  [ Q x h5 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ Q h8 ] , [ N x e4 ]  Still not too late for Pd5...
 [ B x d5 ] , [ B x f2 + ]  Seeing what is coming up I decide to exchange my way... but it was a mistake.
 [ B x c5 ] , [ b x c5 ]  ...and we swap bishops as my knight can cover all squares.
 [ R x c1 ]  [ R x c1 ] , [ R b8 ]  I know what he really wants. In this position he is trying to put pressure on the b file. Here's the thing he is eventually hoping to exchange pawns with [ a x b4 ] ...[ R x b4 ] which would leave my [ b2 ] pawn attacked. This time however that does not bother me as I will have none of it.
 [ R e2 ]  [ Q d8 ] , [ c3 ]  I don't know why I didn't do that before on move 16. But I needed my rook for other purposes.
 [ N d2 ] , [ N d3 ]  Attacking his Bishop.
 [ c5 ]  [ d x c5 ]  [ N x c5 ] , [ N d4 ]  Alternative variation: 14. [ Q x d8 ] R[ f x d8 ] 15. [ R f d1 ] Alternative variation: 14. [ B x f6 ] [ B x f6 ] 15. [ N x b5 ] [ Q x d1 ] 16. R[ f x d1 ] [ N b3 ] 17. [ R c7 ] [ B x f3 ] 18. [ B x f3 ] [ a x b5 ] 19. [ B x a8 ] [ R x a8 ] $17 [Alekhine]
 [ O-O ]  [ N b4 ]  [ c3 ] , [ N d3 ]  I could have taken the pawn at [ a2 ] but that would leave my knight with no safe retreat and tie my queen down to guard duty. So I put him in place to be a thorn in white's side til the end of the game.
 [ R x a1 ]  [ Q x a1 ] , [ Q f5 ]  Black tries to keep up the attack but plays a dangerous game with the a and b files.
 [ a3 ] , [ N c x e4 ]  I did not understand the purpose of [ a3 ] other than protect against future perches on b4. Black moves forward with starting an exchange.
 [ Q a8 ]  [ Q c7 ] , [ N x f6 ]  ???
 [ R x d1 ]  [ N x d1 ]  [ R d8 ]  [ N f2 ]  [ N c5 ]  [ N d2 ] , [ B c8 ]  Rerouting to a different spot where the Bishop will be more active.
 [ Q h2 ]  [ R f h8 ]  [ Q g1 ]  [ R x h1 ]  [ Q x h1 ]  [ R h8 ]  [ Q f3 ] , [ e x f4 ]  Gaining [ e5 ] as a outpost for the knight.
 [ B x c3 ]  [ b x c3 ] , [ b6 ]  Preventing white's [ B c5 ] attack.
 [ K h8 ]  [ R c3 ]  [ R d e8 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ Q f5 ]  [ a3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ K a2 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ Q e2 ]  [ b4 ]  [ R c4 ]  [ b x a3 ]  [ b3 ]  [ e3 ]  [ K x a3 ]  [ R e d8 ]  [ g4 ]  [ Q h7 ]  [ h4 ]  [ R d2 ]  [ Q f3 ]  [ R x c2 ]  [ R x c2 ]  [ Q x c2 ]  [ g5 ]  [ R f5 ]  [ g6 ]  [ Q c5 + ]  [ K a2 ]  [ Q c2 + ]  [ K a3 ]  [ B c5 + ]  [ K a4 ]  [ Q a2 + ]  [ K b5 ]  [ B b4 + ]  [ K c4 ]  [ Q c2 + ]  [ K d4 ]  [ Q d2 + ]  [ K c4 ] , [ Q c3 # ]  
 [ g5 ]  [ d3 ]  [ g x f4 ] , [ B x f4 ]  this is what we call free development...
 [ K e6 ] , [ B d8 ]  Threatening the c-pawn.
 [ R c5 ]  [ g4 ]  [ f4 ]  [ g x h3 + ]  [ K x h3 ]  [ K e7 ]  [ R x e5 ]  [ K d6 ]  [ R h5 ]  [ R a7 ]  [ R b4 ]  [ R a3 ] , [ R x d4 + ]  Even though the opportunity is gone this is significant. Although I don't have a passed pawn yet it can't be prevented any longer. In fact this was the start to my plan on the 13th move which I started and carried through up until now where I know that it's gonna happen.
 [ h5 ] , [ K e8 ]  Yeah he has to try to stop me now.
 [ g x h3 ]  [ R a d8 ]  [ N e3 ]  [ e4 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ Q a4 ]  [ Q x f3 + ]  [ K g1 ] , [ Q f2 # ]  
 [ b5 ]  [ N x c5 ]  [ b x c4 ]  [ d x c4 ] , [ B x b2 ]  Now I get a free pawn too! And an open b-file!
 [ R d8 ] , [ K h2 ]  gives up some of white's advantage. This move makes it harder to bring white's king into the game. Alternative variation: 32. [ K f1 ] [gets the king closer into the game unlike [ K h2 ] which hinders the future activity of the king.]
 [ Q g4 ] , [ B x d2 ]  !! White loses a whole rook with nothing to compensate for it. Now both White's d pawn and b pawn are hanging.
 [ N d6 + ]  [ K b8 ] , [ N x f7 ]  Now things get interesting. I deliberated for a long time as to which rook I should move then hesitantly played 18... [ h6 ] to prepare for 20...[ B g5 ] Black not only will win back the material gained by White but also launch a severe attack.
 [ B c2 ] , [ c5 ]  Looking to attack whites center Kasparov plays pawn to c5. He has fought himself back into this game.
 [ R b1 ] , [ Q c7 ]  I now move 'F' rook across to [ b1 ] and take control of b file protected by knight at [ d2 ] so black queen moves away to c7. If I was black I would have moved my [ a5 ] rook out to [ b5 ] as it was protected by [ a6 ] and put up a fight for the b file. If black had got the DB at [ c5 ] out of the way the queen would have been able to get down the c file and defend. I am not sure the pawns were worth fighting over while the king was left with a knight and a rook.
 [ R a c1 ]  [ B x d6 ] , [ B x d6 ]  This fork wasn't feared due to the previously mentioned line.
 [ N x c5 ]  [ d x c5 ]  [ Q a5 + ]  [ c3 ]  [ Q x c5 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B d7 ]  [ Q e2 ]  [ N h5 ]  [ R f e1 ] , [ N f4 ]  After a very long series of very logical moves black has to make a fundamental choice. An interesting plan would be to start a kingside attack with [ g5 ] and trading the white's black bishop. Black decides to go for the trading of white's white bishop which seems inferior since the white bishop seems to be neutralized in this variant.
 [ e x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ Q x d5 ] , [ d3 ]  Thinking in terms of what I see in the Spanish Opening when [ [ d4 ] ] isn't played to avoid the Noah's Ark Trap and thinking that the variation wouldn't work because of what happens when pawns were exchanged I played this. My worry was losing a pawn with something 6.[ [ d4 ] ] cx[ [ d4 ] ] thinking that 7.Qx[ [ d4 ] ] would lose my Queen. What I forgot is where my N was located and in this position that exchange was acceptable. But I might as well have overlooked that since it did prevent me from jumping the guns. As otherwise I would've exchanged more in which I believe would've been unnecessary as now it would be just because I can with the fact that I had to come to work earlier then usual which gave me less time here.
 [ Q e3 ]  [ N g6 ]  [ R a e1 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ Q c5 ]  [ Q b6 ]  [ Q x b6 ]  [ a x b6 ]  [ a3 ] , [ R a5 ]  I figured there might be some future in using the Rook to defend the pawns along the rank while keeping tabs on White's queenside and with the possibility in future of the Rook swinging in behind the advancing K-side pawns.
 [ b6 ] , [ N g3 ]  Fritz recommends 17. [ Q c3 ] (0.56) 17. [ N g3 ] (0.54) is rated as the second best move. [ Q c3 ] would have placed the queen on the same diagonal as the [ b2 ] bishop directly threatening checkmate at g7. However expecting my opponent would simply counter with 17 ... [ f6 ] I elected to clear the e file for my [ e1 ] rook.
 [ R f2 ]  [ c3 ]  [ R d6 ]  [ R b8 ]  [ R x d5 ]  [ Q c4 ]  [ B a3 ]  [ K b7 ] , [ R d7 + ]  going for the boxing fork
 [ R x f3 ] , [ R f6 ]  Looking for some compensation.
 [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B g5 ]  [ e6 ] , [ Q c1 ]  I suppose he was trying to eliminate my dark squared bishop and weaken my kingside defence but I think [ Q d2 ] might have been better.
 [ N e2 + ]  [ K h2 ]  [ N x c1 ]  [ R x c1 ] , [ R x b2 ]  I've rather diluted my attack but am now two pawns to the good and have my Rook on the 7th.
 [ R x d4 ] , [ g5 + ]  White can only play [ R x g4 ] losing a R for two pawns. It would be still better than...
 [ c x d5 ] , [ B g4 ]  [ B g4 ] ! here it is the attack by king side is dead and double treathen : queen and [ d1 ] rook the [ d3 ] bishop attack is not so dangerous
 [ e6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ] , [ N x d4 ]  Note that it would be exacly the same position if White played 2.[ N f3 ] instead. 1.[ e4 ] [ c5 ] 2.[ N f3 ] [ e6 ] 3.[ d4 ] cx[ d4 ] 4. [ N x f3 ] same thing as this position!
 [ R a e1 ] , [ R a g8 ]  Threatening to win the Q with ...R-N3-R3.
 [ d6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ N c3 ]  i dont like his pawn at d5. i was thinking of something to get rid of it. this pawn is now big headache for me.
 [ B x d1 ] , [ d8 = Q ]  48. d8/Q - Boy am I glad to see Glenda but can she save her beleaguered spouse?
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ d6 ] , [ N c3 ]  All as you would expect
 [ R d5 ]  [ Q b6 ]  [ Q c1 ]  [ R x f2 + ] , [ K g1 ]  [ N x h3 ] is impossible but...
 [ Q x d1 ] , [ R x d1 ]  Now I am a clear piece up. White's attack is largely defused.
 [ b5 ]  [ B b3 ] , [ B e8 ]  this move took a lot of consideration. black doesn't have anything and in fact has to be very careful.
 [ B x e5 ] , [ d x e5 ]  [ f x e5 ] would have had merit too keeping the rook a bit more interested. I decided that the f pawn would eventually advance and prove to be useful in other ways.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ d6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ d4 ] , [ B g4 ]  not sure I would have done this it's too early. Black has a bad black bishop and this just allows me to offer the knight in trade with the next challenging move
 [ Q a4 + ]  [ K e7 ]  [ Q b5 ] , [ b6 ]  too easy...
 [ R f7 ] , [ K x c2 ]  eats the bishop i think this was game costing if he could force a draw before.
 [ Q x e4 ]  [ R b8 ]  [ N d2 ]  [ f5 ]  [ e x f6 ]  [ e ]  [ p ]  [ N x f6 ]  [ Q e5 ]  [ R b6 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ Q x e4 ]  [ B b7 ] , [ Q g4 ]  He's lucky I haven't taken his Rook yet being his other one is still tucked in the corner...I've been saving that move...
 [ K d1 ] , [ Q x g2 ]  Just munching pawns building the material and positional advantage. White cannot take the undefended bishop with 19. [ Q x d3 ] because 19. ... [ R d1 ] wins the white queen (rook bishop for queen isn't much of a win but it's sufficient to ensure the bishop's safety). At this point I really expected white to put me in check with 19. [ Q e3 ] to which I didn't have any clever replies - just consolidating my forces and eventually bringing my rooks to bear on the open center and exposed white king.
 [ b x c6 ] , [ B g5 ]  finally started to develop queen side
 [ Q x d2 ]  [ Q a5 ] , [ R e c1 ]  Also forced.
 [ Q x g6 ]  [ h x g6 ] , [ N x e6 ]  Apparently my knight is safe because it can go back to [ g5 ] or to [ c6 ] and then b5.
 [ R x b7 ]  [ N c2 ] , [ N d1 ]  This move will prevent any check for my king Actually I think my first plan was better to attack his bishop
 [ B x b2 ]  [ R b1 ] , [ B e5 ]  moving away with the B while keeping the pressure on [ N b5 ]  [ R x d8 ]  [ B c3 + ] , [ K d1 ]  White's big error. [ R d2 ] would level things up
 [ N x d3 ]  [ K x d3 ]  [ K e6 ]  [ K e3 ]  [ c6 ]  [ g4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ g x f5 + ] , [ g x f5 ]  The result of blacks majority on both wings is visible- black has two passed pawns. The win was probably trivial even with the piece on due to the pawn majority on both wings but exchanging the last piece cannot be recommended in these circumstances.
 [ e x f5 ] , [ N f6 ]  Computer analysis recommended 19...[ e4 ] but I'd still play the torturing 20.[ N g5 ]  [ N g5 ] , [ h6 ]  Computer analysis recommended 20...[ N d8 ] but still uderestimated:20...[ N d8 ] 21.[ N x f7 ] and if Black played the analysis move 21...[ B e7 ] then I'd play 22.Nxe5+!.
 [ a5 ]  [ B c3 ]  [ f3 ]  [ B x e1 ]  [ R x e1 ] , [ R d1 ]  And now to win more than the exchange.
 [ B x b2 ] , [ R x e7 + ]  And no he resigned and for sure reasons he will lose another pawn and I will be 10+ good game for him.
 [ K g8 ]  [ Q c8 + ]  [ K h7 ]  [ Q e8 ]  [ Q d6 + ]  [ g3 ] , [ Q e6 ]  Again I offer a draw. White declines.
 [ K f2 ]  [ B x c5 + ] , [ K e2 ]  After getting him in check he moved his King out of danger. I can have a free knight if I want it but no. I want to punish him a little. I did think that [ Q x c1 ] is the better move.
 [ R x d7 ] , [ Q e8 ]  This is a serious error probably due a tactical oversight. [ B c8 ] seems indicated but after 18. [ R x d8 ] [ B x h3 ] 19. [ R x f8 + ] [ B x f8 ] 20.[ B x c4 ] White emerges a pawn up! Defending the other bishop with 17...[ Q c8 ] was interesting too but it seems like White can always force a win of a pawn with a right timed Bxc4.
 [ f6 ]  [ g6 ]  [ B x g6 ] , [ h x g6 ]  I believe this is the real blunder. I haven't found it yet but there has to be a mate after this.
 [ N f3 ]  [ B g4 ] , [ c3 ]  A good move to support the center and allow potential tricks for white. dc is possible but not recommended if white is trying for an edge.
 [ R b1 ]  [ a6 ]  [ R x b2 ] , [ R c7 ]  black is a dead duck. The white rook will clean up pawns
 [ g3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ B g2 ] , [ B g7 ]  the game looks to be heading toward a queenspawn game or else a symmetrical English
 [ e5 ]  [ O-O ] , [ B e6 ]  Not sure what she's up to here. It does nothing but protect the pawn (which was already protected by the Queen). Otherwise the Bishop doesn't gain any advantage from that move. The Queen's side of the home rank is looking increasingly empty and undefended while the King's Knight Bishop and Rook are still undeveloped.
 [ O-O-O ] , [ B b4 ]  I go after one of the knights defending [ e2 ] and plan at the very least to pull apart the king's defensive wall.
 [ R c3 ] , [ B h3 ]  Here the bishop makes the kings less active.
 [ R x e1 ]  [ B g4 ] , [ Q f4 ]  Give the bishop chase.
 [ B x d1 ] , [ h x g6 ]  White choose the best option freeing the R and keeping the bishop pair.
 [ e x d6 ]  [ e ]  [ p ] , [ Q x d6 ]  this prevents d4.
 [ B d4 + ]  [ K h1 ] , [ N e5 ]  I will win the exchange due to the third rank weaknesses when white must cover the knight.
 [ e x f5 ]  [ g x f5 ]  [ Q e2 ] , [ b6 ]  An empty threat: [ Q x e5 + ] buys enough time for the bishop to move away.
 [ e3 ] , [ c5 ]  Black adds tension to the Centre. (I spelled it the old fashioned way on purpose.)
 [ R c1 ]  [ R b2 + ]  [ R c2 ]  [ R b3 ]  [ R c3 ]  [ R b2 + ]  [ R c2 ] , [ R b3 ]  As I said white has to prove...
 [ b5 ]  [ N f4 ]  [ Q c2 ]  [ Q c3 ]  [ Q d1 + ]  [ K g2 ] , [ N e5 ]  Undoubtedly an oversight.
 [ R b5 ] , [ B c4 ]  Pulling back one bishop to get ready for the real attack.
 [ B c4 ] , [ N b6 ]  a_random_guy: 6.[ B b3 ] There isn't much to say here aside that we need to save the bishop somehow. 6.[ B b3 ] keeps the bishop on the strong a2-[ g8 ] diagonal and we can retreat it to [ c2 ] if they push c4. roneshet: [ B b5 ] advance a little bit. if they threaten our Bishop we can change pieces with their knight setting two pawns on the same column. a tip from the Great list of tips of ptitroque. We also leave the diagonal... which is a downside... What's better? a_random_guy: @roneshet Don't forget that we'd also give up the bishop pair for no valuable reason in that 6.[ B b5 ] [ [ a6 ] ] 7.[ B x [ c6 ] ] line. Doubling pawns is good and all but non-isolated doubled pawns isn't that big of a weakness early on. ptitroque: 6.[ B b3 ] Seems OK for me bluenoser: 6.[ B b5 ] I was looking at Bb5...if [ [ a6 ] ] we could play BX[ c6 ] taking N and doubling up their p's on c file. If they push [ d6 ] we can take N[ c6 ] doubling up p's. ptitroque: 6.[ B b3 ] -further analyse They'll probably castle short (because of the advance of their c pawn) our bishop will be pointed at their king. Doubling pawn is a disadvantage but it would create an half open file for their rook and 2 pawns on the c file would reinforce their center which would balance the inconvenient.
 [ Q x d7 ] , [ Q h3 ]  threatens mate but i can take [ f3 ] because i am up a bishop and 2 pawns
 [ N b3 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ O-O ] , [ b5 ]  I didnt know this move was an error
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ N f3 ]  Against this I'm at a total loss so I improvise. Sometimes I try to fianchetto the lsb in [ b7 ] but it is not really a confortable game. So I tried something different.
 [ e x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ] , [ B e2 ]  Getting out of dodge with my bishop in toe thinking of moving pd2-[ d4 ] - it would keep things even you take with p-ec I take w/ knight you take with knight and I take knight w/ queen.
 [ c3 ] , [ R a4 ]  Threatens ...RxN winning a piece [PxR??? BxP mate!]
 [ Q x a7 + ] , [ K c8 ]  (Its all over for Black now.)
 [ R b1 ]  [ N x d4 ] , [ b4 ]  The rook move was not wasted. It supports the attack of the b-pawn opening the lines to the Black King.
 [ d4 ] , [ Q c6 ]  threatening g pawn
 [ N e6 ] , [ Q b6 ]  The only safe spot available to Queen.
 [ g x f6 ] , [ Q h5 ]  Black resigns as there is no way to prevent 20 QxN ch winning a piece. [19... K-[ R1 ] 19... K-[ R2 ] or 19... K-[ N2 ] are answered by 20 QxP ch K-[ N1 ] 21 Q-[ N7 ] mate!] If the Knight moves 20 NxP ch is decisive.
 [ d x c3 ]  [ f5 ] , [ R d1 ]  hoping he would continue with the pawn
 [ Q x e3 ]  [ B d6 ] , [ c3 ]  Simply defending the hanging pawn
 [ d4 ]  [ b5 ]  [ a x b5 ]  [ Q x b5 ] , [ B x a3 ]  first calcul problem first paw lost
 [ B x f6 ]  [ g x f6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ B b4 ]  The standard answer with the surprising intention to take the N then e5...
 [ Q x g4 ] , [ f5 ]  Blocks the b1[ h7 ] diagonal for my lsb which could have caused some problems for black
 [ N d5 ]  [ B x d5 ]  [ Q x d5 ]  [ Q x a4 ] , [ Q c5 ]  the wrong plan...
 [ N c4 ]  [ N x c4 ] , [ Q x c4 ]  Black may not be able to castle for the moment but his king is safe.
 [ R f7 ]  [ N h5 ]  [ Q e7 ]  [ N g3 ]  [ R h7 ]  [ R f2 ]  [ K f7 ] , [ N x f5 ]  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i win a pawn!! if he takes i take
 [ R e5 ] , [ B x f7 + ]  At this point white has his eyes on gaining a rook. The rook that is about to be pinned.
 [ K g4 ] , [ R x e4 ]  He resigned.
 [ B x c6 ]  [ R b8 ]  [ B g2 ]  [ Q a5 ]  [ a3 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ R b1 ]  [ B a4 ]  [ b3 ] , [ Q b5 ]  Winning back the gambit pawn.
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ d3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B d2 ]  [ d6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ h3 ]  [ B h5 ]  [ g4 ]  [ B g6 ]  [ N h4 ]  [ e5 ] , [ N x g6 ]  White doubles up black's pawns.
 [ a5 ]  [ N x e6 + ] , [ f x e6 ]  Here I thought It s time to be materialistic. So I went for his pawns.
 [ a3 ] , [ R a d8 ]  Seizing the half-open d-file.
 [ N f2 + ]  [ K g1 ] , [ N d3 ]  Attacking his queen.
 [ N x f5 ]  [ B c8 ]  [ N e3 ]  [ f x e5 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ R e6 ]  [ N g4 ]  [ R g6 ]  [ R a d1 ]  [ R f g8 ] , [ N f6 + ]  A decent play here on my part wins me a rook. And here is where I just assume I have the game eventually. I have found that at times when I am playing "better" I rarely consider any game as had.
 [ N g5 ] , [ N d4 ]  Might as well scare the Queen.
 [ R d5 ]  [ f6 ]  [ R d1 ] , [ g7 ]  And there it is. After Deep Blue's next move Kasparov will either play 46. f7...[ R d8 ] 47. g8=Queen or he will just settle for a rook advantage by playing 46. g8...[ R x g8 ] 47. Rxg8. He most likely would have taken the Queen and won the game anyway. Deep Blue realizes it has no hope of winning this game and resigns. What a great game and a great stradegy by Kasparov. Holding back and not making any mistakes whatsoever. If you liked this classic battle between Deep Blue and Garry Kasparov I will guarantee you that you will love the ones to come.
 [ R e1 ]  [ N c7 ] , [ N g5 ]  I'm piling up on the pawn but I can't really take it as we'll see.
 [ N x d5 ] , [ Q e5 ]  Now I am trying to figure out a way to get something back but it will not work.
 [ B d7 ]  [ B e2 ] , [ g6 ]  ? [ N c6 ] is better by far
 [ K e7 ]  [ e x f6 + ]  [ N x f6 ]  [ N g6 + ]  [ h x g6 ]  [ Q x h8 ] , [ K f7 ]  The last few moves have all been pretty much forced. Now white must decide how to proceed. He has a rook for knight and pawn he has displaced the black king and created structural weaknesses in the enemy position. On the negative side black has mobile central pawns one of which is passed and he will be able to develop more harmoniously in the short term. This position is wonderfully imbalanced unclear and dynamic with chances for both sides. Just how I like them!
 [ B h4 ] , [ R e b8 ]  ! a cunning defence the exclaim is not for the actual strength of the move but for the chances it creates the simple [ K h8 ] was stronger but this move gives black fighting chances instead of settling for a position where white has all the play
 [ c x d4 ] , [ Q x d4 ]  Surprise! Here this is actually good. In fact the GK database shows White with a high winning percentage at this point even with best Black play. My opponent seemed unprepared for this.
 [ R x b2 ]  [ Q x e5 + ]  [ K d3 ] , [ Q x b2 ]  and then he tips his king
 [ e3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ O-O ] , [ O-O ]  both sides castling
 [ B x g5 ]  [ Q c7 ] , [ B x h6 ]  ! Therefore I decided to take advantage of my gained tempo. In other words I decided to use my extra move so that I can capture his knight. This way I am exchanging his knight for my DSB after he plays 7...Bxh6. Note: this is a closed position so a knight is worth more then a bishop in this context.
 [ d4 ] , [ N f6 ]  Black could instead play 4...[ e4 ] but 5.f3! inducing 5...[ e x f3 ] 6.[ N x f3 ] is very good for White.
 [ h2 ]  [ K b6 ] , [ h1 = Q ]  52. ...... h1/Q - .... but on the h column there's a big black Queen!
 [ N x e3 ]  [ f x e3 ] , [ R e7 ]  And I do it here because no matter how you slice it the computer will also win my e pawn. Plus I'm too far down to continue that I felt that now was the time to throw in the towel.
 [ Q x f3 ] , [ f6 ]  Protecting the f-pawn but it immobilizes the queen and weakens the kingside pawn structure with holes now at [ g6 ] [ f5 ] and h5. Black is therefore weak on the light squares on his kingside and White need not fear a kingside attack so he continues queenside operations...
 [ Q d3 ]  [ O-O ] , [ R f d1 ]  Now back surrendered saying "I must be blind" The strange thing is he still can play Rd5. Then we could have 24.[ Q x a6 ] Bb5; 25 Rxd5; Qxd5; 26.[ Q x b6 ] whcih threatens Nf6+; Probably black has to accept losing a pawn but that should be the worst of it
 [ K a5 ]  [ b4 + ]  [ K b6 ]  [ N x e6 + ]  [ B c5 ]  [ B x c5 + ]  [ K a6 ] , [ N x c7 # ]  Hopefully this gives a peek into how difficult this game can be.
 [ f4 ]  [ Q d2 ] , [ f x g3 ]  Black is attacking on the King side. The pawn opens the f file.
 [ h5 ]  [ B f7 ] , [ K b1 ]  To prevent black's next move from being a problem such as the checkmate example as shown above Joe played this.
 [ h3 + ]  [ K h4 ]  [ g3 + ]  [ K x h3 ] , [ R h5 + ]  One final sack to finish the game.
 [ e5 ] , [ N e2 ]  And so the 2nd black missile is fired; Knight to [ e2 ] as expected
 [ c x d4 ]  [ c x d4 ] , [ d5 ]  The text move and [ N f6 ] are the only ways Black can keep equality. Other less agressive moves will leave me with a small advantage due to my strong centre.
 [ Q e7 ] , [ N d5 ]  Chasing my lady early.
 [ B x c6 ] , [ d x e5 ]  Winning a piece.
 [ B x e3 ]  [ B x e3 ]  [ R x e3 ]  [ R x e3 ] , [ N x e3 ]  I have no idea why I went through with all those trades. What a disaster! As you can I'm dead. I resign. Actually I didn't resign. I played it out but I can't bear to put the rest of the game down as it's really difficult copying yahoo's chess notation onto the board.
 [ R e8 ] , [ K c2 ]  47. [ K c2 ] - I have a vague plan of getting Henry towards the kingside to bolster my [ e5 ] passer. My queenside [ b2 ] passer will be used to tie black down as much as possible.
 [ N x d5 ]  [ Q x e4 + ]  [ B e3 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ N c7 + ] , [ K e7 ]  !!! [ K e7 ] saves your position where [ K f8 ] loses immediately.
 [ N c3 ] , [ c5 ]  This is the start of the Modern Benoni. Black invites white to create a central wedge after d5. In return black can get some dangerous counter play on the queen side. The pawn structure that results is very dynamic. Black aims for b5-[ b4 ] break and White aims for e4-e5. The Modern Benoni was achieved in the 2008 WCh in mexico city. see this link for the game: http://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2007/09/25/result070925.xml
 [ K d4 ] , [ R f3 ]  f pawn protected but the black rook is less mobile.
 [ O-O-O ] , [ N b d7 ]  [ b5 ] is also playable here but i like to complete development before I start attacking. So far this is still main line now both sides will pawnstorm toward the others king and then it's a matter of whose attack is completed first. Black's attack looks more promising since Black gets 2 tempo moves ([ b4 ] and a4) while White only gets 1 tempo move (g5) and the space is already clear for Black's major pieces to dominate the queenside files while it will take White a little more time to coordinate his pieces on the kingside.
 [ B x h6 ]  [ Q f3 ]  [ O-O ] , [ B c4 ]  Exploiting the weakness of the [ f7 ] square.
 [ N c6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ d3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ N h3 ]  [ h6 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ O-O ]  [ e5 ]  [ N d5 ] , [ N b5 ]  In my opinion it would have been much better for my opponent to take on d5. It appears he didn't have a plan since he had pretty much forced my knight to move to [ d5 ] after playing e5.
 [ e5 ]  [ c5 ]  [ a3 ]  [ B x c3 + ]  [ b x c3 ] , [ N e7 ]  Mainline moves for the Winawer variation. I follow it up with [ N f3 ] which allows me a few options for attack which include a kingside assault with the h-pawn [ d x c5 ] to open up the bishops for attack to secure [ a4 ] or a4-[ B a3 ] to secure the queenside.
 [ Q a3 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ g x f6 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ h5 ]  [ O-O ] , [ N c6 ]  I do not understand why Black has not yet played [ Q b4 ] to effectively escape.
 [ d x e4 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ N x e4 ] , [ B x f8 ]  Better was [ B x e4 ]  [ N x c3 ]  [ Q c1 ]  [ N x a2 ]  [ R x a2 ] , [ Q x f8 ]  Now material is even however black has a few things in his favour. The weak [ b2 ] pawn two bishops and a safe king
 [ R d2 ]  [ Q f4 ] , [ R d b2 ]  my rooks now doubled up.
 [ Q h4 ]  [ Q x h4 ]  [ N x h4 ] , [ N x d5 ]  The queen escaped. I kind of had my eye on the pawn.
 [ e3 ] , [ a6 ]  Unnecessary. Better to continue with your development.
 [ Q d8 ]  [ R f e1 ]  [ f6 ]  [ N g4 ] , [ R g6 ]  Passive but not so easy to dislodge.
 [ R f3 ] , [ R f7 x f3 ]  White moves rook to [ f3 ] in order to avoid black's DB and knight but this suits black who moves rook up to take white rook at f3.
 [ Q f6 ]  [ N x f8 ] , [ R x f8 ]  I take back the Knight with my rook.
 [ Q c6 + ] , [ K f8 ]  better than [ K d8 ] were white could have tried some repetition of moves
 [ R d8 ] , [ O-O ]  white has the bishop pair control of the center and queenside the game is far form preordained but objectively white looks to stand better at this point.
 [ K d5 ] , [ B a1 + ]  Opting to move my bishop as far away as possible from the enemy king. Let's say I put my bishop on [ b2 ] instead then things can get fishy if he gets his king on b3. [ B g7 ] was also a possibility. ( Note that [ B [ f6 ] ] isn't a possibility since my queen will go to the [ f6 ] square somewhere in the future. ) At this point of the game I have about 9 minutes left to figure out a winning variation.
 [ Q c5 + ]  [ Q x c5 ]  [ R x c5 ] , [ R d3 d4 ]  34. [ R d4 ] - defending his isolani but I will not take no for an answer here!
 [ N g6 ]  [ Q x g6 + ] , [ K e7 ]  OK!
 [ d4 ] , [ d6 ]  Threatening an [ e5 ] boost.
 [ R a b1 ]  [ N d3 ]  [ N e4 ] , [ N e5 ]  ?
 [ K d3 ] , [ b6 ]  ...but let's secure this first. It was a mistake actually. I can afforg [ c5 ] by white.
 [ R b8 ]  [ g5 ]  [ h5 ]  [ f4 ]  [ g6 ] , [ K d2 ]  He is so locked in that I feel safe enough to bring my king into the game.
 [ Q x e3 + ]  [ B x e3 ] , [ N g4 ]  ...and now this is nastier than it seems. It threats to double white's central pawns (they are weak because black has the two bishops and the semi open column in front of them.
 [ b3 ] , [ N g4 ]  
 [ c6 ] , [ N c3 ]  This is a very common reply. And of course I also stick to the mainline by continuing with my development.
 [ N c3 ]  [ R h8 + ]  [ K g7 ]  [ R h7 + ]  [ K g8 ] , [ R h x f7 ]  The rest is easy.
 [ R d2 ] , [ N b4 ]  I just won my other game against this player and I'm looking at our match. There are only two of us playing and vrw[ c1 ] is amazingly far ahead in one of his games. This is a tight game that could go easily either way and looks drawish to me if no one makes any mistakes. So I decided to offer the draw that looks like it guarantees at least a 2.5-1.5 victory against one of the top teams. That'll move us up the ladder.
 [ e5 ]  [ f4 ]  [ e x f4 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ B b4 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ] , [ e5 ]  White decides to go for the attack.
 [ K d7 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ] , [ d x e5 ]  12. [ d x e5 ] - white has a strong passer on e5!
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ b3 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ B b2 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ e3 ]  [ c5 ]  [ B d3 ] , [ N e4 ]  The [ B f5 ] setup that my opponent uses turns out to be pretty effective.
 [ c x b6 ]  [ B x b6 ]  [ R d7 ]  [ R a8 + ]  [ B b8 ] , [ B d4 ]  Now I'll be able to play Rc3! You know you're in trouble when all of the pawns in front of your king disappear and your pieces are on the other side of the board.
 [ K e1 ]  [ Q b1 + ] , [ K f2 ]  Considered playing either [ R c1 ] or [ Q c1 ] but the next move would probably be [ Q x e4 + ] so I wanted to preserve my threat and make the capture of the e pawn a losing move.
 [ N h3 ] , [ g6 ]  This reply was not what I expected and it seemed to me that my opponent would then play [ N g5 ] to put pressure on the [ f7 ] pawn. I decided to break this pressure by trapping the queen forcing her capture during the next turn. I saw the response 5.[ Q g5 ] which I thought to be safe for the white queen...
 [ f3 ]  [ B h5 ]  [ e x f6 ] , [ Q x f6 ]  Ok but now how to go on? My K is nearly weak... it's still possible some trick.
 [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ d5 ] , [ b5 ]  And there we are: the Benko Gambit. In the main line which we will see in this game Black gives up a pawn for nice open lines on the queenside and pressure on the weak White pawns. This game at least the first part will be instructive to see themes occurring often in the Benko Gambit.
 [ B e5 ]  [ K g7 ]  [ d6 ]  [ K g6 ] , [ e7 ]  36. [ e7 ] This Pawn roller is just gruesome to watch in action. Its carnage is equivalent to the Terminator.
 [ Q g4 + ]  [ Q x g4 ] , [ N x g4 ]  Lets try that on this side.....
 [ R f6 ] , [ B f1 ]  "Un-dangle" my bishop while at the same time preparing to move it up to [ g2 ] to tentatively serve as a pawn. My opponent seemed to be gunning for 33. ... [ R g6 + ] 34. [ K f1 ] [ Q c1 + ] 35. [ Q d1 ] [ Q x d1 + ] 36. [ B x d1 ] [ R x c6 ] and costing me my pass pawn while setting his own up for possible promotion.
 [ a6 ]  [ R a2 ]  [ R c6 ]  [ K f7 ] , [ K f4 ]  Theoretical draw it would appear.
 [ Q x g5 ]  [ h x g5 ] , [ N a2 ]  My knight wants his [ c3 ] square back.
 [ a3 ]  [ B x c3 + ]  [ Q x c3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ e3 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ Q c2 ] , [ N f6 ]  Feint parry.
 [ h x g5 ]  [ c4 ] , [ f6 ]  Now the black bishop cannot get breath in the nearby of my king.
 [ K g4 ]  [ B e6 + ]  [ K h4 ] , [ R h6 + ]  And now white must play 36. [ Q x h6 ] to avoid mate.
 [ B d6 ] , [ e5 ]  Pushes forward and forks the black queen and bishop.
 [ K b6 ]  [ R a8 ]  [ f x g3 ]  [ h x g3 ] , [ K b7 ]  ...[ R x d3 ] is strong.
 [ B d6 ] , [ N h3 ]  can't remember why i did this but it looks good right? I think i saw this in a book and decided to give it a go....
 [ N x f3 + ]  [ g x f3 ]  [ R x f3 ] , [ R f6 ]  Makes doubled-rook defense of [ f5 ] possible. Once the King has moved it also brings a doubled-rook threat to [ d3 ] into play. 31. .. [ R d4 + ] seemed merely to give White the opportunity for [ K a5 ] requiring the [ a6 ] pawn to be constantly guarded and factored into any exchange at f5. 31. .. [ K g4 ] may be superior.
 [ K h7 ]  [ Q f4 ]  [ Q e7 ] , [ Q h4 ]  The game is up - I'm just hoping for an error that allows some counterplay since [ e3 ] and the Rook on [ d1 ] are undefended.
 [ N e7 ]  [ e3 ]  [ N g6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ N e2 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ c6 ]  [ b3 ] , [ d5 ]  Anticipating a Knight move I needed to boss the center. [ d5 ] destroys any thoughts of [ B e4 ] and dominates c4.
 [ R e3 + ] , [ K h2 ]  ahahaha. I'm a li'l strong in the endgame. Victory is so close...
 [ N g e7 ]  [ N b5 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N d6 ] , [ N f5 ]  A forward Knight is a fearsome beast. Wreaking havoc.
 [ B f2 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B h4 ]  [ N e4 ] , [ B e1 ]  50. [ B e1 ] - I expected [ B d8 ] leading to a queenside pawn trade.
 [ B x c4 ]  [ e5 ] , [ d x e5 ]  [ Q c2 ] was another option..
 [ N x e4 ]  [ B x a3 ]  [ b x a3 ] , [ B x a2 ]  Black has managed to saddle white with an isolated pawn. Not exactly a winning advantage yet.
 [ Q f5 ]  [ B h3 ]  [ h5 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ f6 ]  [ e4 ]  [ d x e4 ] , [ N h4 ]  ok. have you ever had one of those moments where you stop and think "How the HECK did that happen?!"
 [ R x g5 + ] , [ B x g5 + ]  gettin greedy and having Rook for Bish too..
 [ R b7 ] , [ a5 ]  Now the [ a6 ] pawn is pretty much out of the game but White can't ever advance ground on [ b5 ] without more help and without the White King it's just not going to happen.
 [ B x h4 + ] , [ K d2 ]  11. [ K d2 ] - now the WK is exposed!
 [ g x f4 ] , [ R x f4 ]  Joe: My only options are [ N d2 ] to avoid getting my N pinned or losing the N. Actually the pin is needed as otherwise I lose my Queen after Qg4+. I feel that walking into it is the only way to avoid further loss of material. Ken: [ [ f3 ] ] is playable as is [ N g3 ] Joe: Which one is better? Ken: [ [ f3 ] ] is very slightly better but both positions are difficult
 [ Q x a5 + ]  [ N d2 ]  [ B b4 ] , [ Q c1 ]  A blunder indeed. All it did was waste a move and make way for mate. Probably best for white is Rb2.
 [ a5 ]  [ R h d1 ]  [ Q e7 ]  [ B b2 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ B a3 ] , [ c5 ]  At this point or somewhere around this point I offered a draw believing that both of us had no chances to move forward with any advantage. Obviously my opponent refused the draw offer.
 [ N f6 ] , [ c4 ]  He protects it and opens a way for his queen to move out.
 [ K c7 ]  [ R b3 ] , [ R h2 + ]  70 ... [ c5 ] is again possible here.
 [ R c1 ]  [ N e4 ] , [ Q e2 ]  Maybe q[ d3 ] was better. This move lets me pressure [ g7 ] however.
 [ B e7 ]  [ N b d2 ] , [ c5 ]  Now my position starts to get cramped leaving the control over the board and the initative to black. A possible way to continue would be to fianchetto the second bishop ot build up bigger pressure on the center.
 [ N d3 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ B d4 ]  [ f6 ] , [ B g4 ]  23. [ B g4 ] - putting pressure on [ e6 ] but Henry now goes to its aid.
 [ K x h7 ] , [ N h4 ]  Now the threat is [ Q d6 ] (MY nemesis! :-).
 [ B g3 ] , [ h5 ]  ! I give this move an exclamation point simply because I am jealous of the calculating ability of Steinitz. By making it black is willing to sacrifice his g pawn in exchange for the chance to further harrass white's dark squared bishop.
 [ B x b3 ]  [ d x c6 ]  [ Q x c6 ]  [ c x b3 ] , [ B c5 ]  I was outraged. How could I have missed such a simple tactic?
 [ c5 ]  [ c3 ] , [ c4 ]  ?! relieving the tension to early. prehaps motivated by the desire to trade off his 'bad' bishop but here it is developed outside the pawn chain so is not as bad as it normally is in a french type setup
 [ B x d6 ]  [ R x d6 + ] , [ Q x d6 ]  My opponent resigns. If he takes the cook I get checkmate on [ d1 ] and he doesn't want to play down a rook apparently.
 [ Q h5 ]  [ K g7 ]  [ Q h7 + ]  [ K f6 ]  [ N g4 + ]  [ K f5 ] , [ g7 + ]  And my opponent resigned. Comments and questions are most welcome.
 [ e5 ] , [ N f3 ]  The point of the early [ f5 ] being I want to strike in the center and put pressure on the [ e5 ] point black will tend to try to undermine the [ e4 ] point and control the [ d5 ] square.
 [ B g3 ] , [ Q b6 ]  The mainline of this gambit system for Black.
 [ B d7 ] , [ d4 ]  ?? I decide that now is the time to exchange pawns. Of course I don't exchange pieces just because it's possible but my attitude is a little different with pawns. Once I'm ready to I exchange pawns. But I forgot what Ken said. Earlier Kenneth_fiore_3 said that when it comes to not exchanging so readily he was specifically alluding to pieces and not pawns which is when I first discovered that Coach Stockel isn't always right. However Ken later advised about not exchanging pawns so early in the exact same comment in one of my annotations. Well this is when common sense knocked into me and I treat pawns more like pieces when it comes to exchanging although now was the time to do it but differently. I'm extremely picky about when to exchange pieces but nowadays I don't exchange pawns unless I feel that there's at least a somewhat valid reason like breaking through in the center. Having said that this was not the time to exchange as now Stanley will break through in the center since this is a center pawn. I mentioned that I'm forced so best was 11.[ f4 ] and if black is to attack my [ N g5 ] later on I would be able to retreat on f3.
 [ e4 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ N x e4 ] , [ b6 ]  Opening the better line for the lsb. Now I have to be careful. I can play [ B g2 ] myself and [ R g1 ] but I wanted "more" from the position and I bet I could handle the pressure. I was wrong.
 [ e x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ] , [ N x f7 ]  An attacking move. After 6. [ K x f7 ] 7. [ Q f3 + ] threatening knight on d5.
 [ B g2 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N x c6 ]  [ d x c6 ]  [ a3 ] , [ B d6 ]  10. ...[ B x c3 ] just gives white two strong bishops for nothing really
 [ N d2 ]  [ B f5 ] , [ Q b3 ]  Now I can start to build up a lot of pressure on the Queenside.
 [ N f6 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ B g4 ]  I just love these pins. They are so effective at preventing my opponent from attacking! It is highly unlikely now that white can do anything more with those pawns as white risks shattering his pawn structure. Anyhow my development is complete before white's!
 [ B g5 ] , [ N d7 ]  Now the second N reinforces the defence of f6. It's a pity Black has lost his Q as his pawns look solid but draughty. White can have a party on the black squares.
 [ R x e7 + ]  [ K c6 ]  [ R x c7 + ]  [ K b6 ]  [ R x b7 + ] , [ K c6 ]  This move loses immediately but after 20...[ K a6 ] 21. [ N x b5 ] would decide things quickly
 [ K c2 ]  [ Q f2 + ] , [ K b3 ]  Now the King is out in the open wanting to kill himself. The problem now is getting to him.
 [ B h6 + ]  [ K g8 ] , [ R e7 ]  ! Paralyzing Black and stopping any counterplay with ...Qh4+. The rook is immune because 20...[ Q x e7 ] 21.[ Q x b8 + ] forces mate.
 [ Q h5 + ]  [ K g8 ]  [ R h g1 ] , [ B e3 ]  Protecting h6...
 [ B e2 ]  [ B d4 ] , [ g8 = Q ]  17. [ R f1 ] would have been much better. After 17...[ B x g7 ] 18. [ R x f7 ] [ R e7 ] white has an advantage.
 [ R d7 ] , [ K f6 ]  Avoiding the draw and the check and keeping the White rook off f7.
 [ b x c5 ] , [ B x c5 ]  Neither side can really win this. Black might have a small edge due to his better piece coordination but certainly not enough to create serious winning chances.
 [ b5 ] , [ h x g6 ]  so now i opened up the h-file
 [ B d3 ]  [ O-O ] , [ N b d2 ]  This move serves two purposes: White is considering castling queenside and this Knight wants is now poised to leap to [ c4 ] once ...[ [ d5 ] ] is no longer a threat. Of course Black may simply play 17...[ [ d5 ] ] immediately and he should. White probably would have been better off playing the awkward-looking 17.[ R a2 ] to get out of the pin on the e-pawn.
 [ Q x e1 + ]  [ R x e1 ]  [ B b7 ] , [ N x c7 ]  Now black has one extra pawn.
 [ e4 ]  [ a6 ] , [ d4 ]  Might as well take the center if he's going to start that way...
 [ N x e4 ] , [ Q x c2 ]  This positing consumed most of my scarce time. I had the feeling that controling the a1-[ h8 ] with the queen would be vital but did not see how to gain it yet.
 [ N c6 ]  [ N x c6 ]  [ b x c6 ] , [ B x c6 + ]  Ahh one of my favorite forks.
 [ B f4 ]  [ B d6 ] , [ e3 ]  not bad at all if black takes white takes and gets the e file.
 [ N e7 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ R d8 ]  [ N c5 ] , [ B c8 ]  and now the knight is fixed !
 [ N e4 ]  [ Q e1 ]  [ N x g3 ]  [ Q x g3 ] , [ R g7 ]  I moved my rook there so [ c5 ] would be an option and I could break his stonewall
 [ N b6 ] , [ Q b7 ]  The computer prefers to play 25. ... [ Q c3 ] threateing a queen trade with a dangerous passed pawn being shepherded through by the bishops or else using the bishops to pick up the loose queenside pawns. I think of this option as more conservative.
 [ N x d5 ]  [ N d x e5 ]  [ c4 ]  [ B g5 ] , [ N c5 ]  Hard to believe but this outwardly active move appears as an origin of a transition of the game initiative to black. Better 16. Qc1! As was proved in a theoretical part.
 [ K e7 ] , [ B x d6 + ]  16. ... [ K e7 ] was a mistake that costs black even more material. In fact it allows white to equalize numerically though in reality the advantage of three pieces to two may still favor white slightly.
 [ B x c4 ]  [ d x c4 ]  [ c5 ] , [ Q d3 ]  So my idea of a good time is connecting the Rooks. And that is the sole reason for playing this move as nothing else comes into consideration here. Part of it is the time crunch and it's worth noting that I've got 13 minutes now.
 [ g x f4 ] , [ Q g4 ]  being down 4 points with only hope for attacking lines I post up my Queen at the focal point of attack.
 [ e3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N e2 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ g3 ] , [ e6 ]  White's approach is unusual to say the least: Black is just expecting and preparing for d2-d4...
 [ b5 ] , [ b4 ]  This was a strange move - it was made because I pressed Submit when I meant to press Reset. The move I wanted to play was a4.
 [ f x e5 ]  [ N x e5 ] , [ N f6 ]  Forcing white to make the exchange or keep it's DSB and queen overloaded
 [ K f6 ] , [ K e8 ]  But it wasn't working
 [ R c2 ]  [ B x b2 ]  [ R x b2 ] , [ Q d3 + ]  The queen dominates the rooks while the pawn is close to promotion so it's pretty much over now. If [ K a2 ] then [ Q d5 ] forks. If [ K c1 ] then [ [ e2 ] ] and the king is badly placed it stops the rooks from defending the promotion square and allows the [ Q c3 ] tempo idea controlling the promotiong square not to mention the king is more exposed to rook forks. [ R c2 ] is also bad because of [ Q e4 ] threatening the rook and there's the [ Q b4 ] idea that threatens the promotion square with tempo so after [ [ e2 ] ] White really can't stop the promotion tactic or he'll lose a rook.
 [ N c3 ] , [ B g4 ]  Black goes with the Chigorin Defense. I didn't know that during the game--I learned this after the game.
 [ e5 ] , [ d5 ]  ?? However Perry made a terrible mistake here. In fact I call it a blunder. I'm not sure why he played this. Perhaps he was focused on stopping my e pawn from advancing. What he doesn't realize is that I can advance and exchange it with 4...[ e x d6 ] e.p. But I was not going to capture en-pessant because I have something better. At the very least I can win a piece for a pawn with my next move.
 [ B c4 + ]  [ R f7 ]  [ B x f7 + ]  [ K f8 ] , [ B x g7 + ]  
 [ h4 ]  [ f6 ]  [ h x g5 ] , [ h x g5 ]  Again looking at two pawns and which to take with giving yourself an avenue to stack some rooks on the h file is always a good idea.
 [ Q x c3 + ]  [ R d2 ] , [ Q x d2 # ]  Thanks for viewing my game. Comments and analysis are very welcome
 [ R x c7 + ] , [ c3 ]  Now one would think that 34.[ K e3 ] was better but I would've pinned his N with 34...[ Q a3 ] followed by 35...[ R c3 ] which would've won the N and there would've been no way out. So as noted there are no good moves left.
 [ R d c1 ] , [ B x e5 ]  preparing to reroute the LSB to c5.
 [ f6 ]  [ O-O ] , [ N d7 ]  In this position I thought it better to go ahead and take f6; surely he would take [ f3 ] with the black bishop soon and I wanted to keep things a bit tied up in the center rather than the open positions that would otherwise likely result.
 [ Q e5 ]  [ R h5 ]  [ Q f4 ] , [ R h8 + ]  Thank you.
 [ B x c4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ O-O ] , [ Q h5 ]  Black wants to try attacking on the other side. I personally would have preferred keeping the queen where it was and developing more pieces - as you can see Black has developed absolutely no minor pieces.
 [ Q b3 ] , [ b x a6 ]  White is lost in more ways than I can count. I really cant see any way for white to get out of trouble. The best I can do is Nd2. Something like 13. [ N d2 ] Nd3ch 14. [ K c2 ] Qf5ch 15. [ e4 ] Bxe4ch Mayhem.
 [ h3 ]  [ f5 ]  [ K d2 ]  [ a6 ]  [ K c2 ]  [ g5 ]  [ K b3 ]  [ B g1 ]  [ f x g5 ]  [ h x g5 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ d4 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ B f2 ]  [ K c2 ]  [ g4 ]  [ h x g4 ]  [ f x g4 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ B x g3 ]  [ N x g4 ]  [ K c6 ]  [ K d3 ] , [ K d5 ]  pretty locked position
 [ N x e4 ] , [ d x e4 ]  white apparently deems this acceptable.
 [ B x d7 + ] , [ N e x d7 ]  I didn't like my undefended knight sitting on e5. That square has already been bad luck for undefended pieces (well for a pawn anyway). My knight on [ e5 ] is just one good move by white's [ d3 ] bishop away from ignoble death.
 [ N f6 ] , [ B e2 ]  Offering a trick if 4. [ N x e4 ] 5. [ Q a4 ] winning the knight.
 [ R e4 ] , [ R b7 ]  I will revenge on this pawn and I will win with the a pawn.
 [ e3 ] , [ d6 ]  At the time I considered this play to be a little slow. Upon analysis though black now has the real threat of playing a very strong c5!
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ h6 ] , [ B h4 ]  I believed white would have trade : 4. [ B f6 ]  [ g5 ]  [ B g3 ] , [ N h5 ]  Black can take white's DSB whenether he wants weakening the white king.
 [ g6 ] , [ Q f6 ]  ????
 [ Q d3 + ]  [ K g7 ]  [ Q g3 + ] , [ Q g5 ]  Interposing here is not possible if the Q is on b6. Now White's Q is pinned due to the threat of Qxg2#.
 [ B b4 ]  [ R d1 ]  [ Q x a2 ] , [ B f6 + ]  I hoped that Henry would head Queenside.
 [ Q g3 + ]  [ K f7 ] , [ Q x e5 ]  if i take out his pawns he cant hope to win.
 [ a6 ]  [ N d5 ] , [ c6 ]  attacking my Knight...
 [ f5 ]  [ Q a4 ]  [ Q f6 ] , [ d4 ]  16. [ d4 ] - I play it anyway - Fou Lenoir must have a square to develop to so that I can connect my rooks.
 [ d4 ] , [ e x d4 ]  The pawn at [ d4 ] isn't going anywhere immediately. White will castle and then be free to mingle about.
 [ B x g2 + ]  [ K h2 ] , [ Q h4 ]  Now Black threatens mate at either [ h3 ] or g3. If RxB then Q[ h3 ] [ K g1 ] Qh1mate. . The game was interesting after the sac. of the rook. Blacks pieces where better placed for the attack. In hind sight the luft of the rook was probable too early and subjected it to harassment.
 [ B a4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ O-O ] , [ B e7 ]  The closed variation as opposed to opening the game with Nxe4.
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ a6 ]  [ B a4 ]  [ b5 ]  [ B b3 ]  [ N a5 ]  [ c3 ] , [ Q f6 ]  I don't like this early Q move which just provides White with a target and threatens little at this stage. It would be better to conclude the harrassment of the WSB by swapping the N for it.
 [ B d4 + ]  [ K h2 ] , [ e5 ]  So that pawn is safe. All white's pawns are invisible to black's black bishop.
 [ O-O ] , [ d4 ]  I start claiming territory.
 [ N f6 ]  [ K d4 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ b4 ]  [ N f4 ]  [ B f8 ]  [ h5 ] , [ K c5 ]  41. [ K c5 ] - this king march will win back a pawn for me.
 [ B e7 ] , [ Q x g4 ]  Right.
 [ c4 ]  [ Q g3 ]  [ B x a3 ]  [ R c e1 ]  [ B f8 ]  [ Q h4 ] , [ h6 ]  I don't think this move is good probably ... [ f5 ] would be better
 [ R x c4 ] , [ Q h3 + ]  gaining one tempo.
 [ d4 ] , [ e4 ]  The obvious and strongest response to white's bid towards the center. Black closes the center and continues to gain space.
 [ K d2 ]  [ f5 ]  [ e x f5 ] , [ B x f5 ]  More space developing...
 [ h6 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ N x c3 ] , [ Q d2 ]  Yes of course black knight gets tied. It is not fatal but black now have to play accurately to avoid further problems.
 [ R b7 ] , [ h6 ]  Again when your opponent attacks on the wing counter in the center therefore 20...[ f5 ] is called for here.
 [ B g5 + ]  [ B e7 ]  [ B x e7 + ]  [ K x e7 ] , [ B x b7 ]  Better was Fxf
 [ g x h6 ]  [ B x h6 ] , [ B g5 ]  There is nothing more important for him than to get rid of my dark bishop
 [ K d6 ] , [ b3 ]  The Black P can cruise to the end line; White resigns.
 [ K d7 ]  [ N x e5 + ]  [ K e6 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ N d8 + ]  [ K d7 ] , [ Q g4 + ]  Better was 20.[ N x b7 ] because it is now almost impossible to promote. This however is not the line of blunders.
 [ N d7 ]  [ B x d7 + ] , [ K x d7 ]  13. ........ [ K x d7 ] - I trade off one of my attacked pieces with tempo. Now I remove the rook.
 [ N a5 ] , [ b3 ]  24. [ b3 ] - to prevent Nc5.
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ] , [ N x d4 ]  I have been annotating games for fun but this is an annotation for the learning experience of others. A normal Sicilian opening. I played this because the Sicilian nearly always gives a result.I had planned on playing Najdorf because I like the positions.
 [ B b3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ c4 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ R c1 ] , [ d4 ]  Black creates a passed pawn to match White's while opening the strategically important h1-[ a8 ] diagonal. But the speculative text move is very dangerous because it basically cedes control of the Q-side to White who will get an automatic jumpstart for his attack because he can tempo immediately on the Black Queen with the pawn-push to c5. The position has become razor-sharp.
 [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ g6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ e4 ]  [ d6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B e2 ] , [ N b d7 ]  This is inferior according to BCO2 which dismisses it with 7 0-0 = but it avoids the line Carl wanted to play: 6...[ e5 ] 7. de de 8. [ Q x d8 ] [ R x d8 ] 9 [ B g5 ] when he reckoned 9... [ R e8 ] is best but difficult to find if you do not know the line. I avoided it because I do not like swapping Queens early in the game. 6...[ B g4 ] would have avoided trapping my Bishop in - unless I play vigorously from here on I get a very cramped position.
 [ R f d8 ] , [ N f1 ]  The Knight begins his march.
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N b d2 ] , [ a6 ]  I'd say a weak move but true is that white has a game going on with [ B b5 ] followed by BxN and Ne5.
 [ a3 ]  [ B a5 ]  [ b4 ]  [ B b6 ]  [ h3 ]  [ O-O ] , [ N h2 ]  wants f4? white has agreat space to move in. maybe [ N d5 ] was better.
 [ K f2 ]  [ a5 ] , [ B c5 ]  I didn't want 26.Bxa5? [ R a8 ] 27.[ B b4 ] [ R x a2 + ] winning a pawn and creating 2 passed pawns on the queenside.
 [ R x a3 ]  [ b x a3 ]  [ B x c3 ] , [ N c4 ]  I give up the knight to prevent the mate on b2.
 [ N d4 ] , [ Q d3 ]  There's going to be some tactics floating down the d-file but the Queen had to move somewhere and this seemed the most reasonable albeit temporary post.
 [ Q e5 ] , [ N c3 ]  [ N c3 ] threatening 17.[ N d5 ] [ K e6 ] 18. [ Q e8 ] [ B e7 ] 19. [ Q x e7 # ] unless black wants to give up his queen.
 [ B x e2 + ]  [ K x e2 ] , [ B b6 ]  In retrospect I should have moved to [ g1 ] instead to eat white's h and g pawns. However we can't make the right moves all of the time.
 [ N f6 ] , [ h3 ]  demanding a declaration from Bg4...
 [ Q f1 + ]  [ K g4 ]  [ K e2 ]  [ K h3 ]  [ Q h1 + ]  [ K g4 ]  [ K f2 ]  [ K f4 ] , [ Q h2 ]  Rook pinned [ K f2 ] is there and the game that should have been over long time ago finally finished the way it was supposed to after the early Q fall. However never would I have thought I would have had to fight for it like this. For all intents and purposes this was a draw game. It took only my relentless analysis and end game maneuvering to get the win. Hats off to cw40832! Thanks for giving me hell even after you lost the Q. I learned a lot in this match about the early development and positional advantage. I also learned (AGAIN) to not give up early and consider every option before resigning or accepting a draw.
 [ e6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N f6 ] , [ R e1 ]  Still following the DB. Black threatened white's king pawn and white defends it with a rook.
 [ Q x c5 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ e6 ]  a bit uncautious considering Whites' next plan of action; better is [ Q c6 ] [ N b d2 ] e6...
 [ R h1 ] , [ g5 ]  marching on up
 [ Q x c3 + ]  [ K f1 ]  [ Q d3 + ] , [ K e1 ]  Not strictly necessary but when in INCREMENTAL blitz games it never hurts to get more time especially when one can take a pawn in doing so.
 [ d5 ]  [ c4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ c x d5 ] , [ Q x d5 ]  7. ..... [ Q x d5 ] - the Wicked Witch of the West is well centralised here and not very easy to drive away.
 [ e6 ]  [ b3 ]  [ B x a3 ]  [ B x a3 ] , [ Q x e2 ]  Allowing white to activate his queen with [ Q e4 ] would be a mistake.
 [ b x a4 ]  [ R x b1 + ]  [ K h2 ]  [ R a1 ]  [ R c4 ]  [ K e7 ]  [ f4 ]  [ R a3 ]  [ h4 ]  [ h5 ]  [ g3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ R c7 + ]  [ K f6 ]  [ R a7 ]  [ e5 ]  [ f x e5 + ]  [ K x e5 ]  [ a5 ]  [ f6 ]  [ R g7 ]  [ K f5 ]  [ R a7 ]  [ K g4 ] , [ R a6 ]  Great mistake. But my position is difficult anyway. His rook is active mine is defending my pawn. I didn't "see" it planning the final strategy.
 [ Q e6 ] , [ O-O ]  Now White is clearly better.
 [ h4 ]  [ b6 ]  [ h5 ]  [ N f8 ]  [ B a3 ]  [ c5 ]  [ B c1 ] , [ g6 ]  at this point my opponents points rose above mine and I realised I could not win as my knight was trapped so i was happy to offer a draw
 [ K d6 ]  [ K x e4 ]  [ K c5 ] , [ K e5 ]  i allowed black king to eat my pawn to promote quickly.
 [ N e5 ]  [ B x h4 ] , [ N a6 + ]  but White wins [ b4 ] in exchange for [ h4 ]  [ g3 ] , [ N c2 ]  I was expecting [ K e2 ] stopping [ B f2 ]  [ g1 = Q ]  [ N x g1 ] , [ B x g1 ]  as long as I don't allow White to win the pawn for free I should win. I am aiming to force White to trade the knight for the pawn and then mate with bishop and knight
 [ N x c6 ] , [ B x f2 + ]  This is going to hurt. That is twice I ignored the bishop.
 [ R e1 ]  [ N c2 ] , [ R e5 ]  Figuring that the [ B f5 ] was attacked but I forgot about black's Rf7. Nontheless the computer moves the B anyhow.
 [ N c6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ f5 ]  [ e x f6 ]  [ e ]  [ p ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ B x f6 ] , [ Q x f6 ]  13. …… [ Q x f6 ] - after this plethora of exchanges I have got rid of my weakie on e5. Julio does have a pawn centre which at first sight looks strong. However there is a backward pawn on e6. Can this be exploited? Well bringing material to attack it at the moment is a long way off.
 [ Q f5 ]  [ B g6 ]  [ Q f2 ] , [ N f6 ]  catching up in development
 [ e5 ]  [ N c2 ]  [ B d6 ] , [ f4 ]  Nice move. If I get a couple moves to consolidate then I would be in a great position. It's important to keep black occupied which I think you understood.
 [ K c2 ] , [ R x e4 ]  Why did White not do 38.Ra4?
 [ c4 ] , [ c5 ]  [ d5 ] [ b6 ] and [ B b4 ] are more common
 [ B b3 ] , [ b6 ]  Was now unsure of the opponents plan.
 [ h6 ] , [ Q h4 ]  I was really frightened here. I had to wait resourceless and wait to see what attack line he would chose.
 [ B b2 ]  [ B g7 ] , [ R b1 ]  im not sure about this move.
 [ R b5 ] , [ N d5 ]  Black seems so sure of his superiority... and he has good reasons!
 [ K h1 ]  [ B x e1 ] , [ N x e1 ]  definitely should have taken the bishop with the queen now [ Q f1 ] is mate
 [ g x f6 ] , [ B h6 ]  I love this short little diagonal for the Bishop
 [ N c3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e4 ] , [ d4 ]  Slightly better than other choices.
 [ R h8 + ]  [ K c7 ]  [ R h7 + ]  [ K d8 ]  [ R h8 + ]  [ K e7 ]  [ R h7 + ]  [ K f8 ]  [ R h8 + ] , [ K g7 ]  White has to stay on h to avoid getting mated.
 [ K d8 ]  [ K a6 ]  [ K c8 ] , [ c6 ]  Poor move I do not see Kb8!!!!!! 44 [ K a7 ] Win... I am desilusionated for this move
 [ B g4 ]  [ Q a4 + ]  [ K f8 ] , [ B d3 ]  ?? The losing blunder: Black simply gets too many tempi for white to withstand the souped-up attack that follows. 12. [ c x d4 ] [ e x d4 ] 13. [ K x f2 ] (13. [ B e6 ] [ Q x e6 ] $19) 13... [ N e4 ] 14. [ K g1 ] [ Q h4 ] 15. [ h3 ] [ Q f2 ] 16. [ K h2 ] [ Q g3 ] [ Is all theory and a forced draw.]
 [ K e4 ]  [ Q c4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ K b6 ]  [ K e3 ] , [ K c5 ]  I don't know.......Maybe Queen's moves was better than King's?
 [ N e2 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N x c7 ] , [ Q x c7 ]  connecting the rooks and getting rid of well placed knight for my bad bishop
 [ b5 ] , [ N a7 ]  I push my b pawn to [ b5 ] and attack the knight at [ c6 ] which retreats to a7.
 [ N f6 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B f4 ]  [ N h5 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ Q h4 ] , [ f3 ]  I like this move--it was the first response I considered to black's defense of the knight. But it does put the pawn in the way of QxN.
 [ N x f6 ] , [ N e5 ]  In this position I considered [ B x h6 ] and [ N g6 ] but neither of them looked very promising at the time.
 [ Q g7 ] , [ e7 ]  43. [ e7 ] - will this be the clincher?
 [ O-O ] , [ d6 ]  Still building a sound position.
 [ h4 ] , [ d4 ]  This is an inaccuracy and gives white a lot of play. Black could’ve aimed for a draw with 16…[ B x h4 ] 17.[ N x h4 ] [ Q x h4 ] 18.[ B g5 ] [ Q g4 ] (18…[ Q [ c4 ] ] 19.Re3) 19.[ B d1 ] [ Q f5 ] 20.[ B c2 ] [ Q g4 ] 21.Bd. If white plays on he is down a pawn and black is a little better. And Black’s Queen cannot escape via [ c4 ] either because of 22.Be2. But given the huge rating difference it is understandable that Black is looking for more than a draw.
 [ Q d1 ] , [ b4 ]  !
 [ B d2 ] , [ N c7 ]  :)
 [ K x f5 ]  [ K f2 ]  [ K e4 ] , [ K e2 ]  Now it's a battle for the Opposition.
 [ B c2 ] , [ R e8 ]  Simon: 13. [ N f1 ] Continuing the plan. 13. [ [ [ [ [ [ a4 ] ] ] ] ] ] or 13. [ [ [ [ [ [ b3 ] ] ] ] ] ] are also worth considering. ION: I'd be ... ... happy with 13.[ N f1 ] or 13.a4. If there is otherwise an even split I'll probably go with the knight move. The [ [ [ [ [ [ a4 ] ] ] ] ] ] move is on the cards sooner or later. It can afford to await the further development of our pieces. Jeremy: I really like [ [ [ [ [ [ b3 ] ] ] ] ] ] to activate the dsb and prepare for [ [ [ [ [ [ a4 ] ] ] ] ] ] (coming). [ N f1 ] is an interesting decision but my preference is b3. Charles: On this opening database [ N f1 ] seems to be the most popular move but [ [ [ [ [ [ a4 ] ] ] ] ] ] and [ [ [ [ [ [ b3 ] ] ] ] ] ] seem to score better... Joe: Which is my vote. And that's because the idea is freeing up our DSB. So my vote is for 13.Nf1. Simon: I can definitely see the merits of [ [ [ [ [ [ a4 ] ] ] ] ] ] and b3. If we go down the [ N f1 ] and subsequently [ N g3 ] or [ N e3 ] then we'll have ended up moving the knight three times and the bishop 3 times which is hardly what the grandmasters recommend! By playing [ [ [ [ [ [ b3 ] ] ] ] ] ] (or [ [ [ [ [ [ a4 ] ] ] ] ] ] and [ [ [ [ [ [ b3 ] ] ] ] ] ] later) we can develop the bishop without having to move the knight again and hopefully retain more opening advantage. I'll switch my vote to [ [ [ [ [ [ b3 ] ] ] ] ] ] just to keep things interesting.
 [ c3 ]  [ b x c3 + ]  [ K x c3 ]  [ R g c1 + ]  [ K b2 ] , [ R c h1 ]  It is too late.
 [ B d2 ]  [ R e7 ]  [ R c1 ]  [ R e c7 ]  [ Q b3 ] , [ Q d4 ]  ?!?!?!?!!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!? Really risky.
 [ d4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N d4 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ c5 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ Q d3 ]  [ B x c4 ]  [ Q x c4 ]  [ b6 ]  [ R a d1 ]  [ N h5 ]  [ b4 ]  [ N f4 ]  [ B x f4 ]  [ e x f4 ]  [ b x c5 ]  [ b x c5 ]  [ Q x c5 ]  [ Q f6 ]  [ Q d5 ] , [ N x c2 ]  finally able to move
 [ R b4 ]  [ R g7 ]  [ R d4 ]  [ B b3 ] , [ B e5 ]  This tricks Black into deflecting the d7-rook from the aid of his comrade.
 [ K e7 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ R d8 ]  [ N x f7 ]  [ K x f7 ]  [ R h f1 + ]  [ K e7 ]  [ Q h4 + ]  [ K e8 ]  [ Q h5 + ]  [ K e7 ] , [ Q f7 # ]  That is the price of leaving one's King in the open. Hope you enjoyed!
 [ g x f6 ]  [ Q e5 ]  [ f x g7 ]  [ K x g7 ] , [ Q x e4 ]  and two pieces down without a hope of redemption I resigned. If you're going to play the King's Indian you really have to get your attack in quickly. I dillied and I dallied and I couldn't find my way home.
 [ N f6 ]  [ b3 ] , [ O-O ]  I now am safely out of sight and I see that My opponent has his sights on my totem of Pawns.
 [ O-O ]  [ B g5 ]  [ N a5 ] , [ N b d2 ]  He wins my LSB. I decided by play this to give my knight a good position.
 [ B c5 ]  [ N x f7 ]  [ B x f2 + ]  [ K x f2 ]  [ N x e4 + ]  [ K g1 ] , [ Q f6 ]  So now I would be threatening checkmate in 1 and be able to save my rook while white defends it's king...theoretically...but...
 [ K c7 ]  [ Q b3 ]  [ Q c6 + ]  [ K b4 ]  [ K d6 ]  [ K a3 ] , [ e5 ]  I fight but it's a draw.
 [ R h d8 ]  [ R x d8 ]  [ R x d8 ]  [ R d1 ] , [ R x d1 + ]  25. ........ [ R x d1 + ] and DRAW OFFER! Despite the difference in our ratings and despite the fact that I had previously lost 5 out of my 6 games with him he did not wish to play out the ending. I thought that he would given the fact that his king was more centralised than Henry but he didn't. Michael is still winning overall - by 5.5 points to 1 in our 7 game encounters. Still after the recent horror show against Master Freddy I am only too pleased to have something like this to write home about.
 [ Q x d1 + ]  [ K x d1 ]  [ B x c5 ] , [ B x c6 + ]  White should have accepted the loss of the pawn or maybe played Rf1. After this move Blacks lead in development becomes way to strong.
 [ g5 + ]  [ K e3 ] , [ K e5 ]  39 [ K d3 ] White is still hanging on but gets a lifeline 38......c4ch would have been a better choice
 [ B f5 ]  [ N c5 ] , [ b6 ]  The knight has to retreat "losing" control of d3.
 [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ] , [ B b5 + ]  3. [ B b5 + ] - rather than play [ d4 ] I decided to do something different and play the Nimzowich-Rossolimo Attack. Interesting that Coach Ion likens my play to Nimzo and Tigran Petrosian!
 [ g6 ] , [ Q x e3 ]  Removing the offender defending [ f2 ] and defending the in sight of h5.
 [ B x c3 ] , [ b x c3 ]  I made a visual error here thinking that the f6-knight wasn't there so I played this instead of [ Q x c6 ] because I thought that [ d4 ] was a serious fork.
 [ e x f5 ]  [ a6 ] , [ N c3 ]  3. [ N c3 ] - good old fashioned sensible development here.
 [ N f6 ] , [ f4 ]  ? I dont know if there was anything to be done.
 [ h3 ] , [ Q d6 ]  This is where he made the joke. Too late I can now begin "Operation Sacrifice Knight to win Queen with Rook" or for those who have seen the latest Batman movie. "Operation Harvey Dent."
 [ a4 ]  [ N d b7 ]  [ R a1 ]  [ R a8 ]  [ B c6 ]  [ R a5 ]  [ R b1 ]  [ N d8 ]  [ B f3 ] , [ R x a4 ]  
 [ R x d3 ]  [ R d7 ]  [ B a3 ]  [ b5 ]  [ c x b5 ]  [ a x b5 ]  [ b4 ]  [ R e3 ] , [ K d2 ]  I don't mind a rook trade but do not like the revealed check black would get
 [ Q x b3 ] , [ R x a7 ]  ?? White could have held out for a bit longer though the situation was pretty well lost by now. The text though fails to prevent a very slick mate in four. Do you see it? Black does.
 [ e x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ] , [ N x c6 ]  The best recapture for white isolating black's pawn on the c-file. By the way only with this move do we leave the game DB.
 [ R c5 ]  [ Q f2 ]  [ K h8 ]  [ Q h4 ]  [ R g8 ]  [ R f3 ]  [ Q f8 ]  [ R h3 ]  [ h5 ]  [ Q g5 ]  [ K h7 ] , [ K h1 ]  I almost blundered into 24.Rxh5+?? which would be fine if not for the black rook on the g-file that would pin my queen to my king after 24...gxh5. Now [ R x h5 ] is a legitimate threat.
 [ c x d5 ]  [ c x d5 ] , [ Q a6 ]  Black is attempting to "dictate the direction & flow of the game" by challenging white and presenting him with problems! The weakens of the a6-[ f1 ] diagonal is glaring now white try to stop the [ N d3 + ] with interrupts his plans!
 [ K f8 ] , [ Q h6 + ]  38. [ Q h6 + ] - here I offer a draw but black thinks he can escape the perpetual so he declines.
 [ N f3 ] , [ d6 ]  2...d6. Standard book I believe. Is this a Closed Sicilian?
 [ N f3 ] , [ d6 ]  But this is where he deviates from his usual. As Tom's main move is 2...[ N f6 ] with which I play the Guaco Piano. But he changed things up presumably to take me off guard. But I know how to respond the Philidor's Defense quite well.
 [ Q f6 ] , [ g3 ]  I think the reason why I didn't play my next move here instead was simply because of the threat to the bishop itself meant that I got tied up thinking defensively.
 [ e3 ]  [ O-O ] , [ B d3 ]  challenging my light-square bishop.
 [ N d5 ] , [ N x f3 + ]  A discovered attack against white's rook on [ a1 ] given with check.
 [ N c7 + ]  [ K d8 ]  [ e6 ] , [ K x c7 ]  just sets things up for a check with discovered attack on the Q. Desperation measure was [ Q x c1 ] getting rid of my B and forcing the Q off the d-file
 [ R x d3 ] , [ a5 ]  19....a5?? This is pathetic! What does it accomplish?
 [ h x g4 ]  [ h x g4 ] , [ R c1 ]  !? a odd move.I hope to keep my position more flexible
 [ d3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ Q x d5 ]  [ c4 ]  [ Q d8 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ B x e3 ]  [ f x e3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ e4 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ Q x d4 ]  [ Q f3 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ Q g3 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ Q b6 ]  [ b3 ]  [ Q b4 ]  [ K d2 ]  [ a5 ]  [ R h f1 ]  [ a4 ]  [ a3 ] , [ Q x b3 ]  [ Q d6 ] instead sets up a nice knight fork. Does the queen have any escape route here if white plays Rfb1?
 [ B e6 ]  [ R e4 ]  [ R b8 + ]  [ K c1 ] , [ Q b2 + ]  computer preferes [ Q g5 ] but my plan seemed ok from now.
 [ R b1 ]  [ f5 ]  [ b4 ] , [ K h8 ]  This waiting move also freeing [ g8 ] for the black pieces has become standard.
 [ B g3 ] , [ R x a4 ]  Black's a-pawn is now passed and hence dangerous.
 [ N c3 ] , [ B c6 ]  Wanting to keep my bishop for now.
 [ B g7 ]  [ B a4 + ] , [ K f8 ]  Black is only down a pawn but his King is stuck in the center. Bad position
 [ K x f7 ]  [ N x e5 + ] , [ K f8 ]  This looks better than keeping the king in the open.
 [ R x f7 ]  [ N x f7 ] , [ K x f7 ]  but of course get the rook into action
 [ B f5 + ] , [ K c3 ]  trapped: [ R h1 ] mate so White has to run...
 [ Q e2 ] , [ R d8 ]  Well if white wants the c-file black will take the d-file.
 [ N f8 ]  [ N a c4 ]  [ B h4 ]  [ R e f1 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ K h1 ]  [ B x d6 ]  [ N x d6 ]  [ Q e7 ]  [ Q x e7 ]  [ N x e7 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ R d7 ]  [ N c4 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ N b6 ]  [ N x b6 ] , [ c x b6 ]  Through tactical maneuvers White has managed to get a passed pawn.
 [ f3 ]  [ Q a5 + ]  [ K d1 ]  [ B a4 + ]  [ K c1 ] , [ Q c3 + ]  Mate on the next move so White resigned.
 [ R f c8 ]  [ h3 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ Q x b4 ]  [ N x c4 ]  [ a4 ]  [ R c6 ]  [ Q b5 ] , [ N a5 ]  analysis calls this a mistake preferring … [ R c5 ] 34. [ Q b4 ] [ R a7 ] 35. [ h4 ] [ R a c7 ] 36. [ K h3 ] [ K g7 ]  [ R c5 ]  [ Q g4 + ]  [ K f8 ]  [ Q b4 ]  [ R b8 ] , [ h4 ]  Passed pawns must be pushed
 [ N c6 + ]  [ K e8 ] , [ f3 ]  Best choice White will disentangle himself by playing Rf2. 18.[ f4 ] was not precise because of 18...[ a5 ] 19.[ R f2 ] [ R b1 ] 20.[ R x b1 ] [ B b1 ] 21.[ R f1 ] [ B e4 ] and White Bishop is magnificently posted.
 [ R c7 ] , [ R d1 ]  Looking at a potential mate on [ d8 ] but Black's natural reply covers that square as well as defending the a-pawn again and attacking my Ra5. He also has another reply that I hadn't fully considered ...
 [ K e6 ]  [ N g5 + ] , [ K f5 ]  now fritz suggests [ B d2 ]  [ N e4 ] , [ b6 ]  a bad move giving access to 6th line for white rook. now i had a plan: as the black king is trapped in a mate network the idea is to push g3-[ g4 ] but first protect my bishop and move the knight to [ g5 ] again
 [ d4 + ]  [ K d2 ] , [ c4 ]  Creating two connected passed pawns.
 [ N f3 ] , [ g6 ]  This pawn is the Hungarian variation of the Sicilian. The bishop is fletchetted on move 4.
 [ d4 ]  [ f5 ]  [ c4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ e3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ O-O ] , [ O-O ]  We started off with a dutch defense opening.
 [ d x e4 ]  [ B x e4 ]  [ B x a2 ]  [ b3 ]  [ R c8 ]  [ K b2 ]  [ B x b3 ]  [ c x b3 ]  [ N e7 ]  [ R d a1 ]  [ b6 ]  [ B g1 ]  [ O-O ]  [ f3 ]  [ R c7 ]  [ b4 ]  [ N a c6 ] , [ B e3 ]  ? I don't see white's strategy behind sacrificing the b pawn. The a pawn is well defended.
 [ f5 ] , [ N e5 ]  ! only move that neutralizes whites growing advantage. Besides don't the Knight look awesome!
 [ B g3 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N x g3 ] , [ h x g3 ]  ? Better was [ f x g3 ] for clear path or rook
 [ R e4 ] , [ B d6 ]  Although not a bad response this move allows me to do some more bad things. When you are forced to make an exchange make sure that the exchange is as much on your terms as you can allow it. Because of 10. ... [ b6 ] the next move is possible.
 [ Q d3 ] , [ Q g5 ]  Threatens mate on [ g2 ] but even better it forces the exchange of queens.
 [ K f8 ]  [ g4 ]  [ g6 ]  [ h4 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ R c7 ]  [ d4 ]  [ h5 ]  [ g x h5 ]  [ g x h5 ]  [ K g7 ] , [ K g3 ]  I am now hoping to Queen that pawn.
 [ h6 ]  [ h4 ]  [ N b d7 ]  [ a4 ]  [ a6 ] , [ R a3 ]  9. [ R a3 ] - a piece does develop but The Dentist violates opening principles and should be thinking about moving the minor pieces first though but I think he is trying to surprise and confuse Freddy though.
 [ N g6 ] , [ B g3 ]  So my [ B h5 ] plan was really not so good. My move is [ f4 ] but even I was a little scared not to secure my king. And I need the rook on f.
 [ b6 ]  [ b4 ]  [ R b2 ] , [ b5 ]  Alternative variation: 37. [ b x a5 ] [ b x a5 ] 38. [ R c4 ] [ R d b8 ] $19
 [ B e3 ]  [ B g7 ] , [ f3 ]  to be followed by [ Q d2 ] 0-0-0 [ B h6 ] pawn storm on the kingside. If 7.[ Q d2 ] immediately black can play 7...Ng4.
 [ N f6 ]  [ b3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ B b2 ]  [ B g4 ] , [ d3 ]  At this point I wonder if the b knight has to come on [ d7 ] or [ c6 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ d4 ]  The soldiers advance
 [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ c3 ] , [ N f6 ]  White has thrown me for a loop with 3. c3. I don't have any chess library to speak of and this move isn't in what I have. So I'm winging it with the GK DB for now. Edit: Note that now black's knight attacks the white pawn on [ e4 ] but if black captures it say with 4. ... Nxe4? white replies 5. [ Q a4 + ] and 6. [ Q x e5 ] and black loses his knight.
 [ Q b5 + ]  [ N d7 ] , [ Q x b7 ]  bringing the B back might have been better but boy those [ b7 ] pawns attract Qs like flies to excrement
 [ Q g5 ] , [ Q c3 ]  keeping the queen on the a1-[ h8 ] diagonal but forcing some positional disadvantages on white's camp [ R e2 ] is almost forced in view of losing another pawn
 [ B h6 + ] , [ B e3 ]  The only move he could do to safe his king not really thought about it. Maybe Rc5! would have been the best continuation on move 17 blocking his bishop.
 [ B x c3 ]  [ N c2 ]  [ B b2 ]  [ R d1 ] , [ B a4 ]  Well now I've lost all hope. This is a seriously dour situation.
 [ R e1 ]  [ b x c3 ]  [ b x c3 ] , [ O-O ]  ? The first obvious mistake. Black leaves the pawn on [ e5 ] en prise! Better was 17...[ Q d6 ] the only way to defend the pawn although White should be a lot better in the ending.
 [ N b d4 ]  [ N c x d4 ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ O-O ]  [ c5 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ B c4 ] , [ R e8 ]  At this time 13...[ Q f6 ] would get some counter attack against d column
 [ Q e2 ] , [ B b7 ]  ready to attack or counter-attack
 [ e x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ N c3 ]  Defending the pawn as well as developing
 [ d x c6 ]  [ B x c6 ] , [ N f5 ]  Here we go... Still in the DB but I finally have a plan.
 [ Q h5 ]  [ R c6 c8 ] , [ R x h2 ]  Now i dont have time without checking
 [ B e3 ] , [ g5 ]  White now moves his DB to [ e3 ] and I continue to prepare my attack on the king side with pawn to g5. This stops the [ f3 ] knight from moving onto h4.
 [ d6 ]  [ K d7 ]  [ R e b2 ]  [ K c6 ]  [ d7 ]  [ K x d7 ]  [ R b2 x b6 ]  [ R c7 ]  [ R d1 + ]  [ K e8 ] , [ R d5 ]  Black resigns as after 54... R/4-[ K2 ] 55 R-[ N8 ] ch K-[ B2 ] 56 R/5-[ Q8 ] Black cannot avoid decisive material loss.
 [ N e4 ]  [ R d1 ] , [ B c5 ]  ? Black allows white to attack the [ e6 ] pawn.
 [ B x d5 ] , [ f x e5 ]  But I preferred to keep it simple and just take the pawn.
 [ R e7 ]  [ R f3 ]  [ R c7 ] , [ a4 ]  At this point Fischer sealed his move.
 [ K g2 ] , [ N b3 ]  OK so *now* I'll occupy the square it just got pushed back one move.
 [ B g4 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ B x e2 ]  [ Q x e2 ]  [ Q d7 ] , [ N f3 ]  Putting another defender on the [ e5 ] square and preparing a march forward.
 [ N e5 ] , [ O-O ]  ?
 [ R x a1 ]  [ R h e8 ] , [ N g5 ]  [ [ f6 ] ] is not possible due to Ne6. But after he takes on [ h7 ] [ [ f6 ] ] will make her lose the piece after Rh8.
 [ N x e6 ]  [ K x e6 ]  [ R a c1 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ B x e7 ] , [ R h8 ]  I guess white can choose bishop or knight. Except [ B c5 ] rescues the knight.
 [ Q g8 + ]  [ K h6 ]  [ R a4 ]  [ N d4 ] , [ R a2 ]  a mistake now he will be in big trouble.
 [ b4 ] , [ N d1 ]  12. [ N d1 ] - this knight stays on this square for the rest of the game.
 [ e5 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ d x e5 ] , [ B g3 ]  this way I thought that the pressure against [ e5 ] will compensate the bishop's inactivity. If black goes [ f6 ] it opens the way for a future [ Q h5 + ] once more conditions are met.
 [ N c6 ]  [ Q x g7 ] , [ Q f6 ]  Competent response In his shoes I would've done the same.
 [ f3 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ g4 + ]  [ K g6 ] , [ Q d3 + ]  !!!!!!. Forcing an equal endgame. If 38... [ Q x d3 ] 39. [ N e5 + ] forking the king and queen
 [ R x f4 + ]  [ K e2 ] , [ R x g3 ]  Trading knights.
 [ K f3 ] , [ Q d3 + ]  Forcing the draw.
 [ B b3 + ]  [ d5 ]  [ N x d5 ] , [ Q g2 # ]  
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ f4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ e3 ] , [ e6 ]  normal position after 4 moves
 [ R b2 ]  [ R x g4 ]  [ K h1 ]  [ N g6 ]  [ R f2 ]  [ Q e7 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ R e g5 ]  [ R a1 ]  [ h4 ] , [ c4 ]  41.[ R b2 ] [ R x g4 ] 42.[ K h1 ] [ N g6 ] 43.[ R f2 ] [ Q e7 ] 44.[ Q d2 ] [ R e g5 ] 45.[ R a1 ] [ h4 ] 46.c4! ... I have tightened the vice on the position but 9K has hung in there staving off a decisive breakthrough by putting his pieces on their best defensive squares. My main problem was finding a secure square for my king a problem which I address with my next few moves.
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ N f6 ]  A change from my usual response.
 [ K h7 ] , [ R c c2 ]  [ R g2 ] at least saves him for a little bit.
 [ B x f4 ]  [ Q x f4 ]  [ N x f6 ] , [ N x f6 ]  The queen has a good place to go... d4. Incidentally a white pawn is in there so... why not? Chase me...
 [ B x f3 ]  [ N x f3 ] , [ B g3 ]  Now can I get away without giving up the bishop or the knight?
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ d6 ]  Philidor? what is it with you guys?
 [ e4 ] , [ N e5 ]  Probably not a good move (the knight has got to move twice and it gives black one tempo)
 [ B x d7 + ]  [ Q x d7 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ Q x d4 ] , [ O-O-O ]  Blundering pawn and position
 [ a4 ] , [ a5 ]  30. ...... [ a5 ] - this prophylactic move is to ensure that the white rooks bite on granite!
 [ B d6 ]  [ Q f7 + ]  [ K c8 ]  [ Q x e6 + ] , [ K b8 ]  white is pushing black to the edge. the end is near...
 [ N f6 ] , [ e5 ]  I felt bold because I recalled a game I played where my knight was systematically chased and thought I could duplicate the maneuver.
 [ K c8 ] , [ R x a7 ]  ...and I lose the latter.
 [ N x c6 ] , [ b x c6 ]  At this point black has what he wants; a superior center with excellent counter-attacking chances. So black ought to just pursue playing that way or so I would think.
 [ N c3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ e4 ]  [ d6 ]  [ f3 ] , [ O-O ]  5. ....... 0-0 - I castle quickly all right but my queenside will remain undeveloped for a very long time.
 [ K c8 ]  [ R e8 + ]  [ K c7 ] , [ R x a8 ]  always good to exchange pieces when up in material.
 [ d x c4 ]  [ b x c4 ] , [ Q x d3 ]  This is not how I intended to win the pawn at [ d3 ] but White kept putting an obstruction on c4.
 [ K e7 ] , [ B d2 ]  ...this move. Note that if I play [ c4 ] the black N has to go to [ b6 ] allowing my B to check him in b4. After [ c5 ] dxc the threats is still on.
 [ Q d2 ]  [ d6 ] , [ N c3 ]  all those moves by white or black aim at the center
 [ N f3 ] , [ g6 ]  My 5th game against joanne. As has been typical for me of late I go with the Modern defense. I have limited time to study and I'm trying to spend primarily on tactics. I can't say why but I like this defense.
 [ b5 ] , [ B b4 ]  With the consideration that I don't want my B trapped behind my Pawn chain. Now it can participate in the coming attack.
 [ Q x b4 ]  [ a x b4 ] , [ R x c6 ]  I thought this might have been a small inaccuracy. I think [ e5 ] or [ N b6 ] might have been slightly better with fewer counter play chances for black.
 [ R g8 ] , [ R d1 ]  Thinking to do [ b4 ] on next move.
 [ e6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B b4 ]  [ a3 ]  [ B x c3 + ] , [ b x c3 ]  I see no reason to dislike this situation. On the contrary: I open the queen side and keep an average center.
 [ Q f6 ]  [ B x g6 ] , [ h x g6 ]  23. ....... [ h x g6 ] - Elia's kingside pawns are doubled and the h file is open can I make use of it?
 [ N f4 ]  [ K h1 ] , [ N e g6 ]  Looking for ...Nh4! with a solid attack
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ] , [ Q f3 ]  making a statement right from the beginning: White is going for the King...
 [ R x e1 ]  [ R d7 x d3 ]  [ Q e5 + ] , [ K a8 ]  And here White resigned. Despite my far lower rating a sharp tactical blow in the middlegame followed by a commanding presence on the d-file sealed the win.
 [ R f2 ]  [ R d f8 ]  [ b3 ]  [ Q g5 ]  [ R f c2 ]  [ Q f4 ]  [ R c2 c4 ]  [ Q e4 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ f4 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ Q g6 ]  [ R e c1 ] , [ f3 ]  Now I need to be careful. black's pawn advances are taking away the time I need to develop an attack.
 [ R x b6 ]  [ a x b6 ]  [ Q x d5 + ]  [ B f7 ]  [ Q x d6 ]  [ Q x c3 ] , [ B x f5 ]  Okay...now both of my bishops are aimed at the king...my queen is centralized and just begging for a better square...my knight is doing his job by protecting the rook...but he would love to get into this...it's sad he doesn't get a chance :(
 [ Q d7 ] , [ B e3 ]  The white pieces grouped in the center are very powerfull at ong term for they control a big pack of squares.
 [ Q h6 ] , [ N f3 ]  White's best chance was probably to go back to [ d3 ] with the queen.
 [ d5 ] , [ Q e3 + ]  I'd expected that one and had the response ready.
 [ a4 ]  [ R h6 ]  [ h3 ]  [ b x a4 ]  [ Q b6 ]  [ B b5 ] , [ c6 ]  The move I worried about in addition to the poor coordination of my rooks!I have to withdraw more quickly as I am. As i have said earlier [ R h6 ] is just a waste of time.
 [ N x d7 ]  [ N x d7 ]  [ b3 ]  [ b4 ] , [ Q d1 ]  I think I just got very lucky.
 [ d x e4 ] , [ N x e3 ]  Ne3... i told you.... white must take otherwise next move they have lost by [ N c2 ]  [ Q x b5 ]  [ a x b4 ] , [ B x e3 + ]  and now the games pase slows down as white has a long way to come back from
 [ Q b7 ]  [ B a5 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ R f e1 ]  [ e6 ] , [ R e5 ]  I haven't given up hope. Despite being a piece down there is enough wood left on the board to provoke complications.
 [ K c6 ] , [ c4 ]  If 41...[ K d5 ] the 42.[ K d3 ]  [ b x a5 + ] , [ K x a5 ]  From now on in White King should be pushed beyond pawns as it gains more squares than a single pawn.
 [ N d5 ] , [ d3 ]  protect [ f4 ]  [ d6 ] , [ c4 ]  continue pushing his knight about
 [ B x b5 ] , [ B d7 ]  ?? In this position my knight is still pinned. Therefore I moved my LSB to undue the pin. According to Jack Stockel it is best to move your bishop if you want to break a knight pin (get your knight unpinned). However 7...[ a x b5 ] would have been my best move. If 7...[ a x b5 ] 8.Qxb5. That way my a pawn is exchanged for his LSB so I am 3 points ahead. If that happened I would have been able to fix my previous mistake. At this point I am in even more trouble due to my played move. Consequently he is going to win a free piece with 8.Bxc6.
 [ O-O ]  [ N b3 ] , [ R e8 ]  I played Rook [ e8 ] for 1). protection of the e-pawn in the case when my queen or c6-Knight moves 2). if white plays the bishop ram move Queen-[ d2 ] I can thus move my bishop to [ h8 ] 3). because I was out of book and didn't know what to do!!!
 [ h5 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ B x e5 ]  [ f x e5 ]  [ B d7 ] , [ B x h5 ]  Destroying the K side. [ g4 ] is also very useful.
 [ Q x b3 ]  [ a x b4 ] , [ R d8 ]  Check mate is inevitable...
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ a6 ]  Najdorf; now i learned.
 [ N x c6 ] , [ Q b7 + ]  And black resigned here. If king moves 26. [ Q f7 # ] is coming. Blocks are possible with [ N e7 ] - but there are 3 attackers and black will lose queen and trade a lot of others. e.g. 25 ...[ N e7 ] 26. [ B x e7 ] ... [ Q x e7 ] 27. [ R d7 ] and black will lose the queen.
 [ c3 ] , [ N d5 ]  My plan is to manoeuvre the knight to f4. If bishops are swapped on [ g6 ] I open up the h-file voluntarily. If we trade knights on [ f4 ] I will try to swap bishops on [ d3 ] and then advance my f g and h-pawns towards the enemy king.
 [ g6 ]  [ a2 ]  [ g7 ] , [ a1 = Q ]  It's a tie! The ending remains level.
 [ c x d5 ]  [ Q x d5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ Q d8 ]  [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ B d6 ] , [ d4 ]  I would rather play white here than black.
 [ N e5 ]  [ R h6 ]  [ g x f4 ]  [ R f h8 ]  [ f x g5 ]  [ R h6 h2 + ]  [ K g1 ]  [ R h2 h1 + ]  [ K f2 ]  [ R h8 h2 + ]  [ K e3 ]  [ R h2 h3 + ]  [ N f3 ]  [ R x f3 + ]  [ R x f3 ]  [ Q x c1 + ]  [ K f2 ]  [ Q e1 + ]  [ K g2 ] , [ Q g1 # ]  I think you will agree when I say that this goes to show that a development advantage can lead to an easy game for the player with the advantage aslong as he keeps the intiative. SO to answer the question "is development crucial?" the resounding anwer is yes! I hope you enjoyed my annotation. If you have any feedback or you think I have made any mistakes please PM. Tom
 [ N x b5 ]  [ Q x b5 + ]  [ N d7 ] , [ d5 ]  Forcing open another line.
 [ e3 ]  [ c5 ] , [ a3 ]  This is mistake white can't get advantage that way. Better continuation would be 6. [ N f3 ] or 6. [ c x d5 ] [ e x d5 ] 7. [ e x d5 ] with clear advantage.
 [ K d7 ]  [ N d5 + ] , [ K c6 ]  30. ... [ K c8 ] 31. a8=R# or 30. [ K d8 ] 31. a8=R+ [ Q c8 ] 32. [ Q e7 # ]  [ N f3 ] , [ N c6 ]  Typical..
 [ R d6 ] , [ K f2 ]  Maybe 35. [ N d4 ] would have been better than [ N x f4 ] as this would stop any counter-play down the d file. But I still felt in control and had answers to the [ R d2 + ] threat..... such as [ R c6 ] picking up the a Pawn.
 [ B b7 ]  [ e3 ]  [ h6 ] , [ B h4 ]  7. Bh4. Here I consider [ g5 ] and then castling long. But instead...
 [ f5 ]  [ R e2 ]  [ K f7 ]  [ h4 ]  [ R a1 ]  [ g4 ]  [ f x g4 + ]  [ K x g4 ]  [ R x a4 ] , [ R f2 + ]  This will either seperate the king from his pawns or box him in to the corner. I'm expecting the latter and hoping I can gain material here. By this point in the game I was starting to believe I had a real chance to win if I played well enough the main issue was that my rating was near the bottom of its descent and my confidence had largely sunk with it.
 [ B f1 ]  [ R f5 ]  [ N g4 + ]  [ K g7 ] , [ B e2 ]  Probably a stalled position. I tried something but it was a blunder.
 [ O-O ] , [ N b d2 ]  not making any decisions yet: just developing...
 [ b x c5 ] , [ d x c5 ]  Correctly. Another choice was [ N e7 + ] [ K h8 ] NxB black retakes BxR. This way white cashes.
 [ R x b8 ]  [ R x b8 + ]  [ K h7 ] , [ f4 ]  I now have a won game.
 [ g4 ] , [ f4 ]  Creating a passed Pawn but it proves useless.
 [ B d6 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ h6 ] , [ N d5 ]  In Jolivos vs. Ratinho Jolivos moves Bh4. With [ N d5 ] white trades a knight and bishop for a knight and pawn. Not a bad trade if white ends up exploiting some brilliant positional advantage not readily apparent to me here. http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=5862002&mv=9&rnd=0.9964051939155457
 [ N x c3 ] , [ Q x c3 + ]  Now white will lose his rook.
 [ R d7 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ B x d4 ]  [ B x d4 ]  [ R x d4 ] , [ R c7 + ]  17. ................. [ R c7 ] - after a plethora of exchanges both sides are left with one lsb and a pair of rooks. I put the question to the white king.
 [ K d8 ] , [ R c6 ]  White is letting black coordinate his rooks which I would've tried to prevent but it hardly matters since white is up so much material.
 [ B b6 ]  [ B a4 ] , [ R a f8 ]  20. ....... Raf8. Moves rook out of the Jack Horner and puts pressure on the f column. Firstly white trades off his lsb for my knight on c2.
 [ K f4 ]  [ K f6 ]  [ g5 + ]  [ K g6 ]  [ K g4 ]  [ K g7 ] , [ K x h4 ]  He has no chance of stopping two pawns.
 [ a6 ]  [ B a4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B e7 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ b5 ]  [ B b3 ] , [ O-O ]  The main line is 7... [ d6 ] 8. [ c3 ] 0-0 but playing the moves in the other order keeps White on his toes as he doesn't know whether Black intends to play the Marshall Gambit (8... d5). If White does think Black intends this he may prefer to avoid this line with 8. [ a4 ] instead of c3. In this game however my opponent was not fooled by this little ruse so we immediately return to normal lines.
 [ K e8 ] , [ R x c7 ]  let's take a look at the position here - material is even and each side only has one developed piece. Black has the better piece - the queen - in no-man's land on the (White's) right side of the board and while White has a weaker piece - the rook - it restricts the mobility of all of Black's pieces (for now Black's Queen is stuck on the g-file protecting the pawn as if she moves; 23. [ R x g7 ] and unless the Black Queen had moved onto the h-file Black's rook will soon be lost
 [ O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ R a e1 ] , [ R f c8 ]  I'm not great with this position but the principles that would have guided my play here are basically as follows: move pawns to control central space (and limit his knights); use your Rooks to move pawns and control open files; get your Bishops off of the defense. Especially with the last point it is regrettable that neither of your Bishops can move without giving up pawns. So I would probably have recommended [ K g7 ] [ R f e8 ] or [ b5 ] before Rfc8. After all with a defended White pawn in the c file where can your Rook go?
 [ R f e8 ]  [ Q a4 ]  [ e4 ]  [ R f d1 ]  [ a6 ]  [ Q b3 ]  [ Q c8 ]  [ a4 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ a5 ]  [ B h7 ]  [ c5 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N f1 ]  [ c6 ] , [ B f4 ]  Starting to slightly swing in White's favour. I probably should've written something about the previous 8 moves but they all seem fairly obvious to me. This is an aggressive move trying to force something to happen and gain a measurable advantage.
 [ Q x d5 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ N a5 ] , [ R b1 ]  Not much of a threat as the black knight is defending Pb7.
 [ K c6 ] , [ B d2 ]  This gets my rook into play
 [ Q f5 ]  [ R d6 ] , [ Q b1 + ]  White resigns here in light of 35.[ Q e1 ] [ B h3 # ] Perhaps as Lakdawala explains the Modern allows Black greater leeway than any other opening.
 [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ c6 ] , [ B g5 ]  clear development with the idea that my queen-bishop is not my most important piece and can be exchanged if necessary.
 [ N x d4 ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N e8 ] , [ c3 ]  And here comes the gambit!
 [ Q x d5 ] , [ N d6 ]  Black moves his knight to a protected position.
 [ e4 ] , [ B c6 ]  Forced but not as dangerous as it appears: 22.d5? is an extremely ineffective fork that in fact would lose material for White after 22...[ B x d5 ] 23.[ Q x d5 ] Qxe5.
 [ f5 ]  [ R b x c8 ]  [ R x c8 ]  [ R x c8 + ]  [ K f7 ] , [ R x c6 ]  Black has two pawns for the rook and he is starting to overextend them I think it's a better idea for Black to keep the pawns back where they are safe.
 [ b4 ] , [ b5 ]  I block White's advancing pawn with mine threatening white bishop.
 [ K d7 ] , [ N c x a7 ]  He charges with King I readjust my attack from new platform.
 [ Q f5 + ]  [ e4 ] , [ Q c8 ]  I still liked QxNc5. Free knight. What 's not to love?
 [ N e6 ] , [ Q h4 ]  Maybe White missed that?
 [ K b7 ] , [ R d8 ]  I saw where he might try though as Ted has a passed pawn and this is it. I must be careful to prevent the possibility of him promoting. That's why I'm bound to take it.
 [ e5 ]  [ d5 ] , [ Q f4 ]  Releasing the pin on the Rook easing Black's position.
 [ Q h1 + ] , [ K e2 ]  Black re checks the White King on H1 white King now moves to [ e2 ]  [ Q x g2 ] , [ a x b7 ]  Black Queen takes pawn on [ g2 ] White takes pawn on [ b7 ] and forks the bishop and rook
 [ g3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ B g2 ]  [ B g7 ] , [ O-O ]  Keres adopts a rather passive response.
 [ d3 ] , [ B x f3 ]  ...and the knight...
 [ f4 ]  [ g5 ]  [ g3 ]  [ h6 ]  [ b3 ]  [ K f7 ]  [ N f2 ]  [ K f6 ]  [ N d3 ]  [ a5 ]  [ c4 ]  [ R b8 ]  [ N c5 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ K d3 ]  [ R e7 ]  [ N a4 ]  [ g x f4 ]  [ B x f4 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ B x h6 ]  [ R h1 ]  [ h4 ]  [ R h3 ]  [ B f4 ] , [ K g6 ]  White is clearly better. But some work still left before winning.
 [ K b1 ] , [ Q d2 ]  ...and my queen ensures he can only move between two squares...
 [ R x f3 ] , [ d1 = Q ]  another pin!
 [ Q x d6 ] , [ Q x d6 ]  White is almost obliged to accept the trade in order to conserve the initiative. Trading normally advantages the one with the material advantage but in this case with a far better pawn structure I estimated that I had good chances in an endgame.
 [ N x f3 + ]  [ g x f3 ] , [ Q d8 ]  11.[ Q c8 ] leaves to 12.T[ c1 ] loosing a tempo
 [ N b d7 ]  [ g5 ]  [ N e8 ]  [ N c1 ]  [ R b6 ]  [ N a2 ]  [ N f8 ] , [ N b4 ]  The Knight successfuly landed in desire outpost. It strongly defending this side while also block Black active rook and now White can continue the attack he has built before. Dan Kuda Putih berhasil duduk di petak yang baik sekaligus memblok Benteng musuh yang sangat aktif.
 [ O-O ]  [ O-O ] , [ h3 ]  Forcing a trade but costs white a move.
 [ R x h5 ]  [ K x c2 ] , [ f4 ]  Stopping my [ f5 ] pawn. It's a good choice because I was eventually going to advance after moving the f pawn. That's because you use that pawn chains for the passed pawns. In other words that's where they work.
 [ K g1 ] , [ Q e3 + ]  ! Black can now defend [ h7 ] and give a brutal pin after 33. [ K h1 ] Qe4.
 [ B x b5 ] , [ R x c3 ]  He's 1 pawn ahead but it's rather vulnerable on that f-file and black has quite a possible checks. The hunted becomes the hunter.
 [ a4 ] , [ O-O ]  Now it is not long before his impending doom.
 [ c6 ]  [ B a4 ]  [ b5 ]  [ B b3 ]  [ d5 ] , [ N x e5 ]  Did someone mention free pawns?
 [ R d2 ] , [ R g3 ]  ?? The sad blunder that loses. I would assume that he plans to double up rooks and get checkmate but I manage to avoid mate and hold onto my extra piece.
 [ K d1 ] , [ N x e4 ]  ! Safe from capture thanks to [ N x f2 + ]  [ N f3 ]  [ f5 ]  [ g3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ g6 ]  [ B g2 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ c4 ]  [ d6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ Q e8 ]  [ d5 ]  [ a5 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ N a6 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ N g4 ] , [ B d4 ]  Alternative variation: 11.

 [ a x b5 ] , [ N f3 ]  hoping the exchange
 [ b6 ] , [ e4 ]  This should reveal how narrow my book knowledge is. I'm going purely on whatever general precepts there are. Here I'm just trying to control as much of the center as possible. My opponent I imagine was suspicious of [ d3 ] and was playing it coy.
 [ N e5 ] , [ N g e7 ]  Not only is my second knight ready to provide support to the first but the king can now castle to safety.
 [ B e3 ]  [ N g8 ]  [ h3 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ B d2 ]  [ N a6 ]  [ a3 ]  [ B e5 ]  [ B f3 ]  [ O-O-O ]  [ O-O-O ]  [ R e8 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ b6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ B f6 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ b5 ]  [ a4 ]  [ N b4 ]  [ a x b5 ]  [ N e7 ]  [ b x c6 ] , [ N e x c6 ]  Now he;s connected his two knight together
 [ O-O-O ] , [ b6 ]  Played so that if White swapped B for N on [ c5 ] Black wouldn't have to recapture with the d-pawn thus giving White's advanced d-pawn scope for a future advance. I think this was too slow though. An immediate 13...N[ c5 ] followed by ...[ a4 ] might have given Black the start of an attack which at least would have given White cause to think about something other than his kingside attack. White's B is much more concerned with the holes in Black's kingside anyway.
 [ Q x e4 + ] , [ Q e2 ]  Pins my queen so I can't take the rook on h1.
 [ c x d5 ]  [ Q a5 + ]  [ Q d2 ] , [ Q x d5 ]  My temtation did not work
 [ b6 ]  [ b x c5 ]  [ b x c5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ d3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ R b1 ]  To take the control of the open file
 [ N f3 ]  [ Q e7 ]  [ Q g3 ]  [ N e3 ]  [ R f2 ]  [ N f5 ] , [ Q h2 ]  Again the white are playing without a bishop however I was able to consolidate 5 pieces on the king's side.
 [ N c6 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ N f6 ]  Turning in to the Italian.
 [ Q e4 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ h3 ]  [ f5 ]  [ Q e3 ]  [ B x e2 ]  [ Q x e2 ]  [ Q f6 ] , [ d5 ]  Wow that's a really good move that causes me trouble no matter what I do. If I capture with the knight he's going to play [ Q b5 + ] and have a strong attack. So it looks like cxd5. I think that he'll play [ B e3 ] threatening to take the knight and also threatening Be5.
 [ K g7 ]  [ B x c3 + ]  [ R f6 ]  [ B x f6 + ]  [ Q x f6 ]  [ g x f6 + ] , [ K x h6 ]  My opponent calculated this far only thinking that her Rook is still on the board on [ f8 ] and that she is up a piece. Here White has a clearly winning position (being up an exchange and a Pawn). Unfortunately I forgot the famous advice: when you see a good move look for a better one! Instead I played the natural
 [ K x b7 ] , [ d x c6 + ]  Now I'm glad that I had placed a pawn on d5. I had thought it might come in handy. Also glad that my Queen is on that diagonal backing it up.
 [ R a d1 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ] , [ N f6 ]  Right move wrong timing. First 22. ... [ N x d4 ] 23. [ R x d4 ] [ N f6 ] 24. [ f3 ] [ b6 ] is in order for black...
 [ B d3 ] , [ d x c4 ]  Lost tempo for white now
 [ B f6 ]  [ Q h5 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ R a d1 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ N d e7 ] , [ N c4 ]  Seems like resignation to me. Black still could try to come up with some resilient defence perhaps [ R a7 ] or even Qxe7. 20 ... [ N g6 ] 21. [ R x d6 ] [ Q c7 ] also seems sensible.
 [ R x c8 ]  [ b4 ]  [ N a4 ]  [ Q a6 + ]  [ K c7 ]  [ Q x a4 ]  [ K b7 ]  [ R d7 + ]  [ R c7 ]  [ R e6 ]  [ f4 ]  [ Q a6 + ]  [ K b8 ]  [ R e8 + ]  [ R c8 ] , [ Q x c8 # ]  
 [ N d5 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ f3 ] , [ K f7 ]  This was intended to protect [ g6 ] and avoid the [ Q b4 + ] but fearlessly allows [ Q [ d5 ] + ] after the forcing d4-[ d5 ] break. However 19 ...[ K e7 ] [ Q b4 + ] does not seem to leave Black in a happy place
 [ R e8 ]  [ e5 ] , [ f x e5 ]  I spent time here worried that this opened my king too much but after looking for a successful line for White I could not find one and thus took.
 [ R d8 + ] , [ K c1 ]  Now Black has control of the open file again. I moved the king along his starting rank along the queenside to keep his bishop free so it can allow his rook to contest the open file...
 [ a4 ]  [ R e5 ]  [ a5 ] , [ R g5 ]  White may have missed this tactic. There's only one way to save the Bishop and it will leave to the loss of the passed pawn.
 [ N b4 ] , [ Q a4 + ]  check to take the horse on b 4
 [ N x e4 ] , [ b6 ]  Black aims for a queenside fianchetto combined with pressure down the f-file after ...O-O.
 [ b x c5 ]  [ B x c5 ]  [ B x e5 ] , [ Q d3 ]  The [ a3 ] pawn is poisonous. 30..Bxa3? 31.[ Q e3 ] [ B d6 ] 32.[ B x f6 ] (32. Qxb6?! [ B x e5 ] 33.[ N c6 ] [ R e8 ] 34.[ Q x b5 ] white only won a pawn) 32..[ g x f6 ] 33.[ Q x b6 ] white won a piece
 [ R x e4 ] , [ d x e4 ]  1. Immediate threats : none 2. center : white has a far better control on it (N P DSB Q indirectly) fired. 3. Pawn structure : slighly bette for white because of the doubled pawn. 4. Open files : one (and a central one !). under black control... for the moment ! Still a clue in the game. 5. Safety of the kings : Both kings are safe. The advance of the f awn has weakened the black king but white has no more LSB. 6. Material equality : black has the 2 bishops which is an advantage especially in open games. 7. General disposition : the white pieces are more active (having more mobility) but 2 of them are unprotected.
 [ N b5 + ] , [ R d7 ]  trying to save 1 R ends up losing both
 [ Q e6 ]  [ d7 ]  [ R d8 ]  [ B x c5 ]  [ R x d7 ]  [ R x d7 ]  [ Q x d7 ] , [ B d4 ]  Game note: 26.[ B d4 ] because now my Q and K are lined up in a skewer. Plus his DSB has great central and long range control.
 [ B e7 ]  [ N x c6 ]  [ b x c6 ]  [ b4 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ B d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ a5 ]  [ O-O ]  [ a x b4 ]  [ R c1 ]  [ B a6 ]  [ B x a6 ]  [ R x a6 ]  [ c x b4 ]  [ O-O ]  [ b5 ]  [ R a a8 ]  [ b6 ]  [ Q b7 ]  [ f4 ]  [ R f d8 ]  [ e5 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ R b1 ]  [ R a5 ]  [ R f3 ]  [ R d a8 ] , [ R d3 ]  i did this so i could dominate the d file
 [ R b8 ]  [ K g2 ]  [ R c8 ]  [ K f3 ]  [ R c7 ]  [ K e4 ]  [ N d2 + ]  [ K f5 ]  [ a4 ]  [ N c5 ] , [ R a7 ]  Black has been thrown on the defensive.
 [ d4 ] , [ b6 ]  In retrospect I should have taken [ d4 ] forced his queen out for risk of losing a pawn and then developed [ K c6 ] putting black ahead in development and with initiative.
 [ g6 ] , [ f4 ]  hmmm un anticipated reply. taking the bishop isnt wise as he gets a pawn up in the exchange and a queen check on [ h5 ] with a pawn on e5. so i decide that both of us conserving material is wiser. i played the pawn anyway to kick the bishop away. his attack on my knight is sorta a time gainer for me to move out of the [ e5 ] square. and sets up my trap
 [ Q g3 ] , [ R b f8 ]  Now I am threatening 31. ...F4!
 [ B b2 ]  [ B x b4 ]  [ B x e5 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ c6 ]  [ R b1 ]  [ B a5 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ B c7 ]  [ B x c7 ]  [ Q x c7 ]  [ e3 ] , [ d5 ]  striving for center control/influence and seeking to castle soon.
 [ B x f6 ]  [ g x f6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B x c3 ]  [ b x c3 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ B b3 ]  [ b5 ]  [ h3 ]  [ c5 ]  [ f4 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ R a d1 ]  [ c4 ]  [ B c2 ]  [ O-O ]  [ R f3 ]  [ K h8 ]  [ R g3 ]  [ R f g8 ]  [ R x g8 + ]  [ K x g8 ]  [ a4 ]  [ a6 ]  [ R d6 ]  [ h6 ]  [ R x a6 ]  [ N c5 ]  [ R a7 ]  [ R d2 ] , [ R c7 ]  Now comes a tricky exchange that I think I can win. There are complexities that might trip me up though.
 [ b4 ]  [ Q e7 ]  [ b5 ]  [ Q e6 ]  [ B c2 ] , [ c6 ]  If [ N x c2 ] first White would respond [ Q x d5 + ] and Black's attack would be gone. Good foresight on this move!
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ a6 ]  At the start my opponent plays an interesting O'Kelly variation of the Sicilian. At first I did not know what to do facing this odd-looking move.
 [ a5 ]  [ a4 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ B d3 ] , [ N b4 ]  I'm not sure what he's trying to do here but it's a little annoying to have a knight lodged there.
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ] , [ d4 ]  The Smith-Morra gambit. Usual continuation is 2...[ c x d4 ] 3. [ c3 ] dx[ c3 ] 4. Nx[ c3 ] where white sacrifices a pawn for fast development.
 [ B b4 + ]  [ c3 ] , [ B x c3 + ]  ...a clever sacrafice by black
 [ K g2 ] , [ h5 ]  King moves out of check and I push pawn to h5.
 [ B x c4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B e3 ] , [ N g4 ]  This seems to spend another tempo without a good reason by moving the N twice.
 [ K d1 ]  [ Q b3 + ]  [ R c2 ]  [ Q d3 + ] , [ B d2 ]  Oh the rook might have been better. You could get a draw with repeated moves. Now [ B a4 ] pins the rook.
 [ O-O ] , [ Q x d5 ]  Now I can't protect [ e5 ] and [ b7 ] at once.
 [ R a e8 ]  [ R x e5 ]  [ R x e5 ] , [ Q d2 ]  a good end game for white I have plenty of attacking options
 [ B g5 ]  [ R x d7 ] , [ R x d7 ]  31. ...... [ R x d7 ] - one pair of rooks is traded on the d column. Tip when up in material trade pieces not pawns and preferably heavies.
 [ h6 ] , [ B e2 ]  Now Black has to be careful.
 [ N b c6 ]  [ c3 ] , [ h6 ]  need to discourage anything from going on [ g5 ] before pushing the f pawn forward
 [ f4 ] , [ K e8 ]  The Knight cannot be saved; after 37. [ f5 ] [ f6 ] prevents a rescue and the King simply marches up to the hamstrung horse. Black then needn't even Queen a pawn or take either of White's but it is easy to do either or both so White resigned.
 [ N b d2 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ N f1 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ N g3 ] , [ g6 ]  13. ......... [ [ g6 ] ] - this move seems to weaken my kingside position but the [ [ g6 ] ] move does stop white from plonking a knight in on f5. Next move Fou Lenoir will move in to [ f8 ] to strengthen my castled position.
 [ R d8 ] , [ B x c7 ]  I feared [ Q d7 ] but after [ B g2 ] [ Q d2 + ] [ K f1 ] I think I'll have the best of it.
 [ a6 ]  [ B x c6 ]  [ d x c6 ] , [ O-O ]  I believe Black recaptures with the right pawn to try to generate some counterplay against the weak d-pawn. Opening the b-file wouldn't have given him as much to play against. White's position may appear to be quiet but development is slightly better and the pieces are more coordinated. The knight on [ b1 ] can sometimes be troublesome to develop well in these positions - however it has a good perch with [ N c3 ] to [ N e4 ] where it is nicely centralised and the advanced e-pawn prevents [ f4 ] from chasing it away. The [ d4 ] push to open the position may now also be a possibility for White.
 [ e4 ] , [ R f d6 ]  But now with doubled rooks this is a real threat.
 [ K f8 ] , [ Q f3 + ]  And here black resigns because if 12.ke7....13.q[ [ [ f7 ] ] ] mate. or if 12.kg8.....13.q[ [ [ f7 ] ] ] mate or 12.kg7...q[ [ [ f7 ] ] ] mate. So here's third actual game I've played here so comments and advice on what i could have done better are welcome:) Thanks for checking the annotations out.
 [ B x g5 ] , [ N f3 ]  but now black's structure doesn't favour his dark square bishop so in the future I'll benefit if I can exchange light squared bishops or even a knight by black's light squared bishop
 [ K f8 ]  [ K e1 ]  [ R c5 ]  [ N e3 ]  [ a5 ]  [ K d2 ]  [ b4 ]  [ B d1 ]  [ R c6 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ R d6 ]  [ B f3 ]  [ a4 ]  [ K c2 ]  [ R c6 + ]  [ K b1 ] , [ a3 ]  putting the pawns on the dark squares out of the range of the LSB
 [ e x d5 ] , [ Q x d5 ]  As white my play is likely too passive but I'll explain my reasons for the moves I choose.
 [ R a b1 ]  [ Q d8 ]  [ N c d1 ] , [ f5 ]  Opening the f file
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ N c3 ]  Oddly enough from here it looks like it will be dull.
 [ b5 ] , [ B x b5 ]  Now i started to my variante. If he can see my variante i will exchange my bishop to his rook. If he can't see i will get his queen.
 [ K f8 ] , [ g5 ]  49. ……. [ g5 ] - and foiled again!
 [ Q x c6 ]  [ Q x d4 ] , [ N c3 ]  We end up in a similar spot but instead Black has one less piece to work with making Black's job easier. White will now seek to get rid of the doubled f-pawn and hope to trade queens.
 [ e4 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ B x e4 + ]  [ K b3 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ N f4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ R f2 ]  [ c4 + ]  [ K a3 ] , [ a5 ]  27...[ a5 ] there are some winning lines that initiate with [ B b7 + ] available for the next couple of moves but were quite beyond black's ability to calculate the risk.
 [ B d6 ]  [ B e3 ] , [ B x f3 ]  Zwischenzug forcing me to capture his bishop since [ d5 ] immediately allows [ B x e2 ] [ Q x e2 ] [ Q d8 ] and black is a bishop up.
 [ e4 ] , [ c5 ]  at least a decent opening...
 [ R e e8 ]  [ B x d6 ]  [ R f7 ] , [ e5 ]  31. e5. The central Pawn mass is incredible to see in action. Pawns should not be pushing so many pieces around but that is exactly what is happening. W had to be really enjoying himself here.
 [ K h5 ]  [ Q x g3 ]  [ K h6 ]  [ Q g8 ]  [ K h5 ]  [ K g3 ]  [ K h6 ] , [ K f4 ]  
 [ c4 ]  [ R d7 ]  [ R f c8 ] , [ N a3 ]  White takes action:
 [ K x d8 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ c6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ N e7 ] , [ O-O ]  I considered castling queen's side but found it unwise because that was where he had his material momentum.
 [ Q d8 ]  [ Q b4 ]  [ N c7 ] , [ N c4 ]  White now threatens to capture the pawn on [ d6 ] with either queen or knight. Note that White could have taken the pawn on [ b7 ] with 17. Qx[ b7 ] but Black can then play 17. ... [ R c b8 ] and capture the pawn on [ b2 ] after the queen moves away putting a good rook deep into White's territory.
 [ N c4 ] , [ O-O ]  16. [ B x c4 ] allows black to free his position with dxc4.
 [ R f e8 ] , [ N d6 ]  Forcing another trade.
 [ K f4 ]  [ c3 ]  [ K e5 ]  [ c2 ]  [ K e6 ]  [ c1 = Q ]  [ K x e7 ] , [ Q c6 ]  White resigned here realizing Black has a simple K+Q checkmate. I think this game was probably winnable for White with more aggressive play in the opening. Because Black had so few options White could have taken time to improve until Black cracked. Trading off attackers made Black's job easier.
 [ Q x b4 ] , [ Q f6 + ]  Black emerges from his fog and rightfully gets things into gear.
 [ N g7 ]  [ a3 ] , [ B e7 ]  releasing my bishop and giving my self the option to castle
 [ N c3 ]  [ N b d7 ]  [ R a b1 ] , [ R b8 ]  16. I don't know if this was my best move
 [ c x d4 ] , [ h x g4 ]  If white takes with his queen then I have [ Q x d4 ] and a chance to attack the exposed white king with my queen and lsb
 [ c3 ] , [ Q a4 ]  There are worse moves I could have made here but not many.
 [ Q g6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ d6 ] , [ f4 ]  10. [ f4 ] - pawn stab at my knight now here comes a clearance of that tangled mass in the centre.
 [ R e4 e6 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ R x g6 + ]  [ K h8 ] , [ N e5 ]  Ne5? NxNe5. If whit takes the knight [ N h4 + ] gives black Rg6!
 [ R e1 ]  [ O-O ] , [ Q c2 ]  Doubling his attack on g6. My knight has no field to go to once it's attacked ! So probably white will come with an h-pawn-attack. Haven't seen that one coming in the game though :(
 [ Q h5 ]  [ g6 ]  [ Q h6 ]  [ N g5 ]  [ N x g5 ] , [ Q e7 ]  a little trick: Black gives a piece - after all is said and done a pawn - for drawing tempo...
 [ B x e6 ] , [ f x e6 ]  Creates an isolated pawn but allows more room for King to escape.
 [ N d7 ]  [ B x g7 ]  [ K x g7 ]  [ O-O ]  [ c x d5 ] , [ Q x d5 ]  Keeping good pawn structure and central control.
 [ Q h5 + ]  [ N f3 ] , [ R h2 + ]  And similarly a pinned knight allows black a move I hadn't considered. I'm fairly sure [ N f3 ] was still correct though. But I thought I had everything covered until black played this.
 [ B e3 ]  [ c5 ] , [ Q b3 ]  22. [ Q [ b3 ] ] - whoa there Glenda makes a short journey to [ b3 ] on her Nimbus 2000! She actually leaves the back two ranks!
 [ e x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ B b3 ] , [ B g7 ]  Putting his Bishop on a comfortable diagonal.
 [ N b d7 ] , [ f4 ]  my knight is not going anywhere!
 [ B d3 ] , [ N c6 ]  The Pivot Square is At d4.
 [ a4 ]  [ N d6 ]  [ f3 ] , [ f6 ]  Paving a way for the Black king.
 [ N f d4 ] , [ R e5 ]  I give up a pawn for activity though my rook is locked in when the knight comes to e6.
 [ h3 ] , [ R e8 ]  Ganging up on my Knight - but as already indicated it has a place to go.
 [ Q c2 ]  [ g6 ] , [ R a e1 ]  The rooks are lined up without needing to castle. If the king is well defended there is no reason why you can't advance him up a file to preserve tempo especially when it helps defensively.
 [ K g7 ] , [ R g1 + ]  ...and now my rook comes to help...
 [ e4 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ N f3 ]  A friendly game against a coworker. I'm white and start with the Open Game and he replies with the Nimzovich. White's reply is mainline but black's 2. ... [ N f6 ] will give black some problems.
 [ Q a5 ] , [ b6 ]  I had a hard time finding this move. All other moves seem to lose.
 [ N h6 + ]  [ K g7 ] , [ Q h3 ]  I still can't believe I did this I just didn't notice his bishop.
 [ d x e5 ]  [ d5 ] , [ N c5 ]  Aims at the e4-pawn.
 [ N d4 ] , [ f5 ]  !
 [ Q x h2 ] , [ N b5 ]  Four pawns down White tries for a counter attack. Of course Black has a few ways to stop the fork and White may have done better to play [ N x c6 ] aiming to relieve some pressure. Of course the fork is hardly the plan and White is looking for lines like 13.... [ R b8 ] 14. [ N x a7 ] [ N x a7 ] 15. [ B x a7 ] [ R a8 ] 16. Ra1; peeling off the a-pawn which could become a dangerous passer. But truth be told Black is perfectly safe after castling.
 [ K b2 ] , [ R f e8 ]  it seemed that 17.[ K b2 ] was silent move to protect the knight on [ c3 ] but no after 17.[ K b2 ] white threats [ N d5 ] and force the black queen retreat to passive position and get contra ply on the kings side for example : 17.Kb2-b5.18.Nd5-[ Q d8 ] (if 18...Qxd2.19.Nxe7+-Kh8.20.[ R x d2 ] +-) 19.h5-Rfe8.20.hxg-fxg.21.Bh6-Bh8.22.[ Q h2 ] and white with the advantage therefor the move 17...[ R f8 ] avoiding those threats because : 18.Nd5?-[ Q x d2 ] if 19. Nxe7+? [ R x e7 ] Evan 19...[ K f8 ] the white knight it trapped because of white must capture the queen on [ d2 ]  [ g5 ] , [ N h5 ]  blunder no white rueins his chaces for contra play its one siude game now 18.[ h5 ] was the best move for white
 [ B x b6 ] , [ a x b6 ]  He has three minor pieces to my Queen.
 [ Q h2 ]  [ O-O-O ] , [ R h8 ]  It seems a mistake but...
 [ N c5 ] , [ R e f1 ]  Finally realizing the passivity of that rook. A better move would have been [ g4 ] to immediately undermine my e4-[ f5 ] pawns. Perhaps he is concerned about giving his king too much air.
 [ K c7 ] , [ N e6 + ]  Black chose to chase the advanced pawn so that both his king and queen could cover [ b8 ] and prevent the promotion but now white has Mate in 3. The knight is forking the king and queen and black only has one square to which his beleaguered king can run.
 [ O-O ]  [ R e1 ]  [ d x c4 ] , [ B x c4 ]  This was the last move in Fritz's opening book so hereafter I will post Fritz's score.
 [ R c3 + ]  [ K g4 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ R d6 ]  [ R x b3 ]  [ R x d5 ]  [ R a3 ]  [ R x a5 ]  [ b3 ]  [ R b5 ] , [ b2 ]  Forcing a sacrifice.
 [ B g4 ] , [ d3 ]  Development of both sides is almost complete.
 [ K f2 ]  [ N x f4 ]  [ K e3 ] , [ N g2 + ]  this one he didn't miss. at least i could act in a way to salvage some damage.
 [ Q d6 ]  [ Q h7 + ]  [ K f8 ] , [ Q h8 + ]  with mate to follow.
 [ g x f6 ]  [ N e d4 ]  [ N x d4 ] , [ N x d4 ]  ...And he has a very nice outpost. But this move has a major downside.
 [ R e8 ]  [ g3 ]  [ K x b4 ]  [ R c2 ] , [ e4 ]  I honestly cannot recall the logic I had with this move. It seems a bit odd looking back on it now.
 [ N f6 ] , [ B d2 ]  Probably a weak move now that I think about it. White essentially wastes a move.
 [ R a6 ]  [ R g4 + ]  [ K f7 ] , [ c5 ]  planning attack on knight with 50.[ a3 ] 51.[ Q c4 ]  [ Q h7 + ]  [ K e8 ] , [ R g8 # ]  What an escape this was for me! I deserved to loose this game from an early stage but somehow snatched victory when I was on the verge of defeat.
 [ N c3 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ B b5 ] , [ B d7 ]  Opens the way for queen-side castling.
 [ B x b8 ]  [ R x b8 ] , [ Q c7 ]  A very good square for my queen virtually paralyzing all of blacks pieces.
 [ N x h3 ]  [ c6 ] , [ B x c6 ]  I grab the rook and when he plays [ c6 ] I got a little scared about xb5+. Best move is [ R f2 ] with mate in 15 (which I may or may not have been able to figure out). Bx[ c6 ] allows me a little more peace.
 [ K e3 ]  [ R d8 ]  [ R c1 ]  [ b6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ R d a8 ]  [ B d5 ]  [ R a4 a2 ]  [ R c b1 ]  [ R a8 a4 ]  [ K d2 ]  [ R d4 + ]  [ K e2 ]  [ N a4 ]  [ R x a2 ]  [ b x a2 ] , [ R a1 ]  not 37.Bxa2?-Nc3+.38.Ke3-Ra4.39.Bb3-[ R a3 ] .... and black win a bishop and the game .
 [ d5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ c6 ] , [ N f3 ]  3. ... [ c6 ] is not listed as one of the common replies for black so now I'm off in uncharted waters.
 [ N f5 ]  [ Q e2 ]  [ N h4 ]  [ Q x e6 + ]  [ K h8 ] , [ Q h3 ]  20. Qh3?! - would say [ R f d1 ] have been a better try here allowing the WK to run for the hills?
 [ N b6 ]  [ b4 ]  [ Q a3 ]  [ N b5 ]  [ Q a4 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ Q x c2 ]  [ R a c1 ]  [ Q h7 ]  [ b5 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ Q e4 ] , [ B f8 ]  protecting mate on [ e7 ]  [ Q x f6 ]  [ B f7 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ R b8 ] , [ R c7 ]  threatening mate with [ R e7 + ] [ B x e7 ] [ Q x e7 # ]  [ B g8 ]  [ R x e5 + ]  [ B e7 ]  [ Q x e7 + ]  [ Q x e7 ]  [ R e x e7 + ]  [ K d8 ]  [ R c d7 + ]  [ K c8 ]  [ R d c7 + ]  [ K d8 ]  [ R e6 ]  [ R x b5 ]  [ R d6 + ]  [ K e8 ]  [ N f6 + ]  [ K f8 ] , [ R d8 # ]  
 [ N f3 ] , [ a6 ]  This prevents [ B b5 ] after [ c5 ] so now I'm doing something at least!
 [ R c1 + ] , [ K d3 ]  no exchanges yet!
 [ c3 ]  [ b6 ]  [ f4 ]  [ B a6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ Q d7 ]  [ a4 ]  [ N b c6 ] , [ b4 ]  Now the [ c6 ] knight is choked
 [ g6 ]  [ h3 ]  [ B g7 ] , [ N c3 ]  9. [ N c3 ] - a developing move which backs up the e pawn. This pawn will be vulnerable to attack for the duration of the game but will never be taken.
 [ N e7 ] , [ f3 ]  Another reason why you don't advance the f pawn before you are secure. His e pawn was well defended by 2 pieces and was at no risk.
 [ K b1 ]  [ b x a2 + ] , [ K a1 ]  19. [ K a1 ] - Henry shelters behind an enemy pawn ensuring that for now the heavy black artilliary will be biting on granite.
 [ Q x e2 + ] , [ K h3 ]  White attempts to induce Black into 27...NxPch???. If Black falls for this 28 K-R4!!! wins [28...N-N7ch 29 K-[ N5 ] Q-K6ch 30 K-[ B6 ] with 31 QxP following as a deadly threat.] If Black plays 27...QxN equalizing the material White has 28 RxBch!!! K-N-2 29 R-N8ch K-[ R3 ] 30 RxPch!!! forcing mate.
 [ N d4 ]  [ R x d4 ]  [ e x d4 ] , [ Q x h3 ]  now white has big troubles. All pawns are separated Rook is powerless and have to choose between offer [ g4 ] and get Queen near by King or trying save everything.
 [ N e4 ]  [ B d4 ] , [ N x d4 ]  .....quickly removed by The Baron in this exchange.
 [ N d3 ] , [ c2 ]  Taking the knight would also have won.
 [ c4 ]  [ N g f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ O-O ] , [ Q d2 ]  Each side has been carrying out development for the last few moves.
 [ B e6 ] , [ e5 ]  I expect now [ R f5 ] and I will play [ Q e3 ] to pin the knight while defending the e pawn
 [ g x f6 ]  [ Q x h5 ] , [ Q x a2 ]  There is where White screwed up in a really big way with 17. [ Q d5 ] [ B h6 + ] 18. [ f4 ] [ B x f4 + ] 19. [ R d2 ] [ Q a1 # ] So strongest for White is ...
 [ B x e5 ]  [ R g f8 ]  [ Q h5 ] , [ R e c8 ]  Not 24. ... [ R x f2 ] 25. [ Q x e8 # ]  [ K a8 ] , [ R d4 ]  Playing for [ R b4 ] and [ Q f3 ] then d5-[ d6 ]  [ c5 ] , [ R c4 ]  Trying to provoke [ b5 ] because....
 [ R c2 ]  [ R a6 ]  [ K b3 ] , [ R c6 ]  Creating a blockade in front of the white c-pawn.
 [ K c5 ]  [ B f7 ]  [ N d6 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ K d4 ]  [ f4 ]  [ N e4 + ]  [ K f3 ]  [ c5 ]  [ a4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ b3 ]  [ b6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ N e4 ] , [ K g4 ]  things are drying up well for White...
 [ K g4 ] , [ K g7 ]  A bit surprised he didn't play [ K g6 ] instead.
 [ K g1 ] , [ N g4 ]  Spassky resigns as Tal's attack is overwhelming and his pieces stuck away from the action on the Q-side cannot come to the rescue of the besieged monarch.
 [ B a4 ]  [ O-O ] , [ B b3 ]  I regard this a waste of time and would have let the bishop on [ d7 ] bound to it's mundane task to keep an eye on c6. I was expecting a kingside attack by [ f4 ] [ g4 ] [ g5 ] etc.
 [ Q f6 ]  [ Q g2 + ]  [ K f8 ]  [ Q a8 + ]  [ K g7 ]  [ R g2 + ] , [ K h6 ]  Black is trying to trap me: on 47. Rg6?? Qg6! wins. I'll have none of that silliness however.
 [ B c5 ] , [ R b8 ]  Necessary to defend the 8 file.
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e5 ]  [ c5 ] , [ c3 ]  Nf3?! is totally winning for Black because after [ c x d4 ] [ N x d4 ] Black has an extra pawn in the centre my pawn on [ e5 ] is weak and Black is ahead in development.
 [ R f c1 ] , [ Q d6 ]  You now have the initiative so press on with the attack with 27...c4!
 [ b6 ] , [ N d4 ]  Double attacking his e pawn
 [ B c5 ]  [ b4 ]  [ B x f3 ]  [ Q x f3 ] , [ O-O ]  Well after trading a bishop for a knight I was an idiot here and forgot my bishop was under attack and castled instead.
 [ O-O ]  [ B g7 ] , [ R a d1 + ]  Getting this rook posted on an open file was a no brainer. I was hoping that he would go to [ c7 ] and he did.
 [ B e5 ]  [ B d5 ] , [ R x a4 ]  I remove the one on my far left creating more space...
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ a6 ]  [ B a4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ O-O ] , [ N x e4 ]  the capturing of an [ e4 ] pawn leads to the open Rui Lopez variation . Botvinik adtence to try this vriation as probebly he prerared at home for this contest .
 [ N f3 ] , [ B d6 ]  [ N c6 ] is the most common response but I like this.
 [ B a2 ]  [ B x d4 + ]  [ K h1 ]  [ B x b2 ]  [ R a b1 ] , [ Q d2 ]  Curiously chesscom's analysis states this as a slight error preferring Rc2.
 [ K d7 ] , [ R e8 ]  This is a blunder! Best was simply 25 [ R x h8 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ R d1 ] , [ N d2 ]  Nice try white can you do better?
 [ B e2 ] , [ O-O ]  Black tries to sacrifice a pawn in the hope of intensifying his attack but this is not really justified since white is ready to castle and the [ e3 ] pawn is very strong. 7. ... [ Q e7 ] would have mantained an advantage after 8. [ N x e5 ] [ N x e5 ] 9. [ d4 ] [ B x e2 ] 10. [ Q x e2 ] [ B d6 ] 11. [ d x e5 ] Bxe5.
 [ h6 ]  [ a x b5 ]  [ a x b5 ] , [ B b3 ]  And white resigns. Seems a little premature but black is going to take on [ [ d4 ] ] and have 5 pawns for the piece. 3 connected kingside and 2 queenside. Defending here seems hard to impossible. Black is the only one who can win this and the computer confirms they are winning. After taking on [ [ d4 ] ] they can go [ f5 ] [ K f6 ] or push [ c5 ] [ c4 ] or both. White just has to try to complicate this. I find the marshall to be fun to play and think you should give it a go. Give up a pawn in the center for great attacking chances. But if white defends well early you can still give up a piece for a chain of pawns. A little technique and those pawns become queens. 5 pawns is still a ton of pawns with diminished materiel.
 [ R x f4 ]  [ N x d3 ]  [ R f5 ] , [ b3 ]  He resigns when he realizes that the pawn cannot be stopped. The game was titled this way for a reason and it once more shows why Knights are my favorite Minor piece over Bishops.
 [ N g4 ] , [ B f4 ]  normally here will be played Nf3.
 [ R e8 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ B f8 ]  [ g4 ] , [ B h7 ]  14......... [ B [ h7 ] ] - the bishop is driven to [ h7 ] where he remains right up until the last move of the game!)
 [ B e7 ] , [ N c3 ]  Add the pressure in [ d5 ] square
 [ B e2 ] , [ B b7 ]  Finally activating the light squared bishop. I have my eye on the [ a2 ] pawn.
 [ R e8 ]  [ f x g6 ]  [ f x g6 ] , [ R e3 ]  Now an indecisive middle game. The hallmark of blitz chess!
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ h3 ] , [ O-O ]  Black has now extended the lead in development. White still has no pieces developed.
 [ B g2 ] , [ d5 ]  now he challenges for the center
 [ Q b5 ] , [ B b6 ]  if 13 ... [ B x f3 ] 14[ B x f3 ] [ B b6 ] 15[ Q g5 ] [ N f6 ] 16[ Q x g7 ] and white is much better. If 15 ...[ Q d8 ] 16 [ Q x g7 ] [ R f8 ] 17 [ B x b7 ] [ R b8 ] [ B c6 ] and blacks troubles are huge
 [ R h4 + ]  [ K g2 ]  [ R x h5 ] , [ Q d2 ]  Ok. I'm another pawn up but look at the sorry state of my rook on the h-file. He can easily use his king to trap my rook. Dangerous. I didn't spot it yet though.
 [ N f3 ] , [ N c6 ]  I do want to catch up and it is like what the rules were for the WTW games. That was to try your best against the runner which is what I'm doing. But Nathan shows that he's ready for action by deciding to pin my Nf6.
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ] , [ c4 ]  I'm playing the Queen's Gambit more or less my favorite when playing white.
 [ e6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N e7 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ a6 ]  the Najdorf extension to protect square b5...
 [ Q g6 ]  [ a5 ] , [ R e7 ]  ? I think this is the point at which whites game gains real winning chances the best defense was to play 23...[ b5 ]  [ a x b6 ] , [ a x b6 ]  Now I have a real target to attack and because of my 'doubled pawns' in the center white will entually be able to force the win of material. With blacks queen on the now unimportant king side white is going to switch to the queenside and centre
 [ B e4 ]  [ B x e4 ]  [ Q x e4 ]  [ K d7 ]  [ f4 ] , [ Q f5 ]  19. ........................ [ Q f5 ] this queen move controls quite a few squares and offers up a queen trade. White declines the trade and moves the queen back to g2. I now move my queen rook to [ f8 ] doubling up on the half-open f file and preparing to put my king on [ c8 ] achieving the planned Castle By Hand. However ..........
 [ N f3 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ R a2 ]  [ a5 ]  [ R g2 ]  [ N f4 ]  [ R g4 ]  [ N h5 ]  [ K h2 ]  [ R f g8 ]  [ R f g1 ]  [ K f7 ]  [ R f1 ]  [ R c f8 ]  [ g x f6 ]  [ e x f6 ]  [ f x g6 + ] , [ h x g6 ]  So far White doesn't seem to have achieved much. He has cleared the f and g files of his pawns but Black's remain...
 [ g6 ]  [ c3 ] , [ B g7 ]  4. ........ [ B g7 ] - predictable follow-up to g6.
 [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ] , [ Q x d5 ]  I've played the scandinavian with varied success against higher rated opponents it seems to catch some of them out. This is the Lasker variation
 [ R d2 + ]  [ N e2 ] , [ a5 ]  if Black plays [ R x b2 ] here then White can play [ R c6 + ] followed by [ R x a6 ]  [ R a7 ]  [ a4 ] , [ c4 ]  breaking up the Pawns
 [ Q c2 ]  [ Q b7 ] , [ R c1 ]  Black resigns the position is hopeless
 [ R x a3 ]  [ R x b6 ]  [ f6 ]  [ f4 ] , [ R a4 ]  White has to fight for a draw...
 [ B d3 ]  [ h6 ] , [ Q h4 ]  Tempting him to..
 [ B c5 ]  [ b4 ]  [ B e7 ] , [ N e2 ]  there goes a pawn
 [ d x e5 ]  [ B x e5 ] , [ K f8 ]  I am not sure why he did that as it will help me
 [ d x e5 ] , [ Q x h5 ]  His knight is free for taken and develope with tempo with attacking his king side.
 [ R a x d1 ] , [ e x f4 ]  I have a knight a pawn on [ e4 ] and the pawn on [ b2 ] threatened... but he cannot take all of them and actually i won't let him to
 [ e4 ] , [ e6 ]  Today's game features a player that plays regularly in blitz. In the first move I face a black [ e6 ] which means I'm probably going against the French defense a break from the Sicilian Defense games that I've played and encountered. I'm hoping for a Rubenstein variation as the best case scenario as white will have a great space advantage to work with.
 [ Q a7 ] , [ Q h5 ]  if my q can get in on [ e8 ]  [ N b2 ] , [ h x g7 ]  Too late for him- if he takes the pawn with his rook my queen will move to [ e8 ] and mate him
 [ f6 ]  [ a3 ]  [ B a5 ]  [ N h4 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ B x g4 ]  [ h x g4 ]  [ Q x g4 ]  [ R x h4 ]  [ Q x h4 ]  [ Q e7 ]  [ Q g3 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ h4 ]  [ O-O-O ]  [ O-O-O ]  [ B x c3 ]  [ B x c3 ]  [ c5 ]  [ f4 ]  [ b6 ]  [ h5 ]  [ N f8 ]  [ f5 ]  [ N h6 ]  [ Q h3 ]  [ Q f7 ]  [ g4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ B d2 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ Q a2 ]  [ c3 ]  [ c4 ]  [ Q f3 ]  [ R d3 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ Q b3 ]  [ R x d3 ] , [ c x d3 ]  
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ d4 ]  [ e x d4 ] , [ c3 ]  Danish Gambit
 [ K d8 ] , [ Q f6 + ]  White sacrifices his queen with check to decoy Black's knight away from protecting the e7-square.
 [ N x a2 + ]  [ K b1 ]  [ N c b4 ] , [ N x b5 ]  White takes the free pawn leaving [ N x c2 ] defended only by the king.
 [ K d5 ] , [ R b8 ]  White returns to guarding the b pawn. The purpose of all this was to separate my king from my pawns.
 [ K f2 ]  [ K h3 ] , [ Q g3 # ]  checkmate I had it even is he did [ K h1 ] [ Q g2 # ]  [ e4 ] , [ e6 ]  I really don't like playing against the French; pushing the e-pawn to [ e5 ] seems dubious but White often ends up playing it. But not here...
 [ Q d4 + ] , [ B e3 ]  He is getting his bishop back but helping my development.
 [ K g8 ]  [ B h7 + ] , [ K f7 ]  Not exactly a bunder since [ K h8 ] lead to a well-known [ N g6 + ] KxN NxR++ and white seems to win the attack - if not the game.
 [ B d3 ] , [ N f6 ]  ...so now the solid move is f3. But the Morphy Fisher and Tal games are too present not to take advantage. So I played...
 [ B f3 ] , [ K c3 ]  I was expecting black to get his king into h1.
 [ b4 ] , [ Q c6 ]  This was a relatively simple move as every other move lost the Queen.
 [ R a6 ]  [ Q e3 ]  [ B g4 ] , [ B x f7 + ]  24. [ B x f7 + ] the only way to minimise the damage is to isolate all of Thierry's remaining pawns so that they become targets for my remaining pieces.
 [ B d7 ]  [ Q x b7 ] , [ B c6 ]  ?? A losing blunder much better was 8… Nc6! developing a piece and allowing the queen to protect the rook but now things are going to start looking very ugly for black.
 [ R g1 ]  [ B x e4 ]  [ B f6 ]  [ g6 ] , [ N d2 ]  Activating more pieces. Note my glut of pieces on the Queenside none of whom can effect the game
 [ g4 ]  [ N d6 ]  [ R f d1 ] , [ c6 ]  I want to move my [ N d5 ] to [ f4 ] but now is not the right time.
 [ B x d7 ] , [ K x f6 ]  Black's king defends both pawns. Black is ahead by three pawns and has the bishop pair to guide them to promotion. White correctly resigns.
 [ O-O ]  [ N c6 ] , [ N x c6 ]  Supposedly this takes us back out of book. It is a bit of a concession I admit having sacrificed a pawn I don't wont to be trading pieces so willingly especially my centralised developed knight. Yet on the other hand moving it else ware seems like a concession in time and there isn't a good way to defend it plus I feel as though the pawn formation black will be left with will make it hard to coordinate and activate his pieces in particular by closing the c file I can probably gain some time making the black queen a little uncomfortable. Not that moving the knight would be bad both [ N c2 ] and [ N f3 ] were also worth considering
 [ K e8 ]  [ B c2 ] , [ R c8 ]  Activating *one* Rook. Both KR's are still relatively useless.
 [ B a5 ] , [ R e7 ]  28. [ R e7 ] - here I resign the game on the grounds of ruinous loss of material. I am already a pawn down and the pawn on [ g2 ] must now drop and I have a terrible feeling that Old Matey cannot be too far away (although Jeff did not announce it). So I waved the white flag. Another disappointing show from The Beginner with the Class A Rating.
 [ N x d5 ] , [ B g3 + ]  The white king is surrounded and in serious pressure.
 [ c3 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ d3 ]  never play [ e5 ] here...
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ B b5 ]  The Ruy Lopez achieved. Hoerah for me!
 [ N x e4 ] , [ Q x e4 ]  I was about to play [ d x e4 ] without much thought but I decided this gives him fewer choices. He has to castle. Then I'll play [ Q g4 ] and see how he can deal with the threat on g7. If he plays [ e5 ] I'll challenge it with d4.
 [ a6 ]  [ N c5 ]  [ N x c5 ]  [ b x c5 ] , [ Q d7 ]  21. ............. [ Q d7 ] - this move was necessary because the f pawn is hanging. However it wastes a vital tempo. If Glenda had gone straight to [ [ c7 ] ] then I would have had time to back off my bishop to [ c8 ] and swap off one pair of rooks on the b file. In a pressure situation like this time is of the essence! If I had perhaps got in an earlier [ g6 ] then Glenda could have gone straight to [ [ c7 ] ] and all may have been well.
 [ Q b4 + ] , [ K f7 ]  23. ..... [ K f7 ] - brave Henry stays near the centre.
 [ R e5 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ R x f5 ]  [ R e8 ] , [ R e5 ]  Trying to trade rooks as I had planned.
 [ K h1 ] , [ N g5 ]  I now take the Isolated pawn for free :)
 [ R b2 ]  [ N c7 ]  [ K e5 ] , [ K e1 ]  Or 74. [ N a8 ] [ K d6 ] or 74. [ N e8 ] Rb7.
 [ b4 ]  [ a6 ] , [ a4 ]  Trying to force a breakthrough on the queenside because the centre and the kingside are now locked. I guess Black was hoping he could hold up the queenside as well when he sacrificed the exchange. Another plan was to get the king involved: 27.Kg2.
 [ N c3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ d3 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ] , [ N g5 ]  Probably a little premature but I'm trying to tempt black into a pawn advance in front of his king in the hope it introduces weaknesses that I can try to take advantage of analysis calls this an inaccuracy
 [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ] , [ N f6 ]  Playing back at the lone pawn and developing at the same time.
 [ R g2 + ]  [ K h4 ]  [ R g4 + ]  [ K h3 ] , [ R x a4 ]  He gets my pawn by checking. At this point I realize that he might promote one of those pawns which would not end up well for me.
 [ B x b7 ]  [ R d b8 ]  [ B e4 ]  [ R b a8 ]  [ a3 ]  [ R a5 ] , [ R d6 ]  I try to increase my advantage.
 [ B x f5 ]  [ N g5 ]  [ R f7 f6 ]  [ Q h4 ]  [ h5 ] , [ h3 ]  This is a dubious option which was countered by a more dubious reply. 30. [ N e4 ] keeps things solid.
 [ Q g3 + ] , [ K h7 ]  Now he's running out of checks though.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ d6 ]  Philidor's Defense -- except that Philidor was not yet playing competitive chess. Maybe the great Frenchman was observing and learning what NOT to do?
 [ B b4 ] , [ d3 ]  Not worried about [ B x c3 ] cause that will end up being an advantage to me. The pin will not last long due to my plan to castle.
 [ R a c8 ] , [ Q f5 ]  The queen invades into black's position
 [ d4 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ e4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ f5 ]  [ e x f6 ]  [ e ]  [ p ] , [ d5 ]  I gain a pawn advantage because Black can't recapture due to having to protect the knight.
 [ R g f3 ]  [ Q c4 ] , [ R d1 ]  I knew one pawn would drop--I decided to save d4.
 [ B x f3 ]  [ g x f3 ] , [ R f e8 ]  In this position he wants to exchange our Rooks. However I think that he is attacking my DSB but make a serious miscalculation. Until now I completely forgot that this bishop is actually protected.
 [ Q x b5 ] , [ Q h3 ]  31. ... Qh3!! needs a pair of exclamations. Well maybe only 1. It's one of the scariest moves I've played in a long time. Black is leaving his rook en prise and white can capture it with check gaining a tempo. That's usually certain doom but oddly enough in this case even that extra tempo won't let the white queen return to defense in time as she has to run around the forest of black pawns. There is always the fear of perpetual check and 3-move repetitions but nothing of that sort presents itself to white either so it's time for the poor rook to take one for the team.
 [ Q d7 ] , [ Q a6 + ]  60. [ Q e6 + ] ...... DRAW!!! Yup after 60 moves the game is drawn wheew and double wheew. So much so that after I got the game drawn I googled Youtube and downloaded these tracks to boogie on down in order to release loadsa adrenalin. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O972NI6s958 then http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otBdxNmEq6k and http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpP2d5NBoqU. So after chilling out to those lurvely 80s soul funk grooves I then annotated the game. There will be more games from me to annotate later on but for now I hope you have all had a good read. Bye for now - Joanne
 [ B e6 ] , [ B h6 ]  White wants to deprive Black of the bishop pair so decides to swap dark-square bishops.
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ f3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ O-O-O ]  We arrive at a very well known theoretical position in the Sicilian Dragon with 9.O-O-O; the other main option being 9.[ B c4 ] for white.
 [ N e5 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ Q d3 ] , [ B e7 ]  My other choice was c5. I figure I'm going to have to move it eventually and it would save me a move but I wasn't comfortable with him trading and then playing Na4.
 [ R c1 c2 ]  [ K b7 ]  [ K f2 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ R d5 ]  [ R h d8 ]  [ R d4 ] , [ B e5 ]  23. .......... [ B e5 ] - not good to exchange when you are down but I felt I just had to relieve the pressure that the two white cannons were generating.
 [ K a3 ] , [ R d x b2 ]  Can you see that after [ R b1 ] mate is threatened?
 [ f x e6 ]  [ O-O-O ] , [ e5 ]  here we are. the white game is quite disorganized but i still miss opportunities to plan
 [ d6 ]  [ B b2 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ B c4 ]  Better is [ B e2 ] this move allows black to gain a sight advantage after the move [ e6 ] threating d5.
 [ e4 ] , [ c6 ]  Caro Kann: unpretentious and solid. Beware.
 [ B h6 ]  [ B h8 ] , [ N f4 ]  I didn't quite know what to think at this point. white has a lot of pieces around my king does he have an attack? I dont know. I chose to continue with my own plans by making use of all these squares I have worked so hard to create.
 [ B h7 + ]  [ K f7 ] , [ B g6 + ]  Black resigned there is mate in 1 or 2 moves i.e. 33.- [ K e7 ] 34.[ Q g7 # ]  [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ d3 ]  [ c6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ O-O ] , [ d5 ]  Vienna game - a little early to open the center but ok I guess.
 [ R x g1 ] , [ N f2 # ]  Very beautiful. I never would have come to this move sequence had I not read about it somewhere. Readers' comments are warmly invited.
 [ N x c5 ]  [ a7 ]  [ R x a7 ] , [ R x a7 ]  Three pawns and the exchange up the game is effectively White's now. I played a couple more token moves then resigned.
 [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ g6 ]  '!' - Well not exactly! In any event Black is quite pleased to enter into his pet Dragon variation.
 [ Q a5 ]  [ Q e3 ] , [ Q h5 ]  With all the attacks neutralized figured this is a good time to attack. Though mine isn't as strong at the moment...
 [ N x e3 + ]  [ K e2 ] , [ N x d4 # ]  28. ..... [ N x d4 ] MATE!! ...... with a cadaverous knight!
 [ c x d5 ] , [ f4 ]  The plan is to push [ f5 ] and make his king vulnerable.
 [ K f8 ] , [ K e3 ]  Continuing to head for the main theater of action.
 [ B x g5 ]  [ h6 ]  [ B h4 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ Q h5 ]  [ N b a6 ] , [ N f3 ]  [ Q x f7 ] at once was just an invitation to Rf8. But now this N has a target.
 [ N x d3 ] , [ e x d3 ]  ? I overlooked White's next move. I thought the attack on [ c2 ] would win the exchange.
 [ c x d5 ] , [ B f4 ]  defends [ N e5 ] to freeing the queen for other tasks.
 [ e6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f d7 ]  [ f4 ]  [ a6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ c5 ]  [ B e3 ] , [ c x d4 ]  [ Q b6 ] seems okay also.
 [ a4 ]  [ R b5 ]  [ R c6 + ]  [ R c5 ]  [ R x c5 + ]  [ d x c5 ] , [ b2 ]  First come first served. The White resigns.
 [ B e5 ] , [ h3 ]  freeing the pawn so that the King can move. White decides to go for the h pawn to advance so that the black bishop gets useless. Right now there is only one pawn that black could attack with his Bishop. On the otherside there are 3 pawns on black's side on dark squares. However this alows a saving move for black: 29 ... Bg3!
 [ R c2 ] , [ Q d7 ]  I suppose I wanted to push the c pawn and open the board but this move seems less than aggressive.
 [ N x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ Q x d5 ] , [ O-O ]  ?? He said "Castle." I understand why he played this as the idea is to castle early and often to get your K to safety. However this is a blunder and an occasion where guidelines must be broken to avoid losing material. In it I said normally that's the best move. But the problem is that leaves your LSB en-prise. And he responded by saying "Oh yea" So I responded by telling him that in this case best was to either play 9.[ B b5 ] or retreat back to the seventh rank or play 9.[ B b1 ] The idea is castle early and often but at the same time it's important to access the position of say what's hanging does the move played present a risk. Can it be taken and what can my opponent. And always be ready for anything and everything or as they say "Expect the Unexpected." @superandy: That's about doing your HW and another example of being your own spectator. One thing to note is that there are general principles which aren't rules but guidelines. However if following them means a mate from your opponent or loss of material then the guidelines have to be broken.
 [ B e3 ] , [ Q b6 ]  Black piles the pressure on [ d4 ] and also threatens to nick a pawn on b2.
 [ N f6 ] , [ B g2 ]  or [ N c3 ] [ d5 ] cx[ d5 ] Nx[ d5 ] Bg2...
 [ d4 ] , [ B g4 ]  10. ..... [ B g4 ] - Fou Leblanc develops with a pin on the knight on f3.
 [ B d7 ] , [ h3 ]  Squeezing black in and providing an escape route for my dsb.
 [ c x b5 ]  [ B x b5 + ]  [ N b d7 ] , [ O-O-O ]  Pressuring the pin
 [ B x d4 + ]  [ K h1 ] , [ Q x h4 ]  Now Black has a 3 pawn advantage for which White has no compensation.
 [ N d7 ] , [ N a4 ]  Adding pressure to QB5.
 [ h3 ] , [ O-O-O + ]  ...so I can castle queenside and place him in check.
 [ Q g7 ] , [ f4 ]  !? Now White tries to break up the center a bit to give him more room to operate even though it obliterates my King-side defenses.
 [ N e4 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ B x e4 ]  [ N c4 ]  [ B f3 ] , [ K e7 ]  24. ... [ N x b2 ] is met with 25. [ R f b1 ] and then black's pawn on [ b7 ] falls. Connecting the rooks and getting the black king out into the path of white's passed pawn seems a greater priority. White could have made this more difficult by getting a rook onto [ e1 ] though he hasn't had much chance yet. 24. ... Ke7! takes the initiative before white closes it down.
 [ B f4 + ] , [ R e5 ]  The dismal fate of the rook underscores the fact that Black's e-file counter play was a mirage. Unfortunately for the rook this is easily the best move Black has: 14 . . . [ K c5 ] leads to a forced mate after 15 [ b4 + ] [ K x b4 ] 16 [ B e6 ] [ R x e6 ] 17 [ d x e6 ] [ d3 ] 18 Qb2+; 14 . . . [ N e5 ] fails against 15 [ N e4 + ] [ K e7 ] 16 Bg5+; and 14 . . . [ B e5 ] is undone by 15 [ N b5 + ] [ K e7 ] 16 [ B x d7 ] [ B x d7 ] 17 [ B x e5 ] [ K f8 ] 18 Nxc7.
 [ B g7 ] , [ h4 ]  Attacking inmediately. I've seen this move on DB and it is in the spirit of the London system. Probably is a bad one tough... :-)
 [ B g3 ] , [ N x e4 ]  And then I could finally grab the pawn on [ e4 ] while attacking the bishop.
 [ d x c5 ] , [ N a4 ]  Now blacks position starts to fall. [ N a4 ] has a double threat on [ c5 ] and both of whites bishops are active. The c-file is also open for whites rooks. Lastly look at blacks pieces...they are all very inactive besides the Queen which is soon to be threatened.
 [ R g2 ]  [ c2 ]  [ R g1 ]  [ B e5 ]  [ h7 ] , [ K d2 ]  I resigned here because it is easily won for black. He can give up the bishop for me pawn and then he could play c1. If I try to check him once he gets his king to [ b1 ] the game is lost.
 [ Q x d4 ] , [ b6 ]  the [ b6 ] [ e6 ] [ B c5 ] plan is a bit slow
 [ c x d5 ] , [ N f5 ]  Forcing the black's queen to move and opening spaces for mine!
 [ h3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ g3 ]  A very defensive setup from white. I debate whether to proceed with natural development or grab more space...
 [ e x d6 ]  [ Q x d6 ]  [ Q d3 ] , [ N d7 ]  This is the latest of what is going on. I will keep you updated.
 [ R e8 ] , [ R f c1 ]  Finally attacks the unguarded c-pawn.
 [ N d4 ] , [ B c4 ]  protecting my [ b3 ] pawn.
 [ b x a6 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ h x g5 ]  [ B x g5 ]  [ R c8 ]  [ R x a6 ]  [ R c7 ]  [ R d x c6 ] , [ R b7 ]  trying to avoid unnecessary swapping when material down but it makes no difference
 [ N e2 ] , [ B e7 ]  White develops his g knight to [ e2 ] ready to castle. I develop my DB to [ e7 ] and now I can castle.
 [ R x e4 ] , [ N f6 ]  This move attacks the R and brings a piece closer to the king to aid in defense. Just to note that this knight has now made a circuit from f6-d5-e7-d5-f6. That is a lot of moves for one piece and as a result black still has queen and rook in starting position while white has queen and rook active.
 [ Q c2 ]  [ a6 ]  [ a3 ] , [ h6 ]  Attacking the B and creating "luft" for the King.
 [ R x d4 + ] , [ B d3 ]  So I can take the [ g4 ] pawn and the game goes on. But I tried something stronger again.
 [ N g4 + ]  [ K f5 ] , [ N x f2 ]  at this point Black is a full rook behind: but the sorry bunch on the other side of the board leaves much to desire...
 [ Q e3 ] , [ Q x f2 + ]  ...before deciding it's worth removing the pawn...
 [ Q c5 + ]  [ K h1 ]  [ h4 ] , [ N e4 ]  Black can win the pawn on [ c2 ] but the diagonal is more important than a pawn. The threat of 16. ... [ h3 ] looms large as well.
 [ d x e3 ]  [ f x e3 ] , [ B b4 ]  Developing with ideas of counterattack. However as 16.[ Q x g7 ] was probably very good for White maybe 15...[ N c6 ] was the better option.
 [ N f6 ] , [ f3 ]  The main line is 5. Nc3. But this move is in the DB and has a much better record as white though it's only played about one time for every 45 times the main line is played. Still the guys playing it have equally high ratings so they likely know what they're doing so I thought I'd give it a try.
 [ N f6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ g6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ e4 ]  [ O-O ] , [ B e2 ]  6..[ c5 ] 7.O-O [ c d4 ] is the Sicilian Maroczy Bind which is how I play against 6. [ B e2 ]  [ e5 ]  [ O-O ] , [ N a6 ]  Oddly I have never faced this despite being a 1.[ N f3 ] / 1. [ d4 ] player OTB and in correspondence for some time. I have also played 7...e[ d4 ] myself and it's good fun. I react rather badly to an unfamiliar situation...
 [ f x e5 ]  [ Q c6 ] , [ R h e1 ]  19. [ R h e1 ] - time to centralise that rook me hearties! I have got a plan up my sleeve concerning that [ e5 ] pawn. Later on that little foot soldier as Blake would say will become a footman in drag a pretender to Glenda! That is still a long long way away though.
 [ Q x d2 ] , [ R x c7 ]  3 moves to mate...
 [ B x g5 ]  [ h x g5 ]  [ K g2 ] , [ c5 ]  Push the bishop back and claim [ e4 ] so I can hit c3. The possibilit y of having an adcanced d-pawn is suddenly real and must always be watched.
 [ B x c3 + ]  [ b x c3 ]  [ N g4 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ f4 ] , [ Q e7 ]  Threatening Qc5.
 [ K g2 ] , [ e x d4 ]  now black opens up the game as his rooks can take the e-file
 [ K g2 ] , [ d6 ]  White went in Full Guru Mode: spending his last minute to try and get out of this; he timed out... Black had still 5:27 left on the clock...
 [ Q b1 + ]  [ K e2 ]  [ Q b2 + ]  [ K e1 ] , [ g x h5 ]  This was starting to look quite grim for me.
 [ d x e4 ] , [ N g5 ]  unusual configuration or is it not?
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ d5 ]  [ b5 ]  [ c x b5 ]  [ a6 ]  [ e3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ O-O ]  All the game started from this position with White to move.
 [ N x d2 ] , [ Q x d2 ]  Still good for white.
 [ N g4 + ] , [ K g1 ]  This appears to get the white king into a safer position however my queen is well placed to apply serious pressure
 [ N b4 ]  [ B b5 + ]  [ B d7 ]  [ B x d7 + ] , [ Q x d7 ]  13. ..... [ Q x d7 ] - bishop trade.
 [ N f3 ] , [ B d6 ]  I develop my knight to [ f3 ] and black brings out his DB to d6.
 [ Q x c2 ]  [ c5 ] , [ B e3 ]  Black has just prevented Nc5: frustrated Black is attacking the [ c5 ] Sicilian troublemaker; this move however does not belong in this opening: at least not in this stage; better [ c4 ] [ f5 ] Ng5...
 [ a6 ] , [ R a4 ]  ...but it must now cover my right-hand flank...
 [ Q h6 + ] , [ K g3 ]  Again safer is [ K g1 ] but the game is still even...
 [ B f4 ] , [ O-O ]  Well castling is a waste of time in the mid-end game. He lost tempo. He should have castled earlier
 [ Q x e5 + ]  [ B e7 ] , [ N f3 ]  Now the trick is to develop and force White to move his Queen around as much as possible
 [ b4 ]  [ b3 ] , [ R x c3 ]  giving up the exchange for an advanced passed pawn
 [ K d4 ]  [ K d6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ c5 + ]  [ K c3 ]  [ b4 + ]  [ K d3 ]  [ K e5 ]  [ K e3 ]  [ h5 ]  [ h4 ]  [ K f5 ]  [ K f3 ]  [ g5 ]  [ h x g5 ]  [ K x g5 ]  [ K f2 ]  [ K f6 ]  [ K e2 ]  [ K e6 ] , [ K f2 ]  dead drawn position with black to move.... draw offered by white and accepted by black.
 [ c3 ]  [ Q d7 ]  [ B b5 ] , [ h6 ]  To prevent [ B g5 ] which could bring trouble in the center
 [ Q x f3 ] , [ f6 ]  Right now he has to move the Bishop then I take the d pawn with my queen. I bet you can see what I missed and what he played next move. Easy to see when you have someone hinting that something is on! Harder to see a couple of moves back when I exchanged on f3.
 [ B x e6 ]  [ B x e6 ]  [ Q e7 ] , [ O-O ]  OK attacks are forming. I love that open e-file and the black king with nowhere to castle. Black cannot play 14. ... Qxe6?? for then he loses his queen to 15. Rae1.
 [ Q e4 ] , [ R c1 ]  I use the rook to cut off an escape square for the queen
 [ K g2 ] , [ Q g5 ]  White can still not take that Knight back. But 15. Ke2? [ N g3 ] ! 16. [ h x g3 ] [ Q h2 ] 17. [ K d1 ] ([ K f1 ] [ Q g2 ] ) [ f x g3 ] (attacks Q with Rook) gets real dangerous for white.
 [ B c4 + ]  [ K c3 ]  [ B b5 ] , [ d7 ]  49. [ [ d7 ] ] - I now force Elia to give up his bishop for the [ [ d7 ] ] pawn.
 [ B c4 ] , [ N a5 ]  He attacks me I attack him. My knight finds itself back on [ a5 ]  [ B d5 ] , [ N b7 ]  Maybe heading for [ c5 ] or [ d6 ]  [ K e7 ] , [ f5 ]  I block the position a little. Knights like blocked positions bishops like open positions.
 [ N d7 ]  [ Q e1 ]  [ e6 ]  [ Q e3 ]  [ B x f3 ]  [ N x f3 ] , [ Q c7 ]  It is obvious now that the black pawns are dominant in the center of the board and that the white pawn on [ e5 ] is more difficulty for the white than for the black.
 [ d x c4 ]  [ B a3 ] , [ R e8 ]  White is getting in trouble...
 [ R g6 ]  [ B f1 ] , [ N h5 ]  Now all Black's pieces are involved in the attack. White's forces are spread across the board.
 [ Q c6 ] , [ B b7 ]  ?? This however is the move that loses material because as noted above you wouldn't have lost anything else had you played 15...[ R b8 ]  [ Q x b7 ] , [ Q e8 ]  My guess is that Sue wanted to place pressure on the center. Now I was wondering what to do here but figured that I could liquidate by placing her in check. The idea is to exchange when ahead.
 [ a4 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ a3 ] , [ b3 ]  That should clog up the queenside for me.
 [ N x e4 ]  [ B x e4 ]  [ Q e8 ] , [ b4 ]  I was hoping for an exchange but Black was not open to that plan.
 [ e x d5 ]  [ O-O ] , [ d x c6 ]  This favors black's development. [ N f3 ] was more solid. After 7. [ N f3 ] SF5 proposes 7. ... [ N f5 ] 8. [ B b3 ] [ c x d5 ] 9. [ g4 ] [ N d6 ] 10. [ h3 ] with a slight advantage for black.
 [ c5 ]  [ B a4 ]  [ B d4 ]  [ Q d3 ]  [ c4 ]  [ Q d2 ] , [ B g7 ]  Better was Rc7. Cautious play can be dangerous too!
 [ b4 ]  [ a6 ]  [ K f2 ] , [ N e5 ]  Now the position is changing . White is pressuring the queenside and the rook wants to get to [ h6 ]  [ R h6 ]  [ N c4 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ d3 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B e8 ]  [ R x f6 ] , [ B g6 ]  A necessary repositioning. The d pawn has to be pushed and white has to blockade it or try to win it outright. In either case his winning chances are decreasing.
 [ Q g4 ]  [ f5 ]  [ Q g3 ]  [ N x e2 ] , [ K x e2 ]  White can't castle directly but this isn't a major problem as [ R h e1 ] [ K f1 ] will mean he has "castled" the long way
 [ Q a1 + ]  [ K d2 ]  [ N c3 + ]  [ N d6 ] , [ N x d1 ]  And the end is near
 [ Q x a4 ] , [ c3 ]  This I think is a good move looking to rid himself of the weak [ c4 ] pawn & if takes somewhat damaging White's queenside pawn structure.
 [ K x e5 ]  [ Q e7 + ]  [ K x d4 ]  [ Q e3 + ]  [ K c3 ]  [ B e2 + ]  [ K b4 ] , [ R f b1 # ]  
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ c6 ] , [ N f3 ]  A principle says that when black moves this pawn I have to move mine c pawn to in order to provide room for my Q to [ b2 ] in case of Qb6. I missed this "on purpose" to test some ideas similar to a game I was engaged in where I missed by mistake the c pawn movement.
 [ B e3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ f3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ e6 ] , [ O-O-O ]  All "by the book" so far. We blasted through the opening in half a day.
 [ B x b5 ]  [ a x b5 ] , [ B g5 ]  attacking hoping he'll take the bait.
 [ R e8 ] , [ c4 ]  Maybe white is hoping that black would attack this pawn en passant.
 [ Q x h5 ]  [ N x g7 + ]  [ K f7 ]  [ N x h5 ]  [ K g6 ]  [ B f6 ] , [ K x h5 ]  i'm down in material here though i will be able to make it up by move 25.
 [ Q d4 + ]  [ K g6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ R e7 ]  [ c5 ]  [ K f5 ]  [ c6 ]  [ K e6 ]  [ Q d8 ]  [ K f7 ]  [ c7 ]  [ R e1 + ]  [ K g2 ]  [ R e2 + ]  [ K f3 ]  [ R x c2 ]  [ Q d5 + ]  [ K f6 ]  [ Q g5 + ]  [ K e6 ]  [ Q g6 + ]  [ K e7 ] , [ Q x c2 ]  Mate in 3 - 66...[ K f6 ] 67.[ c8 = Q ] [ K e7 ] 68.Q2[ f5 ] [ K d6 ] 69.[ Q c d7 # ]  [ K f6 ] , [ Q c6 + ]  Unsure why this pleased me so much but White missed it allowing me to last 1 extra move. :o) 67...[ K g7 ] 68.[ c8 = Q ] [ a5 ] 69.Q8[ d7 + ] [ K h8 ] 70.[ Q a8 # ]  [ K g7 ] , [ c8 = R ]  Rubbing salt into my wounds since he doesn't need the Queen he doesn't bother to get one.
 [ B x d4 ]  [ B x d4 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ c6 ]  It's time for black to get his knight to a more effective square; this move appears to make black's pawn majority more secure. Also it neutralizes white's other long range bishop.
 [ N x d6 ] , [ Q e1 ]  The pawn is gone anyway. 22. [ K g2 ] does not save the day but tries to deal with any pins on the back rank [ Q x c3 ] 23. [ B d2 ] [ Q b2 ]  [ N x c3 ]  [ B d2 ]  [ N e2 + ] , [ K h2 ]  Waste of a move. 26. [ K g2 ] [ R a2 ]  [ K g2 ] , [ h5 ]  All of your pawns are tied up and your Bishop is the only piece you have which can move ([ N h2 ] Rg1#). So you may have tried to relocate your Bishop to the K-Side as a last ditch attempt via [ b4 ] and d6.
 [ O-O ]  [ N c3 ] , [ N c6 ]  The knight is well placed on [ c6 ] in most lines of the Dutch often contesting or supporting the [ d4 ] and [ e5 ] squares and well placed for re-development ala a Steinitz-ean ...Nc6-d8-f7.
 [ Q e7 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ B x e5 ]  [ d x e5 ] , [ B b5 + ]  I switch my attack from [ f7 ] to the queen wing.
 [ Q g3 + ]  [ K h7 ]  [ Q b8 ] , [ Q e3 + ]  Checks and protects a-pawn.
 [ g4 ]  [ N h7 ] , [ g5 ]  This would have been a great time for white to pause and take a look at things... My clock was at some seven minutes my opponent was already some three minutes behind in time... Had I done so I surely would have found 13. Qe1! [ Q b6 ] 14. Kh1! followed by [ Q g3 ] and pick it up from there... But I wanted to beat him to g5...
 [ B x f3 ]  [ Q x f3 ]  [ Q x d4 ]  [ R d1 ]  [ Q e4 ]  [ Q x e4 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ R x d6 ]  [ R f d8 ] , [ B f4 ]  ? Losing a pawn for no compensation.
 [ Q d2 ]  [ N a5 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ] , [ B d6 ]  in this position white have big advantange and the strange thing is that the intrnationl master Morey cant do nothing about it even moves like 15...Nc4.16.Bxc4-Rxc4.17.0-0.... or 15...Qe7+.16.Be2-Nc4.17.d6! now white getting material advantage .
 [ R x c6 ]  [ B x c6 ]  [ b x a5 ]  [ Q x c5 + ]  [ B e3 ]  [ Q d5 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ Q e4 ]  [ Q f2 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ h3 ]  [ Q b4 ] , [ B d2 ]  and I offered a draw which Paul quickly accepted. I didn't think either of us had an edge here.
 [ Q f4 ] , [ R e d5 ]  Doubling the rooks.
 [ B x b2 ] , [ Q g5 ]  The [ g2 ] pawn is momentarily available. Pushing it opens the rook diagonal which I can exploit well if ever QxP[ e4 ] becomes available.
 [ d4 ]  [ B b4 + ]  [ c3 ]  [ B a5 ]  [ Q a4 + ] , [ c6 ]  A blunder. Many times when the queen does this double attack with check the knight can go to [ [ c6 ] ] and protect the attacked piece at either [ a5 ] or [ b4 ] this is one of those times. Or if the knight Itself is attacked it can go to [ [ c6 ] ] and block the check.
 [ K d1 ]  [ Q x e4 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ h6 ] , [ B d3 ]  Starting to attack black's King side
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B b5 ] , [ g6 ]  These guys really want to prove something! Men! #CarlsenCaruana
 [ d4 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ e3 ]  [ e6 ] , [ N f3 ]  The cleared long diagonal is always interesting to play with.
 [ R a d8 ] , [ R x e6 ]  Black cannot move his queen anywhere it won't get traded for a rook with a discovered check. White's bishop isn't protected however. So black's next move is only slightly foolish looking.
 [ K b1 ] , [ N b6 ]  Since white castled on the queenside and to avoid the block of white pawns in the center black brings minor pieces over to the queenside.
 [ N x d4 ]  [ O-O-O ]  [ B e3 ]  [ B b4 ] , [ N d e2 ]  After 10 P-[ B3 ] BxN ch 11 PxB B-[ Q2 ] 12 K-[ B2 ] unlike Bishops would be left after a possible exchange of Knights giving Black good drawing chances.
 [ B x h5 ]  [ N x h5 ]  [ Q x h5 ]  [ g6 ]  [ Q e2 ] , [ f5 ]  Black doing something to shore his position up now trying to open up the center for his pieces and possibly pin White's queen to his king.
 [ R a7 + ]  [ K g6 ]  [ R a5 ] , [ h5 ]  ok i do not know what you see here but i'm gonna put a stop to it
 [ K h8 ] , [ N b2 ]  The knight needs to get back into the game.
 [ Q b3 ]  [ f6 ]  [ f x e5 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ c5 ] , [ B g7 ]  an annoying pawn chain runs through the centre of the board
 [ R h e1 ] , [ e5 ]  This was the way Sicilian was played in those days also called Boleslavesky's idea. The pawn at [ e5 ] occupies the centre supported by the [ d6 ] pawn thus stopping any central breakthrough and also attacks the White knight on d4. This move creates a hole on [ d5 ] which shall be exploited by White but Boleslavesky showed that this weakness can be managed.
 [ B b4 ]  [ N x c6 ]  [ b x c6 ]  [ B d3 ] , [ d5 ]  aggressive but premature here. 7 ... 0-0 instead
 [ h5 ]  [ R b1 ] , [ h4 ]  22. ....... [ h4 ] - danger on the g and h files. I now release Fou Lenoir from the protection of the [ b2 ] pawn with b3. Fou Lenoir is desperately needed to defend my horsie on f4.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B b5 ] , [ N d4 ]  The Bird Defense. Unusual and highly tactical.
 [ B f4 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ Q d2 ] , [ N f8 ]  White can start an attack of his own with H4.
 [ O-O ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ c x d5 ] , [ a6 ]  migchess20: 12...T[ e8 ] Aqui debes dominar la columna abierta by the tower 13.A[ f4 ] C[ b d7 ] 14.[ d6 ] D[ b6 ] 15.Ab5.
 [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N x c6 ]  [ b x c6 ] , [ f4 ]  An unusual attack here and not a terribly useful one. It leaves the [ e4 ] pawn unsupported.
 [ h1 = Q ]  [ R x h1 ]  [ R x h1 ] , [ K d5 ]  No hope just for a tempo.
 [ h4 ]  [ Q b2 ]  [ N d5 ] , [ b5 ]  Let's see if this passed pawn can make something of himself.
 [ K e1 ] , [ R d7 ]  (!?) I admit to worrying about this move after I played it. It seemed counter-intuitive to induce the e-pawn forward in the circumstances. 51...[ R a2 ] followed by ...[ R a6 ] or ...[ R a7 ] might have been better but this move suffices as it turns out.
 [ e6 ] , [ d3 ]  Intending to keep the position closed along the lines of the KIA. My friend and I have played dozens of main line classical French lines so I wanted to deviate to increase my practical chances.
 [ d5 ]  [ c4 ] , [ B g4 ]  this move kinda took me by surprise i hadn't thought that he would pin my e pawn move 2.
 [ R a c1 ]  [ R x c1 ]  [ R x c1 ] , [ R c8 ]  The open file seems more vital than the half-open file right now so black contests white's right to own it.
 [ R f d8 ]  [ N f4 ] , [ K f8 ]  The king heads back to [ e7 ] to defend the f6-pawn.
 [ B e2 ]  [ c4 ]  [ c3 ] , [ N d3 ]  The knight must move before white finds a way to drive it off possibly winning [ b7 ] in the process.
 [ N x e5 ]  [ d6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ] , [ c4 ]  Aiming to undermine the support for Black's central knight.
 [ N d3 ]  [ f3 ] , [ g3 ]  When this game was played in 1868 this was the standard line. The current usual play is 9 PxP B-[ K2 ] 10 B-K3.
 [ h x g6 ]  [ f x g6 ]  [ B h3 ]  [ d4 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ B e7 ] , [ N h4 ]  19. [ e x d4 ] [ c x d4 ] 20. [ B x d4 ] [ B x b3 ] 21. [ c x b3 ] [ e x d4 ] 22. [ B x f5 ] [ R x f5 ] 23. [ N x d4 ] [ B x g5 ] 24.[ N x f5 ] [ B x c1 ] leads to excellent game for White.
 [ g5 ] , [ N c6 ]  White wants to bring the knight over to pile pressure on g4.
 [ N f5 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ N x e7 + ]  [ Q x e7 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ Q d5 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ Q x e5 ]  [ Q x e5 ]  [ N x e5 ] , [ N f6 ]  [ d5 ] is a better square for the Black Knight.
 [ N x d7 ] , [ Q x c8 ]  I had no choice....at this point my opponent has asked that i point out the fact that his rook and bishop were both poisoned however i catagorically deny such underhand accusations and put it down to superior chess prowess on my part...
 [ R e7 + ]  [ K b7 ] , [ B d5 + ]  
 [ R x d1 + ]  [ N x d1 ] , [ b x c4 ]  This is won for me now. With [ N e3 ] I gain a pawn.
 [ c4 ]  [ N b6 ]  [ d5 ] , [ N b8 ]  May be [ N b4 ] is better?
 [ K f1 ]  [ N g3 + ]  [ h x g3 ]  [ Q x b1 + ]  [ B e1 ]  [ f6 ]  [ a4 ]  [ R g7 ]  [ Q f3 ]  [ h2 ]  [ Q x d5 ]  [ Q h7 ]  [ Q h1 ] , [ Q d3 + ]  
 [ N f3 ] , [ N c6 ]  After going [ N f3 ] I go [ N c6 ] and hope he does a Ruy Lopez so I can get one step closer to trapping him with the Blackburne Schilling Gambit.
 [ B f6 ] , [ Q f2 ]  Perhaps [ g5 ] now since [ Q f2 ] is perhaps not necessary yet.
 [ O-O ] , [ e6 ]  Tringov continues with e6. possibily planning to develop the knight to [ e7 ]  [ R f e1 ] , [ a6 ]  Tringov have played to many pawn moves i think. Look at tal's development compared to tringov. Now Tal can take advantage of this development and attack.
 [ Q e8 + ]  [ K h7 ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ h4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ Q e6 ] , [ Q b6 ]  I definately like [ Q x d5 ] here better. Three pawns are threatened strongly encouraging white to swap queens.
 [ a4 ]  [ R d5 ] , [ R c1 ]  so now i can take control of the open file and it sets up a deadly check attack
 [ f6 ]  [ g x f6 ]  [ g x f6 ] , [ R e6 ]  28. ...... [ R e6 ] - piling up on the [ f6 ] passer.
 [ N e2 ] , [ R f c8 ]  Black's doubled rooks are a much more powerful weapon than White's muted fellows stuck behind their pawns.
 [ Q e6 ]  [ N f2 ]  [ R g8 ]  [ N g4 ] , [ Q e8 ]  Black is slightly better here due to the vulnerability of the White King.
 [ N f6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ e x d4 ] , [ e5 ]  the in between move looks to put the knight on a worse square.
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ c4 ]  [ c6 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ B g4 ]  Not the best of moves but I'll give my opponent credit.
 [ N x e5 ] , [ Q h4 ]  A fluid beautifully timed move. The pentagonal formation created by the bishop-hook is unmistakable.
 [ e4 ]  [ e6 ] , [ f4 ]  An unusual option against the French Defence transforming the game into species of King's Indian Attack. White early announces an interest in K-side operations. Things don't quite turn out that way!
 [ B a5 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N d2 ] , [ N e4 ]  I REALLY REALLY REAAAALLLLLYYYY wanted to play [ [ c4 ] ] here. But death and destruction await me along that path. ([ [ c4 ] ] [ N x d2 ] or [ K x d2 ] [ B x d2 ] [ Q x e4 ] and I go down a pawn).
 [ e x d5 ] , [ B g5 ]  I don't see what he's planning at this time.
 [ Q h3 ] , [ R g3 ]  "Thanks for standing there insane Queen!" -my Rook.
 [ d x e4 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ B x e4 ] , [ N a5 ]  [ B b7 ] was probably a better move but I felt like being adventurous and like I said before I wanted to play with the white queen.
 [ g x h3 ]  [ Q f3 + ] , [ K e1 ]  Agreed a draw. i was winning 2 rooks but a draw. How sad. :(
 [ Q x f6 ]  [ a3 ] , [ B x c3 + ]  We all knew that was gonna happen.
 [ R e1 ] , [ R e8 ]  Black is reacting to white not the other way around so white has the initiative. White also has a space advantage but black has a developmental lead.
 [ O-O ]  [ O-O ] , [ h3 ]  A very bad move. D3 is so much better.
 [ Q g2 ]  [ K d2 ]  [ B h6 + ]  [ K c2 ]  [ N f4 ]  [ R a g1 ]  [ Q x e2 + ]  [ Q x e2 ] , [ N x e2 ]  Gaining a knight for free while destroying his structure and setting up possible retaliatory attacks in the center.
 [ N f6 ] , [ Q h6 ]  now my last ditch is becoming a future mate
 [ B g3 ] , [ N h5 ]  Planning to capture weakening his king and pawn formation
 [ Q x e1 ] , [ Q d8 ]  The idea is to play 18. ...[ B f8 ] followed by 19. ...[ Q e7 ] fighting for control of the critical e-file.
 [ f x g5 + ] , [ K x g5 ]  Black has two pawns hanging which one will white kill?
 [ O-O-O ] , [ B e2 ]  White does not allow the menacing ...[ R e8 ] check.
 [ K f1 ] , [ a3 ]  29. ....... [ a3 ] - pawn push.
 [ Q x e5 ]  [ f x e5 ]  [ K d7 ]  [ K e4 ]  [ K e6 ]  [ b5 ]  [ K e7 ]  [ K d5 ]  [ K d7 ]  [ b6 ]  [ h5 ]  [ c5 ]  [ g5 ]  [ g4 ]  [ h4 ] , [ c6 + ]  Black resigns. This was a hard fought game and I was very relieved to get the point.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ b4 ] , [ B x b4 ]  Celle accepts the gambit Pawn.
 [ R f6 ] , [ Q d3 ]  ! Nice! To save a pawn (and stop [ Q h7 # ] of course) Black needs to relinquish the pressure on the f-file...
 [ B x f8 ] , [ K x f8 ]  [ Q x f8 ] hangs the e-pawn
 [ N x f4 ] , [ N e4 + ]  51. ..... [ N e4 + ] - in between move which puts pressure on white.
 [ d5 ]  [ N g3 ]  [ h6 ] , [ f4 ]  White advances pawn trying to open a line for rook on F1
 [ N f6 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ B g4 ]  Pins the knight on [ f3 ] to the queen.
 [ c x d4 ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ B d6 ] , [ N h3 ]  I think Stalhandske wanted to go out of the database here. He is doing this to group G in the Walking club and it is causing our brains to go into overdrive!
 [ N x a1 ] , [ B c4 ]  ?? Inviting a fork with no compensation.
 [ N g e7 ] , [ d4 ]  Kitrich plays a thematic break inviting black to either unzip the E-file which both players can then share or to close the board with e4. My question: is [ e4 ] good for black...?
 [ Q d3 ] , [ N f6 ]  tempo lost for black
 [ f4 ] , [ Q x f4 ]  Keeping control on d4.
 [ a x b3 ] , [ Q x d1 ]  I trade kings giving him the open file temporarily.
 [ B g3 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N b3 ]  [ Q c7 ] , [ Q b1 ]  Gaining a tempo by the threatened discovery on the Black Q.
 [ c5 ]  [ R a8 + ]  [ K d7 ]  [ B f5 + ] , [ K e7 ]  Computer gives [ K e7 ] as a blunder as it is mate in 10 now but is [ K c7 ] as suggested by the computer really better?
 [ K f6 ] , [ Q d3 ]  Other option is Nh7+. but white wants to continue the attack.
 [ f x e4 ]  [ B x e4 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ R c8 ] , [ Q h5 ]  Threatening h7.
 [ B f6 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c4 ]  [ B f5 ] , [ B h3 ]  Trying to trade bishops because that bishop is causing me trouble in this position.
 [ N g5 ] , [ a5 ]  Opening up a path for the rook - cant move knight else Queen would take the rook.
 [ b x c4 ] , [ R b1 ]  Claiming the open file.
 [ c6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N e4 ] , [ Q d1 ]  Going for second exchange
 [ Q d6 ]  [ b4 ]  [ R a e8 ] , [ g3 ]  Making a loophole for the King and relieving most of the threats associated with the back rank. But Black now gains even more time to improve his position.
 [ d4 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ e4 ]  [ h5 ]  [ h4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N g e2 ]  [ N g4 ]  [ O-O ] , [ B x h4 ]  A very un-Hedgehog-like sacrifice. A little too optimistic too although at subsequent points you wouldn't know it from White's play.
 [ c x d4 ] , [ Q g5 + ]  Forced mate in 7.
 [ B b3 ]  [ B e7 ] , [ Q e2 ]  gaining more space
 [ N g8 ]  [ K g2 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ K g3 ] , [ N e7 ]  32. ........ [ N e7 ] - for the next few moves there is a lot of manoeuvering but basically it is a case of Operation Joblock this hedgehog defence can sometimes be very effective against opponents who overreach themselves and find themselves mightily spiked!
 [ Q b6 ] , [ R b8 ]  Threatens [ Q x d5 + ] and then [ R x b6 ] this move however is a bad move from white since it allows black to improve its chances. [ Q b8 ] is the better move.
 [ N x c4 ]  [ b3 ]  [ N d6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ c6 ]  [ N b6 + ]  [ K d8 ] , [ N a4 ]  I like [ c5 ] better. Make black move his knight then [ N c4 ] is available.
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ g6 ] , [ c4 ]  We pick up this epic game by Stalhandske at move 5 in the mini tournament. IMO the Sicilian Marocozy bind system starts slightly in white's favor. This is due to the edge in space and slightly more active knight.
 [ Q x g4 ] , [ B g7 ]  Now I decide to go back to development.
 [ N b3 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ N b d7 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ f3 ]  [ b5 ]  [ a3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O-O ]  [ R c8 ]  [ K b1 ]  [ Q b6 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ Q b8 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ B x d3 ]  [ Q x d3 ]  [ f5 ]  [ g4 ]  [ N b6 ] , [ g x f5 ]  Perhaps I should have exchanged my Bishop for "the Dark Knight."
 [ N f6 ] , [ h3 ]  More challenging (and more book) immediately is 6. [ f4 ] swallowing up a ton of space on the K-side and setting the table for the stereotyped strategies to follow with White playing a positional game based on space control and a K-side build-up as Black tries vigorously to break White in the center and on the Q-side even if it's at the cost of a little material. Playing cautiously in the Closed means Black will often drift into a cramped and passive position; tactical energy and nerves of ice are called for and Black must be willing to risk an attack by White to get his fair share of the position.
 [ Q f3 ] , [ c6 ]  Both Pavlovic and David Vigorito in "Understanding the Marshall Attack" (Gambit 2010) p. 6 prefer 12...Bd6. There is probably nothing wrong with the overprotection but it does greatly limit the scope of the Bishop in an attacking system. My gut feeling is White benefits more from the overprotection of the [ d5 ] Knight than Black... Of course after I wrote all this and plugged the position into Stockfish 7 the silicon beast says 12...[ c6 ] and 12...[ B d6 ] are Black's two best choices at a depth of 21. At 22. the move 12....[ B d6 ] is slightly favored at 0.25 to 0.32. No real edge to White there!
 [ R g1 ]  [ N x f1 ] , [ g x h5 ]  ? I could've taken the N but I know that it's usually better to take the B. In fact I mentioned to Jack GM Susan Polgar emphasized that I shouldn't exchange my B for N without a good reason. And he said that new studies now show that N's are still worth 3 points but the B is 3.5 points. That's the first thing I kept in mind here but once again didn't think about it even more. And I should've given that more thought since Tom is going to win a pawn now. Thus 13.[ R x f1 ] was the way to go.
 [ R c7 ]  [ g5 ]  [ e3 ]  [ R e2 ]  [ R b2 ]  [ d5 ]  [ R c x c2 ] , [ R c x c2 ]  no difference makes R[ e x c2 ] [ N x c2 ] [ d6 ] Nd4! [ R f1 ] [ R f2 ] [ R x f2 ] [ e x f2 + ] [ K x f2 ] a3! [ d7 ] Nc6...
 [ c5 ] , [ d4 ]  another blunder move
 [ N c3 ]  [ N b4 ]  [ a3 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ B d2 ]  [ N x c3 ]  [ B x c3 ]  [ Q d5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N h6 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ e6 ]  [ R c1 ]  [ N g4 ]  [ Q d2 ] , [ B h6 ]  This would have been a great pin had white not seen the [ N g5 ] block.
 [ B d2 ]  [ d x c3 ]  [ B x c3 ]  [ Q b6 ] , [ B x f6 ]  although it's never advised to swap when material down I take the opportunity to break up his k-side while I can
 [ c4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B b4 ] , [ d3 ]  White normally plays a light-square game in this opening.
 [ R f d8 ] , [ R e d1 ]  At this point Freddy complimented me on my play observing that I appeared to have learned some chess principles.
 [ B e8 ] , [ B d2 ]  43. ..... [ B d2 ] - he protects me from [ c2 ] instead.
 [ c5 ]  [ Q c4 ]  [ R e c8 ]  [ R c2 ]  [ N e8 ] , [ N d5 ]  I was aiming for the King/Rook fork but if that doesn't work I'm quite happy to have the bishop off.
 [ R c1 ]  [ a5 ]  [ N e3 ] , [ R b4 ]  at least I have one good piece
 [ B x d4 ] , [ B b7 ]  Or white plays [ R b1 ] and forces this move.
 [ K x a6 ] , [ R x d7 ]  Black resigns
 [ R h3 + ]  [ K e2 ]  [ Q e4 + ]  [ K d2 ]  [ R d3 + ]  [ K c2 ]  [ Q c4 + ]  [ K b2 ] , [ Q c3 + ]  [ R d2 + ] [ Q c2 # ] worked too... Now please come back and answer: was ultimately [ N x f3 + ] a soudn sac or wasn't it? Answer: if white hadn't blundered [ c4 ] probably the answer would have been "no".
 [ K h1 ]  [ N x f4 ] , [ N e5 ]  White seeks to fork the black rooks.
 [ b5 ] , [ Q d4 ]  Voilà the queen in the centre.now black doesn't have many options..
 [ N h5 ] , [ B e3 ]  No reason to lose the good dsb. Now after my [ N f3 ] moves [ N h5 ] is "en prise". For the tactics to come.
 [ N g f3 ] , [ f6 ]  As I said. White has a slight (or not that slight) advantage in development but black has the pair of Bishops and an interesting attack on the WB castling.
 [ a3 ]  [ B b7 ] , [ B x f6 ]  A critical decision point for Black. The B is needed to support the pawn on [ d6 ] but has counter-attacking potential on the long black diagonal. Both the N and B if they recapture are vulnerable to pawn thrusts. Recapturing with the pawn doubles the pawns on the f-file but opens the g-file for Black's rook. If the B stays on [ e7 ] it is virtually paralysed and in many variations difficult to protect from attack by White's knights.
 [ f8 = Q + ]  [ N x f8 ]  [ R x f8 ] , [ K x h5 ]  takes the bait: also here [ R x h4 ] was still saving...
 [ R a d8 ]  [ R d3 ] , [ f5 ]  f5? is a premature attempt to chase the Knight. Better was Bb4.
 [ Q c6 ] , [ B c1 ]  Threathening my knight.
 [ K e2 ] , [ B c1 ]  Another counterattack my threat on [ g4 ] is still "on".
 [ B x d5 ]  [ g5 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ f x e4 ]  [ B x e4 ] , [ B d3 ]  Forced.
 [ d x c4 ] , [ e x f6 ]  2 pawns for a knight is not preferable until d end game black is in trouble
 [ N c3 ] , [ Q e6 + ]  A queen trade before the sixth move? From my research it appeared there were many instances of this very sequence in grandmaster practice. Does an early queen trade presage an early draw? In those games and in this there is little opportunity for a draw. I also considered 4...[ Q [ h5 ] ] 5. [ B e2 ] [ N c6 ] 6. O-O 0-0-0 7. [ d3 ] [ N f6 ] 8. [ h3 ] [ B d7 ] 9. [ B f4 ] [ Q f5 ] 10. [ B g3 ] [ g5 ] 11. [ a4 ] [ h5 ] 12. [ h4 ] gx[ h4 ] 13. Nx[ h4 ] [ Q h7 ] from Westphal-Kiel Landesliga Ost in 2002. Kiel won this game but only after some serious torture in the middle-game. Still other options at black's fourth move include 4....[ Q a5 ] 4...[ Q d6 ] and 4...Qd8.
 [ K c8 ]  [ c6 ] , [ b x c6 ]  Probably best. If 29. ... [ b6 ] then 30. [ Q a6 + ] (30. ... [ K c7 ] 31. Qb7#) [ K b8 ] 31. [ c7 + ] [ N x c7 ] 32. [ Q x b6 + ] [ K c8 ] 33. [ B a5 ] [ R d7 ] 34. [ R c2 ] with the idea of doubling Rooks with a decisive advantage
 [ K h1 ]  [ R a1 + ] , [ B f1 ]  everything going as planned and then....
 [ N e4 ]  [ B b6 ] , [ N d6 + ]  Just a cheap blunder from my opponent. He probably thought the knight was protected.
 [ B d7 ] , [ B c4 ]  This might look like a waste of a move but black's bishop is better placed on [ c8 ] because now [ d5 ] is harder to get in due to the blockage of the black queen. Therefore black's move is worse than a waste of a move!
 [ R x b8 ] , [ R x e7 ]  and now his rook is pinning my bishop and he will surely double them up... but more worryingly he can pass a pawn on the d-file...
 [ a4 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ e3 ]  [ f6 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ g5 ]  [ K e2 ] , [ g x f4 ]  Thank you for the bishop
 [ h5 ] , [ Q g5 ]  Forced again.
 [ R a e1 ]  [ N d3 ]  [ R e4 ]  [ R a c8 ]  [ N h7 + ]  [ K g8 ]  [ N f6 + ]  [ K f8 ]  [ N h7 + ]  [ K g8 ]  [ N f6 + ] , [ K f8 ]  
 [ N e7 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ Q x a1 + ]  [ K e2 ]  [ B g4 + ]  [ h x g4 ] , [ Q d4 ]  He clearly won the exchange so I salvage a draw.
 [ O-O ] , [ Q h4 ]  Threatening to begin a kingside build-up of force but it's not the only thing this move threatens.
 [ N x g4 ] , [ Q x g4 ]  Hard to see any way I do not have positional control here. His left side pons face a solid defense queenside I have control of the center and he has no king side defense.
 [ f5 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ f x e4 ]  [ N x d7 ] , [ B x d7 ]  Black have two bishop and a horse but white continue to play
 [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ e3 ]  [ a6 ] , [ B d3 ]  Still showing similarities to the 1700 game.
 [ N e5 ] , [ f4 ]  CENTRO DEL TABLERO ABSOLUTAMENTE CONTROLADO POR LAS BLANCAS
 [ Q x c4 ] , [ R d3 d7 ]  Threatening mate
 [ e x d4 ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ B d7 ] , [ R b d1 ]  White's advantage grows.
 [ N x b4 ] , [ K d4 ]  i thought he wanted to play [ b e4 ] which could not have worked but it would force me to move pawns soon...
 [ N x d5 ]  [ e4 ]  [ N x c3 ]  [ b x c3 ]  [ B g7 ] , [ N f3 ]  This move came back into vogue towards the end of the 20th century. [ B c4 ] followed by [ N [ e2 ] ] had been the more usual way of developing the white king side preventing black from pinning the knight with Bg4. With the knight on [ e2 ] this can just be met by [ f3 ]  [ c5 ] , [ R b1 ]  [ R b1 ] delays the development of the black [ B c8 ] as the pawn on [ b7 ] is attacked
 [ R f8 ] , [ O-O ]  7. 0-0 with a semi-open f file it makes sense to oppose rooks on it. The WR adds a defender to the [ f2 ] pawn which is under the hammer of Alex's dsb.
 [ R a e1 ] , [ f6 ]  White played as expected pinning Black's bishop on e5. [ f6 ] saves the bishop from any future embarrassment and at the same time the bishop protects the pawn too.
 [ B d7 ]  [ N c2 ]  [ Q c8 ]  [ e4 ] , [ N e7 ]  Black wisely guards [ d5 ] with ...[ c6 ] if White waits to play his Knight there. I was formulating a different plan however one to expand on the Q-side.
 [ O-O ] , [ N a4 ]  The only offensive square that does not block a file. Additionally it leaves black with three squares to protect c6. (Well 16 ... [ c7 ] is followed by 17 Nxg6! )
 [ g6 ] , [ e4 ]  The computer agrees with this pawn sacrifice to open up the position but I didn't follow it up correctly.
 [ K h2 ] , [ f5 ]  I'm looking forward to moving [ R g4 ] by playing f5. Obviously I see the threat of [ Q x a8 ] but I'm in no hurry and there isn't much white can do.
 [ N g e2 ]  [ c5 ]  [ O-O ] , [ N c6 ]  He's got a good outpost for his knight: [ d4 ]  [ d3 ] , [ a6 ]  Not sure what that was all about
 [ K f3 ] , [ R a e8 ]  ...and completing the doubling of my Rooks.
 [ N x e4 ]  [ R x f7 ] , [ B f3 ]  Some how I got it into my head I could mate but I overlooked the rook on f7.
 [ N f6 ] , [ N e5 ]  Black's doom is just a matter of moves.
 [ R d7 d4 ]  [ b5 ]  [ R a4 ] , [ R x d2 ]  29. [ R d2 ] was a mistake. Much better would have been 29. [ b x c6 ] [ b x c6 ] 30. [ R c5 ]  [ R x d2 ]  [ K x d2 ]  [ R x a5 ]  [ b x c6 ]  [ b x c6 ] , [ R c2 ]  To protect against [ R a2 + ] followed by [ R x g2 ]  [ R b5 ]  [ K d3 ] , [ a5 ]  Passed pawns must be pushed. White is in serious trouble.
 [ N x c4 ] , [ Q f4 ]  ! Winning back the piece as there is a discovered attack on the queen. Wrong is Qxd8? when R[ a x d8 ] 21. [ R x d8 ] [ R x d8 ] 22.[ c7 ] loses to Rf8! (eg 23. [ R d1 ] b5! 24.[ R d8 ] Nb6!.) So black must now give back the piece.
 [ c3 ] , [ Q b6 ]  4. ...... [ Q b6 ] - whey-hey! Just look who has come to defend that [ c5 ] pawn why it's no one other than Glenda! However she is also attacking something. Can you see what?
 [ N x e4 ]  [ f x e4 ]  [ B c6 ]  [ R e2 ]  [ f5 ] , [ g x f5 ]  I was expecting [ d5 ] here which would make my job considerably tougher.
 [ b x c6 ] , [ Q d2 ]  White has other options here that may be better. I was expecting [ N g e2 ] to protect the knight and allow white to castle I think [ Q c2 ] is also playable
 [ K x g6 ]  [ g x h6 ] , [ K x h6 ]  
 [ Q x e5 ] , [ N f6 ]  he forces the rook exchange which is fine with knight and bishop where they are i dont see him getting my second rook knight nor queen
 [ B e5 ]  [ d6 ] , [ B g3 ]  at this point white looking to get bishop on [ h5 ] winning the queen if can rid the knight
 [ N x a5 ]  [ e4 ]  [ B g2 ] , [ B g7 ]  White would want to play 26. [ b4 ] to pin down black's pawn but this move prevents it while clearing the way for black's rook on [ h8 ] to get more active.
 [ R f3 f6 ]  [ R c6 ] , [ R f6 f3 ]  White takes care of a possible [ Q b3 ] freeing my a pawn.
 [ B x c5 ] , [ B d4 ]  elyhim: 7. [ B d2 ] is a bad move. For one you moved the bishop three times. Second 7...[ [ e5 ] ] will over run you in the centre I understood what elyhim was saying about moving the bishop 3 times I was sure he meant [ B d4 ] - the logic I feel looking at the position is that I wanted to play [ B x d4 ] [ Q x d4 ] which gave me more control in the centre I didn't take into account [ [ e5 ] ] properly Better options could have been [ e4 ] which would challenge the centre and after dx[ e4 ] fx[ e4 ] Nx[ e4 ] Nx[ e4 ] I would be able to play [ N f3 ] and have some more emphasis on the centre. Another obvious option is [ B x c5 ] [ Q x c5 ] [ e4 ]  [ e5 ] , [ B x c5 ]  Essentially the previous bishop move was a waste of tempo for me plus 4th move of the bishop
 [ B d2 ]  [ B x c3 ]  [ B x c3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N f3 ] , [ c6 ]  Here is a mistake by Black. Instead of developing a piece as would seem natural Black pushes a pawn. To further cramp his position Black has also occupied the natural square for the [ b8 ] knight.
 [ h6 ]  [ B h3 ]  [ g6 ] , [ g5 + ]  The exposes my opponent's h-pawn...
 [ B c3 ] , [ N c6 ]  I develop the knight
 [ K h1 ] , [ Q f4 ]  Increasing pressure and hoping to exchange Queens. Alternative variation: [I probably should just stick to my guns here and play] 27... [ B x f3 ] 28. [ g x f3 ] [ R a b8 ] [Using the dark squares once more. The line I played was also good enough for the win.]
 [ b x a3 ]  [ b3 ] , [ a4 ]  The fortress around White's King is about to collapse.
 [ N c3 ] , [ N c6 ]  It is surely bad to exchange the dsb but in this case it has two interesting conuntersides: if white goes d2[ x c3 ] leaves the two pawns alone. Yes they are strong but will they survive the midgame? If b[ x c3 ] white has a strong center but on the other side has no really safe castling either side. Just wondering. Of course the text move is perfectly ok.
 [ R x d6 ]  [ c3 + ]  [ K e1 ]  [ B c4 ] , [ R c6 ]  The [ d5 ] pawn falls and black has secured a well fought draw.
 [ d5 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ d x e4 ]  3....[ d x e4 ] is the best move as black seems to have nothing more constructive than it.
 [ Q f2 ]  [ Q e4 + ] , [ B e3 ]  Now black has a nice little combination to force the win through.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ a6 ]  [ B a4 ]  [ b5 ]  [ B b3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B c5 ]  [ a4 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ d3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N a5 ]  [ B a2 ]  [ b4 ]  [ N e2 ]  [ d5 ] , [ N x e5 ]  Last book move
 [ K g6 ]  [ R g8 + ] , [ K h5 ]  Finally I get to throw a fork!!
 [ N d7 ] , [ N e4 ]  While I temporary remove the pin on the king with this move it does force the queen to move again which makes this knight advancement come with tempo.
 [ N x e3 ] , [ R x e3 ]  ? Should have been PxN where just a pawn will be lost.
 [ R h5 ]  [ K e6 ]  [ h7 ] , [ B x h7 ]  Black resigns ...... White Wins .... Look at all the options [ b e4 ] u play
 [ f x g4 ]  [ Q d4 + ]  [ K h1 ] , [ N f6 ]  ! threatening [ N x g4 ] and [ N e4 ]  [ N e4 ] , [ Q x d3 ]  the knight was a key piece in the downfall of the white position and survived on [ d3 ] for no less than 18 moves.
 [ K e7 ]  [ Q f7 + ]  [ K d8 ]  [ Q f8 + ] , [ K d7 ]  Game notes "35...[ K d7 ] please take my R lol. 37...[ Q d6 ] I guess the threat of mate will pass with 38.[ f4 ] 39...[ R f8 ] his Q is pinned." Anyway it's all over baby blue.
 [ R f d8 ] , [ Q h4 ]  Threatening [ Q x h7 ] checkmate of course.
 [ Q f6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N a6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N e7 ] , [ d3 ]  so he looks over at my bishop
 [ N a3 ] , [ Q b8 ]  I cannot move my Queen into a proper position to counter [ N b3 ] as an attack on the [ d6 ] square so I have to retreat it.
 [ f4 ] , [ B b4 ]  .
 [ B b7 ] , [ O-O ]  The king gets out of the center of the board and now White's rook can enter the open e-file.
 [ N c6 ] , [ Q g1 ]  ?! Like I said earlier my play began to dwindle. The queen supports a g-pawn push but the rook would have been better suited for the job
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ g6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ N d5 ] , [ e6 ]  In fact I dont know why I was playing these moves maybe I was very good and lucky.
 [ e x f5 ] , [ N f6 ]  Now white takes the pawn I was offering at the start which provides a place for my knight to reside and stops the pawns advance.
 [ K x f2 ]  [ N x e4 + ] , [ K e3 ]  putting the king into the centre makes the end game slightly favorable to me
 [ B x a6 + ]  [ K c8 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ c6 ]  [ B c4 ] , [ b5 ]  relentless...
 [ g4 ]  [ R h7 ]  [ Q f4 ]  [ Q e7 ] , [ N g6 + ]  25. [ N g6 + ] - Ouch and double ouch! A devastating knight fork/discovery combo on Henry Glenda and my rook on [ b8 ] now results in ruinous loss of material. I waved the white flag after white swiped my rook. Coach Ion is quite correct I still need to brush up on my tactics in order to hold my own against The Titans and to retain Class A status. The only thing I can say is that I fell into the tactical shot under extreme pressure. I just hope I can redeem myself a little with the white pieces in my return challenge against Dongoodman. I hope you have a good read and a nice evening. Bye for now - Joanne
 [ R x c3 ]  [ B x c3 + ]  [ b x c3 ]  [ N x d3 + ]  [ K f1 ]  [ N x f4 ]  [ e x f4 ] , [ Q x c3 ]  And now after some exchanges I am down a whole rook. I was almost planning on resigning but I decided to see if I could finish it out.
 [ N x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ] , [ B d3 ]  [Greedy 17.Qxd5? would be a mistake in the view of 17...Bg4! 18.[ Q e4 ] (18.[ Q x d8 ] loses immediately 18...R[ a x d8 ] 19.[ R d3 ] [ B g5 + ] 20.[ K b1 ] [ B f5 ] 21.[ R d1 ] [ R x d4 ] 22.[ R x d4 ] Be3) 18...[ B x d1 ] 19.[ B d3 ] [ g6 ] 20.[ R x d1 ] [ Q d7 ] and White doesn't have sufficient compensation for the exchange.]
 [ N e8 ]  [ R c3 ]  [ N x f6 ]  [ a5 ]  [ N e8 ]  [ a6 ]  [ N c7 ] , [ a7 ]  If the R leaves the c column I can play [ R x c5 ] ([ e5 ] RxNc7)
 [ N f4 ]  [ R e3 ]  [ Q h4 ]  [ Q b3 ] , [ N x g4 ]  I was fairly proud of this move at the time. If he had done 23. [ h x g4 ] then 23...Qh1#. Again GameKnot spoils me and I didn't look very far down the line at his counter moves.
 [ B h2 ] , [ Q g5 ]  dangerous of course to align king and queen...
 [ e4 ] , [ c5 ]  Of all the openings that I've tried out over the course of the past few years to counter [ e4 ] I find this one the most interesting. The games are usually exciting and aggressive and although it contradicts my playstyle something about this opening is just very appealing.
 [ N c1 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ N d b3 ] , [ a5 ]  consolidation of the queen side
 [ b5 ]  [ K c5 ]  [ b6 ]  [ K x b6 ] , [ K x d4 ]  At this point black has all but lost asuming that white counts his moves correcly.
 [ Q c3 ]  [ Q b8 ]  [ Q h8 + ] , [ K e7 ]  this is where i was most tempted to trade. oh well should've when you could've (skillet)
 [ b3 ] , [ e4 ]  i did this so his pawn could get away
 [ B x d6 ]  [ R g8 ]  [ f3 ] , [ R g7 ]  to protect Bxh7. But now black cannot play [ f5 ] (which would have reduced white's white B's mobility and strengthened the f-pawn) since black's rook and king are on the same diagonal.
 [ Q g3 + ]  [ K h1 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ R h2 ]  [ Q x e3 ] , [ R x h3 ]  Ooopsies. When I said White must sac its rook I didn't mean it must do so haphazardly. 26 [ B f1 ] should have been the move there.
 [ a x b4 ]  [ K f6 ] , [ g4 ]  Preventing [ R f5 + ] with the idea of gaining a route of penetration or repelling the white king to a useless square
 [ B x f3 ]  [ B x f3 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ O-O ]  [ g6 ]  [ Q a4 + ] , [ K e7 ]  Weak move on my part. I had plans for the other side which is why I didn't interpose my queen. Too focused on what I wanted ot what I needed.
 [ g3 ] , [ B f5 ]  Now I moved pawn to [ g3 ] so I can fianchetto my bishop. Black developed his LB to [ f5 ] pointing at my [ c2 ] pawn.
 [ Q x c4 ]  [ N f8 ] , [ e6 ]  34. [ e6 ] - this is very reminiscent of how my game with GM Cyrano ended only I had the white pieces!
 [ N h5 ] , [ B b2 ]  I thought this was rather irrelevant but Carl pointed out that it connected his rooks which later proved important. What else was there anyway? I still thought cd was needed.
 [ Q e5 + ]  [ K g8 ] , [ c6 ]  (!) An excellent move. White sees that Black can't take the pawn on [ c6 ] with 28...Rx[ c6 ] after all since White would simply play 29. [ B d4 ] and Black is getting checkmated on g7. Because White is going to play 29. [ B d4 ] anyway Black must find a way to defend. It was only now that I began to appreciate how dangerous White's attack was.
 [ a6 ] , [ N a3 ]  White is eyeing the [ b6 ] square at one point.
 [ R c8 ]  [ B e1 ]  [ B f6 ]  [ K b1 ] , [ N b7 ]  22. ..... [ N b7 ] - black retreats his knight and now there is a potential threat of [ Q x f2 + ] should both white steeds be lured away.
 [ N x g4 ]  [ N x g4 ] , [ h3 ]  This move is bad. Although the knight is stopping the DSB getting to [ e3 ] it's not controlling the center well.My move just forces it to a good square
 [ Q x c5 ]  [ B x a8 ]  [ Q x c2 ]  [ Q c1 ] , [ Q x d3 ]  An even exchange instead of a winning a piece.
 [ e6 ] , [ B x e6 ]  Who says there's no such thing as a free pawn for lunch?
 [ N d6 ] , [ Q c3 ]  29.[ N e5 ] is a bit stronger.
 [ d5 ] , [ N d4 ]  A powerful outpost for his knight.
 [ b3 ]  [ g6 ] , [ R d1 ]  I placed my rook behind my pawn so I could trade bishops on [ a3 ] without losing my pawn.
 [ K h1 ]  [ N f4 ]  [ R f e1 ]  [ Q d7 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ Q x d2 ]  [ R a d1 ]  [ Q a2 ]  [ Q x f4 ] , [ Q x a3 ]  Black has won a pawn: but now it is Whites' turn...
 [ e5 ]  [ Q g6 ] , [ B d3 ]  harass the queen maybe even a chance it gets trapped
 [ K g7 ] , [ a8 = Q ]  Ok that's it... one of the worst games of my life. I hope the ones that hate me (:-) may be enjoing this (:-D)
 [ h6 ]  [ B e1 ]  [ N h5 + ] , [ K e3 ]  32. [ K e3 ] - Henry is pushed back now black forces an exchange of one pair of pawns.
 [ B g5 ] , [ R f d8 ]  When the bishop attacked my queen I mistakenly decided to attack his queen also offering a trade but then I realized too late that I had basically pinned myself. If that queen were to move to safety I lose a rook.
 [ B x c4 ] , [ b5 ]  Force the bishop back
 [ g4 ] , [ B g6 ]  I can get rid of the annoying lsb by NxB but it is not particularly interesting.
 [ B c7 ] , [ c4 ]  And with [ c4 ] leading the charge naturally creates a passed pawn.
 [ R e2 ]  [ Q f3 ] , [ b x c5 ]  31.b5?-Kf7.32.Bxf6-Bd4.33.Bxd4-cxd ... and white will be forced to sac his knight for saving his rook any way white his lost here .
 [ e x d4 ]  [ O-O ] , [ B e7 ]  ? Interesting trying to negate a possible 6.[ B g5 ]  [ N g5 ]  [ O-O ] , [ c3 ]  Trying to free my knight one of the main Ideas of the Max Lange Attack.
 [ R e8 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ R f8 ] , [ B c6 ]  Preventing any central gains by Black
 [ g3 ] , [ B a6 ]  This is why they fianchetto. And I used to be surprised by this kind of play but that's no longer the case. That's because as you saw in recent annotation Bert played this move against me.
 [ e3 ]  [ f x e3 ]  [ Q x b2 ]  [ R d1 ]  [ Q x h2 ] , [ Q g4 + ]  20. [ Q g4 ] - the winning move.
 [ O-O ]  [ g5 ]  [ Q e3 ] , [ h5 ]  Black gains some space.
 [ R e3 ] , [ Q x e3 # ]  Lost this one. I do believe letting his pawn infiltrate my position was a bad idea.
 [ R f d8 ]  [ Q f2 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B x c5 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ Q f6 ] , [ B x b6 ]  ! Despite black's superior attackers white has regained the advantage. This line threatens 28.[ R x b6 + ] dropping the Black queen if Black responds 27... axb6. I originally misread Ion's lines. They reference 26... [ Q c7 ] but Ion on your line 26... [ Q c7 ] 27.[ B x b6 ] [ a x b6 ] I still think that 28.[ R x b6 + ] continues to be the strongest continuation. Black will ultimately drop the queen it is just a matter of how. "29... Kc7"? 30.Rc6! pinning the queen to the king. "29... Qxb6"? White has two alternatives [ a x b6 ] and Qxb6.
 [ N x c2 ]  [ b3 ]  [ N c4 a3 ]  [ N a4 ]  [ Q d8 ]  [ R b f1 ]  [ N x a1 ] , [ R x a1 ]  Black stands better and now must exploit the material advantage
 [ N h3 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ Q f2 ]  [ Q d7 ]  [ Q x f6 ] , [ R f8 ]  Free pawn
 [ K e5 ] , [ K g4 ]  This move allowed my pawn to pull away...
 [ B x h1 ]  [ Q x g7 ] , [ K d7 ]  Black prefers this to [ R f8 ] [ B h6 ] Kd7.
 [ R a c8 ] , [ R a b1 ]  The idea is [ N c6 ] sacrifying a pawn but getting my "revenge" on his [ b6 ] pawn. Also to be able to play Rb3.
 [ B g4 ]  [ N b d2 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ O-O ]  ? Castling after breaking up the castle pawns seems slightly questionable.
 [ B g5 ]  [ f6 ] , [ N x e5 ]  Of course Black cannot take the Knight and taking the bishop allows the exchange to be taken (although Black is then fine). But Black wants more.
 [ e x d4 ] , [ N d5 ]  White moves his threatned knight to threaten Black's remaining knight. Perhaps White is looking to reduce the amount of black pieces that might block the way to the king.
 [ h3 ] , [ B e6 ]  close in the Rook...
 [ B x b4 ]  [ R x e8 + ]  [ R x e8 ] , [ N f3 ]  23. [ N f3 ] - I am a pawn up but those white horsies are gonna be a bit of a handful.
 [ B x d4 ]  [ N g5 ] , [ Q f6 ]  To control [ b2 ] [ f2 ] and [ g7 ]  [ N x h7 ]  [ Q x g7 ]  [ N g5 ] , [ N e5 ]  Threatening [ N d3 ]  [ N x e6 ]  [ f x e6 ] , [ N c3 ]  I think this was a blunder
 [ d6 ] , [ Q d2 ]  Gaining yet another tempo boy is that Knight on [ h6 ] looking silly now.
 [ B e2 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ N c3 ]  I missed 7.[ e5 ] taking a major piece from you.
 [ a5 ] , [ c6 ]  Now I have another supported on the 5th rank and I'm prepared to double my rooks.
 [ R x f1 ]  [ R x f1 ]  [ R f8 ] , [ R x f8 + ]  no rooks for anyone
 [ N g5 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ] , [ N x d5 ]  5. ......... [ N x [ d5 ] ] - it is this move that starts the Fried Liver Attack. The formation of the black king knight and pawn clustered on [ d5 ] [ e5 ] and [ e6 ] in the middle of the board make it look like a lump of liver in a body!
 [ Q f8 + ]  [ K b7 ]  [ Q x h6 ]  [ Q x d6 ] , [ e5 ]  32.e5!! now black resigned because he can't prevent white from eating black knight and black is already down with 6 pawns. if 32....Qd2?? threatening the rook then 33.[ Q x d2 ]  [ e4 ] , [ c5 ]  this follows the sicilian defense.
 [ K x e2 ]  [ N x f1 ]  [ R x f1 ]  [ B c6 ] , [ N c4 ]  counter attack started
 [ N h7 ]  [ Q e8 + ]  [ K f6 ]  [ Q e6 + ]  [ K g5 ]  [ R e5 + ] , [ K f4 ]  I studied this variation after finding 29.Qe8+. For black's only other option was 31...[ K h4 ] but then I would mate with 32.g3#.
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ N f6 ]  Petrov. Not my favorite of openings.
 [ N e7 ] , [ a3 ]  It is well known that in this position there is no harm for Black in permitting the knight to come in at [ d6 ] by 6.[ N b5 ] [ B x d2 + ] 7.[ Q x d2 ] 0-0.
 [ e4 ] , [ e6 ]  french opening
 [ h x g5 ]  [ Q h5 ]  [ f6 ] , [ h4 ]  try to double on h-file.
 [ O-O ]  [ B x c6 ]  [ b x c6 ]  [ d3 ] , [ d x e5 ]  ? I studied this line at home before(with a little help from a book that mentions this but doesn't go to much into it.) 8...[ f5 ] is better.9.[ B x h6 ] [ g x h6 ] 10.Nf3(10.[ N d2 ] [ R b8 ] 11.0-0-0 [ B [ d4 ] ] 12.[ c3 ] [ B x e5 ] is unclear)10...[ R b8 ] 11.b3(11.ex[ f5 ] Rx[ f5 ] 12.[ Q g4 + ] [ K h8 ] 13.[ d4 ] [ R x e5 + ] 14.[ d x e5 ] [ N x e5 ] is unclear)11...[ f x e4 ] 12.[ d x e4 ] [ Q e7 ] 13.[ N b d2 ] [ Q g7 ] 14.0-0-0 [ a5 ] with compensation for the sacrificed material.
 [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ c3 ]  [ c3 ] opens the files for [ B f1 ] and Qd1. Moreover it secures d4. The only problem is that it blocks N[ c3 ] which is not very bad if I develop the bishop c1.
 [ B f4 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ Q b6 ] , [ N e5 ]  Taking the knight now would be a mistake because the bishop would bear down on [ g7 ] and my dark squared bishop is currently the only piece defending my kingside since the other bishop is shutting my queen out.
 [ g6 ] , [ Q d5 ]  My QUEEN came out for an attack..
 [ B g4 ]  [ Q f8 ]  [ Q e4 ] , [ B x a3 ]  25. .... [ B x a3 ] (I now pick off the a pawn - I know my [ c6 ] pawn is doomed and I will then force a queen swap which I did on move 27)
 [ N b d7 ] , [ N x d7 ]  Rather than retreat I swap down.
 [ c5 ]  [ R x a6 ]  [ Q b7 ]  [ R x a8 ] , [ R x a8 ]  Black has squandered a pawn and a rook exchange here: after grabbing the pawn I have also got an exchange I was seeking to make my pawns and minor pieces more of a threat.
 [ O-O ] , [ h5 ]  Leaving the option of Nxg5. I want my pawns to be cleared anyway to attack so that works out in my favor.
 [ R b8 ]  [ B d5 + ]  [ K f8 ] , [ R a b1 ]  A trade of rooks here would give white the chance to invade on the 8th. But 24. ... [ R x b1 ] 25. [ R x b1 ] [ B d6 ] trys to keep the rook out but 26. [ R b5 ] [ B c7 ] to save the knight allows [ R x c5 ] with pressure on c8.
 [ R x c2 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ R c5 ] , [ B x f6 ]  Now I'll gladly go in for piece exchanges.
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ g6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ d5 ]  This opening is called the Grunfeld which is popular with people who want to counter attack with the Black pieces. It is Bobby Fischer's and Garry Kasparov's they use it as a dynamic and popular weapon! 3.[ d6 ] however is the King's Indian Defence ( KID)
 [ c x d4 ] , [ N x d4 ]  After this exchange Black has an open c file and two central pawns (white only has one) but White can develop faster and more easily.
 [ N x d4 ]  [ Q h3 ] , [ N x c2 + ]  This is decisive I dont think there is any possible defense now.
 [ c x d4 ] , [ N x e7 ]  If I take with queen I'm loosing rook.
 [ N b4 ] , [ a3 ]  The knight wasn't doing much here - I could have taken the opportunity to play [ N c3 ] and get more pieces into play. Instead I played [ a3 ] happy to trade off his knight for my bishop. Doing so I remove one of his two active pieces and get my queen into the ball game.
 [ d6 ] , [ N g5 ]  I decide to proceed with plan A shock and awe on the king side...
 [ N g6 ] , [ B d3 ]  This move was strange. It was designed to play [ e5 ] and make a full attack but in hindsight it seems just a waste. Nb-[ d2 ] for development or Q[ d2 ] to prevent [ N f4 ] would both be superior.
 [ Q x e2 ]  [ N d7 ] , [ R f3 ]  My threat is [ B x h7 + ] [ K x h7 ] [ R h3 + ] [ K g8 ] [ Q h5 ] leaving black with little chances.
 [ Q x e1 ] , [ N x d4 ]  Black does win a pawn and white's bishops look weaker than before. The knight can move somewhere else to unveil an attack on white's fianchettoed bishop can regain the knight:bishop ratio and can fork the queen and rook.
 [ Q x f6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ Q g6 ]  Now that's an interesting move. I've got the feeling she's planning something very sneaky. Does she expect me to capture with the knight and then I have to take another move to retreat it after she plays c6? And my bishop is stuck on [ f1 ] until I play g3. So I think I'll take with the pawn instead and see what she has planned.
 [ Q b6 ] , [ N e2 ]  Black eyes the b-pawn but comes at it directly rather than exploiting it. White tries to defend the center but Black can still take control of [ d4 ] with Nc6. White quickly runs out of defenders.
 [ R x f2 + ]  [ R x f2 ]  [ Q x f2 + ]  [ K h1 ] , [ B d6 ]  threat:Qh2mate
 [ c x d5 ]  [ R a c8 ]  [ K f2 ]  [ f5 ] , [ K e3 ]  White is following the rule about bringing the king to the center in the endgame but he really overdid it in this game. The king doesn't have a role yet.
 [ O-O ] , [ g6 ]  This was a terrible mistake and a waste of time. The whole game is centered on my getting my bishop developed.
 [ N h5 ] , [ O-O ]  Although I would've held off on this until completing development there is no choice here. I see the mistake I made and now I must fix it by getting the monarch to safety. In fact he implied that it needed to be done. Jack: Very good you're smart. Joe: Thank you. Jack: That was the right move.
 [ Q d7 ]  [ N e4 c5 ] , [ Q c8 ]  Black is not worried about the N moving yet because the LSB is unprotected.
 [ K c6 ] , [ d7 ]  With that I keep pushing my pawn.
 [ O-O ]  [ c7 ]  [ Q e8 ]  [ R c1 ]  [ N d5 ] , [ B h2 ]  Planting his knight on [ d5 ] was a strong move. I was not sure how to respond and just retreated my bishop.
 [ B h4 ] , [ g5 ]  Renews the attack on White's bishop while freeing Black's knight from the pin.
 [ O-O ]  [ N e5 ]  [ f4 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ N g4 ]  [ Q c3 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N h5 ]  [ Q d2 ] , [ Q x d2 ]  Black had no real choice here as the retreats to [ b5 ] [ g7 ] or [ h8 ] were all very unattractive.
 [ B x c6 + ]  [ b x c6 ]  [ N g e2 ] , [ B f5 ]  Although White has superior development his pieces are stifled in his own half supressed by my long-range.
 [ N x f6 + ]  [ g x f6 ] , [ Q g4 + ]  As not surprisingly this move follows. But what's worse is that I'm going to lose a pawn. As I can't recapture since Charles takes with the Q.
 [ d6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ B d7 ]  the pin is neutralized
 [ O-O ] , [ N d7 ]  13. ....... [ N d7 ] - develops another piece but shuts in Fou Leblanc - this bishop will be Tres Fou later on in the game!
 [ a6 ] , [ B e2 ]  attacking the a-pawn again and preparing to push the N away from [ e4 ]  [ a5 ] , [ R d7 ]  getting behind the IQP not so much with a view to taking it immediately but to tying Black up in its defence
 [ R f d1 ] , [ R b a8 ]  Incase the a file ever were to open. it also clears the [ b8 ] square for my other rook and allows [ R a7 ] where I can choose to double rooks if I ever choose to.
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ] , [ c4 ]  The Queen's Gambit typical position. This is one of the oldest openings in chess where white have a good chance of taking control in the center. It's very important for white to capture the [ d5 ] pawn which give white control over the centre
 [ N f6 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ B e7 ]  Black meanwhile prepares to "castle by hand". Once he plays [ R f8 ] then [ N g5 + ] will have no impact except for losing tempo for White.
 [ B g4 ]  [ e5 ] , [ B e2 ]  a little bit confusing.
 [ N e3 ]  [ Q h3 ]  [ f x e5 ] , [ d x e5 ]  17. ...... [ d x [ [ e5 ] ] ] - the idea of [ f6 ] becomes apparent here - I played that move to support [ [ e5 ] ] - the [ [ e5 ] ] pawn prevents Freddy putting a rook on [ f4 ] in order to swing round to [ h4 ] forcing Glenda to retreat.
 [ K g2 ] , [ K e7 ]  (?/?!) The first real mistake of the game according to GK. A straightforward oversight it must have seemed to Jo when she saw this position. But you know I am beginning to wonder about that. Could Black have seen that his advantages were gradually eroding away and something needed to be done to create a wider range of possibilities even at the risk of conceding to his opponent real winning chances? Maybe Charles can answer that question...
 [ O-O-O ] , [ R e1 ]  Here 10. [ B e3 ] is the move to play according to both data bases I did this move a few tempi later. 10. [ R e1 ] is not played in the data base I played it to support my e-pawn.
 [ B c5 ]  [ R x a2 ] , [ N x f3 ]  In theory I am still a pawn to the good and I still thought I was winning. But wherever I wanted to put my rooks the knight keeps harrassing them and in a few moves I am going to lose either the h pawn or the c pawn
 [ B f6 ]  [ R a e1 ]  [ B d7 ] , [ Q c2 ]  The pawn on [ d6 ] was unprotected for a move but apparently white didn't see it. Or had other plans.
 [ O-O ] , [ e5 ]  opening up a lane for possible bishop attack
 [ e x f5 ] , [ c5 ]  I was expecting 21.[ c x d5 ] instead. That would have opened up the c file and the Q would have been able to exert influence maybe the [ a1 ] R could also join in the fun. After 21.[ c x d5 ] [ b6 ] the bishop isn't lost for nothing because of the very nice continuation: 22.Bx[ b6 ] ax[ b6 ] 23.Qc6! [ R d6 ] (otherwise [ Q a8 ] ) 24.[ R c1 ] [ Q e7 ] 25.[ R x f5 ] and black is helpless (for example the threat of Re5).
 [ Q x f6 + ] , [ R c6 ]  Although white is ahead in material black has connected passed pawns on the 5th rank defended by his king this won't be easy.
 [ R b7 + ]  [ K e6 ] , [ K x g6 ]  ? White should have checked with the rook again so [ R x g6 ] could be played. I was still trying to hold on to my pair of passed pawns and only saw the continuation 46...[ R x g3 + ] 47.Kxh5.
 [ B d7 ]  [ d x c6 ]  [ B x c6 ] , [ N b5 ]  White's queen is too well positioned. Rather than moving it the knight on [ b5 ] blocks it and poses another threat to c7.
 [ Q d8 ] , [ N f5 ]  Now this knight gets to occupy the still warm [ f5 ] outpost threatening the future of the Rook on g8...
 [ B g7 ] , [ B h6 ]  Now I block the exchange and put pressure on the pinned bishop. It's most likely the bishop bishop Queen rook exchange from earlier.
 [ K x f8 ]  [ Q f6 + ]  [ K e8 ]  [ Q x e6 ] , [ a5 ]  This move was very perplexing. I thought for sure black would've gone for a queen trade with QC8. Fear of losing the queen seals black's fate.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N g5 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ N a5 ]  [ B b5 + ]  [ c6 ]  [ d x c6 ]  [ b x c6 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ h6 ] , [ N h3 ]  Stienitz played this against Tchigorin in 1891 and lost since then no one else tried it until this game.
 [ f5 ]  [ B d7 ] , [ N x e4 ]  He should have castled here.
 [ R b5 ]  [ B g6 ] , [ B g5 ]  Piling in now White has the initiative. (Fritz: +1.10/17)
 [ c3 ]  [ B a5 ] , [ N d2 ]  I have to be aware of a possible [ N x d4 ] since [ c3 ] is pinned. Just in case I want to play [ Q c2 ] sooner or later.
 [ Q x h4 ] , [ B h5 + ]  messed up the person castle. "Castle Early As Possible"
 [ Q e2 ]  [ Q e5 ]  [ R d5 ]  [ Q g3 ] , [ R x h5 ]  [ R f5 ] prevents the mess...
 [ c3 ] , [ R x b3 + ]  I couldn't believe it. I want to run fritz on this game and see if I was actually beating Bo Hansen at this point. I obviously cut it closer than it was. I was in shock.
 [ O-O ]  [ B e7 ] , [ a3 ]  I didnt get that move. I think that [ d4 ] is worth looking here.
 [ K f8 ]  [ N f5 ]  [ Q x e4 ] , [ N d6 ]  There it is. A rare find. An undisturbed bishop for the taking coupled nicely with my opponent's even less satisfying option. My opponent is so befuddled with all this horseplay. His next move is his last mistake.
 [ c x d4 ] , [ e x d4 ]  The base of the London System is that the white's queenside must keep being a fortress. Period.
 [ N d4 ] , [ R g2 ]  Black wants to keep the white king immobilised and out of the pawns way. The activation of the black king is tricky too because if it runs too far away the white h-pawn may run through.
 [ R x c5 + ]  [ K d8 ] , [ h x g3 ]  32. [ h x [ g3 ] ] - after grabbing the [ c5 ] pawn I now recapture on [ g3 ] with the pawn and not Fou Lenoir. He must stay on that [ g1 ] - [ a7 ] diagonal.
 [ Q e2 ] , [ d6 ]  The black pawn on [ b5 ] is en prise from white's queen but white's queen is defending the knight on [ h5 ] so she can't capture the pawn just yet.
 [ Q f3 + ]  [ K g1 ] , [ N x d5 ]  
 [ a4 ] , [ g4 ]  Time to get my own pawn storm going.
 [ B f4 ]  [ R e7 e2 ]  [ B x d6 ] , [ R x b2 ]  21. ........... [ R x b2 ] - when you are down on material it pays to exchange pawns rather than pieces. Here Ion has managed to double rooks on the e file as I mentioned in a previous note. He has managed to get a rook down on the 7th rank which can be a bone in the throat. This resulted in Ion netting the b pawn and wrecking white's queenside pawn structure through the back door - black's queenside pawn structure is more intact. Ion is also threatening a move like R x N (uncovering an attack on the [ a1 ] rook) - white sidestepps this threat with Rad1.
 [ B d5 + ]  [ K h8 ] , [ R a1 ]  Now Black is collapsing.
 [ e4 ] , [ R a g8 ]  time to push things a bit...
 [ N x e4 ] , [ B x a1 ]  From this point on it is a loosing battle for black..
 [ h3 ]  [ h5 ]  [ h4 ]  [ a5 ]  [ a4 ] , [ B d7 ]  Now. But we should expect the same thing for the next move from both sides. I'm fairly confident that Erika is played the other moves to copy her opponent which I have seen before. In fact it's been that way for a long while but that's ill advised. GM Susan Polgar emphasized that one should not just copy his opponent because at some point you'll be forced to stop doing so when you're opponent places you in check. After which you can be lost. The example that Susan gave in "Polgar Chess University" was a game between a Master who wrote an article and his viewers.
 [ f x e4 ]  [ B x e4 ] , [ B d6 ]  Again his bishop gets in the way of the rook attack so I wasn't too worried.
 [ e5 ]  [ d x e5 ] , [ N x e5 ]  seemed kinda obvious. Besides being a pain in his ass I have a slight materal lead 3 pawns taken vs 2. Chess is obviously not just about a tit for tat exchange of pieces but for players at our (low) level I think material differences can have a big effect and kind of snowball too. His rook is threatened if he moves it I can attack it again with my knight keeping him all blocked up in that neck of the woods. If he then takes the knight on [ [ f7 ] ] with his queen he'll lose her to my bishop. He can't get his bishop out can't castle can't use the queen effectively. Of course I have to make sure my own queen is ok too. I'm guessing he'll 11.. Nb4-[ c6 ] to pressure my knight and in effect my queen too. My options include sacrificing my knight and taking his rook or moving my bishop [ [ f7 ] ] to put him in check. My black bishoip is available -- to go to [ g5 ] and threaten his knight/queen. I'd like to castle when I get a chance but not until this plays out more. I don't know if anyone will read this notes or find them useful but they also help me clarify to myself what my plans are.
 [ R e8 ]  [ c4 ]  [ R x e3 + ] , [ B x e3 ]  29. [ B x e3 ] - off comes the second pair of rooks with me retaining +3 here. It will soon become +4!
 [ R h e1 ] , [ b4 ]  Logical follow up.
 [ N e7 ] , [ N b5 ]  With a rook on the d file the threat of [ Q c7 ] is far more dangerous.
 [ K g2 ] , [ R d8 ]  I need to provide some support for the [ c7 ] pawn. If I'm going to win this I must use my pawns to their fullest. I really don't like this scenario.
 [ B e2 ] , [ c5 ]  Setting up a crossfire along the light long diagonal and the d-file. But it would have been better played a move earlier I now think.
 [ N x d2 ]  [ N x d2 ]  [ h x g5 ]  [ h x g5 ] , [ K d6 ]  Ditch the hanging pawn and push right up the middle.
 [ B h4 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ B g3 ] , [ B d6 ]  This was the idea. Now white has to choose but finally he will be forced into...
 [ N x d5 ]  [ c x d5 ] , [ B d7 ]  Now his King-Bishop is badly placed though his Queen-Bishop will de difficult to contain.
 [ O-O ] , [ e3 ]  A fairly modest approach by White. The most aggressive approaches to playing against the KID normally involve White playing e2-[ [ [ e4 ] ] ] fairly early on. This is because Black has completely ignored the centre so (if White wants to play for an advantage) the most logical approach is to grab as much of the centre as possible in order to take advantage of Black's omission. Obviously 5.[ [ [ e4 ] ] ] would be impossible in this position since Black's knight is covering e4; however 5.[ N c3 ] or 5.[ N d2 ] followed by 6.[ [ [ e4 ] ] ] would be a more ambitious approach. Normally if White only plays e2-[ e3 ] Black can be fairly certain of easy equality.
 [ Q x d7 ] , [ h5 ]  The only move
 [ B e6 ] , [ B x e6 + ]  Mate follows next move.
 [ f4 ] , [ b5 ]  b5? It is too early for Black to make this move ...d6! is still best.
 [ Q a3 ]  [ e x f3 + ] , [ K e1 ]  Taking the pawn was better.
 [ R h3 ]  [ R b7 + ]  [ K g8 ]  [ N f6 + ]  [ K f8 ]  [ h5 ]  [ b3 ] , [ K g2 ]  At the time I thought this might be a blunder. However the computer passed it over without comment. It seems that Black will achieve a draw regardless.
 [ K x h2 ] , [ K f3 ]  Now that we were opposition I am trying to promote a pawn by placing my King in between one of them. BTW this is a little similar to how the position looked in the very end of our game. That will be explained later on.
 [ N x g7 + ]  [ K e5 ] , [ N e8 ]  Still giving you the opportunity to skewer and pick up his N. But you have something better although it's harder to see since it's several moves.
 [ e6 ] , [ a3 ]  I think this is a little defensive
 [ B x c6 ]  [ N x c6 ] , [ N g5 + ]  the king is "naked" and that's the exact moment to attack him!
 [ Q e1 ] , [ N x g3 + ]  Almost tricking me into taking it but i'm to clever
 [ N x c6 ]  [ B e3 ] , [ B e6 ]  Driving back the Knight. Draw agreed. White has an endgame advantage with a flank majority on the Q-side but it would take a long time to try and exploit. Even if it could be exploited it may not be enough to win.
 [ N c4 + ] , [ K a6 ]  Here Freddy admits he was just looking for a way to draw here. a master just hoping for a draw against a class C-D player on the 13th move. Was my position that good? apparently the comp doesn't think so still gives -1.11 ( a pawn in favor of Black) but I still have a chance. Figuratively not literally
 [ B e6 ] , [ B b2 ]  Now I decide to fianchetto my DSB. Of course I am planning to finish development and connect my rooks at some point.
 [ e x d5 ]  [ c x d5 ] , [ N e5 ]  lo and behold this is the apocalypse attack. If you also notice white has broken classical theory making two pawn and knight moves in first four moves! The knight on [ e5 ] is safe. Black cannot play [ f6 ] due to: [ Q h5 ] ;...[ [ g6 ] ] and I think you know the rest. Notice the open e file the diagonal [ a4 ] to [ e8 ] and the Knight attacking [ c6 ] [ d7 ] [ f7 ] [ [ g6 ] ] g4.
 [ Q e3 ] , [ O-O ]  I have noticed a massive edge connected with my king being on E file so I castled
 [ g5 ] , [ Q x f7 + ]  !! And black is toast.
 [ N c2 ]  [ R b1 ] , [ N c5 ]  I'm aiming for 36. ... [ N b3 ] 37. ... [ N d2 ] If 36. b3/[ b4 ] [ N x d3 ]  [ R x b2 ] , [ a5 ]  I want to play 43. ... [ R a7 ] 44. ... [ a4 ] 45. ... [ R a5 ]  [ R a2 ] , [ R a7 ]  Depending on WHITE'S move I may play 44. ... [ R a6 ]  [ K b4 ]  [ R d3 ]  [ a3 ]  [ R d4 + ] , [ K c3 ]  60. [ R d3 ] [ K c2 ] 61. [ K e3 ] [ R e7 + ] 62. Kf2/Kf3/[ K f4 ] [ K x d3 ] and 60. [ R d3 + ] [ K c2 ] 61. [ K d4 ] [ R d7 + ] 62. Kc4/Kc5/Ke3/Ke4/[ K e5 ] [ R x d3 ] would both have lost WHITE his Rook
 [ B e3 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ f3 ]  preparing castling to the long side...
 [ R f d1 ]  [ R e4 ]  [ R a c1 ]  [ B x d4 + ]  [ K h1 ] , [ R a e8 ]  with a past pawn in the middle of the board and black prepared to attrite white's pieces away white yields the board.
 [ e6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ B e7 ] , [ B g5 ]  complicated play really - designed to pin the knight whilst opening up the position. My only target at this point was rook mobility.
 [ Q g5 ] , [ B x g5 ]  Wow. 11. ... Qg5?? deserves the double question mark. Black sends his queen into the slaughter probably thinking he was forking two pawns [ e5 ] and [ g2 ] but obviously overlooking white's bishop on c1.
 [ N c3 ] , [ d5 ]  That was very strong. He simply took over the center in a "piece developing" way.
 [ R e8 ]  [ N b4 ]  [ B b5 ] , [ K g1 ]  37. [ K g1 ] - I very nearly fell for it I very nearly fell for it but just before I hit the submit button I had a sixth sense. Thank god it kicked in because if I had played 37. Nxd5?? black's lsb would have pinned my knight against Henry and there would have been no way of saving the knight. So I threaten to take on [ c5 ] by moving Henry off to a safer diagonal in line with Fou Lenoir.
 [ e4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ d x e6 ]  [ B x e6 ]  [ B e2 ] , [ B c5 ]  First move out of schemes. I tried this some times well knowing that [ d4 ] comes and then [ B b6 ] makes me lose a tempo... but I solve the dsb's dev problem and if ever white wants to play [ d5 ] my B would be looking at f7. He can take it true but that implies white to exchange Nc3...
 [ d5 ]  [ c4 ]  [ d4 ]  [ g3 ]  [ f6 ]  [ B g2 ]  [ e5 ] , [ d3 ]  Ok a dangerous closed pawn chain. My bsb will be suffering so it seems a good idea to exchange it soon.
 [ Q g2 ]  [ Q x g2 + ]  [ R x g2 ]  [ g5 ] , [ a4 ]  The Pawn forces Black's resignation.
 [ R g2 ] , [ Q x h3 ]  As expected the pawn goes but the computer analysis views this as a blunder yes a blunder and that [ B e5 ] again was the best. I'd tell you why this is a blunder but I'll show and tell instead for I saw the opportunity.
 [ K h2 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ R x d6 ]  [ g5 ] , [ N e4 ]  Threatening pawn and numerous beneficial forks [ c5 ] [ f6 ]  [ N x g5 ]  [ B x c2 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ R x b2 ] , [ B d4 ]  Was hoping for [ R b7 ] 36. [ R c1 ] then if Bishop comes off b1-[ h7 ] diagonal white plays 37. [ R h6 ] which will win the game for white.
 [ b3 ]  [ K f7 ] , [ R e3 ]  34. [ R e3 ] - to stop a possible rook incursion on c3.
 [ Q x b8 + ]  [ Q x b8 ]  [ B x b8 ]  [ K x b8 ] , [ K f2 ]  White defends his [ f3 ] pawn before beginning to march (and activate his rook).
 [ R g1 ]  [ Q h3 ] , [ d4 ]  grabs the centre
 [ R b7 ] , [ R x h5 ]  The KRP falls.
 [ B d4 + ]  [ K g6 ] , [ R f3 ]  Finally a big piece gets to join the fracas. The vultures are circling.
 [ Q a4 ]  [ N h3 ] , [ R a1 ]  Black has allowed White more activity there than he probably should have done
 [ B b7 ]  [ d4 ] , [ e x d4 ]  Although this exchange has been played before I think Black does better to delay it. It give White the square [ c3 ] for the [ N b1 ] and leaves White in control of the centre.
 [ K h2 ] , [ B f5 ]  Make it a triple pin!
 [ R e1 + ]  [ B e6 ] , [ Q e4 ]  Side stepping around the trade again.
 [ R f2 + ] , [ K g1 ]  If he takes my rook then I take his rook and have a chance of a draw.
 [ g3 ] , [ h4 ]  Sadly I dropped the ball at the end of an otherwise reasonably well played match leaving me with an unsatisfactory feeling (especially since a player at my level should understand end games well enough to not make the mistake in the end). However there were still interesting aspects about the game overall so I hoped you enjoyed the annotations.
 [ B d3 ] , [ Q d7 ]  developing the queen and connecting the rook on the back rank
 [ K f6 ] , [ Q c f5 # ]  And mate. ---- That's all. I hope you post a few comments by the road or PM me so I can change a few things to make it better. Thank you for everything and good luck in your GK games!
 [ a4 ]  [ h4 ]  [ b x c5 ]  [ b x c5 ] , [ R b8 ]  34. ...... [ R b8 ] - threatening Rb3.
 [ R x f5 ]  [ K g4 + ]  [ K g6 ] , [ R x h7 ]  unexpected and best. I had analyzed 36 [ R h6 + ] and after 36 ... [ K x h6 ] 37 [ K x f5 ] had eventually figured out that 37 ... Re8!! was the winning move. It would have been essential to prevent [ K e6 ] and [ K x f6 ] setting up a mating net for white!
 [ R x e1 + ] , [ K x e1 ]  ...before exchanging our remaining rooks as he only has two pawns left on his far right-hand side and my three left-most pawns are still intact plus I have a stray pawn on my third right-hand file on the 5th rank (c4) which is the perfect distraction for the king.
 [ B g5 ] , [ R e1 ]  Black's bishop attacks White's bishop on [ e3 ] which is defended only by the f pawn. I don't want want to use the fpawn in Bishop defense because if I do then I'll have doubled pawns on the e file and no chance of ever relieving the isolation of the pawn on g4. So I defend the Bishop with my rook.
 [ N c6 ] , [ K h1 ]  Trying to get [ d4 ] out of the pin on the a7-[ g1 ] angle so I can play 13. d5.
 [ f5 ] , [ B d3 ]  Better was cxb5.. taking the 'free' pawn now [ N f4 ] is dangerous.
 [ R d5 x d3 ]  [ R x d3 ]  [ R x d3 ]  [ R f2 ]  [ R d6 ] , [ K h2 ]  Let's see how his 1-3 pawns fare against my extra bishop...
 [ R f7 ] , [ B c8 ]  Even though I am down on material this suddenly feels more winning. When I see an oppenent play the same move a part of me always thinks he could find no improvement and is willing to settle for a draw.
 [ K d2 ]  [ B g5 + ] , [ K x d3 ]  (Reply to Ionadowman) I briefly thought that 26. [ B d5 + ] [ [ c4 ] ] 27. [ B f3 ] was the solution particularly in view of the exquisite variation 27. ... Nb4? 28. [ R a3 + ] [ K c2 ] 29. O-O [ B c5 + ] (Black can throw this check in or not it doesn't matter) 30. [ K h1 ] Rhf8. It looks as if Black has wriggled out but now comes the rook sac 31. Rc1+!! [ K x c1 ] 32. [ R a1 + ] [ K c2 ] 33. [ B d1 ] mate. Unfortunately there are two flaws. First 26. ... [ [ c4 ] ] is not forced; Black can try 26. ... [ K c2 ] and I couldn't find a clear win. Second instead of 27. ... [ N b4 ] Black can play 27. ... [ d2 + ] 28. [ K x d2 ] [ R a d8 + ] 29. [ K c1 ] Rhf8. You're right that Black has to sac the exchange but look at the awesome compensation he gets after (say) 30. [ B d1 + ] [ R x d1 ] 31. [ R x d1 ] Rf2. How will White ever activate his pieces? This move was when I started realizing that this was not going to be an easy win. There are lots of exchange sacs that give Black tons of counterplay. Thus I also had to reject 26. Bxb7? Nb4! 27. [ B x a8 ] [ N c2 + ] because Black's pieces just take over the board. Although risky 26. [ K d2 ] was the most consistent with White's principles for playing this opening because it keeps the coordination of the pieces (keeping the two bishops on the board connecting White's rooks and even using the king as a fighting piece) and keeps mating threats alive. The fact that it also eliminates Black's potentially dangerous pawn on [ d3 ] is a nice bonus.
 [ B d6 ] , [ B a5 ]  I changed my mind...
 [ R c7 ]  [ N e2 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ Q g1 + ]  [ K f3 ] , [ R f8 + ]  
 [ Q x e6 ] , [ b3 ]  Inaccuracy.19.[ R f d1 ] followed by 20.[ b4 ] was superior I think.The plan would be to weaken and immobilise blacks Q side majority.
 [ N x f6 + ]  [ g x f6 ] , [ c4 ]  good move white must be aggressive or else he will lose his positional advantage if white played a regular move like 9.[ B d3 ] so black would answered 9... [ N d7 ] and everything fine for black. however what if 9...Bxe4.10.cxb5-Bg7.11.Qg4-Bg6.12.Nf5-0-0 and uncleared position . or even 9...[ b4 ] .
 [ f5 ]  [ Q e7 ] , [ O-O ]  
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ c3 ]  [ B b6 ] , [ d4 ]  Book play through here standard Giuoco Piano.
 [ e4 ] , [ c6 ]  So here it is: the caro-kann. After white's next move black will almost always play [ d5 ] to get a good center and good development.
 [ B c3 ]  [ R h2 + ] , [ B d2 ]  If instead 91.[ K d3 ] Black can play ...[ b4 ] at once (92.Bx[ b4 ] Rb2! 93.[ K c3 ] [ R x b3 ] ) or 91...[ R h3 ] 92.[ K c2 ] b4! 93.[ B g7 ] [ K c4 ] etc.
 [ B f1 ]  [ R a e8 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ d5 ] , [ c5 ]  15cxd may have been better.Though ceding an isolated D-pawn white would have got more activity than in the game.
 [ N c8 e7 ]  [ O-O ]  [ h6 ]  [ R f c1 ]  [ R f c8 ]  [ R c2 ] , [ Q e8 ]  Allowing a fatal pin on QB3. But 21... Kt-[ Q1 ] is no better: it allows 22 R/1-[ Q [ B1 ] ] RxR 23 RxR R-[ B1 ] 24 RxR KtxR 25 Q-[ B3 ] Kt-[ K2 ] 26 Q-[ B7 ] and White has an easy win.
 [ N d4 ]  [ Q x d4 ]  [ e x f6 ]  [ Q d1 + ]  [ K b2 ] , [ R x c2 # ]  0-1
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B c4 ] , [ h6 ]  this move seemed a bit peculiar to me as it was preempting my dark-squared bishop from sitting at [ g5 ] w/o even knowing if I had planned to fianchetto it to b2. Plus it neglected development of the pieces.
 [ b4 ]  [ N b1 ]  [ c5 ] , [ f4 ]  21. [ f4 ] - threatening to win a pawn by Bxh4.
 [ Q g3 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ c4 ]  [ B x e6 ]  [ R x e6 ] , [ Q x e6 ]  23. [ Q x e6 ] - that white pawn has been removed from the board and a rook for a bishop has been exchanged but white's attack has not burned out!
 [ d3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ e3 ] , [ h5 ]  Gaining space and fighting for the initiative
 [ R e7 ] , [ R c7 ]  Forcing the exchange of Black's last Rook.
 [ f4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ e4 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ N g5 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ B x f7 + ]  [ K d7 ]  [ Q x g4 + ]  [ N x g4 ] , [ B e6 + ]  The thematic position.
 [ d x c6 ]  [ Q x c6 ] , [ Q d8 + ]  the first check of the game. that's pretty sad
 [ b3 ] , [ B x c3 ]  [ B x b3 ] 15.[ c x b3 ] [ Q x b3 ] could have led to an interesting game too but without my rooks I was not certain to create a good enough attack.
 [ N d7 + ]  [ K e7 ] , [ N x b8 ]  I don't know whether it was planning or luck but I'm left with absolutely nowhere to move with any of my pieces. The rest of the game before I resigned is me looking for something I can move somewhere.
 [ K g2 ] , [ Q g5 + ]  Here W is limited by a series of forced mates (64. [ K h3 ] [ Q g3 # ] 64. [ K h1 ] [ Q g3 ] 65 B moves Qh2#)
 [ R a f1 ] , [ N e5 ]  exactly what I expected. Now lets get his queen.
 [ d4 ] , [ B g7 ]  This is not for the faint-hearted; black does not defend c5... This is one of the great concepts of the Sicilian Defense: never defend c5... It is about d5...
 [ c4 ] , [ g5 ]  His best hope but it ruins his pawn structure and opens his kingside to attack.
 [ e4 ] , [ e5 ]  Now comes said move forcing me to step back and propose the queen exchange.
 [ R d x b3 ]  [ R a1 ]  [ B d3 + ]  [ K d4 ] , [ R b8 b5 ]  Now he asked "do you see anything coming?" And at first I said no but when we arrived at this position I saw an inevitable mating sequence which he was going to exploit. It's actually a similar situation to a recent quiz by GM Judit Polgar. Black has a mate in one and in order to prevent that the K would have to move. Well it's pinned so that makes it impossible at that point to prevent mate. So I resigned. Overall I enjoyed my game against. But the moral is something is that he pm'd me earlier today. In it he said "Here's a synopsis of our game from my perspective: You played the King's pawn opening and I defended with the Sicilian defense Kan variation (Paulsen) and ended with your 5th move according to book play. I thought you played well until your 8th move w/ pxd5. This started troubles for white since I played p[ e4 ] and forked your Kn and B and also lead to doubling of your pawns. From here on I was trying to gain control of the middle while also having your pieces retreat. Once my B checked you on move 25 I wanted to keep the pressure on your K weaken your defense while hoping you would make some bad moves defending your K. Once my B captured your R on move 25 your K was pretty much exposed w/o much defense on that rank. You did play reasonably well until move 33 with R [ g1 ] that I mentioned during our game. Although you didn't have a good move at that point you abandoned your K and it made it easier for me to attack your K in the middle of the board since I had also brought my K up. From this point on it was just of me keeping the pressure on checking your K and winning pieces and exchanging pieces if necessary. Overall not a bad game to make it last till move 38 but a few mistakes early hurt your play. I hope something was learned from the game." BTW I would like to thank andywm for this amazing game and brigadecommander for the thread "Are All the Walker's Sitting". Without it this game would not have been feasible. And I agree that these WTW games are a great way for people to learn and improve their overall games.
 [ e x f6 ]  [ g x f6 ]  [ Q e3 + ] , [ K f7 ]  The black king is safe on [ f7 ] for the moment.
 [ B d3 ] , [ a6 ]  White: Stealth-Invader Black: Slackline
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ B b5 ]  3. [ B b5 ] - Kasparov's Spanish Torture.
 [ a3 ]  [ N d7 ] , [ B e2 ]  White gets ready to castle.
 [ R a a1 ] , [ R b8 ]  now the other R joins the attack
 [ e4 ] , [ f4 ]  18. [ f4 ] - an attempt to block off the line of attack of black's dsb.
 [ K d7 ]  [ N x a8 ] , [ N x e4 ]  12. [ N x e4 ] My thought here was that I was attacking [ R a1 ] and if e1[ x d1 ] then [ N f2 ] forks the K and R. However my friend fritz gave this move two ?? and suggested 12...[ N x c6 ] 13. [ b5 ] [ N b4 ]  [ N e5 + ] , [ d x e5 ]  and material is getting closer to equal.
 [ N f6 ] , [ R e e7 ]  Horrible but my only choice...
 [ R b d1 ]  [ f6 ] , [ B g3 ]  i hope he switch using [ K x g3 ] But he want to switch using bishops
 [ K f5 ]  [ R f4 + ] , [ K e5 ]  That was a wasted move Matthew. Why the heck did I do that?
 [ K c1 ]  [ K g7 ]  [ K x c2 ]  [ Q h7 + ] , [ K b3 ]  I was bit surprised black resigned with the queens still on the board but white is well ahead in material. Still plenty of room for mistakes by both sides.
 [ Q d3 ]  [ R f d8 ] , [ B x a6 ]  Exchange of a-pawns.
 [ R g4 ] , [ Q x g4 + ]  roneshet: f3xG4 No other chice...
 [ N h4 ] , [ g5 ]  ohhh which one which one???
 [ N a6 ]  [ B x a6 ] , [ B x a6 ]  White has traded both bishops for knights. White's king is in the open and black's is tucked away.
 [ c4 ]  [ f x g3 ]  [ h x g3 ] , [ e2 ]  ! Threatening the queen and threatening e1=Q+.
 [ e6 ]  [ O-O-O ] , [ R c8 ]  This I missed: f5.
 [ K f1 ] , [ B x g1 ]  "I think 9...Bxg1? is a very bad move. Your knight was doing nothing while his bishop was very active on that diagonal. ~ l-d-j (1747) on 18-Apr-12"
 [ R c1 ] , [ R c4 ]  offering the exchange.
 [ K f1 ] , [ N b2 ]  Protects [ d1 ] and d3. Looks like I'll be paying a visit to the Buckingham Palace.
 [ c6 ]  [ N d6 ]  [ B g6 ]  [ a4 ]  [ B c7 ] , [ N x b7 ]  the pawn grabbing is completely irrelevant as long as the central pawns are enough to prohibit any action of the bishop on [ g2 ]  [ f5 ]  [ N c5 ]  [ R a e8 ]  [ Q d4 + ]  [ e5 ] , [ Q h4 ]  black wouldn't have allowed the exchange of the queens but he had seen that after the pawn on [ h4 ] falls the black squared bishop becomes a very dominant piece on the board
 [ Q c7 ] , [ R d4 d7 ]  eyeing up [ f7 ]  [ R x f7 + ] , [ R x f7 ]  only move on [ K g7 ] [ Q g6 ] [ K h8 ] [ Q h7 ]  [ Q x f7 + ] , [ K h8 ]  good job pawn freed up angle
 [ Q f3 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ Q g2 ]  [ N x f4 ]  [ Q f1 ] , [ N h3 + ]  no comments needed -or am I wrong anyhow possibly?
 [ K f2 ]  [ R d8 ]  [ B c3 ]  [ e4 ]  [ R d1 ]  [ R d d7 ]  [ K e3 ]  [ g6 ] , [ f4 ]  An interesting choice. On the principle of "two weaknesses" White would normally try to keep the kingside open so as to have the possibility of infiltrating with his king. However this would mean his pieces being tied to the defence of the pawn on f3. Instead Andersson closes the kingside but thereby frees his hands to concentrate on the queenside weaknesses. His plan now is to transfer his king over to defend the b4-pawn and then attack the a-pawn with all his might bringing his rooks to [ a6 ] and [ a5 ] and placing the bishop on the g1-[ a7 ] diagonal.
 [ Q e2 ]  [ B b4 ]  [ B d2 ]  [ K b8 ]  [ a3 ] , [ B x c3 ]  Maybe not the wise choice as the dsb is a most important piece for me.
 [ Q x e2 ] , [ B g2 ]  Still fighting hard - quite a neat defence in the circumstances.
 [ N e4 ] , [ R c4 ]  ? Preparing to threaten the knight with two pieces. Looks strong but easily stopped.
 [ R a8 ]  [ N f7 + ]  [ K h7 ] , [ Q f6 ]  That is the mistake that threw the game for him. I was relieved.
 [ Q h2 + ] , [ K g5 ]  forced 3
 [ R x a7 ] , [ R d2 ]  A rook on the 7th always a thing of beauty. Of course white has one too...
 [ B d3 ]  [ K g8 ]  [ h5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ h6 ] , [ K h8 ]  Black hopes to create swindles based on stalemate motifs.
 [ O-O ]  [ N c3 ] , [ N c6 ]  But Stanley has the same thing in mind.
 [ Q d2 + ]  [ N e3 ]  [ Q x e3 + ]  [ K g4 ] , [ h5 # ]  I really enjoyed the opportunity Porcho! Thanks for setting up the mini tournament.
 [ R f7 ]  [ N e4 g5 ]  [ B x d5 ] , [ N x f7 ]  one step to mate
 [ B b1 ] , [ g4 ]  ?!
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ c5 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ d6 ]  [ e4 ]  [ g6 ] , [ f4 ]  The once feared 4 pawns attack is very agressive and cut throat. white wishes to play e4-[ e5 ] which results in very complicated positions.
 [ N x c2 + ] , [ K d1 ]  black forks my King and Rook by capturing the pawn on C2. I move King to D1.
 [ b6 ] , [ K d7 ]  Still chasing!
 [ R f8 ]  [ K g2 ]  [ K g8 ]  [ a4 ]  [ R f7 ]  [ h5 ]  [ K f8 ]  [ K g3 ] , [ R f5 ]  Black tries to target an isolated pawn.
 [ R d5 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ R c5 ]  [ R e d8 ]  [ N g e2 ]  [ R d6 ]  [ R x c4 ]  [ R x e6 ]  [ N g3 ]  [ R d8 ] , [ K b1 ]  want to avoid being checked
 [ B f4 ]  [ B x f4 ]  [ g x f4 ] , [ Q x h3 ]  His kingside is now completely open
 [ N f3 ]  [ N b d7 ]  [ h3 ]  [ c5 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ B x f4 ] , [ N x f4 ]  I'm not sure how well-placed that knight is. It helps defend [ d5 ] and attacks [ e6 ] but it's also out in the open.
 [ B x c4 ]  [ d x e3 ] , [ b6 + ]  Now here comes the attack!
 [ B x c3 ]  [ d x c3 ] , [ d6 ]  This move basically prevents white from taking advantage of the [ e5 ] square.
 [ a6 ] , [ R a1 ]  but black eliminates white Bishop easily
 [ B x g4 ] , [ h3 ]  Then to drive the bishop back whence it came.
 [ R f d1 ]  [ R a7 ] , [ R a c1 ]  Grab the open file
 [ R f5 ]  [ R d b4 ]  [ B d5 ]  [ R h g4 + ]  [ K f3 ]  [ R g7 ]  [ R h5 ] , [ R x f7 + ]  A draw was agreed because of 51. [ B x f7 ] [ K x f7 ] 52. [ R x h7 + ] [ K g6 ] and after the rook moves the [ b3 ] pawn will fall. Appropriate that the game ended with a capture on f7.
 [ N c3 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ R d1 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ Q d3 + ] , [ g6 ]  I'm not sure I like this move. It removes defense of the h pawn which was his undoing later.
 [ g3 ]  [ Q e1 ]  [ R d7 ]  [ Q e5 ] , [ f4 ]  59. [ f4 ] - preventing all ideas of Ye Olde Perpetualle.
 [ B x c5 ] , [ O-O ]  Beautiful!! White has left the poor pawn brigade in tatters and castled his king to safety. And all he had to give up were his two useless bishops! --Now we enter the middle game and both players realize they must gain the utmost tempo out of their next moves...
 [ Q d2 ] , [ d6 ]  Opening a line to develop his last minor piece.
 [ K c2 ] , [ e x f4 ]  Isolating white's pawns.
 [ N f1 ]  [ N g4 ] , [ Q d2 ]  Giving up the bishop doesn't seem best [ B d2 ] or [ B c1 ] followed by [ h3 ] and bringing the bishop back later should be OK.
 [ N e5 ] , [ Q d6 ]  my oponent decided to play the knight now. you see the importance of [ d4 ] over [ d3 ] last move it will gain me time to reinforce my other knight and have no possible double bishop pins
 [ O-O ] , [ B d6 ]  I dont like that move. [ e5 ] is a problem for black.
 [ B g5 ] , [ B d7 ]  ? Waste of tempo. Black don't have time to think about castling. Computer analysis. Blunder: +6.88 » … [ B d7 ] 15. [ N x f6 + ] [ g x f6 ] 16. [ B g6 + ] [ K d8 ] 17.

[ B d3 + ] [ K a4 ]  [ B x h2 + ] , [ K h1 ]  My queen seems to be in a very bad position but there is nothing to fear because my knight is too well protected and my attack is just too much strong at this point.
 [ B b5 ]  [ d6 ] , [ B x c6 + ]  I was feeling aggressive that day. I don't like to trade a bishop for a knight early but I often will if it results in stacked pawns.
 [ b x a5 ] , [ R x a5 ]  better than bxa5: we are still looking for ways to trade rooks...
 [ N f4 ] , [ B d6 ]  Blunder for Black. Pulls the Bishop off the defense of the knight and give me a piece.
 [ R x d8 + ]  [ R x d8 ] , [ Q a4 ]  A hope to simplify the defense by eventual rook exchanges turned out to be in vain.
 [ B x d7 ] , [ Q x f8 + ]  it had to happen eventually. though the fork still looms ominously.
 [ K f7 ]  [ K h2 ] , [ g5 ]  A very bad move only helping white. I wanted to open lines for my own rook.
 [ R h7 ]  [ N x g7 ]  [ R x g7 ] , [ B b2 ]  Improving my bishop placement with tempo now [ B d4 ] is a possibility to block the d column and protect both my [ e3 ] and [ c5 ] pawns freeing my [ c1 ] rook to other functions
 [ B e2 ]  [ Q c6 ]  [ B f3 ]  [ e5 ]  [ Q c2 ]  [ Q x c2 ]  [ R x c2 ]  [ c6 ]  [ R d1 ]  [ f5 ]  [ R d7 ]  [ f x e4 ] , [ B x e4 ]  This trade nets white the pawn at [ c6 ] or g6.
 [ R x e1 + ] , [ R x e1 ]  the diffrense here that after 30...[ R b2 ] i have the option to play .31.[ R a1 ]  [ R b2 ]  [ R a1 ]  [ R b3 ] , [ N c8 ]  good move if 32....Rxc3.33.[ N x a7 ] and it will be very hard for black to stop my (a) pawn .
 [ d4 ] , [ N f6 ]  A mini-tournament game my second game against this opponent and this time I'm playing black. See Ready for the Cork annotated on 4/5/09 for the first game of the match. White opens with 1. [ d4 ] so black opts for Indian.
 [ e5 ]  [ N h4 ]  [ g6 ] , [ B h6 ]  ...black makes a mistake here ...i can keep the king in the centre and if they go 0-0-0 there is a gap to probe....
 [ R x f4 ] , [ N x f4 ]  No! After 25. [ B x g6 ] [ N x g6 ] 26. [ R x g6 ] [ Q x g6 ] 27. [ N x f4 ] the white gets one piece.
 [ g4 ]  [ d5 ] , [ B g2 ]  starting the most risky grob it wasnt volontary it's just a mistake from me ! good players never get in this trap (2/...- [ b [ c4 ] ] 3/ [ c4 ] - d5x[ c4 ] 4/ [ B x b7 ] ...etc) and then is very dificult to get back the [ g4 ] pawn.
 [ c2 ] , [ N e2 ]  Necessary as taking on [ c2 ] woud have yielded Black a check and a book draw in the rook ending. In view of what was approaching I wondered if Black would try 52...[ R e8 ] with the idea of presenting some technical problems while he still had a couple of pawns one on the brink of promotion to play with.
 [ N f6 ] , [ c3 ]  this is just like a rubenstein exchange variation in the caro-kann except black's e pawn is gone in exchange for a c pawn.
 [ N b4 ]  [ a4 ]  [ h6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ K f8 ]  [ K d2 ]  [ K e7 ]  [ N e1 ]  [ f5 ] , [ N d3 ]  Equivalent to resignation. Black has a piece advantage as well as a pawn majority on both wings.
 [ K b5 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ a x b3 ] , [ a x b3 ]  The pinned B falls. Black resigns here and somewhere in heaven Esteban Canal smiled. I made his variation look good.
 [ K d8 ] , [ Q e4 ]  Now ahead in material I look to simplify by removing the Queens. My opponent accedes.
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N x c6 ]  [ b x c6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B b4 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B x c3 ]  [ b x c3 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ Q d4 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ B a3 ]  Interesting on hindsight just how terrible a blunder 9. ... [ N x e4 ] was for me. It should have been O-O (which I had thought about) but I incorrectly felt my king was safe.
 [ e3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ c6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ Q f3 ]  [ e5 ]  [ R h3 ] , [ e4 ]  This move isn't necessarily bad it strengthens black's pawn structure while pushing the white queen. If white moves [ Q g3 ] black's pawn at [ g6 ] will be undefended. Protecting it with the queen (Qf6) blocks the black bishop while [ N e7 ] (move 9) restricts the queens movement.
 [ a4 ]  [ b4 ] , [ O-O ]  following Cramling Pia - Cmilyte Viktorija Elista 2004 1/2-1/2
 [ f x e5 ]  [ d x e5 ] , [ c5 ]  ! for the sole defender of [ e5 ] to leave
 [ N f4 ] , [ c6 ]  This move is possible because the white's dsb is trapped.
 [ Q d1 ]  [ R h8 + ]  [ K f7 ] , [ Q f4 + ]  The only possible defence now is 43...[ K e6 ] where after 44.[ N f8 + ] [ R x f8 ] 45.[ R x f8 ] [ R x f8 ] 46.[ g x f8 = Q ] is unclear but I suspect black might want to give up a pawn in exchange for getting rid of one of the queens with 46.Qf3+.
 [ B g3 ] , [ N e4 ]  Black has really seized the initiative now.
 [ N f3 ]  [ N e5 ] , [ R d1 ]  Rd1? I was not much interested in the d-pawn at all!
 [ B c5 + ]  [ K h1 ]  [ Q f6 ]  [ c3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ d4 ] , [ N x d4 ]  I am not sure about giving back the knight. It seems to me that white has to large an advantage in development. For me personally I like games where I have a lead in development.
 [ B b3 ] , [ B c5 ]  6...[ B b7 ] is the Archangelsk variation.
 [ N x d3 ]  [ Q x d3 ] , [ d x c4 ]  He now has an IQP
 [ R c7 ]  [ K h2 ]  [ h6 ]  [ Q c3 ]  [ Q f6 ]  [ R e2 ]  [ Q g6 ] , [ R e d2 ]  I double up. This file could be my path to victory.
 [ B x d4 ] , [ N g4 ]  !? ([ B e6 ] allowed Rxg7). This way I set some interesting threats on f2. (GK's engine here starts to give as "better" lines that lead black to a very sad position. I admit I dared a little too much trusting in lines that were only phantoms.
 [ N e7 ]  [ R a c1 ]  [ Q b6 ]  [ R x d5 ] , [ N x d5 ]  The attack has been blunted. Both sides maintain winning chances.
 [ N x d2 ]  [ B x d2 ]  [ B d6 ] , [ B e3 ]  This time it's not so much moving the same piece twice that is bad because the first was a capture but this closes the e file and puts his Bishop in a bad place. If he really wants the file closed I prefer moving the Bishop or Queen to e2.
 [ d3 ] , [ B x c3 ]  ! a great move that removes a key defender of [ [ e4 ] ] and takes away any ideas of [ N d5 ] plus it supports my idea of play f7-[ f5 ] in the future. Because white will have to defend [ [ e4 ] ] with the rook which will not be easy to do
 [ N g e2 ] , [ N e5 ]  What I mentioned about what I couldn't do with the N and what I wasn't going to do is why I played this. My attitude was that if I can't play 8...[ N c6 ] then I'd play 8...[ N b d7 ] with the idea of getting my N to a stronger outpost. In fact this centralizes my N since it's in the center. So I was confident here as I felt that I had a space advantage with more space in the center. Not only that but this attacks [ d3 ] which I kept in mind.
 [ R x h3 ] , [ a7 ]  49. ... Rxh3?? seals black's doom. It's doubtful that black could survive a King+rook+pawn vs. King+2 pawns endgame but it's far more doubtful that he can survive once white's queen promotes without immediate recapture. Moving his rook immediately to [ e8 ] was his only chance at a draw. It's interesting to note that six moves ago white had a two pawn material advantage and now black has a one pawn advantage. Three white pawns gave their lives so their king could find a new queen.
 [ R e6 ]  [ d7 ] , [ R d6 ]  Lost one pawn
 [ N x e7 ]  [ Q x e7 ] , [ Q x c2 ]  Now it's just a matter of technique
 [ B x f2 ] , [ Q x f2 ]  White shouldn't play 20. Qxe5? because black's response would be Ra8[ e8 ] skewering the white queen to her bishop on e2.
 [ f3 ]  [ g3 ]  [ e5 ]  [ Q f5 ]  [ e4 ]  [ b4 ]  [ N e7 ]  [ Q g5 ]  [ f6 ]  [ Q h4 ]  [ N g6 ]  [ Q h3 ]  [ K f7 ]  [ Q h5 ]  [ R f h8 ]  [ Q f5 ]  [ N e7 ]  [ Q f4 ]  [ Q x f4 ]  [ e x f4 ]  [ R h3 ]  [ B e3 ] , [ R b h8 ]  Look at that mass of pawns! With no way out he resigned.
 [ a x b5 ]  [ a x b5 ]  [ Q c3 ] , [ R e d7 ]  This move sets the trap of 30. [ R d1 ] Q[ x R e5 ] and play continues as in the game.
 [ B f8 ] , [ h x g6 ]  and now the second rook
 [ e x d4 ] , [ R a8 ]  White over looked 31. ... [ Q e5 ] and perhaps also [ f5 ] or [ f6 ] to protect the rook.
 [ B x c6 ]  [ d x c6 ]  [ O-O ] , [ B d6 ]  Have to protect the pawn. [ B g4 ] also works...
 [ a6 ]  [ B x c6 + ] , [ b x c6 ]  This makes my b pawn weak. I'm aware but I have to attack.
 [ c6 ] , [ N c3 ]  a tad better than bxc6.
 [ R x e3 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ Q h3 ]  [ R f2 ] , [ R x g3 + ]  Yes exactly.
 [ Q c7 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ O-O ] , [ Q c4 ]  In order to do this I needed another attacker. That means adding pressure to the c file.
 [ h6 ]  [ R e3 ] , [ K h7 ]  This move seems weak making [ f5 ] even more powerful
 [ B d3 ]  [ N b d7 ] , [ b3 ]  preparing queen side attack
 [ Q c1 + ]  [ K e2 ]  [ N x d4 + ]  [ K d3 ]  [ Q x c2 + ]  [ K e3 ] , [ Q e2 # ]  Thanks for reading
 [ a3 ]  [ N c2 ]  [ R e2 ]  [ R b1 + ]  [ K g2 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ R e4 ] , [ R b2 + ]  He starts chasing my king...
 [ B d3 ]  [ R g8 ]  [ g3 ] , [ h5 ]  Just [ B g4 ] [ h3 ] was not very appealing. The only purpose was to be able to play [ h5 ] at some point. It was just not the best plan. o-o-o was much more to the point. Even B[ h3 ] was not all that good white is not forced to castle Kside and I don't want to exchange my B for [ N f3 ] at all.
 [ O-O ] , [ N x a2 ]  and to avoid having lost a tempo i decided to annoy the rook there... not very clever from me.
 [ K g4 ] , [ Q f5 + ]  Therefore I decide to place him another check so 20.[ K g3 ] or 20.[ K h4 ] are his only options. However it does not matter where he moves the king because I will mate him either way.
 [ e5 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ N g4 ]  [ B g5 ] , [ Q d7 ]  This is where we leave the GK database or just about. There's one game with this line which continues 9.[ h3 ] [ N f6 ] 10.[ d x e5 ] [ d x e5 ] 11.[ Q c2 ] although the GK engine prefers 9.[ d5 ] [ N a6 ] 10.O-O [ Q e8 ] though I think that's a bit overly passive.
 [ Q x h7 + ]  [ K x h7 ]  [ R h1 + ]  [ B h3 ] , [ R x h3 # ]  Menchik shows that just as in every other aspect of life women are also superior to men at chess... when they want to be.
 [ Q h5 ] , [ Q c7 ]  The black pawn on [ f7 ] was under fire and white was threatening checkmate with 17. Qxf7#. Black defends the pawn and makes a threat of his own against the white pawn on c3.
 [ O-O ] , [ B e7 ]  I was anticipating castling but I should have anticipated his attack. The bishop could have waited. [ g6 ] or something that restricts the movement of his knight would have been more prudent.
 [ d x e4 ]  [ Q x c4 ] , [ b5 ]  Freddy wastes no time in attacking the queen...
 [ R x d2 ] , [ N x d2 ]  It allows White to get his Knight back into the game. My advantage is really only in my head now but White's chances to seize the initiative have also gone.
 [ b x c6 ] , [ e5 ]  after this black has 2 moves that give him an equality at least.
 [ Q c3 ]  [ K g1 ]  [ Q c1 + ] , [ K f2 ]  46. [ K f2 ] - Henry is eyeing up the top of the board. He intends to seek shelter there against any checks from the Wicked Witch.
 [ K f6 ]  [ N x g7 ]  [ R g8 ]  [ N h5 + ]  [ K f7 ]  [ R f4 + ]  [ K e7 ]  [ R f6 ] , [ N c4 ]  Here i noticed that ill lose the pawn on [ h7 ] anyway so i though ill try and get something back also
 [ d x c6 ]  [ e ]  [ p ]  [ d x c6 ] , [ Q e2 ]  With the idea of pinning his Be7. Now Ted is faced with pressure since his K side is not completely developed yet which means that he also has not castled.
 [ c x b6 ]  [ B x f7 ]  [ R h f8 ] , [ B h5 ]  ! Excellent forcing immediate exchanges. Being up a pawn every piece traded off brings White closer to an easy endgame.
 [ N d2 + ]  [ K g2 ]  [ Q e2 + ]  [ K h3 ]  [ Q h5 + ] , [ K g2 ]  And a draw is agreed to. Overall I was very happy with my play until I let [ f4 ] drop but even afterwards I was able to keep pressure on and exploit the undeveloped bishop of White until I could take advantage of a misstep. A fun game to play :)
 [ N f6 ] , [ Q e2 ]  Here we see the problem: White cannot guard his KP with his QN so now his KB is blocked in.
 [ B d7 ] , [ h4 ]  As I said it seems for white to have gained one time but now B can return to his post and defend along with [ N f6 ] the [ h5 ] spot. Didn´t like what I had I was stalling somehow.
 [ K e8 ] , [ f7 + ]  Now I get the Rook.
 [ e5 ]  [ B e3 ] , [ f5 ]  (?) More than one hundred years would go by in order to show that after 7...[ N f6 ] 8.[ B g5 ] [ B e6 ] Black has nothing to worry about ex: 9.N1[ c3 ] [ a6 ] 10.[ B x f6 ] [ g x f6 ] 11.[ N a3 ] d5! etc. (Fischer-Perosian Buenos Aires 1st match-game 1971). However Anderssen with his aggressive style wanted to haste a crisis in the center: previously such methods had always worked for him. But he has never had to face an opponent of Morphy's level until now...
 [ Q c2 ] , [ a5 ]  wanting to protect the knight with a pawn and free up my queen.
 [ B b4 + ] , [ N c3 ]  !? The most aggressive way to deal with the check. White opts to interpose with development. Safer but far less sexy was [7.[ B d2 ] [ B x d2 ] 8.N[ b x d2 ] [ d5 ] 9.ex[ d5 ] Nx[ d5 ] 10.Qb3!? Nce7] with even chances (albeit a little passive for white).
 [ B x f2 ]  [ Q x f2 ]  [ R a e8 ]  [ Q g3 ]  [ N e5 ] , [ B d1 ]  the black Pisces placed well vs the white . and Smyslov now have to work very hard to block the black attack and solve the problem of his development .
 [ B e2 ] , [ h5 ]  This is a doubled edged move. The principle of attack is met: instead of retreating I "use" the exchange to bring another open line for my pieces some kind of "keeping white busy". I foresaw [ N x h5 ] wouldn't save white after BxB...
 [ B f3 ]  [ R c1 ] , [ B x g3 ]  If white replies by 31 [ g x g3 ] Qxg3. There is then no way the mate can be prevented.
 [ N e4 ]  [ B d5 ]  [ N f2 ]  [ R a4 ]  [ B b4 ]  [ K e6 ] , [ N d3 ]  Protect the pawn and threaten [ N c5 ]  [ R a8 ] , [ K d4 ]  Now threaten [ N f4 ] ! It suddenly seems the board is too small for the bishop !
 [ c x b4 ]  [ a x b4 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ b x a3 ]  [ Q c2 ]  [ Q b6 ]  [ N d2 ]  [ d6 ]  [ R a b1 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ c x b5 ]  [ Q d1 ] , [ O-O ]  by not retreating white has a lost game. Can you see how I can pulverize white.
 [ B d5 + ]  [ K h8 ]  [ f x e5 ]  [ f x e5 ]  [ O-O ]  [ c6 ]  [ B g2 ] , [ e4 ]  Though the pawn at [ e4 ] is isolated but still it is very useful in trapping both bishops. It also creates a partition between the king and the queen side in which case my bishops are very instrumental in forming an attack.
 [ R x g8 ] , [ N c3 ]  Now i open the knight releasing the other rook as well!
 [ B d3 ] , [ O-O ]  always my habit first is my king's safety and then to activate the rook in the open file.
 [ d4 ] , [ N a4 ]  My original idea was to play the steed to [ b2 ] after 17. ...b5! 18. [ c b5 ] [ c b5 ] 19. N[ b2 ] when now it's the c-file that opens with sharp play that probably favors Black slightly. Instead my opponent played the stereotypical ...
 [ d x c3 ]  [ b x c3 ]  [ Q c7 ] , [ N x c4 ]  Probably 13. [ R b1 ] [ B e7 ] or 13. [ R e1 ] [ R d8 ] followed by 14. [ N x c4 ] is best...
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ d3 ]  [ e6 ] , [ B e2 ]  I use this opening when I want to castle early in the game.
 [ Q e4 ] , [ R h5 ]  Threatening Rg5+.
 [ R h2 ] , [ K f7 ]  I have my eye on the g and h files - this move prepares my major pieces to claim them!
 [ B g5 ] , [ R d6 ]  My knight is hungry for that e Pawn. But not while it is pinned to my rook. I expected white to defend that e Pawn now with one of his rooks ([ f1 ] would be best leaving the [ a1 ] rook to deploy to the open D file of the half-open B file).
 [ B x a6 ]  [ b x a4 ]  [ B b5 ] , [ a3 ]  White resigns with less than 3 minutes on the clock for both of us. This was truly a long and exciting game. With this win Kamiak won the WESCO league by a single point* and for the first time ever. I hope you enjoyed viewing this as much as I enjoyed sharing it. *It was actually 1.5 points since Stanwood had to make up a match against Monroe for which we expected them to win 5-0 (no offence to Monroe) but instead they went 4.5-0.5.
 [ R e1 ] , [ N f6 ]  ???
 [ N c6 ] , [ R g1 ]  [This preparatory move is necessary] [as 12.g4? runs into 12...[ N x d4 ] 13.[ B x d4 ] e5! and suddenly White loses material.]
 [ e4 ] , [ c5 ]  Sicilian defense is the most common opening VS. 1.[ e4 ] these days.
 [ e4 ]  [ N d6 ]  [ N d7 + ]  [ K e7 ] , [ N c5 ]  Now the position is equal except for the pawn less I have. "Ánimo!" Let's go on...
 [ Q g4 + ]  [ K e7 ] , [ Q e4 + ]  I'm trying to use a couple of checks in a row you know perhaps there will be a chance.
 [ K e8 ] , [ Q g8 + ]  25. [ Q [ g8 ] + ] - now she flies to [ g8 ] and the BK feels the white heat. Pity that rook on [ a8 ] is defended by the Wicked Witch of the West.
 [ h6 ]  [ N g f3 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ B e2 ] , [ Q d7 ]  White looks like he's planning to go kingside so Black prepares to castle queenside and aims a battery toward the WK along the c8-[ h3 ] diagonal.
 [ Q f6 + ]  [ K a5 ] , [ Q e5 ]  This move stops the pawn advancement because the b pawn is pinned.
 [ R c2 ] , [ b4 ]  Black chases my Q-side Pawns.
 [ B x g4 ] , [ h x g4 ]  Black swaps off another set of minors.
 [ B x e7 ] , [ B x e7 ]  Here Black resigns the game is hopeless. Despite flawed play the game is instructive for how quickly Black got into trouble by playing more passively.
 [ N c3 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ g3 ]  The usual White setup. The White bishop fianchetto is a strong weapon.
 [ B h5 ] , [ g4 ]  this move is depatable as it drive the the bishop away making it a negative bishop in [ g6 ] but also it weaken the king side greatly with the right sac I lost many game because of this move
 [ f6 ] , [ Q x f6 ]  And it’s game over black.
 [ B b7 ] , [ h3 ]  This is a typical bad move. What's the point of a move like h3? [ g4 ] is impossible because I can win a pawn with taking c4.
 [ Q e2 ]  [ Q x e2 + ]  [ B x e2 ] , [ N f6 ]  Continuing with his development which I anticipated.
 [ e6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ b6 ]  I don't think this is the best it allows me full control of the center
 [ R d f2 ] , [ a6 ]  I know I'll get a passed pawn now.
 [ b4 ] , [ f6 ]  black has a slight advantage at this point
 [ Q e7 ]  [ b3 ]  [ B c7 ]  [ B b2 ] , [ Q d6 ]  AHHHH!!! Not my king. I'll get him into the battle when I want too - not you :)
 [ g x f4 ] , [ R a b1 ]  Taking the open file before he does.
 [ N x e6 ]  [ f x e6 ] , [ R d8 + ]  After that I decide to place him in check and this is serious. Why? He was threatening to promote one of his pawns but I did not want to allow that. This should prevent a promotion but it's not as I am going to make a very serious blunder that will end this game in a little while.
 [ d4 ] , [ d5 ]  The queen's pawn used to be my favourite opening for both black and white but for some reason I tend to lose more (at least here on gameknot) when I play the Queen's pawn as black. My mentality when playing this was that I was probably going to lose this as my favourite opening as black is the sicilian. Back then at the beginning of the game I was rated 1575.
 [ N h4 ]  [ g5 ]  [ h6 ] , [ B h8 ]  this attack can never work...
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ a3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ d6 ]  A rather tame opening variation by my opponent not putting pressure on me at once as White can do with certain choices of opening.
 [ Q d8 ]  [ Q x d6 + ]  [ K e8 ]  [ N c7 + ]  [ K f7 ]  [ Q x e6 + ]  [ K f8 ]  [ B c5 + ]  [ Q e7 ] , [ B x e7 # ]  
 [ a3 ] , [ c4 ]  The white bishop is out of game. Theoretically I have a piece more.
 [ e3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ c3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N b d2 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N e5 ] , [ N b d7 ]  6. ......... [ N b d7 ] - challenges the [ e5 ] knight.
 [ N c6 ] , [ d5 ]  Fritz recommends 8. [ B f4 ] (0.59) [ B f4 ] would have placed my bishop in a nice central location with protection from the knight on e2. I liked the idea however of advancing a triple-protected pawn to d5.
 [ b4 ]  [ c x b4 ]  [ a x b4 ] , [ N a c6 ]  creating a weakness at a5...
 [ B c2 + ] , [ K f4 ]  and now my king is in a position to take the g pawn
 [ B d3 ] , [ N x d4 ]  ?! Not very wise really it just improves my opponents position.
 [ b5 ]  [ B b3 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ Q g7 ]  [ R g8 ]  [ Q h6 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ N g5 ] , [ O-O-O ]  The wrong move in this case.
 [ K e1 ]  [ c5 ]  [ d3 ]  [ N x c2 + ]  [ K d2 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ K c3 ]  [ K f7 ]  [ f4 ]  [ K g6 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ c x d4 + ]  [ K c2 ]  [ R x b2 + ]  [ K x b2 ]  [ K f5 ]  [ g3 ]  [ h5 ]  [ K c2 ]  [ h4 ]  [ g x h4 ] , [ K x f4 ]  
 [ B e3 ]  [ N e4 ] , [ B d2 ]  10. [ B d2 ] - white decided to break the pin. This now triggers off a couple of trades.
 [ N f6 ]  [ e4 ]  [ Q d8 ]  [ R a b1 ] , [ N h5 ]  White wins a pawn
 [ d5 ]  [ e3 ]  [ e5 ] , [ h3 ]  Waste of time but... how to exploit it?
 [ B e7 ] , [ B x f6 ]  8. ... [ B e7 ] broke the pin and so Black gives up the bishop for the knight. A favourable exchange for Black in this position as the Black knight was excerting pressure on the [ e4 ] square. Furthermore Black's bishop on [ f6 ] is looking into its own pawn chain
 [ e5 ] , [ d5 ]  white has setup a mazony bind on [ e6 ] and [ c6 ]  [ R h7 ] , [ c4 ]  supporting [ d5 ] and freeing the knight for other duties. Even though white has a strong bind on [ e6 ] it is still very difficult for him to exploit that. So more sacs need to be made.
 [ B f4 ] , [ R d8 ]  Seizing the freshly opened Q file.
 [ N x e4 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ N e5 ] , [ f5 ]  The only move to avoid the loss of the e-pawn.
 [ R x f6 ]  [ R x f6 ] , [ K x f6 ]  With my kingside majority I was confident of forcing a victory although I nearly messed it up!!
 [ e3 ]  [ B d7 ] , [ N e5 ]  A Good Post For The Knight.
 [ R e7 ] , [ Q c8 ]  Only move. 16...[ Q d8 ] loses after 17.[ R x g7 ] when I lose my bishop. Now I was expecting 17.[ B f4 ] when it's difficult to protect the pinned d pawn. If possible I'd like to play Nc7.
 [ g5 ]  [ K c3 ]  [ K d6 ]  [ b3 ]  [ K c5 ]  [ a4 ]  [ b x a4 ]  [ b x a4 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ K b3 ]  [ N d3 ]  [ K a3 ]  [ N f2 ]  [ a5 ]  [ K b5 ]  [ K b3 ] , [ K x a5 ]  My king is too far from the pawns and his two knight should be able to secure the victory.
 [ e x d5 ] , [ c x d5 ]  And to prevent my knight getting booted...
 [ N f6 ] , [ d3 ]  sometimes i like to play [ d3 ] here but being one of my first games back i was also rusty. i find that playing n[ c3 ] more effective when black replies with n[ f6 ] on move 2. holding the d pawn back also if your oponent makes a mistake in his opening can allow for a [ d4 ] instead and an instant opening of the board and aggressive frontal assault
 [ R x e1 + ] , [ R x e1 ]  Black exchanges not a sound strategy when down by a piece and a pawn.
 [ N c6 ]  [ Q f3 ] , [ f6 ]  15. ..... [ f6 ] - this move is good here. Ken supports his powerful pawn centre. However he plays [ g5 ] next move and it is this that entices Glenda up the board to attack as a lone wolf. This attack will prove premature as black has locked up the position so it will be very difficult for Glenda to get assistance and she could also end up being cut off from Henry just when he needs her most.
 [ N c6 ] , [ d4 ]  looking for trouble
 [ Q x d4 ]  [ a3 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ B x c6 + ]  [ b x c6 ]  [ Q f3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ d3 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ Q g3 ]  [ R f e8 ]  [ R x e8 + ]  [ R x e8 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ R x e3 ]  [ f x e3 ]  [ Q x e3 + ]  [ Q x e3 ]  [ B x e3 + ]  [ K f1 ]  [ h5 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ B d2 ]  [ R e7 ] , [ N d5 ]  ({14:+0.08} 24. ... [ N d5 ] 25. [ N x d5 ] [ c x d5 ] 26. [ R x a7 ] [ d4 ] 27. [ [ a4 ] ] [ B d1 ] 28. [ R c7 ] [ B f4 ] 29. [ R c8 + ] [ K h7 ] 30. [ K g1 ] [ B g4 ] 31. [ R e8 ] [ K g6 ] =) ({14:-1.04} 24. ... [ B c1 ] 25. [ R b7 ] [ B e6 ] 26. [ h3 ] [ N d5 ] 27. [ N x d5 ] [ B x d5 ] 28. [ R x a7 ] [ B x b2 ] 29. [ c4 ] [ B e6 ] 30. [ [ a4 ] ] B[ d4 ] 31. [ R b7 ] -/+)
 [ R d8 ]  [ R h e1 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B c4 ]  [ b5 ] , [ B b3 ]  Idea is to exchange my bishop for his knight to free the doubled pawn structure..
 [ f4 ]  [ N e7 ] , [ K f2 ]  In this position the best for Black was 26... Rg8. White would have problems coordinating his pieces and taking care of [ g2 ] pawn and protecting square g3.
 [ K h8 ]  [ B d2 ]  [ Q b5 ] , [ N b4 ]  29. [ N b4 ] - prevents a nasty queen check on d3.
 [ N c3 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ B b5 ]  This looks like a crossover from the Scotch Four Knights Game and the Ruy Lopez.
 [ R b8 ]  [ B f3 ]  [ N b d5 ]  [ Q d1 ]  [ B b4 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ] , [ B d2 ]  With the Black bishop temporarily blocking the Rook's open b-file this seemed to be the best way to free White's Queen-side pieces and to get my pieces positioned to protect and then advance the queen-side majority pawns. This idea seems to back-fire later.
 [ e6 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ d6 ] , [ O-O ]  8. Should have played a3! as this wins the knight on b4.
 [ N h7 ]  [ Q g3 ]  [ B x e5 ] , [ d x e5 ]  The anti natural key move of this opening.
 [ N x g6 ]  [ h x g6 ] , [ Q x f7 ]  I completely missed this move. Black still wins. I played 14...[ N d3 + ] knowing that if I couldn't find a win after 15...[ N x f2 ] I could resort to 15...Nxc1.
 [ B d3 + ]  [ g6 ] , [ R d f1 ]  I prepare to attack hard.
 [ B g7 ]  [ B b4 ]  [ B e5 ]  [ B c3 ]  [ K x a3 ]  [ B x d4 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ B e5 ]  [ K c2 ]  [ K b4 ]  [ d4 ]  [ K c4 ]  [ d3 ]  [ B c3 ]  [ B f2 ] , [ g4 ]  Here White abandons hope and just plays on for fun
 [ c4 ]  [ Q e6 ]  [ N g5 ]  [ Q f5 ]  [ h4 ] , [ Q f4 ]  Now I line up the queen and rook...
 [ Q e7 ] , [ Q f5 ]  Protecting the pawn which will be a massive headache.
 [ B x e6 ] , [ f x e6 ]  here i hesitated to offer queen exchanges and head into 2 rooks 1 knight ith 2 passed pawns vs 2 rooks 2 knights. but i felt like connecting 2 pawns in the middle was safer with queen behind them.
 [ N g3 e4 ]  [ Q f5 ]  [ g4 ]  [ d5 ] , [ Q c6 ]  And where is black's queen going? White's knights dominate the position.
 [ R f e8 ]  [ R h3 ]  [ h6 ]  [ a4 ] , [ R e4 e1 ]  37. .... [ R e1 ] - the attack continues. Now [ R b1 + ] is threatened. I think King Klaus is just beginning to shiver a bit. Klaus prevents this check by c3.
 [ B e6 ]  [ h3 ]  [ O-O-O ]  [ B g4 ]  [ B x g4 ]  [ h x g4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ f3 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ N e3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ R d e8 ]  [ a3 ]  [ c6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ R h f8 ]  [ R a d1 ]  [ K c7 ]  [ g3 ]  [ N b6 ]  [ K g2 ]  [ R e d8 ]  [ f4 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ K h3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ K h4 ]  [ R f h8 ]  [ g5 ]  [ N h5 ]  [ R d3 ]  [ R h f8 ]  [ R d f3 ]  [ e x f4 ]  [ g x f4 ]  [ N g7 ]  [ K g4 ]  [ N e6 ]  [ N e2 ]  [ h5 + ]  [ K g3 ]  [ c5 ]  [ b4 ]  [ K c6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ R d e8 ] , [ f5 ]  The fatal mistake. I outright missed the 37. ... [ N x g5 ] move in my eagerness to press the pawn attack.
 [ B d6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ f4 ]  [ O-O-O ]  [ b4 ]  [ g5 ]  [ a4 ]  [ g x f4 ]  [ e x f4 ]  [ Q d7 ] , [ b5 ]  This just loses a pawn.
 [ B x h6 ]  [ g x h6 ]  [ R x d7 ]  [ K g7 ] , [ N e4 ]  20. [ N e4 ] - a useful outpost for my knight now that the f pawn is pinned.
 [ N e5 ]  [ B h7 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ B x d3 ]  [ Q x d3 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ f4 ]  [ B e7 ] , [ B d2 ]  A pawn sacrifice for the sake of development. I could probably have tried 12.[ h5 ] but there 12...[ Q b6 ] is an annoying move preventing the development of the Bc1. White could try 13.[ N c4 ] and after 13...[ Q c7 ] 14.Bd2. 12...[ N g f6 ] should also be perfectly playable.
 [ a4 ]  [ b x a4 ]  [ Q c3 ] , [ R f5 ]  32. .... [ R f5 ] - I can see nothing better.
 [ f x e6 ] , [ Q x e6 + ]  material is now equal
 [ g4 ]  [ R e8 ] , [ d5 ]  Another low point I was sure that he'd win at this point with a safe advanced pawn. Castle queen side advance the C and F pawn to destroy my interior and I would be screwed.
 [ d x c3 ]  [ B c4 ] , [ Q f6 ]  I don't mind that.
 [ R x c7 ] , [ N f5 ]  Now Black's King is trapped on the last rank and I just need to push pawns until Black is forced to trade his knight for a forward pawn
 [ R x a8 ]  [ K x g7 ]  [ K f2 ]  [ K g6 ]  [ R a5 ]  [ N e4 + ]  [ K e3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ K f4 ]  [ N e8 ]  [ R a6 + ]  [ K f7 ]  [ K f5 ]  [ N g7 + ]  [ K e5 ]  [ K g8 ]  [ g5 ]  [ N h5 ]  [ R h6 ]  [ N g7 ]  [ g6 ]  [ N e8 ]  [ R h7 ]  [ N g7 ]  [ K f6 ]  [ N e8 + ]  [ K e7 ]  [ N g7 ]  [ K d7 ]  [ N f5 ] , [ K e6 ]  What's Knight! I'm tired and just walking around.
 [ N b6 ]  [ B b3 ]  [ N b d5 ] , [ N x d5 ]  12.N!?White gives black an isolated Q pawn as well and fixes the central P structure. 12.[ R e1 ] & 12.[ B g5 ] are in the GK database
 [ e5 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ N d x e5 ]  [ B e2 ] , [ a5 ]  Gives black a slight advantage.
 [ R e2 ]  [ f x g3 + ]  [ K f1 ]  [ N x f3 ]  [ R x d2 + ]  [ N x d2 + ]  [ K g2 ] , [ h4 ]  From this point on his king is condemned to guard the prison in the corner of his f-file g-file and h-file. He cannot venture anywhere unless he either sacrifices his knight for the advanced pawns or otherwise stops the pawns in their tracks. In the meantime the black king is a foot soldier that cannot be stopped. The black knight is ideally placed to fence in the white monarch until the black king can advance to support the pawns.
 [ a4 ] , [ B x f2 + ]  Not falling for ...Rxf2?? [ R x d4 ]  [ K f1 ]  [ R d e8 ] , [ B d3 ]  !
 [ K f2 ]  [ K c7 ]  [ h6 ] , [ g6 ]  Well well! Finally there is a shield with some problems! The squares from [ e5 ] to [ h8 ] are been weakened and White with still equipped with the DSB. One can argue that black DSB is also available but from where it can enter the flawed diagonal?
 [ N e2 ] , [ Q e3 + ]  Fruitless attack
 [ Q d3 ] , [ g6 ]  What do you think about this move? Blunder or intresting Good or Bad Duibious or brillaint?
 [ R x e8 + ]  [ R x e8 ]  [ N b5 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ N x c7 ]  [ R e2 ]  [ c5 ]  [ R x c2 ]  [ b4 ]  [ R x a2 ]  [ b5 ] , [ R c2 ]  Now White has no alternative but to give his last three Q-side pawns for the Black Bishop and b-pawn leaving an elementary win for Black.
 [ d5 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ d x c4 ] , [ a3 ]  This move was particularly murky to me. I'm sick of black playing [ B b4 ] and removing my [ N c3 ] from the board but I don't know if this is right in this position.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ N g5 ]  This begins what is called the "fried liver attack!" defendable if you know how but oh so tactical!!!
 [ R d e8 ]  [ R b1 ]  [ R e b8 ]  [ R b b2 ] , [ d6 ]  (10:18:15 PM) babar: ok 24 ...[ d6 ] (10:18:17 PM) babar: i liked fo rme (10:18:19 PM) babar: restricts ur N (10:18:36 PM) babar: my bad N became good and urs bad
 [ B e3 ] , [ a6 ]  I saw that [ h2 ] was protecting [ g3 ] but was focused on the lsB and forgot.
 [ R c2 ]  [ R b1 ] , [ B h6 ]  No to the bishop trade. Yes to the rook trade. 26.e4? [ R x c1 + ] 27.[ R x c1 ] Bxc1.
 [ b5 ]  [ B b3 ]  [ O-O ] , [ c3 ]  This move is white's last move to avoid the Marshall by playing 8. h3. [ [ h3 ] ] seems like it wastes a tempo and provides a target for black to aim at but it also prevents black's knight from coming into [ g4 ] which i one of black's ideas after playing d5. [ [ h3 ] ] then is quite double edged. another possible move that has been tried recently is a4. I have little experience with these types of lines but it also gives both sides chances and high level players often try it. [ c3 ] though is the most common move with the obvious idea of playing [ d4 ] at the right moment and the less obvious idea of giving the bishop the [ c2 ] square should black play [ N a5 ] trying to trade for the knight. Mostly commonly black will respond with [ d6 ] and there will be a long closed game with both sides having trumps and ideas but needing to be very careful with the other sides pieces. There is a lot of theory in this position if you are interested.
 [ N b d2 ] , [ h6 ]  The normal attack was [ N g4 ] hitting h2... but after [ [ h3 ] ] it goes nowhere. Instead if I would have castled queenside after [ [ h3 ] ] I can confidently play the sac h5! and if hxN hxg would have recovered the piece and played a risky but strong attack. Now I realize that the only way to disrupt white's fortress is to throw in some pawns... uncovering my king. But no way: I cannot play without looking for an attack. And this move covers [ g5 ] which is good anyway.
 [ N a5 ]  [ B a2 ] , [ c6 ]  Harandi tries to pressure the center along the long diagonal.
 [ f x e4 ] , [ N f4 ]  Forcing Gruenfeld's reply.
 [ R h8 + ]  [ K f7 ] , [ R h7 + ]  hoping for 24...[ K g8 ] or [ K f8 ] with quick win for white.
 [ d3 ]  [ B x f5 ] , [ B x f5 ]  White can now push h4-h5-[ h6 ] but never gets the time. Clearly he's gone wrong somewhere. !
 [ B x b3 ] , [ N c6 ]  21. Nc6! - A knight fork attacking the rook on [ b8 ] and the Witch.
 [ B g7 ]  [ O-O ] , [ O-O ]  I wanted to begin to undermine whites centre but I figured I may as well tuck my king away before I begin those operations.
 [ R x c7 ]  [ R x c7 ] , [ K f3 ]  After he moves his king I force another great exchange. That is because I capture more pieces then him because I capture with two of my pieces but he only captures with only one piece. This exchange occurs when R[ h x h7 ] [ R x h7 ] and [ K x h7 ] are played.
 [ Q h5 + ] , [ K e7 ]  However he made the right choice by not kicking my Queen.
 [ O-O ]  [ N d7 ] , [ B b2 ]  Surprisingly I can't find this natural move in any of the (limited) opening databases I use.
 [ N b3 ]  [ a4 ]  [ N a5 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ R c1 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N x c6 ] , [ Q x c6 ]  20. ...... [ Q x c6 ] - knight trade - at least I have got rid of that troublesome queen knight.
 [ B g7 ]  [ Q f4 ] , [ O-O-O ]  13. ............ 0-0-0 - you would think the pawn on [ c7 ] would not be taken here wouldn't you? Think again .......
 [ e5 ] , [ Q f3 ]  The problem here is that Duncan decides to bring his Queen out now. The first thing that should be done is develop the minor pieces with the Queen coming out last.
 [ a x b5 ]  [ B x b5 ] , [ N e4 ]  (!) ouch! This move guarantees Black a piece advantage
 [ B x d3 ] , [ Q x d3 ]  [ R x g7 ] loses a piece after [ B x c2 ]  [ K x f2 ]  [ Q x h2 + ] , [ K f3 ]  [ K f1 ] still allows [ R f8 ] and White's king is just as dead
 [ K x d7 ]  [ R d1 + ]  [ K e7 ] , [ N e5 ]  now the "épreuve de force" starts: white still has the attack but black can try to reduce it.
 [ R d2 ] , [ R x h5 ]  No distractions needed
 [ K f6 ] , [ R e8 ]  [ R e6 ] is better since it forces black's king to retreat or advance to [ g5 ] where things get confined and scary. Note that black's pawns form a barrier that white's king has trouble passing.
 [ Q d2 ]  [ R b8 ]  [ R x e7 ]  [ R x e7 ]  [ B x d6 ]  [ R e4 ]  [ N e3 ] , [ f6 ]  Not thrilled with this move but I don't want him to get a knight into the attack on [ g5 ] and make my rook retreat too. (It's not as if my rook has all that many squares to sit on.)
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ a6 ]  Again chikochiko played his pet line the O'Kelly Variation of the Sicilian Defence. I started to dread this game because as you guys know I almost lost the first game against chikochiko with this variation.
 [ N x f6 ]  [ Q e6 + ]  [ K h8 ] , [ B x f6 ]  my king is vulnerable but I had to take the N as my Rook was in peril and the n was too dangerous...
 [ N f5 ]  [ N x f5 ] , [ g x f5 ]  By trading knights im trying to follow basic rule that doubled pawns are not so good.
 [ Q d3 ] , [ a6 ]  I was preparing to trap the bishop...
 [ B c8 ] , [ Q b2 ]  33. [ Q b2 ] - maybe Glenda can try her luck on the queenside though.
 [ K g2 ] , [ c5 ]  This sacrificial move was too tempting for me to resist. I now have some threat with the exposed check from [ e3 + ]  [ d x c5 ] , [ e3 + ]  White is in big trouble now the most direct threat being [ Q x f2 ]  [ f3 ] , [ N b d7 ]  Looking to bring some more forces into the attack
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ c4 ]  [ c6 ]  [ a4 ]  [ d x c4 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ e4 ]  [ N x c3 ]  [ b x c3 ]  [ b5 ]  [ a x b5 ]  [ c x b5 ]  [ B a3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ B x f8 ]  [ K x f8 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ Q c2 ] , [ f6 ]  Alternative variation: [missed] 12... [ Q h4 ] 13. [ Q b2 ] [ Q x e4 + ] 14. [ K d1 ] [ a6 ]  [ K e7 ]  [ c4 ]  [ R h c8 ]  [ R d c1 ]  [ R c5 ]  [ B b3 ]  [ a5 ]  [ h4 ] , [ B c8 ]  Alternative variation: 22... [ a4 ] 23. Bx[ a4 ] [ R x c4 ] [and wins]
 [ R f8 ]  [ R x f8 ]  [ K x f8 ] , [ R f6 + ]  He is not letting me even exchange [ h x g4 ] in peace!
 [ B c5 ]  [ B g2 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N g e2 ]  [ d6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N c6 ]  [ d3 ] , [ B e6 ]  Looking for ... [ d5 ] which white prevents with
 [ K e6 ] , [ R e5 + ]  Trading rooks is bad because after all the pieces are gone Black's king will be closer to the centre in the pure pawn endgame.
 [ B x e3 ]  [ d x e3 + ] , [ K x e3 ]  Yes he is coming! You see that my queen and knight are very close to white's king and usually a queen can work very harmoniously with a knight against an enemy king. {The attack is an instructive example of the way queen and knight work together. Al}
 [ B x f6 ]  [ g x f6 ] , [ B c4 ]  Putting pressure on f7. Note the difference in development.
 [ e4 ] , [ c5 ]  Black open with the Sicilian Defense.
 [ c5 ] , [ R c1 ]  Pouncing on the c-pawn
 [ N c3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B c4 ] , [ N x e4 ]  I sac a knight to win back a bishop.
 [ c3 ]  [ B a5 ] , [ b4 ]  No such luck...
 [ N f e4 ] , [ B b4 ]  ...little pin...looking to bring in the queen to the game and the white bishop....lets strangle the position a bit...?
 [ d5 ]  [ c4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ g3 ]  [ B b4 + ]  [ B d2 ]  [ B x d2 + ]  [ N b x d2 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B g2 ]  [ c6 ]  [ Q c2 ]  [ N b d7 ]  [ O-O ]  [ b6 ]  [ e4 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N x f6 + ]  [ Q x f6 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ R b8 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ R b7 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ Q x e5 ]  [ B x b7 ]  [ B x b7 ]  [ f3 ]  [ Q e3 + ]  [ Q f2 ]  [ Q g5 ]  [ R a d1 ]  [ Q f6 ]  [ R d7 ]  [ R b8 ]  [ R f d1 ]  [ h6 ]  [ R d1 d3 ]  [ a5 ]  [ Q e2 ]  [ B a6 ] , [ b3 ]  White has a slight advance but a weak king and all his pieces are on white squares vulnerable to a LSB attack. White controls the open file but the black pieces on the queen side are dangerous.
 [ Q c6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ N b6 ]  [ b3 ]  [ N a6 ] , [ B g5 ]  ? Rybka says 15. [ N d4 ] [ Q d7 ] 16. [ B b2 ] with full compensation for the pawn. The text move attempts to prevent Black from castling queenside but the trouble is that the bishop can be chased away.
 [ Q x f7 + ] , [ K x f7 ]  White: Stealth-Invader Black: Slackline
 [ B e7 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N b d7 ]  [ f4 ]  [ b6 ] , [ B d2 ]  12. [ B d2 ] - natural but one must be careful two bishops lined up on one file could lead to skewer combos later on.
 [ O-O ] , [ d5 ]  I opted to choose a more aggressive line. He could've played [ c4 ] to emphasise the h1-[ a8 ] diagonal.
 [ B x g7 ] , [ K x g7 ]  My draw offer is accepted.
 [ B b2 ]  [ R b7 ]  [ B c3 ] , [ g7 ]  ! The way to win
 [ R e8 + ]  [ K g7 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ d3 ] , [ d8 = Q ]  The pawn promotes in plenty of time to stop Black's d pawn.
 [ b6 ]  [ B b2 ] , [ Q d7 ]  Black waits for castling and opens the door for long castling as White becomes puzzled which way he should move his attack.
 [ e5 ]  [ R g6 ] , [ R d6 ]  Threatening the exchange of Rs.
 [ Q e7 ] , [ R x e7 + ]  ...and the game unfortunately ends by timeout.
 [ a5 ] , [ h5 ]  H pawn continues to attack.
 [ B x f3 ] , [ N f4 ]  The computer didn't like this and prefers 21. Bh3. A possible line is 21 ... [ B h3 ] 22. [ B x h5 ] [ Q g5 + ] 23. [ B g4 ] [ B x g4 ] 24. [ Q d2 ] [ R f4 ] 25. [ f3 ] [ B x f3 + ] 26. [ B g3 ] Qg4.
 [ d x c5 ] , [ N a5 ]  Now the answer I thought was Qa3. But after [ Q e7 ] or [ f7 ] I was doomed. So I saw a tiny possibility abut BxN NxQ+ BxN.
 [ K c3 ] , [ Q g6 ]  Hmmm I was hoping he captured [ h2 ] then I would have checked him [ B c5 ] then hopefully [ K e6 ] [ Q e8 # ] or [ f6 ] [ Q x g7 ] then see what happens.
 [ N c3 ] , [ N c e7 ]  8.[ N b4 ] is considered stronger these days when White can consider a rook sac by 9.a3.
 [ O-O-O ]  [ b5 ]  [ f3 ] , [ N b d7 ]  Trying to catch up in development.
 [ g3 ]  [ g4 ]  [ N d6 ]  [ R c7 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ N a5 ] , [ N e8 + ]  ?! Not sure about this move.
 [ Q c2 ] , [ b5 ]  ? Total waste of time and gives white good play on the Q-side. The other moves I considered were ...[ N g5 ] putting pressure on [ [ e4 ] ] and ...[ B f6 ] continuing with my original plan to swap DSB's. I discounted 19...[ N g5 ] since after 20.[ B d1 ] taking on [ [ e4 ] ] loses material for black and now my N is in the way of exchanging bishops and after 19...[ B f6 ] 20.[ b5 ] [ N d7 ] 21.[ h4 ] I wasn't sure I liked 21...g5. Later on I found 19...Qf8!? with the idea to play either ...[ B h6 ] or ...[ f5 ] for example 20.[ b4 ] [ N d7 ] 21.[ Q d2 ] f5!? which should give black good play.
 [ B b3 ] , [ N f6 ]  Following the earlier precedent this might be called the New Angels' Berlin Defense being a position where the Berlin (3...Nf6) has been preceded by Morphy's old move (P-QR3) thus making it "New" and then the Angel's P-QN4. Or would that be the New New Angels' Berlin ... never mind. I guess its nameless? And now we know Why ...
 [ O-O ] , [ N c3 ]  White's bishop still beckons.
 [ R e6 + ] , [ K d7 ]  The king moves into a nice setup for a discovered attack.
 [ e x d5 ]  [ Q c2 ]  [ b5 ] , [ a4 ]  This is a horrible version of a minority attack!
 [ O-O ]  [ O-O ] , [ a6 ]  blocks the knight Alternative variation: 10... [ e5 ]  [ c x b5 ]  [ a x b5 ]  [ B x b5 ]  [ B x b5 ]  [ N x b5 ]  [ Q x b2 ]  [ a4 ] , [ N a6 ]  Alternative variation: 15... [ e5 ] [was still playable]
 [ K x g8 ]  [ B x h4 ]  [ R e6 ]  [ K f1 ]  [ a4 ]  [ R f2 ]  [ R e3 ]  [ R a2 ]  [ R x h3 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ R x d3 ]  [ c5 ]  [ B c7 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ B x d6 ] , [ c x d6 ]  white has got a strong pawn on d6.
 [ N c4 ]  [ R a8 ]  [ K b7 ]  [ R d8 ]  [ N x a3 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ N c2 ]  [ N c5 + ]  [ K b6 ]  [ N d3 ]  [ a5 ]  [ b x a5 + ]  [ K x a5 ]  [ h4 ]  [ b4 ]  [ h5 ]  [ b3 ]  [ h6 ]  [ N b4 ]  [ h7 ]  [ B x d3 ]  [ h8 = Q ]  [ K a4 ]  [ R a8 + ]  [ B a6 ]  [ Q a1 + ]  [ K b5 ]  [ R b8 + ]  [ K c4 ] , [ R x b4 + ]  Rook Sacrifice so I can nail both of his minor pieces.
 [ a6 ] , [ N c3 ]  6. I get on with my development with 6. [ N c3 ] - this move backs up the e pawn.
 [ N c d3 ]  [ B d2 ]  [ b3 ]  [ R a3 ] , [ N x b2 ]  I forgot that White could play [ [ g3 ] ] in this position instead of taking the pawn. [ [ g3 ] ] would probably give White better chances to draw or maybe even win but I stopped considering it after White took the pawn.
 [ R x d4 ] , [ N e2 + ]  And if I take the bishop forks happen.
 [ R x c2 + ]  [ K x c2 ]  [ R c8 + ] , [ K d2 ]  22. [ K [ d2 ] ] - one pair of rooks is traded off and Henry just shuffles back to [ d2 ] to allow my remaining rook to come to c1.
 [ R g8 ] , [ R a d1 ]  now threatening all sorts of mayhem with discovered checks the N going to either [ f5 ] [ f7 ] [ c4 ] or [ b7 ] depending on how Black reacts
 [ N x e7 + ]  [ K h8 ]  [ N x c8 ]  [ R f x c8 ]  [ Q x d7 ] , [ B x c3 ]  I wouldn't have played this since it liquidates but it's almost curtains time wise.
 [ f x e5 ]  [ d x e5 ] , [ N x e5 ]  White comes away a pawn to the good and he's threatening a very disruptive check on f7.
 [ K f3 ]  [ K g8 ]  [ R c7 ]  [ N h7 ] , [ R x c5 ]  one more pawn ...
 [ h4 ] , [ b4 ]  yep all the way to a queen and certain success; the bishop and be ignored entirely
 [ d3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ Q x f6 ]  [ N x f6 ]  [ c3 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ B x e6 ]  [ f x e6 ]  [ b4 ] , [ B b6 ]  Bishop retreat
 [ R d7 ]  [ Q f3 ]  [ R f8 ] , [ R b d1 ]  Boy this is kinda funny :)
 [ R e1 ] , [ f4 ]  I bring my a rook across to protect my pawn at [ e5 ] and black pushes [ f5 ] pawn to [ f4 ] attacking my g pawn.
 [ h7 ] , [ K g5 ]  Still chasing!
 [ N c3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ f4 ] , [ g6 ]  Transposed into the Grand Prix Attack.
 [ Q d2 ] , [ c5 ]  One pawn steps forward and all 3 pawns look unprotected to the untrained eye but each one is guarded...unfortunately [ d5 ] is not guarded enough. The wall is to be shattered and I am in trouble...or so it seems. But I shall survive recover and win! Watch on and see my triumph.
 [ K c1 ]  [ R f e8 ]  [ K b1 ]  [ R e7 ] , [ K x a1 ]  17. [ K x a1 ] - dmaestro's king is so hungry he could eat my horsie!
 [ R x e5 ]  [ R x e5 ] , [ Q d6 ]  forced or [ R d7 + ] is in the cards
 [ R g8 ]  [ e x d5 ] , [ R x g6 ]  The only reasonable move; anything else allows White to keep his Knight.
 [ K f2 ]  [ R f8 ]  [ R x f8 ] , [ N x f8 ]  "For my Queen!" exalts Sir Knight!
 [ R b8 ] , [ N d4 ]  Intending to push the bishop and follow with [ R e7 ] but ...
 [ Q h5 + ]  [ K f2 ] , [ g1 = Q + ]  Unexpected but reasonable move. The main task for white now is to escape from checks. I considered continuation 31... [ Q h4 + ] 32. [ K g1 ] where it is not a problem and taking into account that black king is in exposed position I hoped to win. As Rybka showed 31... [ g1 Q + ] is the strongest defence. Now I had to decide should the new queen be taken by king or rooch.
 [ e4 ]  [ d x c6 ]  [ e x f3 ]  [ B x f3 ] , [ d x c6 ]  Released the bishop and have a place for my rook to go as Black is probably going to castle
 [ N x e5 ] , [ d x e5 ]  Mike: After thinking about it for a few minutes I decided to take the knight. I wanted to set up an attack via putting the knight bak to d6. I know I'm opened to an attack. This is the part when I think too much I think you'll bring kb2. I was thinking putting your bishop to e5. See what happens. Edit k[ b3 ] Joe: Well it is good to think ahead. But you don't want to do too much at one time. That's true. Mike: Which is why I took the knight. I'm not developed to make one of my signature crazy moves lol. Joe: I figured that you took. The other move I thought about was the possibility of 8...Ne4. But then I'd answer with 9.[ N c6 ] and put pressure. That's the move that might have protected the pawn. But by taking black loses a pawn now because I'm going to capture on e5.
 [ e x f5 ] , [ e x f4 ]  Now my pawn on the f file is poised to support my Queen assault Black's King.
 [ N f3 ] , [ g5 ]  Defending the pawn but weakening the kingside.
 [ B c6 ]  [ g x f4 ] , [ N c4 ]  chasing the rook... or provoking exchange?
 [ B e2 ]  [ c x d4 ] , [ e x d4 ]  9. [ e x d4 ] - another pawn trade.
 [ B d7 + ]  [ K f8 ] , [ B x e7 # ]  
 [ Q f6 + ] , [ K g8 ]  White has to keep on giving check: after [ R g1 ] Re1...
 [ Q e3 ]  [ K c7 ]  [ K e2 ]  [ Q e6 ]  [ K f2 ] , [ Q g4 ]  this is a new opportunity on e4.
 [ K e3 ]  [ K d7 ]  [ K d3 ]  [ e7 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ e8 = Q ]  [ R x e8 ]  [ K x e8 ] , [ a5 ]  White is out of reach. A game won for the smallest of the advantages after a fireworked midgame. Happy New Year to all!
 [ Q x d4 ]  [ R c2 ] , [ Q e4 ]  Alternative variation: 32. [ h3 ] $5 $17
 [ c x d5 ] , [ K h8 ]  I can't really see any good plans for Black here either - reader comments would be welcome on that!
 [ Q c8 ] , [ R e5 ]  White takes the initiative threatening [ R x c5 ] winning a pawn (if QxR QxR [ Q f8 ] [ Q f8 ] and Whte will win).
 [ B x a7 ] , [ f5 ]  Aggressive pawn move to try and reclaim lost pawns but didn't protect threats around b7.
 [ O-O-O ]  [ B g3 ]  [ N h5 ] , [ N e2 ]  Ion stated here - Instead of 15.[ N e2 ] 15.[ N d5 ] came into consideration
 [ e x d4 ]  [ c x d4 ] , [ R e8 ]  A pawn exchange and here Jo has [ Q x d4 + ] or [ N x d4 ] to win a pawn. I don't know why she didn't play that - perhaps she was looking to improve her position or she was unwilling to exchange material for just a pawn. I do notice a bit later on that despite being a piece up Black has a better positional advantage than White
 [ h6 ]  [ B h5 ]  [ h x g5 ]  [ h x g5 ]  [ B x g5 ]  [ B x g5 ]  [ Q x g5 ] , [ B x f7 + ]  White get a rook and a pawn for two minor pieces.
 [ R h7 ] , [ R c2 ]  threatens [ R x g2 ] and avoids the skewer [ R h1 + ] after: [ g4 ] [ h x g4 ]  [ g4 ] , [ h x g4 ]  without the rook on [ c1 ] I can make this capture not fearing the skewer [ R h1 + ]  [ R d1 + ] , [ K x g2 ]  only move now if [ R h1 ] [ K g3 ] [ R d g1 + ] (Rhg1+) [ R g2 ] and I've achieved consolidation and can start pushing my pawns or even play [ B d4 ] first to secure my e and c pawns also
 [ Q x f3 ]  [ e6 ] , [ O-O ]  i feel very comfortable. Even my queen is not too badly placed.
 [ R b8 ] , [ R b4 ]  here if he takes I reunite 2 pawns...
 [ e x f6 ]  [ g x f6 ] , [ f5 ]  In hindsight this was inefficient. I was trying to force a passed pawn. Computer analysis shows [ N e4 ] was best. [ f5 ] lost 3 points advantage from +4.
 [ R x h5 ]  [ K c6 ]  [ B e5 ]  [ K d5 ]  [ B f6 + ] , [ K c4 ]  I accidently let him slip through the ranks... I am just now seeing how much fun the move [ R c5 ] would have been....
 [ R e8 ] , [ c3 ]  22. c3?? - [ B g3 ] I think had to be played here and I would have had to have bit the bullet and ceded up the c pawn but at least I would have been still alive!
 [ e3 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ B x e7 ] , [ Q x e7 ]  9. ....... [ Q x e7 ] - both dsbs have been traded.
 [ g x f6 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ B x e4 ] , [ B x e4 ]  So far so good. Now I'm in a position that completely fits to my style (and I guess my opponent had no idea of it) and play quite confortably and confidently. "What a nice king you have..." Sometimes experience in some lines altogether with checking some of the opponents' games allows us to "predict" some of their moves.
 [ Q f7 ] , [ B e5 ]  The black queen scared the white bishop back.
 [ R f8 ]  [ Q x e4 ]  [ R x f7 ]  [ B x f7 + ] , [ Q x f7 ]  White's position sucks but black is still behind a wopping 4 points.
 [ Q x d2 ] , [ R a d1 ]  He moved his Queen to take my pawn on [ d2 ] which means he's taking away potential queening pawns. I moved to threaten his lady.
 [ c4 ]  [ d x c3 ]  [ e ]  [ p ]  [ b x c3 ] , [ N x c3 ]  Bishop can wait. Who can deny a free lunch?
 [ c6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ d5 ]  I hate [ d5 ] because it forces me to take action in the middle squares where I at this early in the game like to be kept alone. Nope.
 [ c1 = Q + ]  [ B x c1 ] , [ N x c1 ]  Better would have been 44...[ R x c1 ] 45. [ R x c1 ] [ N x c1 ] with a simplified position.
 [ B d7 ] , [ c3 ]  This is the slow preparatory move that I previously used before 4.d4.
 [ Q e7 ]  [ R c4 + ] , [ N c5 ]  I thought he was threatening mate with 22. ... [ Q e1 + ] 23. [ R x e1 ] [ R x e1 + ] but then I realised 24. [ K d2 ] and there's not much in the form of threats there. This is why I took preventative measures.
 [ B x e8 ] , [ R x e8 ]  by exchanging the bishops black got the e file.
 [ B x c6 ] , [ b x c6 ]  ...and the reverse happened here. It's now seven pawns against five with two rooks apiece.
 [ B x d2 ]  [ Q x d2 ]  [ Q x e4 ]  [ Q x a5 ] , [ N x d5 ]  Taking two pawns for one and bringing the Knight into the action.
 [ e4 ]  [ c6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ c x d5 ] , [ B b3 ]  Winning a tempo.
 [ K g6 ]  [ h4 ]  [ Q f6 ]  [ B x f5 + ] , [ Q x f5 ]  ?? falling into my trap
 [ B c4 ] , [ B f5 ]  I knew this move would have surprised my opponent...
 [ b4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ B b2 ] , [ N c6 ]  Think d7-[ d6 ] is actually better because...
 [ N x f7 ] , [ B x f1 ]  Putting the plan into execution. Black threatens [ Q e2 ] with mate next move.
 [ d4 ] , [ d5 ]  So we start off with a common queen's pawn opening.
 [ R c6 ] , [ K f7 ]  Attacking the e-pawn gives me a move to get onto the black a-pawn. This pawn is dangerous.
 [ g5 ]  [ d4 ]  [ h6 ] , [ N c3 ]  3. [ N c3 ] - a good pawn centre and a knight developed on c3. So far so good.
 [ c5 ] , [ f4 ]  2. [ f4 ] - Sicilian Grand Prix Attack!
 [ R c7 ]  [ B x c6 ] , [ f6 ]  Can't take the Bishop because of Knight fork at d4.
 [ K e2 ] , [ Q x h1 ]  Setting up a beautiful tactic.
 [ B x g7 ] , [ R g8 ]  Black's rook on [ h8 ] was en prise it had to be saved and this move indirectly skewers the white bishop to white's king an the pawn at [ g2 ] - a fact that will quickly become relevant.
 [ O-O ] , [ b6 ]  !? - Planning to enter a flank war for white's kingside. No knight on [ f3 ] strengthens this play. [ a6 ] may have been better but note that this is not an easy move to outright defend.
 [ f5 ]  [ K f7 ]  [ K g3 ] , [ a5 ]  The kingside is locked. Time to promote a pawn (or two).
 [ R g8 ] , [ N d2 ]  Bringing in more firepower. Now different sacs are possible thanks to this little jumper.
 [ R x d1 ]  [ Q a5 ]  [ a3 ]  [ b4 ]  [ c x b4 ]  [ c x b4 ]  [ a x b4 ]  [ Q x b4 ] , [ R d2 ]  We might have called it a draw here: White's Knight and Rook are ideally placed for defense and his King is well-shielded from checks. Neither player has a realistic chance of winning anymore. Black's only chance of prevailing lies in his a-pawn which is going nowhere as long as White's b-pawn sits safe and smug on b2; White's only chance is in advancing his K-side pawns to supplement a combined R-N-K attack ...which would leave White's King open to harrassing checks and potential missteps that might lose material.
 [ K e5 ]  [ b6 ]  [ K d5 ]  [ R c5 + ]  [ K d4 ]  [ K c6 ]  [ R b3 ]  [ R d5 + ]  [ K c4 ] , [ b5 + ]  56. .......... the black pawn moves one square closer to his goal by giving check.
 [ K g1 ]  [ R x b2 ] , [ a3 ]  Seeing that my a pawn was attacked in a very last effort I play this. But I shortly realize that I definitely have no way out. And it's only a matter of time before I resign. In fact it's about to happen because I have isolated pawns that are of no use since they're not passed. But Tom on the other hand has a passed pawn. With 4 pawns up and the passer on [ e5 ] and his pawns connected with a solid pawn chain [ d6 ] and [ c7 ] he'll get more. Not only that but he's got more time then me.
 [ O-O ]  [ Q c2 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B d3 ] , [ N b4 ]  7.[ B d3 ] is a bit of a mistake conceding the tempo with a knight fork on bishop and queen.
 [ N b8 ]  [ N d5 + ]  [ K d6 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ h6 ]  [ N e8 + ]  [ K c5 ]  [ N g7 ]  [ f4 ]  [ N e6 + ]  [ K c4 ]  [ N x f4 ]  [ a5 ]  [ b3 + ]  [ K c3 ]  [ K c1 ]  [ a4 ]  [ b x a4 ]  [ b x a4 ]  [ K b1 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N d5 + ]  [ K c4 ]  [ N e3 + ]  [ K c3 ]  [ N f5 ]  [ N d4 ] , [ N x d4 ]  Was this a bit risky?
 [ R d4 ]  [ K e2 ]  [ a4 ]  [ K f3 ]  [ a3 ]  [ K e3 ]  [ a2 ]  [ K f3 ]  [ a1 = Q ]  [ K e3 ] , [ Q c3 + ]  Here the queen/rook combination frog march the white king up against the wall where the obligatory blindfold and last cigarette are offered.
 [ Q x g5 ] , [ N x b5 ]  The text move [16.[ N x b5 ] ! ] brings a knight closer to the target of the king while gaining a pawn. The hanging rook at [ a8 ] enables the pin theme (16...[ a x b5 ] ?? 17.Rx[ a8 ] ).
 [ N b d2 ] , [ Q a5 ]  Hmph! Now who's laughing!
 [ B b5 ]  [ N d4 ] , [ N x e5 ]  The fireworks begin.
 [ R d7 d8 + ]  [ K c7 ] , [ R d1 d7 # ]  Its a salutary lesson to me not to always go charging in but sometimes to let my opponent worry himself to death heck enough have done it to me you think I'd have learnt by now ;-)
 [ N e5 ]  [ B b3 ] , [ N g4 ]  As mentioned earlier the ill-positioned queen allows black to make this move à tempo and it leads to a powerful sequence winning a pawn
 [ N c3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ e3 ] , [ O-O ]  This is all pretty standard stuff
 [ Q c6 ]  [ N x c7 + ]  [ K f7 ]  [ N x a8 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ N c7 ]  [ h5 ]  [ Q e2 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ B x e5 ]  [ f x e5 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ R f8 ]  [ O-O ]  [ K e6 ]  [ a3 ]  [ B d4 ]  [ c3 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ b4 ] , [ b6 ]  That pawn doesn't really protect the bishop from capture by Pb4.
 [ K e6 ]  [ h4 ] , [ R b3 + ]  ?! Doesn't accomplish much.
 [ K f3 ]  [ K c3 ]  [ N e4 + ] , [ K d3 ]  not getting any grip on the Black posaition...
 [ B h4 ]  [ d x c4 ]  [ B x c4 ] , [ B c6 ]  That's interesting cause we more often see the knight go on c6. Now the Black attacks my [ g2 ] pawn also tries to take over [ e4 ] square (maybe with [ g5 ] and Ne4).
 [ K d7 ] , [ N x a8 ]  After that combination I'm ahead by eight points.
 [ K x g7 ] , [ R f1 ]  Mating net begins. I mildly regret the retreat of the rook on the e file to the second rank. Should have come to the third and this would go much more smoothly.
 [ R f1 ] , [ R a7 ]  18. . [ N d7 ] would have protected the bishop
 [ Q x g3 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ K f2 ]  [ B x e2 ]  [ R x e2 ] , [ R e f8 ]  He's up a pawn and I'm lost.
 [ h3 ] , [ B d7 ]  Even in endgames you see the struggle for a tempo at times. I simply mark time here.
 [ b4 ] , [ d4 ]  In this game I am clearly aiming to open lines and not giving black time to defend [ b4 ] with [ R b8 ]  [ Q x f7 + ]  [ K d8 ]  [ Q x g7 ]  [ R f8 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ d x e5 ] , [ B g5 ]  I am two pawns up and threatening to win the DSB and the knight with 14. Bf7! with [ B x f6 ] to follow
 [ N b4 ] , [ O-O-O ]  15. 0-0-0 - I answer the threat of the knight fork on [ c2 ] with developing my queen rook. Castling queenside removes Henry from the fork at the same time. The rook rakes down the d column and the BK is on the c column. If black decided to trade pawns on [ d4 ] then [ N x d4 + ] could be very nasty.
 [ R x b3 ] , [ N g4 ]  ! Black threatens the [ h2 ] pawn; Though it's an easy threat to meet suddenly Black has counter-play...
 [ b6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B b7 ] , [ d3 ]  Adding protection to [ e4 ]  [ Q c7 ] , [ B g5 ]  Looking to delay [ B d6 ] as I figured black was looking to castle kingside and wouldn't want his pawns disrupted
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ a6 ]  [ B a4 ] , [ N f6 ]  (kiaoi)Whites next move is the first crossroads in RL. I have played 5. 0-0 [ N x [ e4 ] ] 6.[ B x c6 ] (sets up my knight to take [ e5 ] later) [ b x c6 ] 7.Nx[ e5 ] followed by white playing [ R e1 ] and opening an attack on the black king. Or maybe I have the order wrong.. maybe 7.[ R e1 ] forces black to defend the N on [ e4 ] then white can play Nxe5. -- The other move for white maybe 5.[ d3 ] (defends e4) or 5.[ c3 ] sets up attack with a [ d5 ] push later. -- This position has given me heaps of thought and I've been inclined in many games to play 5.0-0. What do you think?
 [ O-O ]  [ B e7 ]  [ N d5 ] , [ N f6 ]  Still playing the popular line from the DB. White castles then seizes his advantage on d5. Black prepares to castle then challenges [ d5 ] but it's a fake challenge. Black dare not play 8. ... Nx[ d5 ] for 9. ex[ d5 ] forks two black pieces. Tragically the World DB has this line among Experts and above ending in 8 wins for white 8 draws and ZERO wins for black. If I am to believe the DB I already have no chance to win and must hope for a draw...
 [ N c6 ] , [ N f3 ]  me: [ N f3 ] develops a piece. me: Prevents e5? Not really. [ e5 ] Nxe5; Qxc3+. If Bishop takes Knight takes and Q x [ c3 + ] taking Rook.
 [ K f7 ]  [ g5 ]  [ h x g5 ]  [ h x g5 ]  [ g6 ]  [ f x g6 + ] , [ K x g6 ]  Unfortunately this is as good of a position that black will see again.
 [ R x b7 + ] , [ K c8 ]  Indirectly defends the knight on [ c6 ] but Black takes another hit to his king-side. Here 25....[ K e8 ] 26. Nx[ c6 ] Nd7? gives up some material but controls the long-diagonal and through it a1. Ultimately White would have given up a rook for bishop in order to stop the promotion.
 [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ N f5 ] , [ Q e2 ]  White pins his own knight? - Gambling that it will be easy to get out of this position.
 [ B b7 ]  [ d x c5 ] , [ N x c5 ]  17... [ B x c5 ] [ Seems like a good alternative] 18.[ B a4 ] and now 18...[ R x g2 ] ! 19.[ K x g2 ] [ N e5 ] 20.[ B x c5 ] [ Q x c5 ] looks very interesting.
 [ K e3 ]  [ R x f4 ]  [ g x f4 + ] , [ K f5 ]  I just about have time to pick up the f-pawn before racing back with the king.
 [ N x c3 ] , [ b x c3 ]  Things look rather dire for the Bishop.
 [ R e7 + ]  [ R f7 ]  [ R x f7 + ]  [ K x f7 ] , [ R x h6 ]  41. [ R x h6 ] - voila a pawn up after being under the cosh for a few moves it was nice to plumb in some conditional moves - moves 40 and 41. My patience is rewarded. Black now defends with Rc6.
 [ K f6 ]  [ N x e6 ]  [ K e7 ]  [ N f4 + ]  [ K f7 ] , [ R e6 ]  winning another pawn.
 [ N x e4 ]  [ N a6 ]  [ R b1 ]  [ Q x a2 ] , [ N b c3 ]  it is now some moves that the black queen is in danger.
 [ B g4 ]  [ B g2 ]  [ h6 ]  [ b5 ]  [ N a5 ] , [ Q a4 ]  I'm not sure about this move -- it doesn't feel good. I feel like I'm moving my queen to where it can't do any good but I've got to break the pin on both of my knights.
 [ f6 ]  [ O-O ] , [ N c6 ]  ...at last some piece into play...but white is well ahead still...
 [ Q x h4 ] , [ N d8 ]  And the rest is a matter of technique.
 [ Q b8 ] , [ B d1 ]  After a period of inactivity white's light squared bishop gets back in the game with an attack on the Rb3.
 [ B x c3 + ]  [ b x c3 ] , [ d x e4 ]  i missed this one but defence is still strong and no attack yet from the opponents pieces.
 [ B c3 ] , [ R d6 ]  White moves bishop [ c3 ] tol protect pawn at [ d4 ] and find a better square to join in the attack. Black moves [ f6 ] rook across to [ d6 ] which is a part open file with only 1 pawn at d4. This file will enable the rooks to double up.
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ b4 ]  [ c x b4 ]  [ a3 ]  [ b x a3 ] , [ N f3 ]  The Sicilian Wing Gambit. White gives up a pawn for quicker development and a stronger center.
 [ e3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ e5 ]  I like claiming the center.
 [ b5 ] , [ N d2 ]  19. [ N d2 ] - so does Sir Lollabout!
 [ N f6 ] , [ N d5 ]  A good move by White. Pressure is now starting to build up around the [ f6 ] square.
 [ R x e5 ] , [ B d4 ]  I don't know why but for whatever reason he decides to attack my Rook.
 [ B f4 ]  [ e5 ] , [ B e3 ]  I now have total control of the center of the board an attack is now imminent.
 [ g6 ]  [ N d2 ]  [ B h6 ]  [ g3 ]  [ B h3 ] , [ R f2 ]  Both players develops their remaining pieces.
 [ N g e2 ] , [ R d8 ]  This is the kind of stuff that nightmares are made of.
 [ B a6 ]  [ a x b5 ] , [ B b7 ]  huh?.... that was easy. I stopped in my tracks here and looked for away to open a diagnal on the king... and the pawn fork looked good now. I felt as if the king should go straight to [ f8 ] and I'd win a piece.
 [ B d3 ] , [ N f6 ]  White develops his LB to [ d3 ] protecting the pawns at [ c4 ] and e4. I develop my g knight to f6.
 [ K x d8 ]  [ N e6 + ]  [ K e7 ]  [ N x g7 ] , [ K d6 ]  Now I'm a much happier Panda. So much so that I want to encourage her to take [ c6 ] so I can move B-[ d5 ] and baggsie the rook.
 [ N g5 ]  [ B d5 ]  [ B f3 ]  [ R a d8 ]  [ b4 ]  [ h6 ]  [ B x d5 ]  [ R x d5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ R f d8 ]  [ R a2 ]  [ a5 ]  [ b x a5 ]  [ R x a5 ] , [ R b2 ]  in the middle of the game (moves 15-32) no appear grandmaster moves or errors for both players.
 [ N d5 ] , [ N x d5 ]  White has to strike quickly to take advantage of the weakening of the [ [ d5 ] ] square of Black's last move. If he doesn't occupy [ [ d5 ] ] now Black will close off the chance with e4. Nothing for anything else. Now - do you take back with rook or bishop?
 [ d8 = Q ]  [ Q e6 + ]  [ K h4 ]  [ Q e1 + ] , [ N g3 ]  After 50. [ d8 = Q ] [ Q e6 + ] 51 [ K h4 ] [ Q e1 + ] 52. [ N g3 ] black resigns. A battle fought long and hard this victory had not come easily.
 [ N e4 ]  [ Q b3 ]  [ Q a5 + ] , [ B d2 ]  Queen attacked
 [ e x d4 ] , [ B c4 ]  [ [ e5 ] ] here helps Black by developing his bishop to the more active [ c5 ] square though. More importantly Black cannot play [ N f6 ] because of [ [ e5 ] ] [ Q e7 ] [ Q e2 ] losing a piece. Also Black cannot play [ N e7 ] because [ N g5 ] 0-0 [ Q h5 ] loses material.
 [ B c4 ]  [ N b6 ]  [ B a2 ] , [ B e6 ]  Looking to trade a few pieces see where the dust settles.
 [ N f6 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ f3 ] , [ B h5 ]  White's [ f3 ] looks somewhat dubious.
 [ R h e8 ] , [ R c1 ]  A useful in between move.
 [ B e7 ] , [ B e3 ]  This move puts my knight on [ d4 ] in jeopardy. For when white moves [ f4 ] my knight is only defended by my queen if I capture f4. Hopefully I can maneuver a pawn to [ g5 ] before it gets too bad. (This was my thinking at the time. However I can now see that black will inevitably be down 1 point after the exchange).
 [ R e g3 ]  [ R x g3 ]  [ R x g3 ]  [ K f6 ]  [ R g7 ]  [ R c6 ] , [ K d2 ]  ...[ B x b3 ] was a threat.
 [ Q d8 ] , [ c3 ]  avoiding another surprise.
 [ Q e2 ]  [ N d3 + ]  [ K f1 ] , [ Q x f7 ]  So now black restores material equality but the poor position of white's king makes it very hard for white.
 [ e6 ]  [ e5 ]  [ d5 ]  [ Q a4 + ]  [ B d7 ]  [ Q b3 ]  [ B c6 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ B x d5 ]  [ Q b5 + ]  [ Q d7 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N x d5 ] , [ e x d5 ]  Two pawns in the center.
 [ e x d4 ] , [ N x d4 ]  Blundering a piece for no cause! It leaves no option for black but to come down with
 [ R h2 + ]  [ K b3 ]  [ Q f8 ]  [ f6 + ]  [ K g8 ] , [ c x b4 ]  if black swaps queens the pawn cannot be stopped!
 [ Q e2 ] , [ B e5 ]  and you have nothing left... step by step i just took advantage of my opponent's mistake except maybe for the first -not-deciding- pawn.
 [ N d5 ]  [ Q e6 ]  [ N b4 ]  [ Q f7 ]  [ f4 ] , [ N b8 ]  22. ….. [ N b8 ] - this sorry knight will be imprisoned on this square for many moves to come. Its job at the moment is to cover the [ c6 ] square.
 [ B c4 + ] , [ B e6 ]  bishop defends king with his life
 [ N e8 ] , [ f4 ]  ?? An awful move. White has no good possibilities on the K-side and taking the e-pawn will only give Black a monster square on [ e5 ] instead of a blocked and passive Bishop.
 [ Q x d7 ]  [ B x f1 ]  [ R x f1 ]  [ R d8 ]  [ Q f5 ]  [ Q x f5 ]  [ B x f5 ]  [ R x d4 ]  [ R c1 ]  [ R d8 ] , [ R c8 ]  resigns because he is down.
 [ N g f6 ] , [ N g3 ]  No real reason I avoided exchanging knights other than to keep the black bishop off of [ f4 ] a place it seems to like to go in the Caro-Kann.
 [ R x g1 ]  [ R x g1 + ]  [ K b2 ] , [ R f1 ]  White decides to keep fighting. I move to eliminate the isolated pawn.
 [ R f e1 ] , [ Q f6 ]  Black prefers to have weak king side pawns instead of an inactive queen against an active queen. I prefer [ Q c7 ]  [ Q x f6 ] , [ g x f6 ]  So black takes back
 [ e5 ] , [ f4 ]  I recently played in a Kings Gambit tournament and really enjoyed it this is an attempt to continue my experimentation with the various lines.
 [ Q x d3 ]  [ B g6 ]  [ e4 ]  [ K f7 ]  [ Q d5 + ]  [ K g7 ]  [ N h4 ]  [ R d8 ] , [ N x g6 ]  My bishop was useless anyway.
 [ d4 ] , [ f6 ]  Bad. Obviously something had to be done about the e-pawn and 3. ...[ N c6 ] is not good enough in view of 4. [ d x e5 ] dxe5; 5. [ Q x d8 ] Kxd8; when Black can't castle and White gets a lead in development. But this move shuts off a square that either the King's Knight or the Queen badly needed - and now they plus the Bishop are all fighting over [ e7 ] and three into one won't go. To make matters worse the move weakens both diagonals running through [ f7 ] meaning that after White's next Black will be unable to castle for some time to come and will be at risk of a check from [ h5 ] (see move 10). Better is either 3. ...[ N d7 ] 3. ...[ N f6 ] or even the ambitious 3. ...f5.
 [ B c3 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ B x d4 ] , [ c x d4 ]  Wanting to get rid of the bishop
 [ K c2 ]  [ N f5 ]  [ K d3 ] , [ N x h4 ]  munch.
 [ K d3 ] , [ R a4 ]  Better was 78...Kd5! ending the game faster.
 [ R a4 ] , [ K b8 ]  A useless counterattack.
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ N g4 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ e3 ]  [ B b4 + ] , [ N d2 ]  Standard to here. Now I should just take on e5. But being so caught up in MCO memorization I fail to notice that white hasn't yet played [ N f3 ] so my knight is undefended! So what do I do? Like a dummy I play the book move as if he's already played Nf3.
 [ R g6 ]  [ Q h5 ]  [ Q e7 ]  [ R e2 ]  [ Q d7 ] , [ Q x c5 ]  
 [ Q f7 ] , [ Q a1 ]  Only move but strong. Any exchange of queens here (on [ f7 ] or a2) is hopeless for white.
 [ b x a5 + ]  [ K x a5 ]  [ R x b7 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ B x d5 ] , [ K x a4 ]  ...but I manage to snaffle four pawns in exchange for three.
 [ h x g5 ]  [ g6 ] , [ R x h5 ]  ...of course. I know I have to spend two tempoes to bring in the other R but if I do I'm done!
 [ N c3 ] , [ N b4 ]  The knights continue their struggle with white's moving to [ c3 ] and black's to b4. I am not sure why I took my black knight over there but it must have been the only piece I wanted to move at that time.
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ e3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ O-O ] , [ B d6 ]  Here black wasn't paying attention and white pulled off a tactic that messed up his position.
 [ R b b3 ]  [ R c2 + ]  [ K f3 ] , [ R a a2 ]  And white resigned. It was impossible not to lose more pawns for a slow but lost endgame. Thank you for reading.
 [ B x a1 ] , [ R x a1 ]  And black has won a pawn and the exchange. This should be enough to win -- so white gets a little desperate. The following attempt to complicate is interesting and may have succeeded in blitz chess (as it almost does here) but the extra time-per-move of correspondence chess will prove decisive.
 [ Q b5 ]  [ R e3 ]  [ R e d8 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ R d4 x d3 ]  [ Q c2 ]  [ c6 ]  [ R e3 ]  [ R d3 d2 ]  [ R a3 ]  [ R x c2 ]  [ R a8 + ]  [ K c7 ]  [ R a3 ]  [ Q x b2 ]  [ R f3 ]  [ R d1 ]  [ K h3 ]  [ g5 ]  [ R f5 ]  [ N d5 ] , [ R x f7 + ]  Black's resignation makes little sense save that the IHS team may have already won three so the outcome here was irrelevant. A quick end might help them jockey for position on the ladder while suppressing Letiana's rating making it easier to match her against weaker players.
 [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ a6 ] , [ B g5 ]  Nothing was new for me until this move. But I'm not used to this. Furthermore I'm thinking about what his [ N c3 ] might be able to do.
 [ a4 ]  [ b6 ]  [ b4 ]  [ B b7 ] , [ f3 ]  Taking away an advanced support point for black's knight on e4. Right now my knight on [ c3 ] has the chance to leave it's spot.
 [ K b4 ] , [ h3 ]  My only hope is to push my pawns and hope Black gets distracted.
 [ N x h7 ] , [ B x h7 + ]  An exchange of Knights. To be honest i can't believe i'm a pawn up!
 [ a6 ]  [ a4 ] , [ b6 ]  i want to fianchetto my light-square Bishop at b7.
 [ h x g6 ]  [ Q h2 ]  [ B x d5 ]  [ Q h7 + ]  [ K f8 ]  [ N x d5 ] , [ N x f3 ]  Another gross blunder capturing a hanging pawn. Black should be worrying about how to avoid getting mated.
 [ B x c5 ]  [ B x c5 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ R f3 ]  [ K f7 ]  [ R h3 ]  [ K g7 ]  [ R f1 ]  [ R d e8 ]  [ R h f3 ] , [ R a d8 ]  Since [ Q x a7 ] is forbidden on account of 23. ... Ra8. 24. [ Q x b7 ] Reb8. There is little that white can undertake.
 [ N a6 ] , [ O-O ]  BxN may double black's pawns on the a file but that doesn't seem to be enough compensation to lose the bishop pair in a game where white has all that space. In fact with all that space any exchanges would have to be carefully considered as they would probably favour black.
 [ Q d3 + ] , [ N e2 ]  And here my knight will stay for the rest of the game shielding my king from the black queen.
 [ K g7 ] , [ h3 ]  23. [ h3 ] - this is also a database move but I think it is very sensible to create a flight square for Henry especially if I wish to do some attacking in Maria's arc.
 [ B x g2 ] , [ K x g2 ]  A counterattack for white.
 [ d4 ]  [ B b4 + ]  [ N c3 ] , [ Q e7 ]  Maybe not the best. The idea of course is to set up the discovered check by taking the c-pawn but white now gets the chance to build up a solid defense by blocking the e-file with [ B e3 ] leaving little play for black in exchange for the sacrifice pawn. A more agressive option would have been 6.... [ N e4 ]  [ B x c4 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ B x e2 ] , [ N g x e2 ]  The exchange allowed white to develop quickly. A better idea may have been [ B d5 ] as the most likely line that would follow is development of the knight towards [ f3 ] (either directly or through exchange of the bishop on f3) which would leave the knight on [ c3 ] weaker and more susceptible to moves like [ N e4 ]  [ Q d3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ O-O ] , [ O-O-O ]  immediately posts the rook where it needs to be and the asymmetric castling makes it all the more likely that the game will become dynamic and interesting.
 [ N f6 ] , [ f3 ]  This move is great in blitz but considering the fact that I have two days to consider each of my moves it's a poor choice.
 [ B h6 ] , [ Q d2 ]  Black's poor bishop must be feeling rather like a yo-yo.
 [ R e7 + ]  [ K g6 ]  [ N e5 + ]  [ K h6 ]  [ N x d7 ] , [ Q g1 + ]  Now First Black's move without checking means checkmate for Black's King in next move.
 [ Q c7 ] , [ N d e5 ]  I wasn't sure what to do here so I tired to allure Nathan into liquidating my [ N d4 ] with my next move. Not surprisingly however it doesn't work.
 [ g x f5 ]  [ R x f5 ] , [ Q e3 ]  White's King-side pawns are wrecked and now White's Queen need to guard [ f3 ] too.
 [ R b8 ]  [ K g7 ]  [ h3 ]  [ Q a7 ]  [ R a b1 ]  [ R x a2 ]  [ R b1 b7 ] , [ Q x f2 + ]  White had enough and resigned...
 [ N b6 ]  [ Q b1 ]  [ Q d7 ]  [ Q b3 ] , [ N c4 ]  12. ..... [ N c4 ] - trying to avoid passivitis here.
 [ g x f4 ]  [ g x f4 ] , [ c2 ]  Another blunder. Black still thinks c-pawn can survive. He tries to play [ B h5 ] and the [ B d1 ] to save it but the material advantage the two bishop concept and the king activity is to much to fight against.
 [ Q a1 + ] , [ N b1 ]  Forced
 [ Q e7 ] , [ h3 ]  I "put the question".
 [ b6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ d5 ] , [ e5 ]  And the possibility to to capture blacks e-pawn by en´passant went possible but how next move in that case should become stopped me from doing it
 [ N x b3 ] , [ a x b3 ]  Bishops have been exchanged and the position is closed so right now the game doesn't look like it carries any more fire. However my somewhat weird 7. [ N c3 ] required my opponent to think a bit which left me a slight time advantage at this point. Seeing as I like to look for imbalances (I'm a Silman kind of guy) I decide to play off that imbalance.
 [ e4 ] , [ N b6 ]  Not even leaves the black diag to the queen in sight the bishop is out of the defence.
 [ B d5 + ] , [ f3 ]  ? A terrible miscalculation and not because of analyzing/playing through variations this time around. Instead I was fussed on the pawn chain since that's important as I learned from a video by an IM forgot however what his name was. But the K had to move back. By playing this I wind up losing a pawn and then some adding insult to injury. In fact something I forgot is what Jack said. That when getting out of check it's better to use the K as opposed to interposing with a pawn or piece.
 [ e x f4 ] , [ Q x f4 ]  Here 24. [ N x f4 ] might have been better. The N is somewhat feeble on e2.
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ c4 ]  [ c6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ e3 ]  [ N b d7 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ B d6 ] , [ e4 ]  Standard book opening so far. Here begins my assault on the centre. The advancement of the pawn on the King's file frees the dark bishop's development and threatens to undermine Black's centre play. Black cannot afford to allow the pawn to progress to e6; with a knight at [ d7 ] this square is a definite option to clear the knight away from the bishop's path so will have to exchange his own pawn at [ d5 ] during the skirmish. I was anticipating p[ e5 ] as a counter attack although with my dark bishop free to pin the knight at [ f6 ] calculated this to be manageable.
 [ Q d4 ]  [ Q x d4 ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B b2 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ b5 ]  [ N a5 ]  [ N d2 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B d3 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ N d f3 ]  [ B h6 ]  [ N e2 ] , [ N b3 ]  so far he has a massive advantage.
 [ Q x g5 ]  [ R c8 + ]  [ K e7 ]  [ f4 ]  [ Q g6 ] , [ f5 ]  Here I offer up [ e x f5 ] Qxd3. This lets his Queen out but will let me get a vicious attack.
 [ N f4 ] , [ Q f3 ]  20. [ Q f3 ] - WQ dodges knight attack and protects the h pawn. But I now hatch a plan to drive the WQ off that square.
 [ e6 ]  [ d4 ] , [ d5 ]  Starting position
 [ a6 ] , [ N h4 ]  Trying to pile on to the pinned piece.
 [ B x a6 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ B x b5 + ]  [ Q d7 ]  [ B x d7 + ]  [ K x d7 ]  [ B h6 ] , [ N x h6 ]  again not paying attention: rule number two...
 [ N c6 ] , [ g3 ]  post game note: analysis shows this as an inaccuracy but I intended on the fianchetto and wanted to castle as soon as possible. Not sure why its an inaccuracy.
 [ Q g6 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ R g4 ]  [ N x g4 ]  [ B x c5 ] , [ Q x c2 ]  Very weak.In these type of positions black must not go for pawns
 [ N x f4 ]  [ N x f4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ Q a4 + ] , [ B d7 ]  now i expect one of two possible choices: a) [ Q b3 ] a nice threat on [ f3 ] but also a miss directed threat against [ b7 ] a poisoned pawn if white take he loses a rook b) [ B b5 ] the more appealing choice in white's point of view but allows me to force an isolated pawn for white with [ c x d4 ]  [ B x d7 + ]  [ Q x d7 ]  [ Q x d7 + ] , [ K x d7 ]  all forced replies for black white simplifies but get's a worst endgame let's see if he can hold it to a draw
 [ R e1 + ]  [ B e7 ] , [ Q d4 ]  I thought this was a good move but now I see that I could have forced his queen with [ B g5 ]  [ K d7 ]  [ Q e5 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ Q f4 ] , [ B d6 ]  I thought this was my chance well i just didn't see what was going to happen.
 [ e4 ] , [ Q d7 ]  I am now ready to castle on either side whites previous move doesn't worry me unduly I would be happy with [ e x d5 ] Nxd5. Looking at it now [ Q b6 ] seems better
 [ Q x a8 ] , [ Q a5 + ]  !! Before he does any more damage I decide to place him in check. This might look like a nuisance and a waste of time but it is quite. What is the significance of this move? That will be answered shortly.
 [ B c5 ]  [ Q c3 ] , [ B b4 ]  now the exchange is won and it was forced.
 [ N a5 + ]  [ K x c5 ]  [ N x c6 ] , [ K x c6 ]  With no pieces left and my king unable to help the king side pawns I resign myself to pushing the queenside pawns and praying for a mistake.
 [ R a e8 ] , [ c x d5 ]  becoming dangerous for me but i have a surprise ...
 [ O-O ] , [ c3 ]  ...then I attack his dark-square bishop...
 [ B x d6 ]  [ Q x d6 ] , [ N e4 ]  ! Black will lose one pawn.
 [ B e6 ] , [ N c3 ]  Instead I try [ N d3 ] to attack the Queen seemed to be a good move
 [ e5 ]  [ b4 ]  [ Q c7 ] , [ N c x b5 ]  With the idea of not giving black the chances for some attack I sacrificed my knight for 3 pawns. A good choice i think. I'll win the b a and later on the d pawn.
 [ B h4 ]  [ B x h4 ]  [ N x h4 ]  [ Q e7 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ R a b8 ]  [ N g5 ] , [ h6 ]  That was a mistake. Weakening the pawn on [ g6 ] but I just really want that knight out of there! But now he is just going to go on [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ R f6 ]  That was to avoid 21.[ b x c6 ] p[ x c6 ] 22.n[ e5 ]  [ a6 ]  [ B x c6 ]  [ b x c6 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ Q d6 ] , [ R f3 ]  That rook lift was good. He is obviously aiming at the weakened [ g6 ] pawn
 [ O-O ] , [ h6 ]  Preventing 7.[ B g5 ] or 7.Ng5. I don't see the point in preventing it because if Maxime brings his [ N f3 ] up there Shakhriyar has 7...d5.
 [ B c6 ]  [ g4 ]  [ g6 ] , [ g5 ]  Restraining Black's lsb. White may be out of ideas at this point perhaps.
 [ R d8 ] , [ R x a7 ]  [ K c3 ] might be better practically although if black takes the bishop it makes no difference. I just took the pawn and hoped for the best!
 [ N c4 ] , [ B x c4 ]  I was expecting 16 PxB QxP 17 QxQ BxQ 18 R moves with a Pawn ahead and a long endgame to come where I have a slight possibly winning advantage.
 [ Q d5 ]  [ O-O ]  [ f5 ] , [ Q b3 ]  I offer to trade queens and to double up my pawns figuring that black already has a doubled pawn and it would open up the a file for my rook.
 [ Q d8 ] , [ Q x c6 + ]  white has turned the tables
 [ a x b4 ] , [ N x b4 ]  His knight finally proves useful.
 [ b5 ] , [ h3 ]  but black had a counter-attack...
 [ N f6 ] , [ B g5 ]  I bring up the bishop in case the knight takes my queen...
 [ B e7 ] , [ N x f7 ]  The main difference in this and the fried liver is the opening of the e-file allowing white to use his rook early in the attack.
 [ B f8 ]  [ N g6 ]  [ K f7 ]  [ N h8 + ]  [ K e6 ]  [ B d7 + ]  [ K e7 ]  [ N g6 + ]  [ K f7 ]  [ N x e5 + ]  [ f x e5 ]  [ R x e5 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B e6 + ]  [ B x e6 ]  [ f4 ]  [ c4 ]  [ f5 ]  [ B c8 ]  [ R d8 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ R e6 ] , [ N c5 ]  Knew i was gonna lose one of these bishops. i wanted to make sure it was white.
 [ K g7 ] , [ R g5 + ]  Forcing the king to the edge
 [ d4 ] , [ e x d4 ]  I wanted to play [ Q h3 ] here but I think [ f3 ] could cause black some problems.Now if rook takes on [ d4 ] [ Q h3 ] would be strong.If 21. cx[ d4 ] black will have to come up with another plan possibly [ B d5 ] to keep the bishop on the h1-[ a8 ] diagonal
 [ N e2 ] , [ d5 ]  ?! (Dubious move) This forces me to use pieces to defend both e pawns emphasizing the problem with doubled pawns. [ N d5 ] or [ N d7 ] followed by [ B g5 ] or [ B h4 ] may have been better here. I intended to force white's knight to move with [ e4 ] but went about it badly and almost got myself into trouble.
 [ Q e6 ] , [ Q b3 ]  Offering a Queen swap after which the c-pawn could advance unhindered.
 [ Q g5 ] , [ h3 ]  Does not see the mate coming.
 [ R x b5 ] , [ g5 ]  ?! Back to the drifting. Where are you going with this? You need to train yourself to always ask the question "what am I trying to accomplish?" With so many pawns traded off now you need to go after some of White's pawns – which should be easy with an extra piece to work with – to clear the way for one of your own.
 [ B e3 ]  [ R e8 ] , [ Q c2 ]  Development for White is now nearly complete after the rooks are brought to the center. This is a beautiful position for White with a strong pawn chain and well developed pieces. The bishop on [ e3 ] supports the center and play on either side - it is nicely active will all pawns on the opposite colour. The Queen on [ c2 ] supports the knight and action along the b1-[ h7 ] diagonal.
 [ Q a8 + ]  [ K d7 ]  [ Q a4 + ]  [ c6 ] , [ R e7 + ]  White's countersacrifice drives the Black King into the open center of the board away from the shelter of the Q-side Pawns.
 [ Q a5 ] , [ Q d5 ]  offered queen exchange
 [ N f3 ] , [ N c6 ]  Symmetrical... for now.
 [ a5 ] , [ Q b8 ]  confused really.
 [ B e3 ] , [ e6 ]  Now I'll have to live with my queen on the kingside. Is he going to castle queenside? That's so unusual against this opening.
 [ a6 ]  [ e4 ]  [ b4 ] , [ N a4 ]  10. [ N a4 ] - on the rim but probably not for long!
 [ Q d8 ] , [ N d6 + ]  ? White takes another tempo to trade off the Knight he just gave up a pawn to put on c4. 9. [ d x c5 ] [ N x c3 ] 10. [ Q d3 ] (or 9. Bd6) would be much better.
 [ d x e4 ]  [ N x e4 ] , [ N d7 ]  4. ................ [ N d7 ] - prepares [ N f6 ] and allows my pawn to advance to [ c5 ] at the right moment.
 [ N c5 ] , [ K b8 ]  17. ...... [ K b8 ] - a precautionary move to protect [ a7 ] but I wonder whether I should have played [ N e4 ] here.
 [ Q e2 ] , [ Q f6 ]  37. [ Q f6 ] - renewing the pile on (and protecting the rook on [ f1 ] and at the same time staving off Old Matey on the back row). That pawn on [ f7 ] has been menaced for some time. It will survive however and this pawn will be instrumental in me conceding that low draw!
 [ f x e6 ]  [ Q g6 + ]  [ K f8 ]  [ Q h6 + ]  [ R g7 ]  [ Q h8 + ]  [ K f7 ]  [ Q h5 + ]  [ K f6 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ Q e8 ]  [ Q x h4 + ]  [ K f7 ]  [ Q h5 + ]  [ K g8 ]  [ Q h6 ] , [ Q g6 ]  Threaten mate and tries to trade off queens.
 [ Q x c4 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ f6 ]  [ e5 ] , [ f x e5 ]  Um erro fatal. Alternative variation: 29... [ d3 ] 30. [ e x f6 ] [ Q f4 ] 31. [ Q e1 ] [ Q x f6 ]  [ Q x g5 + ]  [ K f7 ]  [ Q x d8 ] , [ Q c2 ]  Alternative variation: 31... [ Q x b4 ] 32. [ R c1 ] [ K e6 ]  [ Q d7 + ]  [ K g6 ]  [ Q x b7 ]  [ d2 ]  [ Q a6 + ] , [ K g5 ]  Alternative variation: 37... [ K f7 ] 38. [ Q a7 + ] [ K e6 ]  [ d x e1 = Q ]  [ Q x e1 ]  [ Q x b2 ]  [ h3 ]  [ h4 ]  [ g3 ]  [ h x g3 ]  [ Q x g3 + ]  [ K f6 ]  [ Q h4 + ]  [ K e6 ]  [ Q c4 + ] , [ K f6 ]  as Pretas oferecem empate.
 [ f3 ]  [ N c5 ]  [ R e7 ]  [ B f6 ]  [ R x a7 ] , [ c3 ]  The king is under tremendous pressure.
 [ R c8 ] , [ N e4 ]  doom looms on the horizon best is 16...[ Q e7 ]  [ N x f6 + ] , [ Q x f6 ]  no other choice
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ] , [ f4 ]  My second game against Joanne who is a very strong player. Our first ended in a draw with me as black. Now I take quite some chances with the King's gambit which often leads to wild but interesting games and which is an opening I love
 [ R x g1 ]  [ R x g1 ]  [ R g6 ]  [ B f6 + ]  [ K g8 ] , [ B g5 ]  Now he threats h4-h5. He is threatening [ N f6 + ] too. I just have to stay calm don't lose my cool blood and defend.
 [ K h8 ]  [ R x g7 ]  [ Q h1 + ]  [ K x h1 ]  [ c x d3 ] , [ R h7 # ]  
 [ f5 ]  [ e x f5 ] , [ g x f5 ]  I might have tried b-[ g4 ] here. You'll still have to retreat with the other bishop but then you're still pushing me back.
 [ R d1 ]  [ B a4 ]  [ R d4 ]  [ R f e8 + ] , [ K f1 ]  ?? Blindness! Of course White should have played 18.Kf3. In that case Black again would have had the better (almost winning) position playing 18... [ R e1 ] or even 18... Bc6+.
 [ N d7 ] , [ N c1 ]  Aiming for [ d3 ] close enough to help defend the king but also ready to help on the kingside if needed too.
 [ R b3 + ]  [ K f2 ]  [ R b8 ]  [ B x a4 ] , [ R f8 + ]  now there is a chance to take on [ b2 ] but this would lose a rook - or the game.
 [ B f1 ]  [ Q h5 ]  [ h3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B g2 ]  [ e6 ] , [ B x c7 ]  Taking the unprotected pawn
 [ K h7 ]  [ N f6 + ]  [ K g7 ]  [ N e8 + ]  [ K g8 ] , [ Q g7 # ]  
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ] , [ c4 ]  Not a very strong move blocks your light squared bishop.
 [ B g3 ] , [ a6 ]  I thought you should play [ [ [ h5 ] ] ] at this point. Your Nh6-[ g4 ] manouevre is the only way to get play and you need to get your R out via h6. I thought 9....[ [ h6 ] ] 10.[ [ [ [ [ [ h4 ] ] ] ] ] ] (if 10[ h3 ] [ [ [ [ [ [ h4 ] ] ] ] ] ] 11.[ B h2 ] Bxf2) Nh6. Forcing [ [ [ [ [ [ h4 ] ] ] ] ] ] means that there is one less pawn defending the B on g3. This doesn't mean much right now but it allows tactics based on a future B[ g4 ] hitting the R on [ d1 ] then the N on [ [ h6 ] ] goes to [ f5 ] hitting the B on g3. If the N can take the B on [ [ g3 ] ] then my pawn structure will be pawns on [ g2 ] [ [ g3 ] ] [ [ [ [ [ [ h4 ] ] ] ] ] ] which means your pawn on [ e4 ] is a passed pawn. look at this possible line. 9...[ [ [ h5 ] ] ] 10.[ [ [ [ [ [ h4 ] ] ] ] ] ] N[ [ h6 ] ] 11.[ a3 ] B[ g4 ] 12.[ N g e2 ] [ e3 ] 13.fx[ e3 ] Bx[ e3 ] 14.[ K b1 ] N[ f5 ] and black has a bit of play. Of course White must be careless to allow this but you would be giving yourself more opportunities by forcing small weaknesses on your opponent. Perhaps even something like this [ B c5 ] 9. B[ [ g3 ] ] [ [ [ h5 ] ] ] 10. [ [ [ [ [ [ h4 ] ] ] ] ] ] R[ [ h6 ] ] 11. [ R e1 ] [ a6 ] 12. [ B x c6 ] [ R x c6 ] 13. Nx[ e4 ] [ B b6 ] 14. [ N f3 ] [ N h6 ]  [ B x c6 + ] , [ b x c6 ]  Looking at the position now you have 3 pawns on the Q side which cannot support each other. With the Qs off you are unlikely to be able to use the open b file to mate me.In the long term your Q side pawns represent a winning position for me. AT this point I looked at 2 ways to play this position. Firstly to go for the Q side pawns by [ N a5 ] [ N g e2 ] c4-[ c5 ] Nd4. Secondly to go for the [ e4 ] pawn.
 [ c4 ] , [ N f4 ]  The best would be to move the night back to [ f6 ] and accept the mistake.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ] , [ f4 ]  Okay we're starting with a Kings Gambit. So white wants a swashbuckling good time and he's willing to give black a slight advantage for it. At this level of play this opening is quite a good choice.
 [ O-O ]  [ N g e5 ] , [ Q g3 ]  White is now threatening so many things and you can foresee several winning plans here that I just threw the towel off. Things like 14.[ B g5 ] or [ h4 ] to get the bishop onto [ a3 ] or else [ f4 ] with [ e5 ] were just too much for me so I tried to focus on the rest of the games of this round. Hope some of you have learned a lesson: develop properly and do not leave your center exposed to an attack early in the game it will mostly cost you the game! Nicely played by laslandes!
 [ d5 ] , [ e x d5 ]  the exchange variation. This is a great choice if one wishes to get a draw. White is rated lower than his opponent so this is a perfectly reasonable choice.
 [ B f4 ]  [ O-O ]  [ c3 ] , [ B f5 ]  [ B g4 ] might be more effective.
 [ Q x f8 ]  [ Q f1 ] , [ N d7 ]  Nice move !! Now black keeps being dangerous because it won't have to play 18. [ Q x f8 ] [ K x f8 ] 19. [ R f1 ] . (where black would need to spend another move to develop his closed-in rook).
 [ B g6 ]  [ h x g5 ]  [ B x g5 ]  [ f x g6 ] , [ Q x g6 ]  15. [ Q x g6 ] - white has sacrificed 2 pieces for 2 pawns for a mating attack. Thankfully it fails.
 [ b5 ]  [ N a5 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N b3 ]  [ c4 ]  [ N c5 ]  [ a5 ]  [ N b7 ]  [ a4 ]  [ N c5 ] , [ K d6 ]  time to put this Knight on a leash...
 [ N x e4 ]  [ B x e7 ]  [ Q x e7 ] , [ R e3 ]  that was the plan but you know this is a 3mn blitz so i had to think quickly and i'm not sure about the suitability of it
 [ R a e1 ] , [ B g6 ]  This was played in part to prevent the white knight from moving. If it goes to [ e5 ] white will drop both the d and e pawns. Any other knight move drops the e pawn.
 [ Q b1 + ]  [ K c4 ]  [ Q b3 + ]  [ K d4 ]  [ R f4 + ]  [ K e5 ]  [ Q e3 + ]  [ K d5 ] , [ Q e4 # ]  gg. Arguably the best game I've played to date. A couple minor move errors but due to piece positioning white couldn't overcome being down that one pawn and was constantly playing defense the whole game. Both games we played were very well played splitting the series as each won as black.
 [ R c5 ]  [ Q b4 ]  [ Q a7 ]  [ f3 ] , [ R x c2 ]  This was a good move!
 [ N c6 ]  [ O-O ] , [ a6 ]  Perhaps Black just doesn't want White to take a stab at occupying [ b5 ] or perhaps he intends b7-b5. White doesn't like his Bishop on [ d2 ] or the unprotected Bishop on c4.
 [ b4 ]  [ g5 ] , [ b5 ]  Not so reasonable move.
 [ K h4 ]  [ K f2 ]  [ K g5 ] , [ K g1 ]  Apparently he did not see [ B f3 ] or had some other idea.
 [ Q x f3 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ Q b3 ]  Attacking f7. Had black adopted a different move order - say 7. ... [ c6 ] then white wins with 8. [ B x f7 ] Ke7/[ d7 ] 9. [ Q e6 # ]  [ Q e7 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ c6 ] , [ B g5 ]  Fischer again - "Black is in what's like a zugzwang position here. He can't develop the [Queen's] knight because the pawn is hanging the bishop is blocked because of the Queen."
 [ e4 ]  [ f x e4 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ N g f6 ] , [ N g5 ]  Also to be considered was [ N x d6 + ] trying to blow the position open immediately. I decided that with a positional edge I was in no hurry.
 [ Q x c7 ]  [ Q e6 ]  [ Q x a7 ] , [ N d5 ]  Bringing the Knight into the game. White's Q has been diverted by Pawns into a position where it is out of play.
 [ Q a4 ]  [ K b8 ] , [ N d2 ]  ?? Too slow! And it is underestimating black's attack power! This happens when a player doesn't take into account sacrifices played against him when defending.
 [ g x f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B b4 ]  [ B d2 ]  [ O-O-O ]  [ a3 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ b4 ]  [ B d4 ]  [ O-O-O ]  [ f6 ]  [ N b5 ]  [ g5 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ B x e3 + ]  [ f x e3 ]  [ a6 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ h6 ]  [ N f2 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ B b3 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ K d2 ]  [ N e7 ]  [ N g4 ]  [ f5 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ c6 ]  [ R h e1 ]  [ f4 ]  [ c4 ] , [ h5 ]  This leaves P[ g5 ] undefended. The bigger problem here is that white can get that knight to [ d6 + ] seizing the rook at [ e8 ] with a fork. I like Nf5. This way black threatens NxP[ d4 ] ending up with the bishop at [ b3 ] or possibly forking the king and e rook with NxPf3.
 [ K c6 ]  [ h5 ]  [ K c5 ]  [ h6 ]  [ N f8 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ K d4 ]  [ N c6 + ]  [ K c5 ]  [ N x a5 ]  [ b4 ]  [ a x b4 + ]  [ K x b4 ]  [ N c6 + ]  [ K x b3 ]  [ K e3 ]  [ K c4 ] , [ K f4 ]  The N must be attacked and forced to move since it aides the [ e4 ] pawn to keep out the BL King letting WT's King stroll on into the action now himself.
 [ d5 ]  [ B g2 ] , [ e5 ]  Deviating from my usual developement (Bf5).
 [ d6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ g3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ B g2 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ d5 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ h6 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ N e4 ] , [ Q d3 ]  Not a good move. Opening the Queen to attack with no compelling reason. [ B f5 ] discovered attack. Enemy Bishop with a line down the center. two knights around the center. Asking for trouble. I would have preferred Ne5.
 [ K c4 ]  [ K f4 ]  [ K d3 ]  [ K x g4 ]  [ K e3 ]  [ K g3 ]  [ K e2 ] , [ K g2 ]  Black keeps the White king out. There's no way to stop the pawn queening.
 [ d3 ]  [ d6 ] , [ B g5 ]  Okay I don't like this move. It forces the queen to move and vacate the knight's favorite square.
 [ N g2 ]  [ N x g2 ] , [ K x g2 ]  The last minor pieces vanish.
 [ Q d7 ]  [ h3 ]  [ B h5 ]  [ B g2 ] , [ O-O-O ]  ...have to watch [ h4 ] and Bh3...I am prepared to sac material on the kingside here are white is not developing quick enough and the English is a solid but slow positional build....
 [ Q d2 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ R a d1 ]  [ Q c5 ]  [ Q d6 ]  [ Q x d6 ]  [ R x d6 ]  [ N e7 ] , [ a4 ]  a spark of hope for Black; White should have played [ e5 ] or at least a3...
 [ d4 ] , [ b5 ]  For his move 6th move black moves his 4th pawn which white correctly punishes.
 [ Q h3 ]  [ B b3 + ] , [ K h8 ]  and now there is nothing to prevent ...[ Q g2 # ] so I play a token move to allow him the satisfaction.
 [ c4 ] , [ N b8 ]  If 18. ...[ h3 ] 19. [ g3 ] maintaining the general ugliness of the game.
 [ B x c4 ] , [ Q x c4 ]  12. [ N x c4 ] instead gives white a slight advantage.
 [ a6 ]  [ g4 ] , [ B e4 ]  First time I face this move. In theory black is not advised to exchange his strong lsb.
 [ h6 ]  [ g5 ]  [ h x g5 ] , [ N x g5 ]  I have a Rook on the half-open file.
 [ N d5 ]  [ O-O-O ] , [ Q c7 ]  Qc7? He now wants to build an attack on my queen side with moves like [ N b4 ] and [ Q a5 ] but there is no real potential in that plan.
 [ B f8 ] , [ Q x f8 # ]  29.Q:f8#. i don't know but maybe i won without his mistake too. however i think willowdale47 had to decline c pawn. what do u think?
 [ Q h3 ]  [ N e2 + ]  [ K f1 ]  [ N x f4 ]  [ Q f3 ]  [ R d4 ]  [ g3 ] , [ N e6 ]  Oops. Black was ahead materially and could afford to sacrifice the knight with P[ f6 ] or Qh5.
 [ O-O ] , [ b4 ]  He's making room to manuever. [ c6 ] and try to break up his pawns?
 [ c5 ]  [ c3 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ c x d4 ] , [ K b8 ]  Black scurries off of the hot file and prepares ...[ [ c5 ] ] hoping to undermine White's center before Mieses has a chance to reorganize his forces. True the king is on an open file but Black has to act fast or White will lock down on [ [ c5 ] ] and Black will be practically speaking a piece down.
 [ h3 ]  [ N x e3 ] , [ Q x e3 ]  I have a stonger control over the center but his other bishop could cause problems.
 [ R h6 ]  [ R f d1 ] , [ R a8 ]  A blunder. This drops the Rook.
 [ d x c4 ] , [ d x c4 ]  ?
 [ N x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ] , [ d5 ]  Now I get the bishop for knight.
 [ e6 ] , [ e4 ]  aiming for Central dominance
 [ Q a5 + ] , [ B d2 ]  Also good was [ c3 ] leaving the bishop on a strong diagonal.
 [ Q d4 ]  [ Q x d4 + ]  [ R x d4 ] , [ c5 ]  time to get back some space my pawns can also promote although I'm a bit behind in the start...
 [ B d5 ]  [ R h f1 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ R f2 ] , [ R e6 ]  Now a check is unavoidable. But it is mortal? Not at all... or is it?
 [ e4 ] , [ N d7 ]  Alternative variation: 43. [ R x e6 ] [ K f7 ] 44. [ N d5 ] [ K x e6 ] 45. [ N x f4 + ] [ K d6 ] $19 Alternative variation: 43. [ N c4 ] [ e3 ] 44. Nx[ e3 ] [ R x a4 ] $19
 [ b4 ]  [ R e2 ]  [ b x c3 ]  [ b x c3 ]  [ Q d7 ]  [ R a e1 ]  [ K h8 ]  [ h3 ]  [ N e4 ] , [ N f1 d2 ]  better than 24.[ B x e7 ]  [ B x h4 ]  [ N x h4 ] , [ f5 ]  this critical move changes structure of the game giving white a chance to place its knight on e5.
 [ Q e2 ]  [ a4 ]  [ N a1 ] , [ B f6 ]  24. ........... [ B f6 ] (attacking the b pawn so I defend it by playing c4?? but this move loses because of the queen fork on [ b6 ] - maybe I should have played [ b3 ] instead). Hindsight is always 20/20 vision (I think you have heard this before and may hear this many more times from me when playing 2000 players!!) so I now lose a pawn.
 [ B c6 ] , [ B g4 + ]  Alternative variation: 19. [ N c3 ] [ e x d4 ] (19... [ Q x d4 ] 20. [ Q x d4 ] [ e x d4 ] 21. [ B g4 + ] [ R d7 ] 22. [ N b5 ] [ N e5 ] 23. [ B x d7 + ] [ K x d7 ] 24.

[ R a b1 ] $14
 [ e4 ] , [ c5 ]  as was to be expected: the Sicilian...
 [ Q x e3 ]  [ B x e3 ] , [ N c4 ]  Ahead 6 points I trade whenever possible.
 [ Q g8 ]  [ R g1 ]  [ Q e6 ] , [ R h g3 ]  19. [ R h g3 ] - plausible but it does not cut the mustard.
 [ d6 ]  [ O-O ] , [ N c6 ]  Happy to develop my pieces to natural squares.
 [ f x g5 + ]  [ K g6 ] , [ h4 ]  another mate threat well i only got one choice here.
 [ B d4 ] , [ R b1 ]  With his white-squared Bishop poised this appears to be the appropriate move but can White afford to lose his pawn on a2?
 [ c6 ]  [ B a3 ]  [ K d7 ]  [ e4 ]  [ K e6 ]  [ e x d5 + ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ R a b1 ]  [ R a b8 ]  [ B c5 ] , [ a6 ]  At this point black suprised me a little by offering a draw which I gladly accepted the question is should I have carried on a little longer? Thanks for reading please comment
 [ R x g5 ] , [ Q a2 ]  After my second win of Material I decided to to liquidate the pieces on the board to a winning end game.
 [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ f3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ N x c6 ]  A dubious idea against the Dragon; After ..[ b x [ c6 ] ] Black's central control has increased appreciably; he has the b-file and he can now play ..[ B [ e6 ] ] (more natural than ..Bd7) without worrying about Nxe6. Indeed the pressure on [ e6 ] and [ c6 ] that [ N d4 ] provides is often so great that Black voluntarily plays ..[ N x d4 ] himself to free his position. This is even better for Black.
 [ N f7 + ] , [ K h7 ]  Forced again.
 [ d x e5 ] , [ c5 ]  With his Q still on the board and a passed QP Black can still drag on his resistance for a while.
 [ O-O ]  [ B e7 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ d6 ] , [ B b5 ]  Seizing the opportunity to pin me...
 [ Q x g7 ] , [ B x g7 ]  My Bishop takes Queen!!!
 [ g4 ] , [ K g7 ]  And Black castles-by-hand and the rooks are connected.
 [ O-O ] , [ d5 ]  If 11. ... [ c x d5 ] 12. [ N x d5 ] will eventually anchor Black's center with the KP. If 11. ... [ c4 ] 12. [ B x b5 ] wins a pawn and a huge bishop threat.
 [ Q f7 + ]  [ K d8 ]  [ Q g6 ]  [ B e7 ] , [ Q x g4 ]  take the pawn
 [ N d e7 + ]  [ B x e7 ]  [ N x e7 + ]  [ K b5 ] , [ N x g8 ]  Its all over.
 [ N f6 ] , [ Q d2 ]  A mistake of sorts maybe I should have played [ h3 ] to prevent the next move but I was thinking of castling queen side.
 [ R f f1 ] , [ R e3 ]  White has to move a rook to the e file to save e5.
 [ Q x d3 ] , [ B x f5 ]  While attacks of this nature on the enemy queen look good....................
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ e6 ]  I prefer to "close" the Sicilian myself when playing against it but as I rarely play the Sicilian myself I'm unsure of continuations. The straight-forward 2. ... [ N c6 ] I dislike by virtue of mirrored knights; 2. ... [ d6 ] is just ugly aesthetically in my opinion. 2. ... [ N f6 ] 3. [ e5 ] looked unappealing.
 [ R a3 ]  [ R b3 ] , [ R x b3 ]  I see nothing better than exchanging since the rook cannot stay put and no other rank offers an active position. The draw offer has changed the game psychologically since I feel White's most likely reasoning for declining was that he felt he could win and that automatically puts me on the defensive. I know that my position looks fairly good with the passed pawn but the downside is that my pawn majority is under constant threat while White's is still quietly at home.
 [ Q e2 ] , [ B b4 + ]  black forces the white king to move as [ B d2 ] loses to 14...[ B x d2 ] [ K x d2 ] 15. [ Q x b2 ] [ K e3 ] 16.[ Q d4 ] [ K f3 ] 17.[ N e5 ]  [ K f1 ] , [ N e7 ]  [ N d4 ] is more active but black might do better to play [ h5 ] or [ f5 ] driving away the light square bishop as the pin on the [ e6 ] pawn is quite strong.
 [ R f e1 ] , [ R x a2 ]  'Winning' a pawn and presumably looking to prevent me taking his as this would pin my knight. We both agreeed afterwards that this was in fact the game losing move although the GK analysis only says it was a mistake. In fact it started a series of knight moves which completely changed the game although at this point I still thought I may be lucky to get the draw.
 [ b x c6 ] , [ N x f6 ]  White has a wining game if he prevents black to promote his right wing pawns.
 [ R b7 ] , [ B c7 ]  But now Black's rook has been cut off from the rest of the game!
 [ R e4 ] , [ R x e4 ]  Also playable were 27...[ N c5 ] and 27...[ Q c8 ] aiming toward the f-pawn. The text looked fine though...
 [ B x e5 ] , [ N x e5 ]  White could resign here but my opponent never quits until it really is hopeless. So the game goes on another 30 moves.
 [ Q b6 ] , [ Q a1 ]  getting queen to long lines
 [ a6 ]  [ O-O ] , [ B c5 ]  Black has spoiled a tempo with a6...
 [ Q d5 ] , [ N d7 ]  31. ..... [ N d7 ] - Rick's queen gets to [ d5 ] as predicted but at least I can safely move my knight to d7. At least my knight also protects the vulnerable pawn at [ e4 ] but I feel an absolute zugzwang is not too far away.
 [ N x d4 ] , [ B b4 ]  even after the captures in the center [ d5 ] still looks good desptie the isoltated d pawn [ N e5 ] also looks better than Bb4.
 [ N e2 ] , [ R x c2 ]  There goes the pawn.
 [ d5 ]  [ d4 ] , [ N c6 ]  Develops knight
 [ B f7 ]  [ h5 ]  [ B b3 ]  [ Q d2 ] , [ h6 ]  What can white do?
 [ Q d7 ]  [ N a3 ]  [ h6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ g5 ] , [ N e5 ]  This dagger thrust gives White a huge positional edge. Black is doomed if White doesn't blow it.
 [ b3 ]  [ Q e8 ]  [ a3 ] , [ Q h5 ]  The usual Black break in this opening.
 [ h x g4 ]  [ B x g4 ]  [ f6 ] , [ K g3 ]  [ K g3 ] is in preparation of h4.
 [ K e3 ]  [ R e2 + ]  [ K d3 ] , [ R x h2 ]  
 [ R x e7 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ R e d7 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ R d7 d4 ]  [ R x d4 ]  [ R x d4 ] , [ R x h7 ]  hoping for back rank mates
 [ Q f2 ] , [ R h3 ]  This saves the day for black.
 [ R e2 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ R e4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ R e e1 ]  [ R d8 ]  [ R a b1 ]  [ Q x a2 ]  [ Q f5 + ]  [ N d7 ]  [ R b3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ Q b5 ]  [ N b6 ]  [ B b2 ] , [ Q a5 ]  Time for a trade. I still have my favorite pieces knights.
 [ Q c7 ] , [ e5 ]  And in doing so Ted takes advantage of that. At first I thought that this won a piece. Although it's very rare once in a while I forget important facts. One of them being that my pin was broken. So I defend. Obviously I don't like the best move since it prevents me from castling. But there's no choice as anything loses a piece. And it's important to note that I directly kept in mind what bhidragon told me about seeing the overall picture. That's because if I were hyperfocused on castling I'd move elsewhere and lose the N in return. So I go by what the story that the board is revealing being black's [ N f6 ] is attacked in many directions which only leaves one option to defend with which means not castling.
 [ Q e1 ] , [ N c6 ]  It has been time ago when I used to develop pieces and sell the opportunity for my opponent to liquidate material for free. Enough for the many losses where all of my pieces are exchanged then unexpectedly find myself into a hard-to-figure-out inferior ending-game ! So I was considering [ N d7 ] before I discovered that NxN leads to a double attack on White (mate on [ g2 ] and attack on c3). So I selected [ N [ c6 ] ] of course [ c6 ] is much natural than d7.
 [ d6 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ B g4 ]  Typically black would play 6. ... [ e5 ] here but my opponent realizes that I'm not playing classically and swoops in immediately.
 [ K g4 ]  [ N x b4 ] , [ R h6 ]  didn't want to move here really wanted to go to [ g6 ] but thought better of it as i need to get king out of way
 [ Q h5 ] , [ R d d3 ]  ? 32.[ R h d3 ] was better; the text indicates how fixated I still was on the kingside attack.
 [ g4 ] , [ d6 ]  Black opens up the c8-bishop to attack the [ g4 ] and [ h3 ] pawns. Also he threatens 11...[ d x e5 ] attacking both the centre my queen and my material chances.
 [ K b6 ]  [ R x h7 ] , [ g x f4 ]  But Black misses the opportunity and might as well resign now. As this is an online game however what do we expect?
 [ a6 ]  [ b5 ] , [ N e5 ]  I'm not ready yet: after all Black's Queen still has the the diagonal to retreat along and [ g4 ] to play to. But I "had a whisper in my ghost" that if I was careful (i.e. as long as I didn't lose in the process of trying to be so clever) I might be able to make Black pay for that Queen sortie.
 [ N x d4 ] , [ e x d4 ]  Alternative variation: 22... [ Q x d6 ] 23. [ N f3 ] [ Q f6 ]  [ B x e7 ]  [ Q x e7 ]  [ f3 ]  [ Q c5 ]  [ Q f2 ]  [ h5 ]  [ R a1 ] , [ g5 ]  Alternative variation: 26... [ B c8 ] 27. [ h3 ] [ f6 ] 28. [ Q e2 ] [ g5 ] [ Houdini.]
 [ Q h4 ] , [ g5 ]  now the queen is forced to leave the 4th rank. It takes a pawn though.
 [ K f7 ] , [ Q e5 ]  I hasten back to the danger zone.
 [ R a b8 ] , [ R b3 ]  trying to get a trade because I'm up material
 [ N d3 ] , [ K e2 ]  I know all the stuff about active pieces etc. etc.Probably [ N b2 ] would have been better but then [ N c2 ] defends the a pawn... and in the endgame to come a bishop is good for him so...
 [ B d7 ] , [ R c5 ]  ah finally... but this is pointless.
 [ a4 ] , [ b4 ]  27... [ b x a4 ] 28 [ R x a4 ] and the white rook is freed. This keeps the white rook in isolation for a while yet.
 [ Q f3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ N c e7 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ h4 ]  [ h5 ]  [ d3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ g4 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ f5 ]  [ g x f5 ]  [ g x f5 ]  [ e x f5 ]  [ B g5 ] , [ B f6 ]  and my bishop stop his attack although i did some blunder in next moves
 [ R g7 ]  [ K f4 ] , [ b4 ]  ! [Carlsen manages to create counterplay with the passed pawn just in time.]
 [ N a5 ]  [ B b3 ]  [ N x b3 ]  [ a x b3 ]  [ a6 ]  [ N f1 ]  [ N h5 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ b6 ]  [ B x c5 ]  [ b x c5 ]  [ N x e5 ] , [ N f4 ]  I really liked 13 [ N x e5 ] but after this I wasn't so sure about my position
 [ Q d4 ] , [ Q e2 ]  Better would've been 12.[ B x c6 ] [ N x c6 ] 13. [ Q e2 ] to get at least some compensation for the bishop.
 [ N b d7 ]  [ h4 ]  [ O-O ]  [ R f e1 ] , [ h6 ]  0-1 This is winning for Black even though White is still ahead in development. Black's position is compact and solid and with careful play White will lose.
 [ K d2 ] , [ R f8 ]  And he saw the trap. Now is time to protect the Knight.
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ d6 ]  Philidor's Defence. If I play correctly I can get a spatial advantage.
 [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B b4 ] , [ Q b3 ]  When black moves his bishop to [ b4 ] to pin my knight I often play this so that if he exchanges I don't get doubled pawns or isolated pawns. This also threatens his bishop and supports my c pawn.
 [ K d6 ] , [ R a1 ]  Now White can win with 75 P-[ [ Q8 ] ] (Q) R-[ [ Q8 ] ] ch 76 K-B7.
 [ K e2 ]  [ K h6 ] , [ h4 ]  blocking the king but allowing Ng4.
 [ B g7 ]  [ B g2 ] , [ N a6 ]  In a lot of Benoni games you will find ...0-0 at this point or ...[ a6 ] or even ...Qe7. In this line the knight is intended to pull back to [ c7 ] putting pressure upon [ d5 ] and also supporting the subsequent pawn expansion (...a6; ...b5) on the Q-side. Again one plan - or at least one approach to a plan - among many possible.
 [ K h2 ] , [ N f2 ]  I wanted to get my knight to [ e4 ] to support my [ g3 ] knight because if my king was on [ f2 ] then [ N f1 ] [ K h1 ] [ N g3 # ] would be mate. When your opponent has limited moving range then It's okay to think as if you have unlimited moves
 [ B x d7 ]  [ N x f3 + ]  [ Q x f3 ] , [ Q x d7 ]  Power of the earlier knight sacrifice has diminished. The bishop is removed and black stands better. White has some potential past pawns on the queen side if an endgame issues.
 [ O-O ]  [ B e2 ] , [ N c6 ]  The most fashionable variation is 9... [ c x d4 ] 10. [ c x d4 ] [ Q a5 + ] 11. [ B d2 ] [ Q x a2 ] 12. O-O. Players like Kasparov Anand Leko Svidler to name just the Gruenfeld devotees play this way. 9...[ N c6 ] has fallen under a cloud and not without good reason White has a strong initiative mainly because of the ease with which he creates a passed d-pawn and uses it to paralyze Black's forces sometimes going for a full K-side attack.
 [ B b7 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ] , [ b4 ]  The advanced pawns come in handy!
 [ Q x b1 ]  [ R x e3 ]  [ B f3 ]  [ Q d6 ]  [ Q c2 ] , [ B e5 ]  25...Be5?!! An unexpected even shocking move. White should stay calm and even against a chessmaster make Black prove the sac is sound if for no other reason than otherwise White simply loses. But White is too frustrated with the rapid turn of events to remember this basic rule. After 26 PxB QxP 27 [ K g2 ] White may be able to draw.
 [ Q x a6 ]  [ b x a6 ]  [ K g2 ]  [ R c2 ] , [ B c1 ]  Not B-[ [ R3 ] ] because of 22... BxB 23 RxB N-K6ch 24 K-[ [ R3 ] ] RxP.
 [ N e1 ]  [ N c4 ]  [ b3 ] , [ Q b2 ]  I must admit I was sooooo tempted to simply play 44. ...[ Q x c3 ] 45. [ b x c4 ] [ Q x c4 ] trading in my knight for two pawns. Two adjacent passed pawns on the far side of the board from white's king and his (nearly) trapped bishop. I whipped out a chessboard and played through that endgame a bunch of times and couldn't quite force one of those pawns to promote so I backed down and played more conservatively. As played 44. ... [ Q b2 ] forces white to trade queens or lose a pawn.
 [ K h1 ]  [ N a5 ]  [ B b3 ]  [ N x b3 ] , [ c x b3 ]  10. [ c x b3 ] - this exchange of N for B breaks the pin on my f pawn and doubles up white's queenside pawns.
 [ B f1 ]  [ g6 ]  [ d3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N e2 ]  [ O-O ] , [ B f4 ]  I am quite please with the opening phase complete but I see a lack of energy with the continuation white has chosen. If you don't push sooner or later you will be pushed! blacks strategy has been successful he has no problems & his [ d4 ] pawn restricts or cramps white game greatly. Notice that without doing anything special black controls more space and will have first opportunity to seize the initiative!
 [ K e7 ]  [ R d5 ]  [ B b4 ]  [ K f3 ]  [ K e6 ] , [ K e4 ]  now black has really nothing more... resigned?
 [ K d5 ]  [ R x b6 ]  [ B c7 ]  [ R a6 ]  [ K e4 ] , [ K f2 ]  may be my only mistake here: i could have played [ R e6 + ] to make it quicker
 [ N x d5 ]  [ e4 ] , [ N b6 ]  Instead of swapping on [ c3 ] the N retreats to a not particularly useful square. The computer gives me the slightest edge after this.
 [ R e e1 ]  [ N b5 ]  [ R b a1 ]  [ R c7 c2 ] , [ a4 ]  retreating the knight wouldn't be dubious but would've be for ill because it went on a journey!
 [ Q b7 ] , [ f5 ]  ?
 [ a3 ] , [ N e4 ]  11. ....... [ N e4 ] - I think I can win back a pawn here but .......
 [ e3 ]  [ O-O ] , [ N c3 ]  Hes attacking my pawn on [ d5 ] twice and its only defended once so i defend it with my bishop
 [ R x a2 ] , [ e8 = Q ]  Black snuck a pawn from me. 40. [ R x a2 ] is a certain win but it does lose my chance to immediately promote at [ e8 ] (I could just let the e-pawn fall plant my rook on [ d2 ] and safely promote my c-pawn where black's king cannot touch it). But as played White threatens mate in 1 with 41. [ Q g6 ] so black must capture white's rook and having queen and pawn against king sounds like more fun than just rook and pawn.
 [ Q x g7 ]  [ N x g7 ]  [ R h g8 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ R x g7 ]  [ d x c6 + ]  [ K x c6 ] , [ N e5 + ]  white with better position and tempi.
 [ N x e5 ]  [ N x e5 ] , [ B x e5 ]  if he does not move his queen she is gone too.
 [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ g3 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ B g2 ] , [ N f6 ]  ? This loses a pawn.
 [ K f2 ]  [ R f5 + ]  [ K g2 ]  [ R f f3 ]  [ R b1 ] , [ R f x g3 + ]  for the first time in the whole game one of us gains a material advantage in the form of a pawn
 [ N x e4 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ d5 ] , [ c4 ]  immediately undermining the N's support using the same method I usually employ in the Petroff
 [ f5 ]  [ e x f5 ]  [ Q d7 ] , [ N a c3 ]  Securing his strongpoint at Q5.
 [ e5 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ R b8 ]  [ B x c5 ]  [ B x c5 ]  [ B a6 ]  [ b5 ]  [ a x b6 ]  [ e ]  [ p ]  [ a x b6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ b5 ]  [ B b3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ h4 ]  [ h5 ] , [ R b a1 ]  ? -- Now why'd I do that? I knew I couldn't double Rooks on this file so the threat is an empty one. White should just play 26. [ N e4 ] with the idea of pushing a pawn to [ g4 ] which soon happens anyway.
 [ B d2 ]  [ h4 ] , [ Q g4 ]  now i see nothing dangerous after this move so i'm trying to attack his "g7" pawn
 [ f6 ]  [ B e6 + ]  [ K h8 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ K g7 ] , [ c3 ]  white now protects [ b4 ] and d4.
 [ h x g4 ] , [ Q b5 + ]  ? Not to the point. Ne5! was still the best.
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ N d7 ] , [ Q d3 ]  White is considering castling queenside.
 [ a x b3 ] , [ a x b4 ]  Allows WR to enter the fatal 2nd (7th) line. Risky but I must admit I didn't see a definitive attack yet just the feeling I had to get something here by doubling rooks on the "a" column.
 [ B d7 ] , [ h4 ]  karpov doesnt hurry to try exchanging the bishops he opens the H and G filse first to expose blacks king side by playing h5.
 [ Q x g5 ]  [ f6 ]  [ Q g3 ]  [ R f d8 ] , [ R a c1 ]  Allowing his knight to move finally.......
 [ B c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ O-O ] , [ N f6 ]  4. .... [ N f6 ] - both players bring out their pieces quickly.
 [ B d4 + ] , [ K h1 ]  White had little choice (if 18. [ K f1 ] [ N h2 + ] and the rook on [ f3 ] is lost.)
 [ N f2 + ]  [ K c3 ]  [ N x g4 ] , [ K d3 ]  Now I revert to "You ain't checkmating me before I run out of time (had about 45 seconds left)
 [ R a c8 ]  [ a3 ]  [ a5 ]  [ B b3 ]  [ R c5 ]  [ R a d1 ]  [ R d8 ]  [ R d5 ]  [ b6 ]  [ R f d1 ]  [ R x d5 ]  [ R x d5 ]  [ b4 ]  [ a x b4 ]  [ a x b4 ]  [ c x b4 ]  [ K g7 ] , [ R d2 ]  I supposed that black would have taken the c file in possession with his rook and traded the rooks after which it would have been a king race. However with my active bishop contrary to black I was sure of being able to take the opposition leading me to victory.
 [ a3 ]  [ B x c3 ] , [ Q x c3 ]  At this point I think white is slightly better as it does not have any doubled pawns or isolated pawns. Black has both.
 [ K b2 ]  [ a1 = Q + ]  [ R x a1 ]  [ R x a1 ]  [ K x b3 ] , [ R c1 ]  White made the right decision. If 62. Kxa1? then 62. ... [ K c2 ] 63. (any) [ b2 + ] 64. [ K a2 ] [ b1 = Q + ] 65. [ K a3 ] Qb3#. Instead as played white lives on. However After 62. ... [ R c1 ] white's king cannot reach his pawns. Black can choose between a King+Rook checkmate or going after the white pawns promoting a black pawn and getting a Queen+Rook checkmate.
 [ d4 ] , [ B x g5 ]  Now when he did this I knew I was going to end up a piece down because of the strangled Lbishop.
 [ Q e3 ] , [ B b4 + ]  I was looking to manouver the bishop to b6.
 [ N e4 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ B x e4 ]  [ f3 ] , [ B b7 ]  Should have Black tried BxBh6?
 [ N x f4 ] , [ e x f4 ]  I now have the half open e file
 [ N x c6 ]  [ b x c6 ]  [ B d3 ] , [ d5 ]  The usual freeing break for Black in [ e4 ] openings. Also by far the most common in the position though 7...O-O is also possible.
 [ K d1 ] , [ d3 ]  White king moves across to [ d1 ] and out of check. I push my d file pawn to [ d2 ] in readiness to queen and also to protect my rook which of course is also protected by the LB.
 [ R x e8 ]  [ R x e8 ]  [ R x d4 ]  [ R e5 ]  [ h4 ] , [ R x c5 ]  32. .......... [ R x c5 ] - regaining my pawn plus but it will be amazing how Freddy's two remaining pieces are going to tie me down. Henry's confinement on [ h8 ] and [ g7 ] will be my waterloo here.
 [ b x c5 ] , [ h5 ]  Ok back to my previous plan. One should NEVER do this on chess.
 [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ Q c7 ] , [ Q d2 ]  mk is still very precautionous. We are both very calm players
 [ e x f6 ]  [ Q x f6 ] , [ R e f1 ]  seizing control of the F-file.
 [ Q e7 ]  [ b4 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ c4 ]  [ K f8 ] , [ K f3 ]  White is pressing forward
 [ K h2 ] , [ h6 ]  In my opinion a mistake. White never intended [ B g5 ] and white's ideas lie not only in the [ f4 ] push but also in [ B e3 ] so if the bishops were traded white would have a nice semi-open file to work on. ...[ h6 ] of course also weakens the kingside slightly and considering that black should be aware that the kingside is where white wants to play doesn't make much sense.
 [ N f7 ]  [ B e3 ] , [ Q a8 ]  Black's Queen will never be able to aid in the coming escalation of force.
 [ e x d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ B b4 + ]  [ B d2 ]  [ B x d2 + ] , [ Q x d2 ]  White has deployed 4 pieces to blacks's 2 and dominates the center and black is fairly stuck behind his pawns. And it's mostly due to that early queen move.
 [ b x c3 ]  [ g5 ]  [ B d2 ]  [ K e7 ] , [ c4 ]  clearing out the b file completely
 [ h4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ Q c8 ]  [ e7 ] , [ K f7 ]  The pawns were barely stopped by black. However I realize that by giving up the e pawn I can win the pawn endgame. The rest of the game does not need much annotation.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ] , [ B c4 ]  Checking up on my opponent's other games I found he was quite the devotee of the Bishop's Opening. There's nothing especially wrong with it but it's a long time since Weaver Adams was optimistically claiming it as a forced win for White.
 [ R a c8 ] , [ Q d2 ]  Ok he decided to release the queen's threat.. but im affraid its to late.
 [ N e7 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ R a2 ]  [ a5 ]  [ R f f2 ]  [ b5 ]  [ R f d2 ]  [ b6 ]  [ R a1 + ]  [ B f1 ]  [ R d d1 ]  [ K f2 ]  [ N g6 ] , [ c4 ]  why didn't I move bxc7?
 [ g4 ]  [ h6 ]  [ Q d2 ] , [ b4 ]  9....... [ b4 ] - now it is Freddy's turn to attack a knight on c3!
 [ R b6 ] , [ e6 ]  30. ... Rb6? was a blunder that will ultimately cost black the game though it's hard to see that right now. White's pawn has sat on [ e5 ] for 16 moves more than half of the game biding its time and now it's ready to pounce with 31. e6! which ultimately is the winning move. Black cannot capture it with his bishop: 31. ... Bxe6??? 32. [ R x d8 + ] [ K a7 ] 33. Ra8#. 31. ... Rxe6? simply loses the rook to 32. [ R x e6 ] and now black's bishop still cannot recapture. And yet that bishop is en prise and white can win it easily. But white has bigger plans big enough to throw away his entire queenside for them. It's interesting to note how much weaker this move would be if black's king were still on c8.
 [ a3 ]  [ a6 ]  [ a4 ] , [ e5 + ]  I think I should have tried to prevent this if at all possible. So perhaps I should have tried for [ f4 ] and [ e5 ] before advancing my a-pawn but I don't think I could actually have prevented it after 30.... [ K d6 ]  [ K c5 ]  [ h3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ f4 ]  [ g5 ] , [ f x g5 ]  I couldn't just let Black take on [ f4 ] so I had to either take on [ [ e5 ] ] or [ g5 ] or advance to f5. I think that would have lead straight to a draw. Taking on [ [ e5 ] ] would have left the smae configuration as taking on g5.
 [ g x f2 + ]  [ K f1 ]  [ K g7 ]  [ Q c x f8 + ]  [ K g6 ]  [ R a7 ]  [ R f6 ]  [ Q b e8 + ]  [ K f5 ] , [ Q e f7 ]  As you can tell I'm just fooling around here because I know that I pretty much won. My one Rook doesn't even move at all in the whole game.
 [ d4 ] , [ d5 ]  Blocking progress in the center.
 [ d4 ] , [ N f6 ]  Team match. This game took over 10 weeks to conclude but it's only 35 moves long. We were just taking our time I guess. Back then I was rated 1504 (I had completed only 26 games on GameKnot at that time) and my opponent was rated 1490. Our first game ended on 2/24/09 and is annotated titled Aggressive Plans on that date. It's a short little gem that ends on move 26 after white walks black's king over to whites side of the board for a checkmate. White begins this game with the queen's pawn and I reply Indian.
 [ N g f3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ a3 ]  White is playing passively.
 [ R x e8 ] , [ Q f4 ]  ?? Now instead of a large material loss it's a checkmate. The only defense is Kh2. White still doesn't see the threat of [ B c6 ] and tries to initiate its own attack.
 [ Q x d4 ]  [ R x c6 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ R d6 ]  [ Q x d6 ]  [ e x d6 ]  [ N x f6 ] , [ R x f7 ]  Black's position is hopeless white is threatening QxP which leads to mate black may play [ N e4 ] which is met by r[ e7 + ] [ K [ d8 ] ] NxP + [ K c8 ] P[ d7 + ] [ K b8 ] P[ d8 ] )Q)
 [ B a4 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ N d5 ] , [ Q b7 ]  Not 11 .. Nxd5? because after 12. P[ x d5 ] there is no escape for black's pinned knight at f6.
 [ R e4 ] , [ Q c1 ]  ??
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ a6 ]  [ B a4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ d6 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ b5 ]  [ B b3 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ c3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ h3 ]  [ N a5 ]  [ B c2 ]  [ c5 ]  [ d4 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ N b d2 ] , [ B b7 ]  All standard moves so far. I wonder however whether White might have been able to exploit Black's unusual move order eg. 5...[ d6 ] instead of the more common 5...Be7?
 [ e4 ]  [ N x c3 ]  [ e x f5 ] , [ N e4 ]  After all I only lost a pawn because of the careless bishop move. But as a consequence he almost got his promoted!
 [ R a1 ] , [ g4 ]  Here we go the time is right. Black cannot answer [ B x f4 ] because [ g x f3 ] would finish him off.
 [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ] , [ d5 ]  I am not sure why Joe played this. I would've done it to tie down white's [ N d4 ] here as my idea would be to take on c4.
 [ d x c5 ] , [ R x b6 ]  [ d6 ] [ b6 ] it does not matter now my e and d pawns are free!
 [ K g5 ]  [ f4 + ] , [ K x f4 ]  30. ..... [ K x f4 ] - Henry is pushed further up the board.
 [ c4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ b5 ] , [ d4 ]  The queenside is closed off.
 [ N f3 + ] , [ g x f3 ]  The Rook at [ h8 ] now looks destined to create havoc for White. Also notice how difficult it is for the White pieces to plug the gaps in the kings position.
 [ f6 ]  [ e x f6 ]  [ N x f6 ]  [ h3 ] , [ N c8 ]  14. .... [ N c8 ] begins a circuitous route to [ f7 ] to try and trade off the annoying white bishop.
 [ N d4 ]  [ B d5 ] , [ g4 ]  The fatal blunder. White does not have time to play this.
 [ f5 ] , [ Q e2 ]  Without ideas and with material equality I look to simplify.
 [ K g6 ]  [ f3 ] , [ f5 ]  protect
 [ Q c7 ]  [ N b5 ]  [ Q d8 ] , [ N d6 ]  going nowhere...
 [ Q f6 ] , [ Q d7 ]  White is not looking for an end game but black makes a mistake.
 [ f3 ] , [ B e7 ]  the start of the king side castle
 [ N c5 ]  [ K b5 ]  [ K b3 ] , [ N f5 ]  43. ..... [ N f5 ] - clearing the line for his h pawn to advance. I now play the only move that keeps me in the game .......
 [ R f6 ]  [ g x f5 ]  [ e x f5 ] , [ h4 ]  If 25...[ B x h4 ] 26.[ Q h3 ] looks good for White.
 [ g x f6 ]  [ Q f5 ]  [ R g8 ] , [ B x f6 + ]  Losing his queen for a bishop
 [ R g h8 ]  [ R d h1 ]  [ R x h7 ] , [ R x h7 ]  Black has managed to reduced material and go into the endgame with Bishops of opposite colors. I don't think a win for White is clear cut from this time on.
 [ b4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N b d2 ] , [ a6 ]  Important to prevent the white B from changing the point of attack
 [ K x f7 ] , [ R x d7 ]  The point of my temporary bishop sacrifice. The rook cannot be recaptured by the black Knight as it is pinned.
 [ g6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ g3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B g2 ]  [ O-O ] , [ O-O ]  Both sides have completed kingside development almost symmetrically the only difference is that White has advanced his f4-pawn early signifying that he wants a space advantage on the kingside. I should look for a plan on the queenside. Here my idea was to place my pawns along the f8-[ a3 ] diagonal to strengthen my fianchettoed bishop and undermine White's [ b2 ] pawn. But that is a long-term plan so I need to complete development and prepare to advance those pawns
 [ R c7 ] , [ Q b5 ]  protecting against an assault on b7. Maybe I can hold out.
 [ d x c6 ] , [ f3 ]  And now the pinned knight must fall.
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ h6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ Q x d4 ]  [ b6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ O-O-O ] , [ B c5 ]  i know my queen is under attack and will be a main focus for his army while out in the middle of things but i do believe i have a much better position. especially after o-o-o; his forces are pointed toward the kings side of the board. My forces are attacking the middle and kingside. He should castle queenside to equalize.
 [ N b3 ]  [ R x c2 ]  [ Q x c2 ] , [ Q b6 ]  Threatening ...[ Q x e3 + ] but this is easily thwarted. Black might have considered a Q exchange here (21...[ Q c7 ] 22.[ Q x c7 + ] Kxc7) with the idea of reducing White's tactical chances. That would have added value to his central pawns.
 [ a x b5 ] , [ a x b5 ]  The pin will win a bishop.
 [ d4 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ d x c5 ]  [ B x b2 ]  [ R b1 ] , [ B a3 ]  I think nothing can save c pawn now.
 [ Q x d4 ]  [ N f4 ] , [ N c3 ]  !!
 [ Q x e2 + ] , [ N x e2 ]  Forced.
 [ K b6 ]  [ B e3 + ]  [ K a5 ]  [ B x c8 ] , [ R x c8 ]  Material is even but White has two deadly passed Pawns on the K-side.
 [ B x g6 ]  [ f x g6 ]  [ Q d3 ] , [ R e5 ]  An awful mistake. Better was f5; that way I wouldn't have lost my kingside pawns. However this was the start of my successful attack.
 [ c x b3 ] , [ d5 ]  ! - Black rips open the center in thematic fashion activating his [ b7 ] bishop and creating strong pressure on [ e4 ] and d5. This is especially effective given the laziness of White's rooks and the wayward queen on h6; White's heavy pieces play no role in immediate central affairs.
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ d3 ] , [ B d6 ]  This is a little unusual for a closed Sicilian since the bishop will "bite on granite" with the white fianchetto.
 [ b x a6 ]  [ R b1 ]  [ O-O ]  [ R b6 ]  [ R a8 ]  [ B b4 ]  [ R d1 ]  [ K e2 ]  [ R g1 ]  [ B c5 ] , [ R g2 + ]  If 34. [ B f2 ] [ B d4 ] 35. [ R b7 ] [ B x f2 ] 36. [ K f3 ] (36. [ N x f2 ] Rxg3) 36... [ R h2 ] 37. [ N x f2 ] [ h5 ] (37... [ R c8 ] 38. [ N e4 ] [ R a2 ] 39. [ N d6 ] Rf8).
 [ K d7 ]  [ B e6 + ]  [ K c6 ]  [ B x g4 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ N e6 ] , [ Q g8 ]  All standard moves in this tourney.
 [ a3 ]  [ f6 ]  [ N e2 ]  [ Q b7 ]  [ N g3 ]  [ Q a7 ]  [ R a c1 ]  [ R e c8 ] , [ R f d1 ]  22. Rfd1! - here it looks as though white can open some lines here to his advantage. I did analyse that I would be a pawn down in a wretched position. I was seriously considering waving the white flag. Had it been an Expert or dmaestro I probably would have but wait my opponent has a 1300 rating. I will see what he does on his next move before I make any decisions. I play [ B e6 ] and say my prayers.
 [ Q d8 ]  [ Q b1 + ]  [ B f1 ]  [ e x f4 ] , [ g x f4 ]  Here Black's best move is ... [ N f6 ] intending ... [ Q g6 + ]  [ Q h8 + ]  [ K g6 ] , [ B f8 ]  ... [ Q f6 ] here would allowed a perpetual with [ B d3 + ] [ B c4 + ] [ B d3 + ] ...
 [ B b5 + ]  [ B d7 ]  [ a4 ]  [ c6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ f5 ]  [ e x f5 ]  [ B x f5 ]  [ d3 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ h6 ]  [ B h4 ]  [ g5 ]  [ B g3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ B b3 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ Q c3 ] , [ d4 ]  This just pushes the queen. I like P[ a5 ] personally. 14. BxP[ e5 ] NxB. 15. NxN[ e5 ] Bb4. This pins the white queen with the bishop protected by Pa5.
 [ B x d3 ]  [ c x d3 ]  [ Q x g2 ]  [ O-O-O ]  [ N a6 ] , [ Q e5 ]  White has a clear lead in development. I kept waiting for the other shoe to fall.
 [ Q e4 + ]  [ Q x e4 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ K f2 ]  [ K f6 ]  [ K e3 ]  [ K f5 ]  [ d5 ]  [ b4 ]  [ K d4 ]  [ a5 ]  [ K c5 ]  [ e3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ e2 ]  [ d7 ]  [ e1 = Q ]  [ d8 = Q ]  [ Q e6 ]  [ Q x a5 ]  [ Q e7 + ]  [ K c4 + ]  [ K x f4 ]  [ Q x b4 ] , [ Q e2 + ]  White has restored material equality and now the endless checks will lead to the draw.
 [ f x e4 ] , [ R x h3 + ]  and [ h3 ] also falls with tempo
 [ R f e1 ]  [ N c8 ]  [ Q d4 ] , [ K h6 ]  Black running out of ideas doesn't like [ e6 ] but B[ e6 ] better prevents as the consequences of [ K h6 ] are very dangerous.
 [ K g7 ] , [ Q x d5 ]  I overlooked this move. Now the game is lost for black for there is very little probablility that black does a mistake.
 [ R x c1 ] , [ R x c1 + ]  Why not
 [ g4 ] , [ N e4 ]  Joining the fray.
 [ R x e2 ]  [ R x e2 ] , [ g6 ]  Perhaps black wanted to avoid the variation: 23... [ N x g3 ] 24. [ N x g3 ] [ Q x g3 ] 25. [ N c6 ] [ R f8 ] 26. [ d6 ] [ N e6 ] 27. [ d7 ] [ h6 ] 28. Rxe6! [ f x e6 ] 29. [ d8 = Q ] [ R x d8 ] 30. [ R x d8 + ] +/=
 [ b x c3 ] , [ B c5 ]  Objective partially achieved though white declined to play 9. [ N x c3 ] as I had hoped he would. Now white has doubled isolated pawns on the half-open c-file ripe for the picking and his isolated a-pawn is only slightly less attainable. Second addition to the pile.
 [ g x f6 ] , [ N c3 ]  other knight comes out
 [ e x f3 ]  [ N x f3 ]  [ Q d8 ]  [ R e1 ] , [ a4 ]  Time to start pushing that pawn for promotion.
 [ N e7 ]  [ B h3 + ]  [ f5 ]  [ O-O ]  [ R x a3 ]  [ R b1 ]  [ b5 ] , [ R c2 ]  [ R f4 ] [ R b2 ] [ N c2 ] [ N d5 ] [ R x f5 ] [ B d4 + ] would have save a lot of damage...
 [ b4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N b3 ]  [ N x f3 ]  [ g x f3 ] , [ B e5 ]  Going after bigger steaks. Not a strip steak not a T-bone but a Porterhouse nice and juicy.
 [ N x c5 ]  [ N x c5 ]  [ e3 ]  [ R a d8 ]  [ d4 ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ N a6 ] , [ c5 ]  At least I am playing well in "bail-out mode" ... This move helps to break up Black’s pawn structure. The position is starting to turn drawish but there are some pitfalls for both sides to avoid.
 [ K c2 ] , [ Q x h1 ]  With that being said I would resign right here. In fact I might have even done so after 16...[ N x d1 + ] although with the material and against someone of near equal strength I'd feel that there was something worth playing for. But after getting his N+R right after I'd feel differently. However Henry is not going to resign at all.
 [ N x c8 ] , [ e4 ]  ?? With that being said I help him out a little more since that's what training is about. So I said However I still think that giving advice is a good idea as that's what here for. With that being said almost any other move was better then this. The reason being was that your e pawn protected the Rook. By playing this I take it. After this however I don't say anything else until after the game. That's because with this blunder Mike does not have any more good moves left. I also want him to realize (at his own accord without me getting involved) that the position is hopelessly lost with no counterplay. In seeing this he will at some point resign without feeling rushed into doing so which is how I want it to be.
 [ B x b4 ] , [ B x b4 ]  bringing the DSB in the game
 [ d x e5 ] , [ N e4 ]  I believe this is known as the Fajarowicz Variation.
 [ Q d8 ] , [ B x f6 ]  Worth the think: 14.[ B b5 ] [ b x c3 ] 15.[ B x c6 ] cxb2! 16.[ R b1 ] (White has no appetite for 16.[ B x a8 ] because it invites 16...bxa1=Q! when black injects panic into the white position) and white gets at least a file for the diagonal.
 [ Q b1 ]  [ O-O-O ]  [ Q b5 ]  [ Q x b5 ] , [ c x b5 ]  weakening control over [ d5 ] but resolving a pawn issue
 [ N d5 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ B x d5 ] , [ c x d5 ]  I liked [ B x d6 ] a bit better but black is starting to falter in either case
 [ g4 ]  [ e1 = Q + ]  [ B x e1 ] , [ N x e1 ]  Here I thought I'd be totally winning but the position is still complicated. I have two extra pieces but now White has three extra pawns and pawns increase in value during the endgame. This is hard but two pieces should be enough to beat White's three pawns.
 [ b5 ] , [ Q x c3 ]  But it's too little too late.
 [ Q e8 ]  [ N e3 ]  [ Q a4 ]  [ Q a2 ] , [ N x g3 ]  24... P-[ K N4 ] wins more quickly but Black does not wish to allow counterplay by 25 PxP.
 [ Q e2 ]  [ Q g6 ]  [ R f1 ] , [ B f6 ]  This actually a decent move! But it doesn't matter.....
 [ f x e5 ] , [ B x d5 ]  Black should watch out for BxP[ f7 ] which forks the rooks.
 [ K x f5 ]  [ K g3 ] , [ K g5 ]  At this point a draw was agreed upon. Even with the h-pawn he simply moves his King to [ h1 ] and blocks my promotion. As I wish to catch some sleep I don't want to delay this any further. I found this game to be quite interesting and would welcome all your comments.
 [ B d3 ] , [ b5 ]  With Joanne having a K-side spatial advantage I need to create some for myself on the other flank.
 [ e4 ] , [ e5 ]  the open games.
 [ Q x d1 + ]  [ K h2 ]  [ h x g3 + ] , [ K x g3 ]  so let us consider the action now. My two last pawns are globally protected. I am pretty sure I can assure the draw without a problem. Hiw own pawns are unprotected and far from each other. Hiw knights is poorly placed and under threat. Black has to solve many problems at once.
 [ Q x d6 ] , [ Q x d6 ]  Forced.
 [ Q c7 ]  [ Q x c7 ]  [ R x c7 ] , [ h6 ]  Black must avoid [ N g5 ] therfore he loses a pawn .
 [ N x e2 + ]  [ B x e2 ] , [ B a4 ]  Adding pressure to the [ c2 ] and [ d1 ] squares. This obviously protects the pawn. But I say obviously because it's not that obvious. Although I didn't know the term at the time the idea being here is overload which is adding the defender. So in addition the way to putting pressure on those squares is with defenders. BTW I bring up that term because Susan said that it's important to know terms that I once was not familar with until recently. One of them being overload which I learned from a different annotator.
 [ Q c2 ]  [ B b7 ] , [ N b d2 ]  Accepted. Now he has to take it and I don't bother at all to lose my inactive N.
 [ R d8 ] , [ B d3 ]  the bishop is pretty strong here because now he also has the b1-[ h7 ] diagonal.Also the queen can go to [ e2 ] forming a battery on the f1-[ a6 ] diagonal.
 [ c5 ]  [ B g2 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ R d1 ]  [ B c6 ]  [ N a2 ]  [ B c7 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ b6 ]  [ N a c3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ B x h2 ] , [ f4 ]  Creating trap for bishop.
 [ R b4 ]  [ a5 ]  [ R b2 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ e x f4 ]  [ g x f4 ]  [ K h2 ]  [ R x f1 ]  [ d5 ] , [ e3 ]  this pawn will be promotionated or changed for the rook. White resign
 [ a x b4 ]  [ a x b4 ] , [ h6 ]  The gift of a waiting move.
 [ N x h2 ]  [ B h3 ]  [ R g7 ] , [ B d6 ]  Here black actually should have played ka6. The only move to save the game
 [ B g6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ h4 ]  [ h6 ]  [ h5 ]  [ B h7 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N d7 ] , [ b3 ]  I don't know what the fianchetto was about. White would do better with his bishop along the c1-[ h6 ] diagonal for the eventual [ g5 ] push.
 [ Q d6 ] , [ R a d1 ]  Very dangerous move! B[ x R e5 ] discovers attack on my Q. This is exactly why I wanted Q out of that side of the board few moves back.
 [ Q c5 ]  [ b4 ]  [ Q d4 ] , [ B e5 ]  11. [ B e5 ] - nice neat bishop fork!
 [ R x f4 ] , [ R x e7 ]  We are one move from Black's error.
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ f3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ B f4 ] , [ B b4 + ]  [ N f6 ] is a pretty strong move for black in the Queen's Pawn opening. [ B b4 ] forces white to move P[ c3 ] which white wants to do anyway and then black must withdraw. The upshot is that white develops his position while black moves the same piece a couple of times.
 [ N x e4 ]  [ g5 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ b6 ]  [ a3 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ a4 ] , [ N x e5 ]  By this stage I realized that the only thing to do was to stay even and take advantage of little mistakes by capturing more pawns since major pieces seem to be one for one
 [ K f8 ] , [ R g3 ]  ...and line up the rook again...
 [ K h2 ] , [ R e8 ]  I felt this was a prudent move didn't fancy leaving my King without any protection at all...notice [ f6 ] is still safe for this move...
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ] , [ c4 ]  The Queen's Gambit my favourite opening.
 [ R c8 ]  [ N d2 ] , [ R c6 ]  Rc3! was much stronger.
 [ B d2 ] , [ N d7 ]  This Knight is surprisingly strong here. It's not going to lead any mating attacks right away but it controls the center and allows Black to play ...[ c5 ] or ...[ e5 ] later. Coupled with a Knight on [ f6 ] Black has a strong grip on the center.
 [ B x d6 ] , [ Q x d6 ]  so i win a pawn and the piece advantage lessens... positional advantage still strong for white.
 [ R a d1 ] , [ a5 ]  I got lured into positional thinking ...completely dreaming. Though strategically desireable this blunderes away my d-pawn.
 [ c6 ] , [ R e1 ]  ?! As Tartakower said obvious therefore dubious. It prepares [ e4 ] of course but the downside is that black can now play ...[ b5 ] immediately with counterplay whereas the most critical test 10. [ Q d3 ] doesn't without additional preparation (10. ...Rb8).
 [ R g7 ] , [ a4 ]  My poor pawns on [ a4 ] and [ b5 ] go no further...where did I go wrong?
 [ N f6 ] , [ B g2 ]  Standard move in polar bear system.
 [ K g7 ] , [ Q h8 + ]  Another check
 [ B x f7 + ]  [ K x f7 ]  [ Q h5 + ] , [ K e6 ]  This is a terrible move. I get a tempo here and might get a checkmate if everything goes well for me. Better was [ g6 ] [ Q d5 + ] d6. This gets a positional advantage for black.
 [ N f3 ] , [ e5 ]  I'll be able to throw in the Q's exchange... maybe just a plain mistake.
 [ K g8 ] , [ N x e6 ]  ??
 [ Q x c2 ] , [ Q x g4 ]  greed before the fall: Black is rapidly losing the material advantage; the Black Queen is still by itself while White is developing...
 [ R f h1 ] , [ R x g4 ]  24. ..... [ R x g4 ] - nacht. Suddenly there is a huge drop in temperature and a dark dark shadow around the WK. Is that The Beast from The East? Maybe it is that Siberian wind chiller killer that descended on the British Isles late on in February/early March but maybe it is the Chessic Grim Reaper Old Matey who is avidly eyeing up g2.
 [ O-O ] , [ B e2 ]  white is slightly ahead in development so next move for black is critical
 [ d4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ e3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ f4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N d2 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N g f3 ]  [ c5 ]  [ c3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ c4 ]  [ B c2 ] , [ N g4 ]  At this point the engines suggest [ B x h7 ] a classic sacrifice.
 [ N x e4 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ B x e4 ]  [ R b8 ] , [ N d2 ]  It's hard to believe we're 21 moves into the game and my Rs are still not linked.
 [ N c6 ]  [ N f1 ]  [ a5 ]  [ N g3 ]  [ Q b6 ]  [ B e3 ] , [ N a7 ]  ?! This Knight is in the mood for exotic travel in this game see a few of the chess board's less well-trodden corners! The computer recommends 17 .. [ h5 ] 18 [ h4 ] [ R c8 ] 19 [ N g5 ] [ B x g5 ] 20 [ h x g5 ] [ g6 ] 21 [ R c1 ] [ B a6 ] with White retaining an advantage
 [ N c3 ] , [ Q x d2 ]  21. .... [ Q x [ d2 ] ] - Michael saves his knight but I snaffle up the [ d2 ] pawn. Now the knight on [ c3 ] and the [ f4 ] pawn are under fire another fork.
 [ K h2 ]  [ Q f6 ] , [ c3 ]  "b2" pawn for free in order to single his rooks
 [ N c3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ e4 ]  [ g6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ f4 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N f3 ] , [ N b d7 ]  Balck wants to prevent [ e5 ] but this move is maybe a mistake. Better was Bg4.
 [ B d2 ]  [ Q a4 ]  [ Q b1 ]  [ c4 ]  [ N e2 ] , [ N c6 ]  Notice how effectively this knight does the work as Lasker would say of keeping her queen boxed in or obstructed on the queenside since it prevents retreat along the a4-[ e8 ] diagonal...
 [ K c2 ]  [ B x d6 ]  [ B e5 ]  [ K e6 ] , [ R x d6 + ]  Black moving King away from line of fire but White's pawns look alot better. And wants to force some more exchanges
 [ K b3 ]  [ N d1 ]  [ N h3 ]  [ N e3 ]  [ g3 ] , [ N x f1 ]  Exchanging to exploit black's material lead.
 [ f1 = Q + ]  [ K x f1 ] , [ K x f3 ]  Now I have the opposition and I win. If it was my turn to move in this position then White can hold a draw by shifting his king on [ [ e2 ] ] and [ e1 ] and then moving two squares above me whenever my king goes to the same rank as the pawn and [ [ e2 ] ] K[ e1 ] is also a draw since leaving the pawn defended is stalemate but since it's White's turn here he can't hold a draw since I have the opposition and I can force promotion
 [ f x g4 ] , [ N x g4 ]  The critical position. I have 2 pawns for the piece as well as a great pawn chain and I am now ready to exchange off White's dear [ e3 ] bishop. Plus development is extremely easy and soon enough my attack will hopefully run as a smooth engine.
 [ R x g7 ] , [ R x g7 + ]  Killing two birds with one stone: removing defenders of the king to open lines for attack and trading pieces to get closer to a won endgame.
 [ a4 ]  [ N c1 ]  [ e x f4 ] , [ B x f4 ]  White's opening the f-file hardly did anything for him. His isolated pawn is much weaker than mine and he has wasted a lot of movevs. Here I was considering [ [ a3 ] ] or b3. I wasn't comfortable after [ [ a3 ] ] because I don't think I'm in a position to take advantage of the dark square weakness i thought [ b3 ] was much sharper and White might accept the pawn sacrifice but now that I analyse the game in-depth I don't think the sacrifice would have worked out very well for me. But luckily White did not accept it.
 [ d x e5 ]  [ R x e5 ]  [ R e3 x e5 ] , [ N x e5 ]  18. ....... [ N x e5 ] - I feel a little better after getting rid of my weakie e pawn but my opponent has a shock in store for me.
 [ B x b5 ] , [ B x b5 + ]  then again Black can say bye-bye to any chances of castling (though I don't see how that could help him in any way here)
 [ Q g6 ] , [ Q d2 ]  ? The Knight belongs here. White wants to trap your Queen which is wishful thinking.
 [ R g7 ] , [ B g5 + ]  (bigglestw) Technically you don't really get to save your rook. One way or another it'll go. (Adui) This appears to be a case of tunnel vision he forgot about my bishop being able to block his check! Lets see if he sacrifices it or saves it and gives the other (two)
 [ Q h5 ]  [ R f5 ]  [ Q e2 ] , [ e x f4 ]  Cannot take with e-pawn because it's pinned...Instead I want to get rid of the threats to my King.
 [ Q d3 + ]  [ R e3 ]  [ Q x b3 ]  [ R x b3 ] , [ N d7 ]  Now I win [ c7 ] one way or another. But which is the best? Hard to say with less than a minute. NxN and after black retakes either with the K or the R white ends up winning f7.
 [ B g4 ] , [ d3 ]  There is relatively little white can do to stop them..
 [ Q d7 ] , [ N h4 ]  The [ f5 ] square is weak so white quickly decides to plant a strong knight there with strong threats against the king.
 [ b4 ] , [ B g4 ]  Ta-da! A particular favorite of mine
 [ N c3 ] , [ B e6 ]  If black castles white can attack [ d5 ]  [ N e4 ] , [ B e7 ]  Obviously black wanted to keep bishop but this move means he can only defend [ f4 ] using extreme measures
 [ K h8 ] , [ Q x f6 # ]  Sigh. Please comment and rate and good job to my opponent.
 [ Q d8 ]  [ f4 ]  [ a6 ] , [ N a3 ]  The knight should drop back to [ c3 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ N e2 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ N c4 ]  [ B c7 ]  [ f x e5 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ N e3 ] , [ B h5 ]  White is going to find it hard to castle and complete development.
 [ R d c8 ] , [ Q b3 ]  again the motivation for this is questionable - white can't protect [ a4 ] fast enough because of the black bishop controlling [ b2 ] and a3. similarly due to the finachetto settup there is no chance of a back rank mate - simplification cannot be good for white here as he has inferior pawn structure and (at best) this is what this move leads to. so blacks plan of action is clear
 [ Q x h7 + ]  [ K f8 ] , [ R f1 ]  Preventing the capture at e5. If [ B x e5 ] then after [ f x e5 ] check White wins the [ g7 ] pawn and the game.
 [ e x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ N c3 ]  A position not usually seen in competitive play.
 [ K c5 ]  [ N x e7 ] , [ b6 ]  White has a high chance of getting his pawn on [ b6 ] across....unless I do something!
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ] , [ N c3 ]  Supports the center but blocks the c P
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ a6 ]  [ B a4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B e7 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ b5 ]  [ B b3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ c3 ] , [ d5 ]  The starting point.
 [ Q x f7 + ]  [ K h8 ] , [ Q x h7 # ]  Right after this game is when I used the fen for right after 23.[ N c7 ] and boiled it down to the moral of the story. So I said you played very well in our game. Your decisive mistake was overlooking a pin. As you were down two pawns. But had you played ...[ Q c8 ] my N would've been tied down with the pin. At that point I wouldn't have been able to take your Rook. So what you remember for the future is how powerful the pins can be. Sometimes they're not a big deal. Or another way of looking at it is just a nuicanse. But other times they can be very dangerous so you want to ask yourself when it's serious or not. If you're not sure it's better to assume that the pins can do a lot because that is true more often then not.
 [ R c5 + ]  [ K b1 ]  [ R c6 ]  [ K x a2 ] , [ R a6 ]  SO it was a draw position.
 [ K c6 ]  [ B d4 ]  [ K d5 ]  [ B a1 ] , [ K c4 ]  and he resigned becuase he can't stop me moving the bishop to [ c3 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ b6 ]  2. ..... b6!? - Freddy decided to gambit a pawn. It does open lines for his lsb to bear down on my [ e4 ] pawn however so I must watch out here.
 [ B a3 ] , [ R d2 ]  checking will give White a temporary sense of power but it really just lets my king get a free move.
 [ c x b6 ] , [ Q e2 ]  Protecting both of my liabilities.
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ a6 ] , [ B c4 ]  This was fischer's usual move and for me it is the best
 [ Q x d6 ] , [ e3 ]  Dismantling the White castle.
 [ B f1 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ N b6 ] , [ B c6 ]  Looks like a strongpoint but at this stage the B is required for more active play than statically waiting for his pawns to catch up.
 [ N x f6 + ]  [ g x f6 ]  [ R g3 + ]  [ B g7 ] , [ Q g4 ]  ...[ K f8 ] 26.[ Q x g7 + ] [ K e7 ] 29.[ B x f6 + ] and Black's queen drops. black resigns.
 [ c4 ] , [ g6 ]  Bobotsov lays claim to the center as Tal preps his bishop's fianchetto along the h8-[ a1 ] diagonal.
 [ Q x c5 ] , [ O-O ]  I saw his queen was blocked by the pawn and at this point he had no material so the open king side was no longer a worry of mine. I castled and at this point he resigned. I enjoy looking over this game not because it was a big win (in material) but because it shows that staying really basic in your moves and trying to stick to sound principles can deliver big defeats. Look at the difference in pawn structures here...
 [ R c5 + ] , [ K d7 ]  It's a war of attrition at this point
 [ B b6 ]  [ Q e2 ] , [ R a c8 ]  A invisible attack on my c4-pawn.
 [ N x e2 ]  [ R x e2 ] , [ N x h4 ]  only 1 point behind but...
 [ R e2 ] , [ B b7 ]  I had some odd plan of playing the queen to [ c6 ] to share the diagonal with the LSB aimed at [ g2 ] then trying to clear away the white pieces. I probably should have just kept it simple and won the pawn on e4.
 [ c6 ] , [ B e2 ]  I expected [ B a4 ] followed by [ d3 ] to regain development
 [ d x e5 ] , [ N d b4 ]  ?? Advancing into enemy territory with reckless abandon..
 [ K c3 ] , [ R x a2 ]  and I get three pawns and the rook for my two minor pieces
 [ N x c5 ]  [ R x a2 ]  [ N e7 ]  [ c4 ] , [ f5 ]  Setting up my knight and opening a file for my rook after castling.
 [ N f6 ]  [ O-O ] , [ b4 ]  A reasonably well orchestrated attack on White's King's pawn although not followed through particularly well.
 [ B d1 ]  [ R g5 + ]  [ K h2 ] , [ Q g2 # ]  
 [ N g5 ] , [ f6 ]  too late!
 [ N c6 ] , [ N g e2 ]  6....[ N c6 ] is a more dymanic way of meeting White's set-up compared with the formations chosen in Charles Higgie vs. Kevin Short or Charles Higgie vs. Mike Williams (see previous annotations). Now I remember at University a player called Rod Newbury playing this against me. I was desparately thinking back to over 30 years ago! I had memories of playing [ [ d5 ] ] in this position and losing quickly although now I see in the opening databases [ [ d5 ] ] is playable although what I play here is more popular and has a higer ratings.
 [ N f3 ]  [ d5 ] , [ c x d5 ]  At this point he accurately said "Pawn trade" So my response was Yes. And it is a known variation. It's called the exchange variation and unlike most variaitons they come in different shapes and forms. Exchange variations=a variation that involves a number of exchanges. And he said "Ok."
 [ K d1 ] , [ R c3 ]  If 27. [ R c1 ] [ R x c1 + ] 28. [ K x c1 ] [ K [ f6 ] ] and Black wins by invading with his King. 29. [ K d1 ] [ K f5 ] 30. [ K e2 ] [ B b6 ] 31. [ N f3 ] [ f6 ] 32. [ K e3 ] [ K g4 ] 33. [ K f2 ] [ K h3 ] 34. [ K g1 ] [ h6 ] 35. [ K h1 ] [ g5 ] 36. fx[ g5 ] hxg5.
 [ B x e7 ]  [ N x e7 ] , [ Q e5 ]  White has emerged from the opening with a clear advantage of space. So here is what I have learned from Alekine and Karpov. 1) bind/limit- force your opponent into a never ending cramped position. Forcing your opponent to make further weaknesses to create room to move. 2) Bind some more- use your superior piece position to force your opponent to sacrifice material in order stay alive 3) open lines to the kings with pawn breaks.
 [ e6 ] , [ d3 ]  nivk moving pawns one space at a time
 [ R h7 ] , [ B d3 ]  Cornering in the rook.
 [ N x c2 + ] , [ K d1 ]  Black cannot take the rook or 14. [ B x d5 ] [ Q x d5 ] and black loses a queen or is mated.
 [ B d5 ]  [ Q e7 ]  [ a4 ]  [ f5 ]  [ Q c3 + ] , [ Q e5 ]  Get the Q's off the board less complex.
 [ d x e6 ] , [ N x c4 ]  Now this is seems a grave mistake although 12...dxe; 13.Qxd8+; KxQ 14. [ N g5 ] might look like an annoying thing for black it has already gained a bishop and about to get a free rook. Nothing can save white here.
 [ B d5 ]  [ Q f5 ] , [ R e5 ]  Keres tries to drive off Fischer's attack.
 [ N c3 ] , [ a6 ]  Overprotective I would say...
 [ B b7 ]  [ K f5 ] , [ B a8 ]  Another move the computer analysis didn't like which suggests [ R d2 ] threatening the f pawn again. The king is quite committed to going forward now so white would not have attempted to hold the f-pawn but the loss of the f pawn may have made the rest of the game trickier.
 [ h5 ]  [ g3 ] , [ f4 ]  A blunder. The same "pinned-pawn" tactic that my opponent didn't see earlier now arises.
 [ K f7 ]  [ R a c2 ]  [ K g8 ] , [ N a3 ]  Welcoming the exchange. I can come out even and still own the c file.
 [ N f3 ]  [ N e3 ]  [ N e1 ]  [ R b2 ] , [ R a3 ]  I am pretty much forced to defend from my opponent's powerful attack. There is simply no good move for me to salvage the situation. Meaning? More bloodshed.
 [ R e4 + ]  [ K f6 ]  [ R d4 ]  [ R e8 + ]  [ K f3 ] , [ R e6 ]  Wow! The rush is over (for a while at least!) and we both took a long breath of relief. The position is totally equal again and we were on suddend death now. 1 hour per side to finish the game. We also were allowed now to offer a draw since we had reached time control at move 40 but neither of us was thinking about chicken out that easily. I only offer draws when there's nothing else to fight for. Yes the position is equal but just as equal as it is at move zero so why don't I offer a draw at move zero? Well because that's why we play the game right? All right then...let's keep fighting!
 [ R a2 ]  [ R b8 + ]  [ K a4 ]  [ Q x a2 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ Q c4 + ]  [ K a5 ] , [ Q b5 # ]  This game was very fun to play and I hope it was entertaining to watch. It should serve as an example to new players to protect your K at all costs.
 [ c x b4 ]  [ K g1 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c5 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ N a6 ]  [ f5 ]  [ K f1 ]  [ K f7 ]  [ K e2 ]  [ K e6 ]  [ K d3 ]  [ K d6 ] , [ K d4 ]  The King appeared in the center. Can white force black to lose the b pawn?
 [ N c6 ]  [ g5 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ h4 ]  [ N b6 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ B x b6 ]  [ Q x b6 ] , [ N d5 ]  Here I had a decision. I ALMOST took the knight with my bishop but then I thought "Why should I trade my strongest bishop for 1 of his knights. I'd rather he takes my weak black square bishop instead."
 [ N g f3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ] , [ b5 ]  This is undoubtedly a mistake as a waste of time.
 [ f5 ] , [ R a b8 ]  I choose not to take and to prepare my attack (plan : occupy the open file - done double the rooks and set one on the first line) estimating that it will take at least 4 moves to white to build a dangerous attacking possibility against the black king and I'll get a mating menace in 3 moves if white doesn't defend.
 [ c4 ] , [ R e3 e7 + ]  I resigned at this point as I will drop the Knight and all my Queenside pawns soon. 29. ... [ R x e7 ] 30. [ R x e7 ] [ K f8 ] 31. [ R x b7 ] with more pawns to fall quickly. My opponent moved boldly and got his pieces working together while mine were trapped in bad positions and unable to help with the eventual finishing attack.
 [ b6 ]  [ f3 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ e4 ]  [ B g6 ] , [ B g5 ]  Now white beginnings attack on blacks king
 [ K a8 ] , [ N x c8 ]  Eliminating Black's remnants and threatens mate in one.
 [ K c7 ] , [ f4 ]  To protect the knight and and hopefully open up the f file as well.
 [ K f1 ] , [ N c3 + ]  And closes....
 [ K f2 ]  [ b4 ] , [ N x e2 ]  now all the pieces go
 [ K c5 ]  [ g x h4 ]  [ g x h4 ] , [ K g6 ]  Black is now set up to break the king through and have queening threats on both sides of the board. This looks like a winning position here.
 [ g4 ] , [ h x g4 + ]  10. ..... [ h x g4 + ] - deadly double check.
 [ B x g4 ] , [ Q x g4 ]  And I gain back the three-point advantage I lost earlier.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ B c4 ]  These opening moves are book moves of Guico Piano.
 [ Q b3 ] , [ R f8 ]  And now black has wasted two tempi for nothing. White's queen defends [ h3 ] now too.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ N d7 ] , [ B c4 ]  This time Pawnbandit chooses the strongest line against the Hanham Phillidor.
 [ f6 ] , [ e x f6 ]  this is a fun aspect of the pawn game..pushing pawns to the end...
 [ Q x d4 ] , [ B h3 ]  I think that Tom is worried about the same. So I decided to take his B instead.
 [ R x c7 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ e4 ]  [ R d7 ] , [ R c2 ]  This might not have been best either. [ R x d7 ] [ N x d7 ] [ R c3 ] would have seized the file anyway.
 [ N x c7 ] , [ B x h3 ]  Threatens mate on g2.
 [ B d7 ]  [ O-O-O ]  [ R c8 ] , [ B b3 ]  This is still by the book
 [ K g8 ] , [ R g3 + ]  .
 [ N x d6 + ] , [ B x d6 ]  Why doesn't Black take the rook? I assume Windows Vista saw checkmate approaching after his king got stuck on the edge say after [ R b1 ] and [ Q a4 ] by White.
 [ h x g6 + ]  [ K x g6 ]  [ K e3 ] , [ R f3 + ]  Now I started to push his king to the last row and push for promotion myself.
 [ e5 ] , [ N d7 ]  This move is preferable to 11...[ N e8 ] as Black now has ...[ c5 ] in the cards. This move also forces 12. [ f4 ] locking up the center. Now Black's attack is faster.
 [ c6 ] , [ Q e2 ]  defending the e pawn and aiming at [ d5 ] with the eventuallity of a sacrifice to oblige the c pawn to move.
 [ N d2 ]  [ B x d5 ]  [ B x e3 ]  [ B x c6 ]  [ B x f4 ]  [ B x b7 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ B x a6 ]  [ N e4 ] , [ g4 ]  Brilliant sequence by Carlsen. He gave up a piece for a bunch of pawns hoping to simplify things to draw.
 [ B x c4 ] , [ d5 ]  ?? Allowing [ N c6 ] if not now in a near future. But what else? [ Q g5 ] is useless against f3.
 [ R a1 ] , [ d3 ]  jkarp: It looks like we're in a lot of trouble. So I'd be trying to figure out what to do with how dangerous Janet's passed pawn is. In this position I would answer by attacking the N with 50.[ R c8 ] and after the N retreats then I'd play 51.[ R a2 ] to stop the passed pawn from advancing any further. brigadecommander: you are not in a lot of trouble.With careful play it is a draw. archduke_piccolo: I reckon... ... we can hold. We might even have a slight edge. I suggest just keep pushing our passer: 50.[ [ a6 ] ] [ d2 ] 51.[ R d8 ] ... ANALYSIS of 51.a7: At this point we probably could play 51.[ [ [ [ a7 ] ] ] ] instead but then we would probably have to fight for the draw: 51.[ [ [ [ a7 ] ] ] ] Ra5! 52.[ R x a5 ] [ d1 = Q ] At this point Black is threatening checkmate by 53...Ne3ch 54.[ K h2 ] Ng4ch 55.[ K g2 ] Qe2ch etc. 53.[ R f8 ] stops the mate by covering [ [ f2 ] ] but Black at keeps alive an attack with the same kind of sequence. However after 53.[ R g8 ] Ne3ch 54.[ K h2 ] Ng4ch?? 55.[ R x [ g4 ] ] ... White wins. Nor will Black play 53...[ N a5 ] as 54.[ a8 = Q ] preserves for White some winning chances. So... 53...[ N b6 ] 54.[ a8 = Q ] [ N x a8 ] 55.R[ g x a8 ] ... Should give us a tenable end game. As a matter of interest if we were to trade off one of our rooks for Black's two pawns and bring our remaining rook to [ [ f2 ] ] assuming the BK stays where it is we should have a 'book' draw. 8 In the diagrammed position even though White is in check after [ K g1 ] the game is drawn. White's set-up is called a 'fortress' and Black hasn't the resources to break it down provided White is careful. So 51.[ [ [ [ a7 ] ] ] ] would be playable. 51...Ne3ch 52.[ K h3 ] [ R d5 ] 53.[ R x d5 ] [ N x d5 ] (not 53...exd5?? and White wins after 54.a7.) 54.[ [ [ [ a7 ] ] ] ] [ N c7 ] or [ N b6 ] At this point I think I would aim directly for the draw: 55.[ g4 ] hx[ g4 ] 56.Kx[ g4 ] [ K e3 ] 57.[ R d1 ] ... No pussyfooting around! 57...[ K e2 ] 58.[ R a1 ] ... (Actually 58.Rxd2ch will do: Black can't stop the WK reaching e5) 58... d1=Qch 59.[ R x d1 ] [ K x d1 ] 60.[ K f4 ] ... 61.[ K e5 ] ... 62.[ a8 = Q ] ... 63.[ K x e6 ] ... Dead game: insufficient material. nambam: i cannot make any sense ot of what is the real position. assumig it is whites move 50 i would play pa6. redfoxrising: We will play on starting p[ [ a6 ] ] and go for our draw as shown by Ion's analysis.
 [ N x c6 ]  [ b x c6 ]  [ e5 ] , [ N g8 ]  ? The tournament results suggest [ N g4 ] is the strongest continuation
 [ O-O ]  [ B g5 ] , [ h6 ]  Of course Black could not play ...P-[ Q N3 ] because of BxN followed by Q-K4.
 [ K b1 ]  [ Q f5 ] , [ Q c2 ]  22. [ Q c2 ] - this move appears to lose a pawn but it does not as you will soon see.
 [ R g1 ]  [ Q f6 ]  [ R a8 + ]  [ K g7 ]  [ R a4 ] , [ Q c3 ]  Accepting the exchange of Queens because I evaluated that the endgame with passive King and Rook was almost lost for White.
 [ B x h7 + ]  [ K h8 ]  [ Q x d6 ] , [ R x e3 + ]  At this point I realize I never castled but you never put enough pressure to make it necessary. See here that you put me in check but you only have the rook to attack with. I am attacking with 2 knights a bishop and a queen. Also see that the bishop next to your king is supported by the knight who is supported by the other knight who is supported by a pawn.
 [ K c4 ] , [ a6 ]  Again the defects in my opponent's position allow me to formulate clear and effective plans to further irritate the sore spots.
 [ c x d4 ]  [ B b4 + ]  [ B d2 ]  [ B x d2 + ] , [ Q x d2 ]  10. [ Q x d2 ] - bishop trade.
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ f6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ e3 ]  [ N e7 ] , [ N h4 ]  Tempting black to play [ g5 ] but [ Q h5 + ] [ N [ g6 ] ] [ N x [ g6 ] ] NxN allows the B to retire (note that black has no [ g6 ] anymore that's the key). Very wild game is obtained if black persists in the pin with [ K d7 ] instead.
 [ B d7 ]  [ d4 ]  [ e x d4 ] , [ c x d4 ]  White now has a very powerful Classical pawn centre and is preparing to thrust forwards and gain space with d5!
 [ Q x d6 ] , [ Q x d6 ]  ? Black was lost anyway but this just drops the exchange. After 21...[ R e8 ] 22. [ Q x f6 ] [ g x f6 ] 23. [ B h4 ] black's losing another pawn.
 [ c7 + ] , [ B d7 ]  Threatening Forgacs' Q. but the Hungarian master is unafraid.
 [ Q d2 ]  [ f4 ] , [ B e4 ]  Black's f-pawn move allows my bishop to threaten black's g pawn.
 [ a3 ]  [ a5 ]  [ c3 ]  [ c5 ]  [ K e3 ]  [ b4 ]  [ c x b4 ]  [ c x b4 ]  [ a x b4 ] , [ a x b4 ]  ...and white must resign since while stopping the b pawn I can take all his pawns. It is very rare for me to get such a "technical" victory with no sacrifices or big mistakes. This makes me a little proud of this game. :-)
 [ R x d1 + ]  [ Q x d1 ] , [ B x c2 ]  And he cannot take back the bishop because of the mate in e1! But he could play Nxb6+... anyway a piece less with no compensation (ALMOST no compensation) must have seemed a suffering after such a promising opening...
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ] , [ d4 ]  I have a sense of deja vu. We played this same opening a few weeks ago.
 [ d5 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ Q x d4 ]  [ d6 ]  [ B b5 + ]  [ B d7 ]  [ B x d7 + ]  [ Q x d7 ]  [ d x e6 ]  [ f x e6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ O-O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ e5 ]  [ N e8 ]  [ B x e7 ]  [ Q x e7 ] , [ f4 ]  So White begins the King side attack with Pawn-f4. This pawn will be marching up the file!
 [ R f e8 ]  [ R c7 ] , [ R a d8 ]  Now things are beginning to come back to me. However black's position is still ugly.
 [ Q f5 ]  [ e3 ] , [ N e4 ]  He is trading off one of the few developed pieces he has better would of been 6 ... [ d5 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ Q x e4 ]  [ B d3 ] , [ Q g4 ]  This is the 5th time he has had to move his Queen in the opening. It is ideal to move a piece just once during your development.
 [ N h5 ] , [ f5 ]  22. [ f5 ] - to avoid losing a pawn. At least immediately.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ B c4 ]  One of my favorite openings.
 [ h x g3 ]  [ R g8 x g3 ]  [ R e6 + ]  [ K d3 ]  [ e8 = Q ]  [ R g1 g2 + ]  [ K f1 ]  [ R g2 g1 + ]  [ K f2 ] , [ R g1 g2 + ]  Black has no more than a draw: as far as I can see; nonetheless White resigned: probably out of frustration; also his time was running on the last seconds...
 [ Q a8 ] , [ N x e7 + ]  Here I should have played 18. [ Q x e7 ] which threatens the knight at d7. If black moves the knight with 18. ... [ N f6 ] I would have 19 [ Q x c7 ] [ N x d5 ] 20. [ N e7 ] ! which wins the exchange. This all looks better than the move I played.
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ B c5 ] , [ O-O ]  Castle
 [ K x a5 ]  [ B c3 + ]  [ K a6 ] , [ N d4 ]  White must now be careful. If white allows me to get my rook on the b file then there are some mating threats that could arise.
 [ a5 ]  [ K f2 ]  [ a4 ]  [ b x a4 ]  [ b x a4 ]  [ N e3 ]  [ a3 ]  [ N c2 ]  [ a2 ] , [ N a1 ]  as such. If Black wants to win he'll have to come over himself to get rid of the knight...
 [ N f6 ] , [ R g1 ]  !Sacrifice #1 - Bye Bye Bishop. Safer plays included [ B a4 ] or [ B c4 ] but Anderssen had bigger plans.
 [ N f3 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ] , [ N c6 ]  Now the opening has turned into a kind of Sicilian.
 [ N f3 ] , [ Q e7 ]  A step ahead. Now [ Q e2 ] gives black just a painful defence.
 [ B b5 ] , [ K d7 ]  ...because of this. I can live with the pin with care.
 [ Q b5 + ]  [ K a7 ]  [ Q d7 + ]  [ K b6 ]  [ Q d8 + ]  [ K b7 ]  [ Q d7 + ] , [ N c7 ]  ...that's it. Now the WQ can't check me and W is forced to give me a tempo!
 [ N e6 + ]  [ K d6 ]  [ R x b7 ] , [ R h8 ]  Now I can no longer keep the threat of promotion I have to promote now
 [ R g5 ] , [ f6 ]  By not getting his rook in front of the pawn black gives his permission to white. Permission granted I gladly accept.
 [ g6 ]  [ O-O ] , [ B g7 ]  I immediately start thinking about trying to get rid of this fianchetto Bishop and eventually succeed
 [ Q d3 ] , [ Q b6 ]  The answer is this move as I plan to check on b2.
 [ K f3 ]  [ B g3 ]  [ g5 ]  [ K g7 ]  [ h6 + ]  [ K g6 ]  [ e5 ]  [ K x g5 ]  [ K e4 ] , [ K x h6 ]  A good even game which turned on one miscalculation in the endgame. Well played sir. A pleasure to play against a gentleman.
 [ g x f3 ] , [ R a b8 ]  [ R a d8 ] probably would likely have been better. Rook on center file exerts greater control over the battlefield.
 [ N x e2 + ] , [ K h1 ]  First I have to duck clear. Black's Knight is now stuck on [ K7 ] [if it moves I play R-[ K1 ] pinning the Q.]
 [ f x e6 ] , [ B g2 ]  Pathetic. 21. [ N e4 ] would have be nice but first the bishop must be moved to its only available square.
 [ N e7 ] , [ f4 ]  ? But not now. White should first play Nf5.
 [ K d1 ] , [ Q a1 + ]  Prevents the white queen getting into the fray. Whites best option now is probably [ K c2 ] which also limits his queen. [ K d2 ] leads to [ N c4 + ] which brings my knight and potentially by dsb into the assault
 [ c x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ e3 ]  [ N x c3 ]  [ b x c3 ]  [ e4 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ N x d4 ] , [ c x d4 ]  9. [ c x d4 ] - a lot has been happening over the past few moves - both sets of knights have been traded off and I have managed to weaken white's queenside pawns. Can I capitalise on this though? We shall see.
 [ B x d7 ]  [ R x f1 + ]  [ R x f1 ] , [ Q d8 ]  '??' - A move that loses quickly though White fails to exploit it fully.
 [ B d7 ]  [ B b3 ] , [ Q a5 ]  I have seen the arrival of the queen on the a5-square many times in Sicilians and then a contest on opposite wings has been put into order.
 [ R h2 ] , [ N x e4 ]  I expected him to retreat but not to h2...
 [ b4 ] , [ a5 ]  Constricting the knight's movement. I now has basically no good squares. Looking at this position the bishop on [ g7 ] looks quite poor staring at a pawn wall and now the knight on [ b8 ] has [ d7 ] and nothing else as it's future.
 [ N x g3 ] , [ h x g3 ]  This looks like the best move but I thought [ f x g3 ] was better. Even though it isolates White's e-pawn it gives White a strong open f-file and makes it harder for me to start a kingside storm.
 [ B x c5 ]  [ R x b5 ]  [ c x b5 ] , [ N b8 ]  I can't help thinking this is not the best square for the knight.
 [ d5 ]  [ f3 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ f x e4 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ B x e2 ] , [ N x e2 ]  good move ready to castle with your rook on a free file lack of developement though
 [ f x e5 ] , [ f x e5 ]  ? he should have done [ d x e5 ] here or Na5. Now with this open line I can do Bf7+.
 [ N c6 ]  [ a3 ] , [ N a5 ]  [ N a5 ] there is no way of getting him not to go on [ b3 ]  [ N g4 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ N x e3 + ]  [ Q x e3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ N h4 ]  with knight [ [ h4 ] ] im trying to get him to play [ g5 ] which he wont play but its a better place than [ f3 ] for my knight because [ [ h4 ] ] reches more towards the king
 [ N c3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ Q d5 ]  [ B a6 ]  [ O-O-O ] , [ N f6 ]  good developing with tempo
 [ B e6 ] , [ N d5 ]  Things get dicey here.
 [ c6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ B b3 ]  [ B c5 ] , [ N f3 ]  The game is equilibrate.
 [ R d2 ] , [ b3 ]  not quite what White was looking for...
 [ K f2 ] , [ g3 + ]  Forcing the King to the corner where it barricades in White's KR.
 [ h x g3 ] , [ N x b2 ]  here i'm up a piece in the endgame. i thought my opponent would probably resign but he didn't so it was time to test out my end-game technique. in this game i think my technique was pretty lousy. anywhere someone cares to offer advice i'll be glad to hear it. i think my trouble is thinking in working plans...
 [ K h1 ] , [ e x f3 ]  Now it's the pawn or the bishop.
 [ N f3 ] , [ Q a5 ]  Blunder. [ B c7 ] or [ B f6 ] was needed. The Analysis board and Flip were needed to avoid a blunder like this.
 [ c x d6 ] , [ a3 ]  a little air and trying to break that stagnant line up
 [ B c3 + ]  [ B f6 ] , [ Q g6 ]  Dont mind the bishop exchange for he has lost his h pawn. The defence of his king is crumbling
 [ N g4 ] , [ B x e7 ]  Exchanges which I needed as need queen to [ g5 ]  [ Q x e7 ] , [ N d2 ]  Was waiting for that to move!
 [ N x a5 ] , [ c x d6 ]  White situation is getting better : material equality white is more powerfull on the center both kings are safe (the white king is even a bit safer as black advanced 2 king pawn (g and h)
 [ B e2 ]  [ R g3 ] , [ g5 ]  Just to see what would he play. Everything so to open a column for my rooks.
 [ a5 ] , [ R b1 ]  42.Rb1! ... I thought this a very good move. I had hoped that if pawns were exchanges on the Q-side that at least the remaining two would be on adjacent files. This rook move squashes that idea. Naturally the rook exchange doesn't come into consideration.
 [ N c6 ]  [ d3 ] , [ a6 ]  I'm not sure about this move...it looks pretty pointless...
 [ K c7 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N b6 ] , [ B b3 ]  14. [ B b3 ] - white does not wish his powerful lsb to be exchanged.
 [ b x c6 ] , [ e5 ]  more than attack the bishop close [ f6 ] for the queen
 [ K f1 ]  [ N g6 ]  [ N d1 ] , [ N e5 ]  computer says this is an inaccuracy giving back the draw situation. He prefers Nf4. So did I: I expected [ N f4 ] from black and was relieved with this move.
 [ K x h3 ]  [ K b8 ]  [ K g4 ]  [ K c7 ]  [ K f5 ]  [ K b8 ]  [ K e6 ]  [ K c7 ]  [ K d5 ]  [ K c8 ]  [ K d6 ]  [ K d8 ] , [ B d7 ]  ....This is not a stalemate at all but rather zugzwang which will cost me two pawns and then allow white to win with his passed pawn. Not seeing that the blockade on [ b6 ] would obviously be lifted dragged the game out 15 moves after it was actually over.
 [ N f6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ B c5 ] , [ b3 ]  This was not a great move. Instead I should have played Nxe5. This way I would have gotten a free pawn.
 [ K a3 ]  [ Q c1 + ]  [ K a4 ] , [ b6 ]  Saving the b pawn.
 [ e4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ c4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B b4 ] , [ B d3 ]  The French Defense which I hate thoroughly. As noted by the way I handle this. I turn it into Queens Gambit with 4. c4...
 [ B e6 ]  [ b3 ]  [ R a d8 ]  [ N e2 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ] , [ B x d5 ]  19. ........ [ B x d5 ] - after a little bit of piece moving there is a pawn trade.
 [ N g4 ]  [ B g1 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ h3 ] , [ N h6 ]  Well that didn't help.
 [ B c2 ]  [ R e2 ]  [ B b1 ]  [ R g2 + ]  [ K h1 ]  [ R x b2 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ B g2 + ]  [ K g1 ]  [ g6 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ N x d3 ]  [ a4 ]  [ N x e1 ]  [ c4 ] , [ N x f3 # ]  Black wins. I hope you felt this game was interesting enough to look at and comment on. I apologise for my horrific blunder and yet I thank "whatever gods may be" for my eventual win. Again thanks for your comments!
 [ B f5 ]  [ f3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ h4 ] , [ Q b6 ]  I still don't know whites intention
 [ d5 ]  [ N b8 d7 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ N e5 ]  It's worth noting that on the next black move the c pawn cannot yet be taken([ Q [ a4 ] ] checks and attacks [ [ c4 ] ] if black tries to grab the pawn) but I was playing quickly and decided to protect it with the pawn and fianchetto my bishop. I'm sure there were more accurate moves than what I made. And goflb about the N defending A4 it goes without saying that ...Nx[ [ c4 ] ] Bx[ [ c4 ] ] Nx[ [ c4 ] ] leaves the [ a4 ] square undefended for [ Q [ a4 ] ] which results in black losing the minor piece this is why [ [ c4 ] ] cannot be taken.
 [ K x h2 ]  [ R x e4 ]  [ B x e4 ] , [ Q h4 + ]  It looks like a free bishop but it isn't. I think [ K f8 ] (which only appears to expose Ph7) would have worked great. [ Q h4 + ] could be saved for another turn though white is almost certain to answer with Re1.
 [ N d4 ] , [ N e5 ]  Obviously I don't want Black to put his knight on [ f3 ] forcing me to give up my queen. So instead I played the move that I could see would lead to my position being torn apart. Was that any better?
 [ B x d7 + ]  [ K x d7 ]  [ Q x d4 ]  [ R c8 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ N h6 ]  [ B x h6 ]  [ g x h6 ] , [ K e2 ]  I wonder why he doesn't just resign... he is down a queen and he is in time preassure.
 [ K f7 ] , [ Q a4 ]  27. [ Q a4 ] - Glenda can be a very sneaky stealthy queen at times. A lot of the time she is defending pieces hence her title Glenda the Defender but here she will soon be Glenda the Offender!
 [ Q f4 + ]  [ K g1 ] , [ f6 ]  The culprit move?
 [ Q f3 + ]  [ K g1 ]  [ Q f2 + ]  [ K h1 ] , [ Q x h2 # ]  Very well played by yodean. All thoughts/comments are appreciated.
 [ N g6 ] , [ Q e1 ]  A typical queen manuver to sore up [ e5 ] and enable the transfer of the queen to the kingside via the e1-[ h4 ] diagonal.
 [ Q c4 + ]  [ b5 ] , [ Q x b5 # ]  1-0. That's all there is! The early development of the White light-square Bishop and Black's inability to get his pieces mobilized (coupled with a few questionable moves) prevented the aggressive counterplay Black so desperately needs in this opening leading to a painful demise for the harried Black King. Many thanks to invinlee85 for the game! Comments on the analysis or the game itself are much appreciated and if you leave a low rating please comment to tell me what I can improve! Thanks for reading!
 [ N f3 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ] , [ N g5 ]  blacks squezed position and underdevelopment gives white a chance to attack
 [ h5 ] , [ h3 ]  White need an escape square on [ h2 ]  [ Q b7 + ]  [ K h2 ]  [ Q f3 ]  [ K g1 ]  [ Q a8 ]  [ a3 ] , [ Q a5 ]  The situation is blocked. Black offers a draw. (Accepted). I did a lot of mistakes by attacking foolishly and am lucky to obtain it.
 [ B f8 ] , [ Q c1 ]  Queen retreats for safety and the [ d4 ] pawn is at the mercy of the [ c6 ] knight.
 [ N h3 ]  [ N e3 ]  [ Q d2 ] , [ Q x b2 ]  Now the shooting starts.
 [ g3 ]  [ B x g3 ]  [ R f1 x f5 ]  [ B x h2 + ] , [ K x h2 ]  Now I blundered this totally I wasnt even in time trouble but I took bishop right away and then happened that very many has encountered that you see your mistake right after you move before opponent has even moved.
 [ R h2 ] , [ R x a5 ]  And that leads to the a pawn's disappearance. Now Black should have a relatively easy endgame task with two passed pawns after the pieces are traded off.
 [ f4 ] , [ e x f4 ]  The gambit must be accepted!
 [ K c3 ] , [ f6 ]  Finally.
 [ R f1 ] , [ N d f4 ]  Threatening [ Q x g2 # ]  [ R f g1 ] , [ N e2 ]  Why settle for the exchange when one can pursue checkmate? 21. [ B x a8 ] [ N x g1 ] 22. [ K x g1 ] [ Q d1 # ] or 22 . ... [ N h3 ] threatening 23. ... [ Q d1 + ] 24. [ R g1 ] [ Q x g1 # ] or 23. ... [ N x f2 + ] 24. [ K g1 ] Qd1#. My main concern at this point is I have strong threats but no seemingly forced mate.
 [ c5 ]  [ a5 ]  [ B d8 ]  [ N d e5 ]  [ N x e5 ] , [ f x e5 ]  25. [ f x e5 ] - pawn trade.
 [ g3 ]  [ h x g3 ]  [ B b2 ] , [ B x d4 ]  Undermining white's center.
 [ g x f6 ] , [ B h3 ]  By this shift White moves the bishop into attacking position while threatening the discovery 16. [ N h6 ] followed by [ B x c8 ] Accordingly Black removes his queen from the aim of the bishop. amenaza jaque descubierto tomando la dama
 [ K d8 ] , [ N d4 ]  and attack his queen
 [ Q b3 ] , [ Q b6 ]  Must guard the QNP...
 [ N b d7 ] , [ O-O ]  The beginning of a bad plan. White's pieces are aggressively placed and the simple 10.0-0-0 ensures a fierce fight. Castling kingside is awkward but White may intend [ [ a4 ] ] and queenside play which will challenge Black nonetheless. It is worth noting that [ [ a4 ] ] and the fight for queenside squares is the only justification for this move.
 [ N f3 ] , [ R f6 ]  At first I wasn't sure why this was played but now it makes perfect sense. And with that being said I also would've moved here because Joe intends to and will double up on his next move.
 [ N f6 ] , [ N c3 ]  White strengthens the control of the centre.
 [ R d1 ]  [ c3 ]  [ N d6 + ]  [ B x d6 ]  [ R x d6 ] , [ c2 ]  Queening is already unavoidable.
 [ N d4 ]  [ B x g6 ] , [ N x b3 ]  16. ...... [ N x b3 ] (I thought I was over the worst here I'm 2 pawns up and both queens are off the board will this be a nice peaceful endgame?)
 [ N a6 ] , [ B a3 ]  Very foolish move.
 [ d x c6 ]  [ N x c6 ] , [ B h6 ]  My next move will be a mistake but I want to prevent ... [ B g7 ]  [ K f7 ] , [ N g5 + ]  Aie! I didn't see that coming. But It's part of Leningrad weakness for black (Ng5). I've learn from this mistake. The fact that my Bishop isn't there anymore and that the white Bishop is occupying [ [ h6 ] ] I couldn't do [ [ h6 ] ] as defencive move. Now he's giving in real pressure on my King side.
 [ N e8 ] , [ N b7 ]  White chooses to move the forward knight rather than allow the exchange because it leaves the black pieces a bit cluttered and restricted on the back rank.
 [ h4 ] , [ e5 ]  Knowing that I'm already trying to figure a way out of this. The one thing that I kept in mind was GM games. Now I always thought that when someone attacks a piece they're opponent reattacks but just for the sake of gaining of tempo. And there were a lot of variations that mentioned it which I played through. However I now know why this happens. The reason why after one attacks the opponent reattacks is although it appears so there is no escape square. So if you didn't go after something more valuable that player would lose a piece and there'd be no way out of it. Having learned that and now making the connection I'm going to reattack but it will be after her Q. In fact I told her something based on what Jack has emphasized repeadetly until it became second nature which I eventually told my students. That is you have to find a way out of trouble and she agreed by nodding her head.
 [ R x f3 ]  [ Q x f3 + ]  [ K g1 ] , [ N h3 # ]  Because of the simple g-pawn advance I have posts on [ h3 ] and [ f3 ] for my pieces to attack White. I only advanced one pawn and it didn't create any major weaknesses.
 [ e4 ]  [ K c5 ] , [ B a4 ]  Surprising to White is that the Black Bishop appears to be trapped and can't get out of this corner.
 [ N x f7 ]  [ K x f7 ] , [ B e3 ]  Oops. Black picks up a pawn and rook for a bishop with this blunder.
 [ Q c7 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ N d7 ]  ?! Black block the other bishop. No choice to move a pawn in the next move if he want to castle. I don't like black position at all I think he has wasted some tempo in the opening and now he is going to have a hard time to keep developing his pieces. Seems like [ e5 ] is going to be black's next move.
 [ K d8 ] , [ B b6 + ]  If 23. [ a x b6 ] 24. [ Q x a8 + ] and 25. [ Q x b7 + ] create big problems for black. The beauty is black has to move to the 7th rank and white's rook can move to [ c7 ] with check and supported against black's queen. In fact if black's queen were a rook white would have mate in two. But she's not. Still the position will force black to sacrifice his queen to remain in the game.
 [ g4 ]  [ B f3 ]  [ R d7 + ]  [ R e7 ]  [ R d4 ] , [ R e4 ]  If he goes back to 35.[ R d7 ] I will retreat my king and then win his g-pawn.
 [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ g6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B g7 ] , [ e4 ]  So far these are the opening moves of the standard King's Indian Defense. In Indian Defenses such as Nimzo and Queen's Black does not challenge White in the center with pawns and instead goes for rapid development and only challenges the center once he is completely developed.
 [ K g6 ]  [ K b4 ] , [ a5 + ]  if he takes i can make perpetual check
 [ B x b5 ] , [ N x b5 ]  A Simple Exchange.
 [ R x d6 ]  [ c x d5 + ] , [ K x d4 ]  certainly not [ K x d5 ] or [ R x d5 ] followed by [ R x c2 ] leaving [ B c1 ] nowhere to go; now we have Be3... also after [ B f6 + ] [ K x d5 ] [ R x c2 ] we have [ B e3 ] or even the stronger Rc6!......
 [ B e2 ] , [ B x f3 ]  forces the exchange and for hime to move the same piece twice in a row in the opening sequence.
 [ N x e4 ]  [ d x e5 ] , [ B c5 ]  5...Bc5? was the mistake that allowed me to go for a quick win.
 [ d4 ] , [ e x d4 ]  The usual line.
 [ e4 ] , [ d5 ]  Hi it's jstevens1 here yet again with another game to annotate. I am a new member of the Sneaky Knights Connection and have completed 12 games so far and scored 7 points. This is one of the most nailbiting games I have ever played in although it does not quite measure up to the one against Yakky In "In Old Matey's Shadow Part 2". However for a few moves it did look as though I might cop Old Matey. I will now start with my first move as black. This is the first time on gameknot that I have played the Scandinavian Defence - I guess I took some inspiration from Chrisobee - he played that opening against me in the annotated game "Slow King" and beat me with it so it can't be a bad opening. 1...... [ d5 ] (the Centre Counter or Scandinavian - to prevent white from totally controlling the centre)
 [ a4 ] , [ R x d6 ]  Black left it hanging so I see no reason not to gobble the pawn.
 [ g3 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ B d2 ] , [ b5 ]  I'm really quite at a loss here how to proceed. I am hoping to draw white into creating opportunities but so far he's been reluctant to give me much.
 [ e4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ d5 ]  I really wanted a French!
 [ B f2 ]  [ B f4 ] , [ g3 ]  guilty of moving pawns instead of pieces! Alternative variation: 41. [ B e1 ] [ K e5 ] 42. [ B d1 ] [=]
 [ d5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ N x e4 ] , [ N d7 ]  This knight move prepares to play Ng8-[ [ f6 ] ] without a risk of doubling pawns. It is more common to see Ng8-[ [ f6 ] ] but after Ne4[ x f6 + ] Black's pawns get doubled. Black would either play e7x[ [ f6 ] ] keeping his pawn chain intact or instead g7x[ [ f6 ] ] so that he can have a semi-open file to attack on the kingside but at the cost of isolating his rook pawn.
 [ R f3 ] , [ B g7 ]  ...removing one of the defenders of [ e7 ] but there's one less attacker. However that blocked attacker can do more elsewhere.
 [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ N f6 ]  I think it's the first time I've moved a knight on my first move: I thought I'd try it out for a change. Interesting that Black should do the same on his first move but then I'd normally play 1... [ N c6 ] as a response to 1. [ N f3 ] when I'm black. That influenced my second move which probably influenced Black's: a keenly contested centre.
 [ h3 ]  [ B h5 ]  [ g4 ]  [ B g6 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ B x d3 ]  [ Q x d3 ] , [ N f d7 ]  14.......... [ N f d7 ] dislodges my knight back to [ f3 ] (I did consider exchanging knights but then thought that it would only help him develop the other knight and there was also the possibility of the black queen coming to [ h4 ] which could be dangerous especially with a dark squared bishop bearing down on h2)
 [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ b6 ]  [ e3 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ b3 ] , [ c5 ]  Somewhere back in my youth I read that if Black can get this pawn break in with impunity he can claim equality. So I felt pretty good here.
 [ R d8 ] , [ R f g1 ]  Black needed to save his rook. 15. ... [ a3 ] threatens mate but then 16. [ R [ g1 ] ] forces black to save his queen (16. ... Qxb5) but allows white to then play 17. [ B x a8 ] winning the exchange. The move as played 16. Rg1? deserves a ? for leaving the white knight to die on b5. That knight needed to be saved. Initially 16. [ N x d6 + ] seems to win a pawn but now the white knight is pinned to the white queen. 16. [ K f8 ] 17. [ Q b4 ] to unpin the knight and threaten a discovered check when the knight moves 17. ... [ Q e7 ] threatens the knight twice and pins it to the undefended white queen 18. [ R a d1 ] [ R h6 ] and now white's knight must fall. Accordingly 16. [ N c3 ] or 16. [ N d4 ] were called for here or even Nc7+. As a silver lining the white rook on [ g1 ] skewers the black queen to the pawn on [ [ g7 ] ] and after she moves white can win the [ [ g7 ] ] pawn.
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ b4 ] , [ B x b4 ]  Evans Gambit accepted. All move up to this point are text book moves.
 [ N b5 ]  [ R x c8 + ]  [ B x c8 ] , [ N e3 ]  Black still has a more comfortable position but Carlsen is making it a little easier to hold now. Even though things look less difficult now Carlsen still needs to be extra careful. There are still some weakness he has to deal with such as the [ d4 ] and [ a2 ] pawns. But it sure is a lot less complicated than a few moves earlier. If​ 34... [ B e6 ] 35. [ N c2 ] [ B c3 ] 36. [ B e2 ] [ B x d4 + ] 37. Nx[ d4 ] Nx[ d4 ] 38. [ B e3 ] and potentially we can have a Bishop opposite color endgame with White down a pawn but draw.
 [ R e1 + ]  [ K f8 ] , [ Q a3 + ]  I get out with a tempo.
 [ B g4 ]  [ O-O ] , [ N c6 ]  Standard development so. It is obvious now that black is inn a much better position because of his speedy development. N.B- white's queenside has not developed a single piece and has put white at a disadvantage for time.
 [ R x g5 ]  [ N c5 ]  [ Q a1 ]  [ g6 ]  [ R d1 ]  [ h6 ] , [ R d8 + ]  
 [ B b2 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B x c6 ] , [ b x c6 ]  I thought this was a good idea: instead of 1 weak pawn I have a bad 2-pawn structures to concentrate on.
 [ Q f6 ]  [ e5 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ B d5 ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ B x d4 ]  [ Q x d4 ]  [ Q x d4 ]  [ B x d4 ]  [ B x c6 ]  [ O-O-O ]  [ O-O-O ]  [ N b6 ] , [ N f3 ]  we need to snuff this out before it gets bad: White is a pawn behind and is losing momentum...
 [ N c3 ]  [ B c5 + ]  [ K h1 ] , [ B f5 ]  threatening the rook white can't even exchange here as after 23.[ R x e8 ] [ R x e8 ] white can't defend the back rank
 [ R x d1 + ]  [ B x d1 ]  [ Q x c4 ]  [ B b3 ]  [ Q f4 ] , [ Q d3 ]  White correctly avoids exchanging Queens. There is no back row mate because Black can always interpose with Nf8. White's Bishop cannot attack on the dark squares. The only threat White has in this position is Qa6.
 [ Q b7 ]  [ Q c2 ]  [ R a c8 ] , [ R c1 ]  The siege on [ c6 ] continues however black has a problem...
 [ d x e5 + ]  [ K c8 ]  [ e x f6 ] , [ g x f6 ]  !! black looses a second pawn but white kingside is wide open.
 [ K x c6 ]  [ f4 ] , [ b3 ]  It probably would have been easier for Black to take on [ f4 ] but then I get a passed pawn on e4.
 [ K d7 ]  [ K f2 ]  [ K c6 ] , [ N d5 ]  the king can march all the way if he wants to make things easier black taking on either C or D allows the d pawn to promote
 [ d4 ] , [ e6 ]  an elastic move which leads to several possibilities of transposition
 [ N c3 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ B g5 ]  These are all very typical moves.
 [ K d8 ]  [ h5 ]  [ N b6 ]  [ B f3 ]  [ R c1 + ]  [ K h2 ]  [ R x c3 ]  [ Q f8 + ]  [ K c7 ]  [ Q e7 + ]  [ K c8 ]  [ B g4 + ] , [ K b8 ]  Swiderski systematically drives Marshall's King away from the theater of action.
 [ R g5 ]  [ Q h3 ]  [ O-O-O ]  [ R d8 ]  [ d6 ]  [ N h6 ]  [ R g3 ]  [ Q e6 ]  [ Q e4 ]  [ e x d6 ]  [ Q x b7 ]  [ N f5 ]  [ R g g1 ]  [ B h6 ]  [ B x h6 ]  [ N x h6 ]  [ R g e1 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N g5 ]  [ Q f5 ]  [ Q c6 + ]  [ Q d7 ]  [ Q x a6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ e6 ]  [ Q d6 ]  [ Q b7 ]  [ Q f4 + ]  [ K b1 ] , [ Q x g5 ]  i finally gain material!
 [ N c6 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N e7 ] , [ N d2 ]  This move differs from the main line. Usually White wants to gain space on the queenside quickly with pawn pushes and delays the maneuvering of pieces for a few moves. Against moves like 9.[ N d2 ] and 9.[ N e1 ] Black cannot play the agressive [ N h5 ] which is a typical move in mainline king's indian. In this line Black should move the knight somewhere else to prepare for the f5-boost.
 [ N f1 ]  [ Q c7 ] , [ a4 ]  The opening of the a-file in the Ruy Lopez is almost without exceptional favour to White.
 [ e3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ c5 ]  I was trying to apply pressure on d4.
 [ Q e8 ] , [ N h4 ]  Single-mindedly hitting out at black's weakness; this also forces the rook off the semi-open file and limits black's counter-play. As noted earlier don't overlook an attack just because you get thrown onto the defensive!
 [ K b5 ] , [ a4 + ]  First he will check again but I am going to take.
 [ B x c8 ] , [ K f1 ]  Well this is a tricky position. I can use my N for good or lose it miserably. Just a matter of care. And I still have to solve the problem of my lsb!
 [ B x c7 ]  [ Q x c7 ]  [ R f c1 ] , [ R e7 ]  The aim is to block the white bishop and pawns to immobilize
 [ Q x f6 ]  [ Q e2 ]  [ R f e8 ]  [ Q x e8 + ]  [ R x e8 ]  [ R x e8 + ]  [ K h7 ]  [ B d5 ]  [ g5 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ b4 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ g4 ]  [ B x f7 ]  [ B x f7 ]  [ N x f7 ]  [ g3 ]  [ R e1 e7 ]  [ g x f2 + ]  [ K x f2 ]  [ Q h4 + ]  [ K f1 ]  [ N c4 ] , [ N e5 + ]  This is sparta!
 [ R f3 ] , [ R c d8 ]  I decided that the d-file was a better file for the rook - to better support the isolani and free the Queen. Looking back I believe 16...[ R a d8 ] was better.
 [ R a8 + ]  [ K g7 ] , [ b6 ]  White has a good position. The king is safe from checks and the pawn is able to gain another step. White has the lead in pawn promotion and black will not gain much by sacrificing the rook to prevent promotion.
 [ B x d6 ]  [ c x d6 ]  [ R x e7 + ] , [ K x e7 ]  I pick up one more pawn now. Can you see it?
 [ g6 ]  [ N g5 ] , [ B h6 ]  6. ..... Bh6?? - JJ's first big error. This is gonna drop him a piece as you will see on the next turn.
 [ Q x c3 + ]  [ R x c3 ] , [ B e6 ]  Now black gains the advantage: while his pawn structure is weak his pieces cut through the position like a knife through butter while white's peices locked up and inactive are unable to effectively respond with any kind of plan or counterplay.
 [ R b8 ]  [ a3 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ R c8 ] , [ B f3 ]  Some loading and aiming at the middle.
 [ e6 ]  [ d4 ] , [ d5 ]  Now the game has transposed into a kind of French Defense where Black has played N-[ Q B3 ] instead of P-QB4.
 [ K h2 ] , [ R x f3 ]  Lucky me. He tries going for a checkmate somehow but it's my move.
 [ d6 ]  [ B x d6 + ]  [ R x d6 ]  [ R a c1 + ]  [ K b8 ] , [ Q b5 + ]  Oops. White got in a big hurry. [ Q h8 + ] would probably be answered by Rd8. [ Q a5 ] creates possibilities also threatening P[ b4 ] and permitting [ R c7 ] to strike fear into the black king.
 [ B x c6 + ] , [ b x c6 ]  so much for nice pawns.
 [ O-O ]  [ a6 ]  [ B x d7 + ]  [ B x d7 ] , [ R e1 ]  It is vital that you get the king off e file now. O-O-O is not pleasant as queenside is so exposed but it is hard to gain enough moves to get the kingside free to castle especially as the [ f8 ] bishop is currently defending your queen.
 [ Q x f2 ] , [ g1 = Q ]  Black has succeeded in promoting but now he has his king to worry about.
 [ B x d7 ]  [ K x d7 ]  [ Q f7 + ]  [ K c8 ] , [ Q a7 ]  Now the pawns are liable to being picked off one by one...
 [ K h2 ]  [ Q b2 ] , [ Q d1 ]  38. [ Q d1 ] - William declines a queen trade. However I do not know how William is gonna stop a two against one here!
 [ N f3 ]  [ B g4 ] , [ Q d2 ]  13. [ Q d2 ] (after [ B g4 ] pinning the knight my queen moves to d2). Black brings out his other knight and I move my bishop to [ h6 ] attempting to weaken black's castled position by exchanging bishops. There then follows an exchange of bishop for knight reaching the position after 15. ...... Nd4.
 [ Q x c4 ]  [ b x c4 ]  [ K b2 ]  [ K b6 ]  [ K c3 ]  [ K b5 ]  [ R h8 ] , [ B e7 ]  Offers to exchange rooks and free the Bishop
 [ B g2 ]  [ B b7 ] , [ N b5 ]  ?? I played this aiming to fork the King and rook but I forgot about 10... [ Q b4 + ] 11. [ c3 ] [ Q x b5 ]  [ Q b4 + ]  [ c3 ]  [ Q x b5 ]  [ Q c2 ] , [ R g7 ]  Aiming to capture the h-pawn. Black defended while still controlling the half open g file
 [ c x d4 ] , [ Q b8 ]  Now Black opens up discoveries upon moving his [ c6 ] knight and in turn threatens the pawn on d4. White has to move his Queen while protecting his pawn
 [ R c1 ] , [ g4 ]  I'm in no rush so I make sure I can't blunder away the h pawn.
 [ B e3 ]  [ Q e5 ] , [ R a b1 ]  Post-hoc computer analysis had this as a blunder for me and that makes a bit of sense in hindsight. I moved the rook here to prevent the Black queen from getting the last word and capturing on [ b2 ] after the exchanges on [ c4 ] but forgot to notice White LS[ B x c6 + ] and a pawn recapture here means black is in for some punishment after the white queen x again on [ c6 + ] forking the rook on a8. Ah well. Instead the situation simply became more entrenched
 [ b x c3 ]  [ B x c3 ] , [ N f5 ]  There's a possible pin that I'm aware of. [ R c1 ] on kn[ c6 ] so that stays put. kn[ e7 ] to[ f5 ] ! Double pronged attack. [ e6 ] ! & [ h4 ] threatens g2. I'm sure white is feeling somewhat pressurised.
 [ Q d3 + ] , [ K h4 ]  Again avoiding an immediate draw.
 [ b4 ]  [ c x b4 ] , [ a x b4 ]  White knows the pawn has no effect on his chances of winning!
 [ Q x g3 ]  [ h x g3 ]  [ R a e8 ] , [ R a e1 ]  White is trying to look offensive but there is no short way of getting the Knight into action.
 [ O-O-O ]  [ h6 ] , [ B h4 ]  eventually heading to [ g3 ]  [ a3 ]  [ R a d8 ]  [ R d3 ] , [ N d4 ]  blocks the column in reply to white's threat of doubling the rooks
 [ Q g4 ]  [ g6 ] , [ Q g3 ]  Necessary as [ f x g6 ] is a mistake due to [ B x g4 ]  [ h x g5 ] , [ e4 ]  Finally it is time to block the white bishop. This bishop hangs for 7 moves before it moves away!
 [ K f1 ] , [ g5 ]  Played to gain space and with the [ f6 ] follow up to deny whites knight anchor points in the centre.
 [ b8 = Q ]  [ K a4 ]  [ K c5 ] , [ K a3 ]  51. ..... [ K a3 ] - the BK tries to escape but Henry is in hot pursuit. Henry will catch him and the BK will receive the kiss of death from Glenda. Just before this can happen black waves the white flag. A good handy win which pushes me towards passing my previous best rating of 1858. More to come but bye for now. Joanne
 [ N x b6 ] , [ R a b8 ]  Looking for a fork.
 [ N c6 ]  [ N g e2 ]  [ R g8 ]  [ O-O-O ] , [ N b4 ]  c'mon man safeguard ur D3 pawn...he didn't in stead he chose to...
 [ N f6 ]  [ e3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ f4 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ c5 ]  [ c3 ]  [ b6 ]  [ N b d2 ]  [ B g4 ] , [ Q e1 ]  so nothing special untill now. The the black lsb should be better in my opinion in [ b7 ] the the black knight can go to [ e4 ] (...N[ e4 ] Bd3xNe4-d5x[ e4 ] and then the white position is quite bad wiht no way to move the rook to [ f3 ] which is one of the important lines.) But now if Bg4xN[ f3 ] it loose bishop just for a knight and help me developing.
 [ K d1 ] , [ d6 ]  another opening. Still his queen in the corner. Can�t do much from there.
 [ B b4 ] , [ B d2 ]  the usaul answer
 [ g6 ]  [ f5 ] , [ B g5 ]  The opening of the f-file is the less of my concerns. Potential [ f6 ] move gains space but allows me to remove my pieces to protect the last entry: the a8-[ h1 ] diagonal. [ B g5 ] can have potential threats of his own on [ e3 ] so its a more active pieces. Don't forget that [ e5 ] pawn must be blockaded at any cost.
 [ c x d4 ]  [ Q x d4 ] , [ N c6 ]  Black already has a strong advantage. White should play 6. Qf4.
 [ g6 ] , [ Q e1 ]  leads to pawn give away
 [ c x d5 ] , [ B x d2 + ]  Also forced.
 [ b x a4 ] , [ K d6 ]  Going down for the knight.
 [ K c5 ]  [ a4 ] , [ N e3 ]  ?? This loses the knight and a pawn
 [ e4 ]  [ d6 ] , [ f3 ]  My first attempt with the Saemisch. This move never made much sense to me; White neglects development to make yet another pawn move and takes away the most logical square for his King's Knight. Initially I tried the seemingly more natural 5. [ N [ f3 ] ] against the K's Indian but I was not satisfied with the resultant positions. Black seems able to complete his development unproblematically and eventually play ... [ e5 ] or ...[ c5 ] chipping away at White's pawn center and thus achieve the main goal of the K's Indian. So for a while I switched to 5. [ [ f4 ] ] which got better results but only through luck in my opinion. 5. [ f3 ] supports the center better than 5. [ [ f4 ] ] and while it is not a developing move it aims at hindering Black's natural development by taking away the [ g4 ] square from the King's Knight (should White decide to play Be3) or the Queen's Bishop (should White decide to play Nf3).
 [ e5 ] , [ B c4 ]  2. [ B c4 ] - after a double king pawn opening we get this move. It is called The Bishop's Opening because the bishop comes out before the knight. It can transpose into several openings The Vienna Guicco Piano and even as in our game the Ruy Lopez.
 [ R e1 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ N d f1 ] , [ d x e4 ]  Alas the first damage has been struck and the War has begun.
 [ Q x f3 ] , [ N x f3 ]  White has a massive lead in development. In fact if I were to pass a board that had this position in a chess tournament I would probably say off the top of my head "I'd rather be White here."
 [ R b3 ] , [ R a b8 ]  Now the N is pinned by a rook. With the [ c2 ] pawn pinned as well things suddenly looked drastic. For a while I thought I'd blown it and even considered resignation. Fortunately I used some of my extra time to think and coolly retreat the N.
 [ N a6 ] , [ a3 ]  preventing [ N b4 ]  [ N c7 ] , [ B f5 ]  Perhaps I should have kept the bishops on the board since Black's bishop is pretty bad compared to White's light-square bishop.
 [ N c7 + ]  [ K d8 ]  [ N x a8 ] , [ B h3 ]  Now Black gets to try an attack of his own. White can save his rook with [ R f2 ] or Rg1; but after 16. [ R g1 ] [ K d7 ] Black will win the knight outright. Instead White goes for [ R f2 ] hoping for the pin 16. [ R f2 ] [ Q g3 ] 17. [ N b6 ] [ a x b6 ] 18. [ B x b6 + ] [ K d7 ] 19. Ra1; which removes the passed a-pawn and controls the empty file.
 [ Q f4 ] , [ Q g5 ]  Tempting White with simplification where White has the better pawn formation for the pawn minus.
 [ e4 ]  [ B x f3 ]  [ g x f3 ] , [ Q b6 ]  Later I found this move was a mistake the correct move is [ Q h5 ] to prevent White's king bishop in [ h3 ] (it would prevent my long castling) I make this move to target d pawn and poison b pawn.
 [ Q b6 ]  [ c5 ]  [ Q c7 ] , [ O-O ]  And Sasha uses that time to castle.
 [ R e1 x e6 ]  [ R x e6 ] , [ R x e6 ]  39. [ R x e6 ] - you think I am crazy leaving my knight to hang don't you? Well .....
 [ g5 ]  [ N f e4 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ N x e4 ] , [ g6 ]  !? He should attack my king but also guard his too!
 [ K f3 ] , [ d2 ]  And the other one...
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ d6 ]  The first two moves is a common them for me as white. But he played the Philidor's Defense.
 [ f5 ]  [ Q a8 ]  [ B c3 ] , [ N e8 ]  Alternative variation: 30... [ Q e8 ] [?] 31. [ N f3 ] [the upcoming [ f x g6 ] wins. ]
 [ d4 ] , [ d5 ]  Again I match. Also if white were to play 1. [ d4 ] I would play [ N f3 ] And then if he played 2. [ N f3 ] I would play [ d5 ] contesting to the center. I have read that [ N f3 ] is a delayed Queen's gambit move a anit-indian setup and also called the Torre attack. But now all the openings available have funnel down to one opening...
 [ R b4 ] , [ B d1 ]  Another prophylactic manoeuvre. Karpov anticipates the threat of 23 ... l:t[ a4 ] exchanging off White's active rook Now nothing can stop the temporarily active black rook from being driven back by lt:ld3.
 [ N f d2 ] , [ B x a5 ]  Okay he blocks it but Bishop for room if hes dumb.
 [ N f3 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ f6 ]  [ e x f6 ]  [ N x f6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B d6 ]  [ b3 ]  [ O-O ] , [ B f4 ]  !? [ B b2 ] is more common
 [ N f6 ] , [ c4 ]  I thought that my opponent would go for the Queen's Indian (2...[ [ e6 ] ] 3. [ N f3 ] b6) or the Nimzo-Indian (2....[ [ e6 ] ] 3. [ N c3 ] Bb4) considering they are the most common openings on Gameknot in the Queen pawn game with Nf6. Instead they went for the Benko gambit and caught me completely off guard.
 [ B g7 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ] , [ N e7 ]  Prepares ...P-Q4. White ought now to have played 9 P-[ K5 ] N-[ K1 ] 10 B-[ K B4 ] securing an advantage in space.
 [ K e2 ] , [ R h e8 ]  This move has some dose of poison... Knight is going to [ f5 ] and if White decides to take it then after ex[ f5 ] Rook is looking directly to White King's eyes... As example the possible (interesting) line 20.[ a4 ] N[ f5 ] 21. [ a x b5 ] [ a x b5 ] 22. Nx[ f5 ] ex[ f5 ] 23. [ B x f5 + ] [ K b7 ] 25. [ R x d8 + ] [ R x d8 ] 26. [ B h2 ] [ B x e5 ] 27. [ B x e5 ] [ R e8 ] 28. [ f4 ] [ f6 ] (unclear position I think with better chances for White).
 [ Q b6 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ B b4 + ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N g e7 ] , [ a3 ]  ? Maybe was it better to continue development with [ B d2 ] or even 0-0 ?
 [ Q x b5 ]  [ Q x b5 ]  [ d x c5 ] , [ Q x c5 ]  Now I'm up by 4 points
 [ K f2 ]  [ K g6 ] , [ K f3 ]  We're both going for the f-pawn.. But he has to do something about his king he's in the same line as my rook. So if I get the opportunity to push my b-pawn.. ?
 [ Q d6 ] , [ N x e4 ]  What was that for? A free knight! For what?
 [ h4 ]  [ a5 ]  [ h5 ] , [ N x h5 ]  Woohoo! Free pawn!
 [ c4 ]  [ c6 ] , [ B b2 ]  Fianchettoing the bishop with tempo.
 [ d8 = Q + ]  [ K e5 ]  [ Q d6 + ]  [ K e4 ] , [ R e7 # ]  
 [ R a2 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ R g2 ]  [ N x g4 ]  [ Q e2 ]  [ e5 ]  [ R h g3 ]  [ Q h4 + ]  [ K g1 ]  [ e4 ]  [ d4 ]  [ B x g3 ]  [ N d2 ]  [ B f2 + ]  [ R x f2 ] , [ N h2 + ]  Caused by a system glitch. The correct move is Nf2.
 [ b6 ] , [ N c2 ]  Now the knight has to move but at least it was on my terms.
 [ K b6 ]  [ g4 ]  [ K c7 ]  [ g3 ] , [ h x g3 ]  Not fxg3?? which clears the path for the e pawn.
 [ N b5 ] , [ K x b5 ]  NOOO!! The answer was 40. ...[ c x b5 ] 41. [ N c5 # ]  [ K a6 ]  [ e5 ]  [ c5 ]  [ e6 ]  [ a4 ]  [ N x c5 + ]  [ K a5 ]  [ e7 ]  [ a3 ] , [ e8 = Q ]  Let him do what he wants I will win.
 [ K b1 ]  [ f x g2 ] , [ R x f8 + ]  It's the end for black.
 [ Q g2 ]  [ g6 ]  [ K a7 ] , [ h4 ]  I am going to need a second pawn to help my g pawn.
 [ N a5 ]  [ g5 ] , [ B d2 ]  If he tried [ B c7 ] [ N e8 ] would seal his fate!
 [ B e2 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ f6 ]  Odd and bad it weakens the diagonal for nothing.
 [ f3 ] , [ B d3 ]  [21...Bd3!] Fine move. Black is making the best of the chance he's been given here and reimposes a bind on White's centre and Queen side. A piece ahead in the endgame White is finding it hard to come up with a plan to free her game and to assert her material advantage.
 [ Q x d4 ] , [ c3 ]  Here is where that g pawn move 3. [ g3 ] hurts. 14. [ B g2 ] instead would have defended the rook.
 [ K e4 ]  [ b6 ]  [ K f3 ]  [ R d3 + ]  [ K g4 ]  [ R g6 + ]  [ K f5 ]  [ R g5 + ]  [ K e4 ]  [ R d4 + ]  [ K f3 ] , [ f5 ]  time to break out...
 [ h6 ] , [ B c1 ]  I would quickly realize why this was not a good move.
 [ K x d6 ]  [ K c4 ] , [ K c6 ]  With 7 minutes left Black offered a draw again. With nearly 35 I felt duty bound to try a little longer by seeking to impose zugzwang.
 [ Q e6 ]  [ N c2 ]  [ R e d8 ] , [ R d4 ]  This was a nice move. I don't know if the moves afterward were what David planned but it's sneaky regardless.
 [ Q a4 ] , [ Q e3 ]  Threatens [ e6 ] and also lays a little trap...
 [ N d7 ] , [ Q h5 ]  ! Bringing more pieces into the attack and creating a multitude of threats the most obvious being [ B x f7 + ]  [ h x g6 ]  [ Q x g6 + ]  [ K h8 ]  [ Q h6 + ]  [ K g8 ] , [ K h1 ]  An important move allowing my rook to access the G-file. [ B d3 ] is also possible here I think
 [ N x b5 ] , [ B x b5 ]  Black recaptures immediately. However the Computer offers the interesting 25...Rb7!? It gives 26.[ N c3 ] [ R f8 ] 27. [ R e2 ] [ Q a5 ] 28.[ K c2 ] [ B x c3 ] 29.[ b x c3 ] [ B a4 + ] 30.[ Q x a4 ] [ Q x a4 + ] 31.[ K d2 ] [ Q x a2 + ] 32. [ B c2 ] with a -1.72 (in favor of White) But wait? I have a +4 material advantage and White isn't threatening to end matters soon so how is he winning? And What's up with 30.Qxa4?? So I came up with 30.[ K c1 ] [ B x d1 ] 31.[ K x d1 ] Rfb8. White is up a pawn but if White is not careful Black has attacking chances.
 [ N f6 ]  [ b5 ] , [ N e7 ]  I think black is a little better now. Black has all his minor pieces out white has one. Also white has that b pawn strung out way ahead of the a pawn which is backward.
 [ Q e7 + ] , [ B e3 ]  As said I can't avoid this one. Now: where do I put my lsb after Qa5?
 [ B d2 ] , [ b5 ]  even i would say but this move seemed a waste
 [ B e3 ]  [ N b6 ]  [ a4 ] , [ N b d5 ]  Not afraid of 16. [ B x a7 ] as [ b6 ] wins the Bishop.
 [ c6 ] , [ N c3 ]  This move is the best White can make. White is closer to finishing his development. At first blush another strong consideration would be pushing the pawn to [ c5 ] however I don't think that helps much as it allows me to retreat my bishop to [ c7 ] making an easy match up for a queen/bishop diagonal.
 [ b x c5 ]  [ c x d5 ] , [ N x d5 ]  Capturing with my knight made it incredibly powerful. Just look at all the dark squares my centre three pieces are attacking.
 [ Q c1 + ]  [ K e2 ] , [ Q x h6 ]  Winning the [ h6 ] pawn and defends against Qxg7#. The middlegame is now over and a queen rook endgame is in progress. As in any major piece endgame piece activity is far more important than material advantage. A well placed rook vs Inactive rook can be an advantage of up to 2 pawns so this finale should be anything but easy to convert
 [ B x f3 ] , [ N f6 ]  Protect my stake in the center while continuing development.
 [ O-O ]  [ d5 ]  [ b3 ] , [ B d6 ]  Starting to contest [ e5 ] and discouraging [ f5 ] from white.
 [ e4 ]  [ Q f3 + ]  [ K h2 ] , [ R d8 ]  this seems the fastest way to checkmate.
 [ R c5 ] , [ B b3 ]  keeping an eye on [ f7 ] and c4.
 [ N x f7 ]  [ K x f7 ]  [ B c4 + ] , [ d5 ]  Necessary to keep the queen from capturing g4.
 [ d x c6 ]  [ B x e7 ]  [ Q x e7 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ b5 ] , [ O-O-O ]  Usually I wouldn't castle this side with my opponent better developed but I thought he was not that strong a player.
 [ c4 ]  [ R e1 + ]  [ B e7 ]  [ B f1 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ b3 ]  9. [ b3 ] - undermining the pawn crimp that Torsten has imposed on me.
 [ R x b7 + ]  [ K d8 ]  [ a6 ]  [ K c8 ]  [ R b3 ]  [ R c7 ] , [ R c3 ]  34. [ R c3 ] (forces exchange of rooks and Freddy's ravenous king will have a right royal feast - a black prawn pancake! - sorry typo - pawn!). So I can only deny Freddy (who loves pancakes btw) this meal by throwing in the sponge.
 [ Q c1 ] , [ N c6 ]  Aiming to go to D4 with knight next and cover the C2 square for a further pawn advance
 [ f x e4 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ Q x d1 ] , [ R x d1 ]  Queen trade accepted and I gain control of the d file.
 [ N x d6 ]  [ Q e7 ]  [ N f5 ] , [ B x f5 ]  this equalizes material.
 [ B g5 ] , [ B e7 ]  !? - A ok move to protect the queen and activate the bishop but I would've preferred the more sound response of [ Q c7 ] at this point. Though this option does give black the ability to castle.
 [ Q c5 + ] , [ K h1 ]  I think the better move would be 17.[ [ [ d4 ] ] ] [ Q c6 ] 18.[ B b5 ] winning his Queen or 17.[ [ [ d4 ] ] ] [ Q a3 ] 18... or 17.[ [ [ d4 ] ] ] [ Q f5 ] 18... but i missed that
 [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ B e3 ]  More typical is 5. [ N f3 ] or 5. [ c4 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B g7 ] , [ f3 ]  A very popular system at club level however Black equalizes with a quick d5. White can head into the dangerous Yugoslav attack with [ B c4 ] which prevents [ d5 ] but allows Black to play 7...[ Q a5 ] a potent anti-Yugoslav system.
 [ Q x e5 + ]  [ B e2 ]  [ b6 ]  [ g3 ] , [ B a6 ]  White must watch out for QxBe2#. We don't want this game to end too quickly. P[ d3 ] will protect the bishop at P[ e2 ] while letting white's black bishop access to the field.
 [ Q x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ] , [ R e1 + ]  Immediately white is back on the back-foot. Black is drawing in for the kill.
 [ R d6 ] , [ N e1 ]  his plan is to go n[ c2 ] then n[ e3 ] and win the [ d5 ] pawn.
 [ B g3 ]  [ Q c8 ]  [ R b f1 ]  [ R f7 ]  [ Q d1 ]  [ Q b7 ] , [ d5 ]  White has a lot of pressure I think he will try to sac the bishop at some point
 [ K f7 ]  [ B x e5 + ]  [ K x e8 ] , [ Q x c4 ]  Player resigned !!!
 [ B d6 ]  [ B x d6 ]  [ c x d6 ] , [ h4 ]  There is a lot of undefended room behind white's pieces.
 [ R x d4 ]  [ B x d4 ] , [ Q x f4 ]  28. [ Q x f4 ] [ B c3 + ] buys black a move but promoting the passed a pawn is probably not in the cards given white's queen and rook.
 [ Q e4 + ]  [ B e6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ] , [ R e8 ]  Normal developing moves. Black is still ahead in development and now he occupies the e-file with a rook glaring directly at the white queen.
 [ R a b1 ]  [ f x e4 ] , [ f x e4 ]  Blacks king is now open but bishop on [ g6 ] doing his job well
 [ K e2 ]  [ R b2 + ] , [ K e1 ]  Black's e-pawn is protected by the queen as well as passed so moving to [ f1 ] or [ d1 ] and facing ...e2ch is out of the question.
 [ K g2 ] , [ Q h3 # ]  White felt really stupid for falling into this mate not to mention I am minus 10 in material.
 [ Q c7 ] , [ Q x f7 ]  White: Stalhandske Black: Itchynscratchy
 [ c6 ] , [ d x c6 ]  So I take it off to make sure Black is straddled with a backward pawn on the semi-open d file. If I didn;t play this he might play [ c5 ] next move.
 [ Q e2 ] , [ B f5 ]  black has found a chink in the "armour" such as it is
 [ e x d4 ]  [ N b5 ] , [ Q b6 ]  Of course not 12...[ c x b5 ] 13.[ B x f7 + ] and black can resign.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ d6 ]  While not entirely sold on the French-style defense I like it against the Three Knights opening as it frees the QN quickly.
 [ f4 ] , [ b5 ]  Black seeks to sort out his Queenside pawns and create a threat of queening thus distractign White from the developing Kingside attack.
 [ e4 ] , [ d5 ]  Scandinavian Defense or Center Counter
 [ B a5 ]  [ d4 ]  [ e x d4 ] , [ O-O ]  This move accomplishes a few things. It removes the king from the danger posed by black's dark squared bishop secures his safety and prepares Re1. The advantage gained by the gambit pawn is starting to take shape.
 [ R h4 ]  [ K h6 ]  [ K d3 ]  [ g5 ]  [ f x g5 + ]  [ K x g5 ]  [ R c4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ b5 ] , [ R d5 + ]  This is a bit of a mistake since my king can now enter the action on the king side. The computer prefers 41...[ h4 ] 42. [ R c2 ] [ h3 ] 43. [ R e2 ] [ K f4 ] 44. [ R f2 + ] [ K g4 ] 45. Re2.
 [ a6 ]  [ R e3 ]  [ K h8 ]  [ h4 ]  [ Q e6 ]  [ Q e4 ]  [ R b8 ]  [ R d1 ]  [ B b7 ] , [ Q d4 ]  Time to move the queen away
 [ N f3 ]  [ f6 ]  [ e x f6 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ h4 ] , [ B x b2 ]  Time to take out as many pieces as I can and put myself in another offensive position.
 [ R a7 ] , [ b5 ]  ...and I do this. This may have been a bit dodgy although 43... [ R a4 + ] 44. [ K b3 ] [ K x b5 ] 45. [ R x c6 ] [ K x c6 ] 46. [ K x a4 ] would give a pawn ending where we're still level...
 [ N x d7 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ B a6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ R c8 ]  [ R e c1 ]  [ a4 ]  [ B h3 ] , [ g4 ]  An interesting decision. Black gives up a pawn to worsen my pawn structure and make my circumstance a bit worse. I don't know if it is the most sound move but it was reasonably effective against me. I am a bit of a pawn muncher and love to secure slight advantages with extra pawns so I was happy.
 [ a6 ] , [ N c3 ]  Personally this would be a situation I'd avoid if playing Black. White now has a developed knight pairing whilst Black has gained....really...nothing. There is no great check on White's intended development or claims for the centre nor has Black really staked any crucial outposts on the flank. Honestly for a mid-ranker or below I believe the main lines of the Sicilian once White plays [ N f3 ] begin the death toll for Black if he sticks to book. Instead at 3.[ d4 ] I think Black is better with the 3....[ N f6 ] movement.
 [ N c4 ]  [ B x c4 ]  [ R x c4 ]  [ h5 ]  [ N x h5 ]  [ g4 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ N d e2 ]  good move Karpov keeps the strong position of the knight on [ c3 ] more powerful and making himself option of maneuvering the knight from [ d2 ] to the king side in the future
 [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ B c5 ]  A mistake according to the computer.
 [ N f3 ] , [ N c6 ]  I don't recommend this knight move but it's a matter of personal taste.
 [ R h3 ]  [ c x d4 ] , [ B x g6 ]  good move now capturing white's LSB will cause black to lose he's rook after 13.Bxg6!-fxg6.14.Qxg6+-Kd8.15.Qf6+with fork on the king and the rook on h8. and if 14...Kf8.15.Rf3+Ke7.16.Qg7+....
 [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B b5 ] , [ Q b6 ]  don't want to see b7[ x c6 ] so use queen
 [ R h6 ]  [ B f4 ] , [ R x c2 + ]  A move fraught with potential. White could trade queen and bishop for both black's rooks and a knight or bishop. But [ K b1 ] is answered by [ R c3 + ] and black trades rook for queen.
 [ O-O-O ]  [ R h e8 ] , [ K b1 ]  ?! Wastes a tempo in my opinion. I would have tried to get the [ f1 ] bishop out via [ g3 ] [ R g1 ] and Bg2.
 [ R x h7 ]  [ Q g3 ]  [ N h5 ]  [ Q g5 ]  [ B f6 ]  [ Q g6 ]  [ Q e7 ]  [ B x c6 ] , [ N f4 ]  her safe squares are scarce.
 [ B g2 ]  [ a4 ]  [ K e7 ]  [ b4 ] , [ K d7 ]  Rushing his King to the defense of the Q-side.
 [ B x c4 ] , [ h6 ]  Again I didn't like this as my DSB wasn't much of a nuisance on g5. Black needs to castle and develop.
 [ R x c4 ]  [ Q x c4 ]  [ Q e3 + ]  [ K f1 ] , [ Q x f3 + ]  29. ..... [ Q x f3 + ] - black gets a pawn back with check. Henry must move to [ g1 ] because if Ke1?? then both rooks drop.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ B b5 ]  The Ruy Lopez my favorite opening as white.
 [ c x d5 ] , [ B c4 ]  The first offensive is launched. The bishop cannot be taken while the queen is undefended.
 [ R x d1 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ c4 ] , [ B g4 ]  Black's knight attacks the white bishop which is defended by white's knight. 15. ... [ B g4 ] pins that white knight and threatens to win the exchange after 16. ... Nxg5.
 [ g3 ]  [ g5 ]  [ h4 ]  [ g x h4 ]  [ g x h4 ]  [ b5 ] , [ K c3 ]  Since [ h5 ] is met with [ h6 ] I decided to save the potential move and attempt to trade pawns on the queenside. If black tries to run for the kingside I should have enough time to queen first.
 [ N x e5 ] , [ N x e5 ]  archduke_piccolo: I keep missing these... ... having all sorts of other places to visit... I would have chosen the f-Knight to go to [ e5 ] sure. redfoxrising: thanks archduke Games still active I'm thinking I need to get the Queen in the game Anyone else care to express a comment?
 [ K f1 ]  [ R g1 + ]  [ K e2 ]  [ B g4 + ]  [ K d2 ]  [ R d1 + ]  [ K c3 ]  [ R g1 ] , [ B g5 + ]  ! Nice move that wins back some material. A) 34...[ Q h7 ] (mate threat on [ c2 ] if the rook moves!!) A1) 35.[ B f6 ] [ K g8 ] 36.[ R x g4 ] [ R x g4 ] 37.[ Q x g4 ] [ K f8 ] (37...[ K f7 ] 38.[ Q e6 ] loses pawns)... and does he see the mate?? A2) 35.[ R x g4 ] A21) 35...[ R x g4 ] A22) 35...[ Q x h4 ] 36.[ R x h4 ] [ K g7 ] 37.[ B e7 ] loses pawns B) 34....[ K g7 ] (exposes the king and lacks the above threat)
 [ B g6 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ K f8 ]  [ B d6 + ]  [ K e8 ] , [ B h3 ]  ! this was a excellent move! instead of e7? black can go Bf5!
 [ f x g5 ]  [ N x g5 ] , [ N x a4 ]  Black eliminates the White pawns - has at least a draw!
 [ e5 ]  [ Q e7 ] , [ c4 ]  An attempt to press forward and gain superiority over a more open center.
 [ g6 ]  [ f3 ]  [ N c5 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ h6 ] , [ N x f7 ]  !? A knight sacrifice for two pawns. I can see no immediate forcing lines and in any case didn't want to be left minus a pawn so I accepted the knight...
 [ K g1 ] , [ R e8 ]  Trying to keep white's rook from traveling too far I set up a possible mate.
 [ b4 ]  [ c4 ]  [ K f4 ]  [ K x f6 ] , [ K e3 ]  Racing to the A1 corner
 [ R x e6 ]  [ f x e6 ] , [ N a4 ]  This is the move I should have seen earlier.
 [ N d3 ] , [ K e2 ]  It is too late for white to challenge for [ d3 ] now.
 [ B x c6 + ]  [ Q x c6 ]  [ d5 ] , [ Q f6 ]  This is my novelty. Black's plan is ..O-O-O ..[ e5 ] ..[ R d8 ] ..[ g5 ] (supported by the queen on [ f6 ] and the purpose of this move)
 [ B x c3 ] , [ N e3 ]  ...and there it is!
 [ b x c4 ] , [ d x c4 ]  Move # 15. 15 Be3! to allow white to castle and bring White King to safety. Now Black has to move the Queen. [ Q d7 ] or [ Q d6 ] are not ideal development of the Queen and is a step backward. The pawn at [ c4 ] is already in a safe position defended by the Knight at b6. Moving the Queen does not impede the pawn safety. 15. [ B e3 ] [ Q d7 ] 16. [ R b1 ] [ R c8 ] or alternatively 16. [ d5 ] [ Q x b5 ] 17. [ R b1 ] Qa5+. 15. Be3! [ Q d6 ] 16. [ B e2 ] e6/[ g6 ] to develop the Bishop and allow Black king to castle. 17. 0-0 Be7/[ B g7 ]  [ Q d6 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ g6 ] , [ O-O ]  White short castles and brings the King into safety. 17. 0-0 [ B g7 ] 18. f4! White has two clear options on Move # 18: (a) [ Q d2 ] 0-0 19. [ R a6 ] [ Q d7 ] 20. [ R a5 ] [ R a c8 ] and Black occupies the "c" file and Rook in an open file is advantageous. (b) f4! 0-0 19. f5! [ g x f5 ] 20. [ R x f5 ] [ R a d8 ]  [ B g7 ] , [ f4 ]  White is now creating space and preparing to attack.
 [ B d2 ] , [ N d4 ]  threatening to win the queen and getting the knight to a great square.
 [ B x g5 ]  [ h x g5 ]  [ R e1 ] , [ Q e7 ]  Wanting to castle queenside the kingside is dangerous with the h-pawn gone.
 [ R c8 ] , [ Q h5 ]  And it is. (I have also taken the open file. This becomes important.)
 [ N a6 ] , [ Q e2 ]  To hold the initiative we should make a constant stream of threats while making beneficial moves. By the rule of using the least active piece 8.[ N f3 ] is best which also threatens Ne5. However this queen move is also quite natural for the queen and is also a good idea.
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ c4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B g5 ] , [ h6 ]  Black normally waits until around move 9 before playing this but it probably doesn't make any difference.
 [ R x d1 ]  [ f x e5 ]  [ R d3 ]  [ B d6 ] , [ N b d2 ]  the [ e5 ] pawn is very weak...
 [ R f3 ]  [ Q g6 ]  [ B x f5 ] , [ R x f5 ]  And there goes my attack.
 [ h6 ]  [ e4 ] , [ g5 ]  8. …...[ g5 ] - allo allo allo - the start of a pawn storm?
 [ c5 ]  [ N c2 ] , [ B e6 ]  The mobile Black center pawns will soon become a nightmare for White. if 26. [ Q x b7 ] Bd5! is a killer.
 [ d6 ]  [ d4 ] , [ B g7 ]  The main line also know as the Mar del Plata
 [ N a4 ]  [ b3 ] , [ N b6 ]  ? Missing important counterplay. Best was [ Q f4 ] threatening [ Q c1 + ] and then winning the c-pawn. I would have responded with 0-0. But the resulting position is better for black than the text.
 [ N d2 ]  [ K e7 ]  [ R e2 ]  [ K d6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ R a f8 ]  [ N g5 ]  [ R e7 ]  [ R a e1 ]  [ R f e8 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N h8 ]  [ d4 ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ g6 ]  [ R e2 e3 ]  [ N f7 ]  [ e5 + ]  [ K d7 ]  [ R f3 ]  [ N h6 ]  [ R f6 ]  [ R g7 ]  [ b4 ]  [ a x b4 ]  [ c x b4 ]  [ N g8 ]  [ R f3 ]  [ N h6 ]  [ a5 ]  [ N f5 ]  [ N b3 ]  [ K c7 ]  [ N c5 ] , [ K b8 ]  Alternative variation: 45...

 [ R c8 ]  [ Q c2 ]  [ Q f4 ]  [ R f e1 ]  [ Q d2 ] , [ R e2 ]  oops. [ Q x d2 ] cxd still for black advantage but better than [ R e2 ] Qxe2; [ Q x e2 ] c2; [ R f1 ] c1/Q.
 [ B x c4 ] , [ c5 ]  I capture black's [ c4 ] pawn with my LB and black pushes his c pawn to c5.
 [ B e3 ]  [ B g7 ] , [ f3 ]  White chooses a sharp continuation the Yugoslav Attack.
 [ d3 ]  [ a6 ]  [ R b1 ] , [ N d4 ]  ! In a few short moves black's position has become reasonably good. He has a centrally posted knight he is poised to trade off White's light-square control and he is in no immediate danger however his play can have a dark side:
 [ Q b3 ] , [ R d6 ]  I was seeking to defend [ e6 ] and [ b6 ] at the same time. But after I noticed a strong reply by white 29. d5!.
 [ B g3 ]  [ N x f5 ]  [ B f2 ]  [ a3 ]  [ R a1 ]  [ a2 ]  [ K g1 ]  [ c5 ]  [ g3 ] , [ c4 ]  Hoping one pawn will eventually promote...
 [ K d7 ]  [ K d4 ]  [ K d6 ] , [ K c3 ]  59. ...... [ K c3 ] - Henry is aiming to drive out the rook in the corner so that I can crown my a pawn.
 [ b4 ]  [ c x b4 ] , [ a x b4 ]  A pair of pawns go off the board.
 [ N b c6 ]  [ d3 ]  [ b5 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ Q c2 ]  [ a6 ] , [ N b d2 ]  White has finished the opening: at least two tempi ahead...
 [ h6 ]  [ R a d1 ]  [ R a d8 ] , [ R f e1 ]  14. [ R f e1 ] - both sides centralise their rooks.
 [ Q x g5 ]  [ R g8 ]  [ Q x g8 + ]  [ K x g8 ] , [ N c d5 ]  Time to defend. This move blocks the Pawn-d while attacking.
 [ e3 ] , [ N c6 ]  White cannot save the [ e5 ] pawn the only try [ Q d5 ] fails to Qe7.
 [ N c6 ] , [ c3 ]  Important as [ N b4 ] is very annoying.
 [ d4 ]  [ g5 ] , [ N x g5 ]  now on 5 ... [ f x g5 ] 6 [ Q h5 + ] [ K e7 ] 7 [ Q x g5 + ] [ K d8 ] 8 [ Q e5 + ] [ K f7 ] 9 [ B c4 + ] [ d5 ] 10 [ B x d5 + ] [ K g6 ] 11 0-0 or 11 [ B x f4 ] with excellent chances
 [ O-O ]  [ d6 ]  [ Q f5 + ] , [ K g8 ]  Black has nicely developed his k-side Rook and is in danger of attacking White's Queen so now it's up to Wite to prove he's not just a Queen-slinging loonie. Here goes -
 [ b3 ]  [ B x c3 ]  [ d x c3 ] , [ O-O ]  Hopewell castles to give rook support to his pawn which has already moved almost all the way across the board and we are only on move 16!
 [ R b3 ]  [ Q c5 ] , [ f3 ]  Closing the a8-[ h1 ] diagonal.
 [ K g8 ] , [ Q e8 # ]  this game is a perfect example of this agressive opening but I would like to have castled but I had too much of an attack going to slow down for a turn
 [ Q x h2 ]  [ e x f5 ] , [ g x f5 ]  Here black could've played more sharply with Qxe5...
 [ c5 ]  [ O-O ]  [ h6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ d4 ] , [ b4 ]  And we're off in to new territory with white sacking a pawn.
 [ d4 ]  [ N d5 ] , [ N x d5 ]  16. [ N x d5 ] - I did not expect him to take the knight in response to the pin/pile up but he does.
 [ h x g3 ] , [ h x g6 + ]  Not very subtle but surprising and nice for me. I still overlook too much but this one...
 [ Q f7 ] , [ Q h4 ]  Curious white clearly doesn't want the trade but after [ Q g6 ] the risks are simply huge. the rook and bishop are hanging and if the rook moves anywhere other than [ d1 ] then [ Q b1 ] is mate. This looks very good for back now.
 [ Q c7 ] , [ f5 ]  The phalanx advances intending to break up black's castle.
 [ N e x d6 ]  [ B x d6 ]  [ N x d6 ] , [ Q d7 ]  all comes together...
 [ K h4 ]  [ Q h8 + ]  [ K g5 ]  [ K b2 ] , [ f6 ]  just trying to promote the pawns but i am almost hopeless.
 [ R e d7 ] , [ R x d7 ]  Trying to keep initiative and maintain my advantage which I believe my bishop pair gives me.
 [ B g6 ]  [ h4 ]  [ h6 ]  [ h5 ]  [ B h7 ] , [ N f3 ]  It's now reach the position where most of the Caro-Kann games go.
 [ N c6 ] , [ Q c3 ]  Again better to control the pawns advance first.
 [ R f6 ]  [ B x f4 ] , [ h6 ]  Kicking the knight away to a bad square
 [ Q e2 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ B x h4 + ]  [ K d2 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ O-O ]  Too busy developing to spot what was happening.
 [ R x d6 ]  [ B x d6 ] , [ K x d6 ]  Black has an active centralised King so how can he defend or capitalise on this position?
 [ Q x e6 + ] , [ R f7 ]  probably Kg8-[ h8 ] was better this pins the rook.
 [ R c2 ]  [ B x b6 ]  [ R c6 ]  [ R d6 ]  [ R c2 ] , [ R d3 + ]  The first move that puts his King into the coffin corner. 38. [ R c3 ] [ R x c3 + ] leaves plenty of time to advance Black's pawns and the Bishop will keep the lid on his King
 [ b4 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ a4 ]  [ R e b1 ]  [ Q c7 ] , [ h3 ]  go [ g4 ] with an attack on the king side
 [ b6 ]  [ B x g7 ]  [ R h7 ]  [ B e5 ]  [ K d7 ] , [ f4 ]  It seems that the engdame is a gimme for white since the f pawn is unbalancing the game in its favour.
 [ O-O ] , [ B e3 ]  This particular Bishop move was intended basically just to free White's Queen Rook in preparation for swinging it to the center or all the way to f1. I chose to move to [ e3 ] rather than [ d2 ] simply because it's a "free" move: Black must respond to my threat on the [ c5 ] pawn.
 [ R x d5 ]  [ B g5 ] , [ c5 ]  He mistakenly thought that the rules allow a player to castle out of check so he wasn't concerned with the [ e7 ] threat. Oops!
 [ N d x f5 ]  [ Q e1 ]  [ N g4 ]  [ R f3 ]  [ B x c3 ]  [ N x c3 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ N x e3 ]  [ Q x e3 ]  [ N x f3 ]  [ Q x f3 ] , [ Q x b2 ]  
 [ R a b8 ]  [ Q f5 ] , [ a5 ]  White currently has a comfortable game but has to play carefully. Black must be wary too because the black king is vulnerable.
 [ d4 ]  [ B b4 ] , [ R e8 ]  touching multiple problems in the White camp...
 [ f x e5 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ B d5 ]  [ R x f5 ]  [ N c4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ B e4 ]  [ R f7 ] , [ N d6 ]  That doesn't gain black much. R-[ c8 ] might have been better though its difficult at this stage.
 [ a6 ]  [ B x c6 ]  [ B x c6 ] , [ b3 ]  didnt see a point with this move?!?!
 [ O-O-O ]  [ Q a4 ]  [ K b8 ] , [ h4 ]  Wait what protects Pg4?
 [ R f2 ] , [ R e1 + ]  White: King_0_Nothing Black: Janheckman
 [ N g5 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ B b5 ] , [ c6 ]  9. ........ [ c6 ] - to screen out that lsb's attack on Glenda.
 [ B b7 ] , [ c3 ]  Giving the white bishop an escape route and preparing to strike at the center
 [ a3 ]  [ b5 ]  [ B b3 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ d x c3 ]  [ e ] , [ p ]  Unless a dramatically better move is available I always ep. It just tends to upset people.
 [ R f b1 ] , [ B x a4 ]  I let the pawn exchange complete for now as I am still good tactically.
 [ O-O ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ] , [ B a5 ]  The point behind 13...Bc7. The problem is that the King isn't defended anymore and White can start an attack on the dark squares that have been deserted by the wandering Ba5.
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e3 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ B d3 ]  Yes I like the Stonewall. Not sure why but it is fun.
 [ f2 + ]  [ K f1 ]  [ N h2 + ]  [ K g2 ]  [ f1 = Q + ]  [ K x h2 ]  [ Q f2 + ]  [ K h3 ]  [ R x d4 ]  [ N x d4 + ] , [ Q x d4 ]  White resigns.
 [ Q e7 ]  [ R x e7 + ] , [ K x e7 ]  black hopes to win another minor piece for his queen maybe [ B x e7 ] retaining the option of castling is a better try
 [ N e4 ]  [ B h4 ]  [ g3 ]  [ N x g3 ]  [ N x g3 ] , [ B b7 ]  anything goes: Black had still several minutes to spare...
 [ f3 ] , [ B h1 ]  [ B f1 ] is to be preferred although it really doesnt matter at this point.
 [ R h3 ]  [ R d4 ]  [ R b h8 ]  [ R b4 + ]  [ K c7 ]  [ K c2 ]  [ R h8 h4 ] , [ R b3 ]  Now the rook has been forced into a rather awkward position.
 [ Q x b5 ]  [ R c7 + ]  [ K b1 ] , [ R f8 ]  Black is aiming for all of his pieces to attack the enemy king
 [ B x e3 ] , [ f x e3 ]  The net is built! The squares in front of his king are attacked so my goal is to get a queen or rook to his back rank.
 [ a5 ]  [ f5 ]  [ g x f5 ]  [ e x f5 ]  [ R d4 ] , [ N x e5 ]  and a draw... Analyses show that white had the advantage.
 [ c5 ]  [ R d2 ]  [ R f2 ] , [ Q x f2 + ]  One move before being checkmated White resigns. Mr. Shaibel would be proud :) Thanks xildur for a really nice game!
 [ N c3 ] , [ d6 ]  And then secure that piece but I'm not sure from what.
 [ O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ h6 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ a5 ]  [ Q d2 ] , [ N g4 ]  11. [ N g4 ] (a knight incursion so I kick it away with [ h3 ] and after an exchange of bishop for knight black develops his bishop to b7) on move 13.
 [ b4 ]  [ e5 ] , [ Q a1 + ]  he's finished.
 [ g5 ]  [ R h7 ]  [ Q g3 ] , [ R f f7 ]  Was my second uh-oh moment. [ R c7 ] or [ R x b7 ] are obvious follow-up moves. They are inevitable (I cannot prevent them) so I use this as an additional opportunity to move my pawns. Subsequent actions that involve my king running grants me safety for 1 turn anyways.
 [ R x f8 ]  [ R x f8 ] , [ R d8 ]  With that being said I try to exchange again.
 [ N x e6 ]  [ f x e6 ]  [ B x e6 + ]  [ K h8 ] , [ B g4 ]  She's a fixed and killed goner now!
 [ h4 ] , [ a4 ]  promotion coming....
 [ g4 ]  [ b5 ] , [ g5 ]  !? [ B b3 ] seems better white probably wants an open file.
 [ a4 ] , [ N h5 ]  hoping to open up my bishop here
 [ Q f5 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ Q x e4 + ]  [ Q x e4 ] , [ R x e4 + ]  The exchange is now very beneficial to me as the material lead is a knight and a pawn. If ahead by a minor piece trading off material is almost always advisable.
 [ O-O ] , [ h3 ]  Let's Black off the hook. White misses 12. [ c x d5 ] with a strong advantage. 12... [ c x d5 ] 13. [ B x d5 ] or 13. Nh3. There is also 12. [ N h3 ] [ N f6 ] (12... [ R e8 ] 13. cxd5).
 [ K x f7 ]  [ Q f3 + ] , [ K e6 ]  10. .... [ K [ e6 ] ] - if I want to hold on to my extra piece then Henry must move to [ e6 ] to defend it. Not a happy place for a king in the opening.
 [ K d3 ]  [ N x h5 ] , [ K d4 ]  Now I fight for a draw.
 [ N e5 ]  [ Q e7 ]  [ R f c1 ]  [ R f c8 ]  [ Q c2 ] , [ N e8 ]  Finally able to protect [ c7 ] sufficiently but now black is stuck in a very passive position.
 [ N b d2 ]  [ f x e5 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N b3 ] , [ N g e7 ]  The position didn't suit me. It' rather equilibrated but black is stronger in the center black has a lack of mobility and the black bishop is blocked on [ f8 ]  [ B d4 ] , [ h6 ]  to prevent [ N g5 ]  [ O-O ] , [ N f x d4 ]  Let's go for trading ! No pieces no attack.
 [ c6 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ K h7 ] , [ B e3 ]  A slight tactical adjustment.
 [ Q d7 ]  [ R d3 ]  [ Q c8 ]  [ Q e4 ]  [ Q e6 ]  [ R d5 ]  [ K f8 ]  [ c4 ] , [ K g8 ]  Black sees that he now stands in his best defensive position and therefore waits for White to show how he intends to break through.
 [ a4 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ R a b8 ]  [ B x b5 ]  [ R x b5 ]  [ b3 ]  [ R d8 ] , [ K e3 ]  This was mistake because after r[ e5 + ] k[ e2 ] r[ d2 + ] I lose a pawn. I should have looked at all the possible checks available for my opponent but did not. Enemy did not capitalize on this though...
 [ b4 ]  [ R e2 ] , [ a2 ]  All over red rover. With nothing left to learn Black resigns. A good game by Joe and it does highlight how a later R-L castling can give White more options in the middle though not all of those options are good!
 [ f4 ]  [ N c5 ]  [ f x e5 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ B a3 ] , [ R d8 ]  For some reason I didn't notice the implications of black's castle on D8.
 [ R b4 ]  [ B x f6 ] , [ g x f6 ]  Some debate about qualities of the Bishor and Knight in Endgame. For Black they didn't want to lose a pawn in the Exchange however White cleverly put paid to that schemme with some quality fork moves showing the advantages of a Knight in a small area. The disadvantages came later in try to defend the whole board.
 [ N g5 ] , [ Q x a3 ]  I take the pawn
 [ O-O ]  [ N x e4 ] , [ B d5 ]  I respond by boxing in his pawns on [ d6 ] and [ e5 ] and I also threaten to capture his knight with Bxe4. This will force him to protect his knight but this move is ?.
 [ d x c4 ]  [ d x c4 ] , [ N c6 ]  After 17.[ Q x d6 ] [ N x d6 ] 18.[ B e6 + ] only seems annoying rather than strong.
 [ h5 ] , [ f3 ]  31. [ f3 ] - the pawn break has come like I thought it would. I refuse to take the temporary sacrifice because it will allow the BR some ingress down the h column. Time to bolt the door and offer a draw - my opponent accepted so my gameknot profile now reads 1 Master Draw and 10 Expert Draws. Nice.
 [ Q x a7 + ]  [ R x a7 ] , [ R x a7 # ]  Oh I'm just going to show you anyway. A typical knight-and-rook checkmating formation called the Arabian Mate carrying the distinction of oldest checkmating pattern. A nice finish to an interesting game.
 [ B b7 + ]  [ K c5 ]  [ K f7 ]  [ K d6 ]  [ B f3 ] , [ a6 ]  preparing promotion
 [ h x g3 ] , [ R e6 ]  black is looking to create mating threats on [ f2 ] but he does not have the time or resources to do that. I continue to increase my control of the center and look for an opportunity to march my passer.
 [ B e7 ]  [ Q f4 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ N x f5 ]  [ B x f5 ]  [ Q x f5 ]  [ R a b8 ] , [ R b1 ]  This exchange is the simpliest maybe not the best.
 [ Q c3 + ]  [ K b8 ] , [ B x a6 ]  Now Black cannot take because of [ Q c7 + ] followed by [ N b6 + ] when Black loses his Q to avoid immediate mate.
 [ R c e1 ] , [ f x e5 ]  The f-file can now be opened for the rook and [ e6 ] made safe for the knight through the exchange.
 [ Q g7 ] , [ R b1 ]  I'm now eyeing those nicely aligned queen and rook. The attack that I'm preparing is unfortunately slow but it does give something useful to do for my still undeveloped rook and bishop.
 [ N x e5 ] , [ B x h3 ]  Instead White gives it up.
 [ N c6 ] , [ N a3 ]  This knight may land on [ d6 ] via b5. So Black has to keep it under consideration.
 [ N x g2 ]  [ B x g2 ]  [ B x g2 + ]  [ Q x g2 ] , [ Q h4 ]  n[ g3 ] is threatened. White's next move is forced.
 [ B x f4 ]  [ g x f4 ]  [ N x f4 ]  [ B f7 ] , [ N h4 ]  20. [ N h4 ] - white's pieces come swarming in can Henry survive this? I decided to grab a pawn.
 [ B x h6 ] , [ d6 ]  missed the next one as well should have played [ Q d7 ]  [ B d2 ] , [ Q x a1 + ]  he missed the 2nd one only a piece down
 [ f x e6 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ h6 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ Q x f6 ]  [ Q x f6 ] , [ g x f6 ]  After all trades I think now black has a little bit more spacial advantage than white.
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ a6 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ e6 ] , [ f4 ]  So far standard mainline Sicilian Najdorf moves. At this point I wondered whether to play 7...[ b5 ] the Polugaevsky Variation but it's so long since I looked at it that I ducked out. From memory the main advantage of it is that it quickly gets complicated but Black avoids problems defending his Be7. So I continued with the main line.
 [ N x c6 ] , [ B x c6 ]  again not the best; after [ Q x c6 ] [ B d4 ] [ R h6 ] [ R f2 ] [ R f8 ] [ Q h4 ] (remember that move) [ Q c7 ] Black is better prepared for f5...
 [ B a6 ] , [ B x c6 ]  White sees correctly that it is of more value to exchange Black's knight rather than his light-squared bishop which will remain inert at the sides.
 [ R a8 ] , [ R d8 + ]  Black now has no choice. The Rooks come off the board.
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ c3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ d6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ N b6 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ Q d5 ]  [ B x c6 + ] , [ b x c6 ]  watch [ c6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ c5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ Q e6 ]  [ N b5 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ f6 ] , [ N g6 ]  lost the queen...
 [ f5 + ]  [ K g5 ]  [ R x c8 ]  [ R x c8 ]  [ Q x c8 ] , [ Q x e4 ]  The situation much simplified leaves white only a single pawn to the good but black's defenses are shattered--white's mobile Q will make short work of the available targets.
 [ e4 ]  [ c6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ d5 ] , [ f3 ]  not a good move. it opens the king side too soon.
 [ c4 ]  [ g6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ e4 ]  [ N x c3 ]  [ b x c3 ]  [ c5 ]  [ B b5 + ]  [ N c6 ] , [ d5 ]  Until this game was played the usual response to this aggressive move was the one played in this game.
 [ B g8 ]  [ a x b4 ]  [ B x b4 ] , [ R d d1 ]  ?? here is the critical error [ [ c3 ] ] was a slightly better choice though I haven't looked at it completely. I was thinking [ [ c3 ] ] and if black decided on a sac Bx[ [ c3 ] ] white would play [ R c2 ] trying to hold down the defense. 27. [ a x b4 ] may have been bad since it allows for the following combination. Have you found it yet?
 [ N x g3 ] , [ B d4 # ]  A lot of players don't respect bullet chess and think it is just a contest of who can click the fastest but being good at fast games comes in handy often quickens your thinking ability sharpens your instincts and teaches you not to panic when time pressure situations happen. Just don't get addicted!
 [ e x d5 ]  [ Q x d5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ Q d6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ a6 ] , [ N g5 ]  White plays very activ for my [ f7 ] square what the weakest pawn is.
 [ K g7 ] , [ N g e6 + ]  And now checkmate cannot be avoided.
 [ a6 ] , [ N x c6 ]  Now I decided to exhange and mess up his queen side. This does slow down his kingside development which helps me win.
 [ N g4 ] , [ N d5 ]  press an attack
 [ Q x h5 + ] , [ B h6 ]  35 ...[ K g8 ] is no good because of 36 Ne7#.
 [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ h6 ]  I'm not a fan of the Sicilian but i know [ [ h6 ] ] is not very common. Not on move 2 anyway. Normally i'd expect [ N c6 ] or [ e6 ] so [ [ h6 ] ] left me pretty optimistic. I suppose it stops me playing the knight to [ g5 ] or the bishop once it's developed but that does not concern me. Altho maybe it's just a waiting move to see what i'm going to do.
 [ N e4 ] , [ Q d3 ]  I thought he would put my bishop to the question :) with [ a3 ] I didn't want to trade just yet thinking I still had options to strengthen my attack.
 [ K x e6 ] , [ R f e1 + ]  A intermediary move bringing the second rook in action before taking the queen. Now all of white's pieces are active while both of black's rooks are still in the corner. Well at least the [ h8 ] one looks threatening.
 [ B b4 ]  [ R b5 ]  [ B d2 ] , [ R b6 + ]  Important move that drives the king from the blockade on the pawns on the kingside.
 [ K c3 ] , [ R d5 ]  29. ......... [ R d5 ] and white resigns. I resigned because I could not avoid the loss of a third pawn. I have two knights against his two bishops. There is just no juice left in the position so I wave the white flag. Well played Ion!
 [ R d8 ]  [ K f1 ]  [ Q d1 + ] , [ Q e1 ]  I thought at this point that a queen exchange would improve my position.
 [ e3 ]  [ d5 ] , [ N c3 ]  The first battle is for the control of the center.
 [ Q x e1 ]  [ N g5 ]  [ Q f2 + ]  [ K e5 ]  [ R a e8 + ]  [ K f5 ]  [ Q x g3 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ g6 + ]  [ K x f6 ] , [ Q x f4 # ]  
 [ B x f4 ] , [ B e7 ]  Preventing king check this is when I start my plan.
 [ b5 ] , [ Q f4 ]  But Carl defends and goes back on the attack.
 [ Q d5 ]  [ a3 ]  [ Q a2 ] , [ h4 + ]  ...[ h5 ] or [ R g6 ] to follow...
 [ Q x c3 + ] , [ N d2 ]  Two extra pawns ahead for the moment Black has the advantage. But...
 [ d x c3 ] , [ R e8 ]  !? Alternative variation: 8...[ h6 ] [has been played in order to prevent White's next. Then another Portisch game from the sametournamentwent] 9.[ N c2 ] [ R e8 ] 10.[ N e3 ] [ d6 ] ( 10...[ b6 ] ) 11.[ b3 ] ( 11.[ Q c2 ] [and there are several moves here but analogous to the game is] [ R e5 ] [!?] 12.[ R d1 ] [with some difficulties for Black.] ) [ a5 ] 12.[ Q c2 ] [ a4 ] 13.[ R b1 ] ax[ b3 ] 14.ax[ b3 ] [ N e7 ] 15.[ R d1 ] [ B d7 ] 16.[ c5 ] [!?] dx[ c5 ] 17.[ c4 ] [ R a6 ] 18.[ B b2 ] [ Q c8 ] 19.[ R a1 ] [ R x a1 ] 20.[ B x a1 ] [ N [ f5 ] ] 21.[ Q d2 ] [ N d4 ] 22.[ B x d4 ] [ c x d4 ] 23.[ Q x d4 ] [ c6 ] 24.Q[ b6 ] [ B e6 ] 25.[ h4 ] [ h5 ] 26.[ R d4 ] [ N d7 ] 27.Q[ a5 ] [ f5 ] 28.[ B h3 ] [ g6 ] 29.[ Q c3 ] [ N f8 ] 30.[ N g2 ] [ R d8 ] 31.[ N f4 ] [ B f7 ] [?] 32.[ R x e4 ] [L Portisch-Izoria Warsaw POL 2005.]
 [ O-O ]  [ d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ B b6 ] , [ a4 ]  This move threatens 8 P-[ R5 ] winning material. If 8... BxRP? 9 P-[ Q5 ] N-[ N1 ] 10 RxB or if 8 NxRP 9 RxN BxR 10 Q-[ R4 ] ch and 11 QxB.
 [ e4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ d5 ] , [ e5 ]  This is one of my first attempts to play French defence. Contrary to Latvian counter gamit this requires to play smart .
 [ Q d4 ] , [ R x e3 + ]  35 moves into the game white finally loses a pawn.
 [ e x d5 ] , [ B b3 ]  Protecting his B since it was attacked.
 [ a3 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ N c4 ] , [ R d7 ]  ? The big mistake of the game now I can gain a pawn and activate my pieces .
 [ g x f8 = Q + ]  [ N x f8 ]  [ Q x d8 + ]  [ R x d8 ]  [ R x d8 + ]  [ K x d8 ]  [ B x a6 ] , [ K c7 ]  Except for the [ a6 ] pawn I thought that everything was still level and felt ok for a little. As one can compensate being a pawn down. But then I counted everything of what he had and I had. And then I realized that things were not ok as after looking at what I lacked v. what he had I quickly figured out that I'm a R+P down. There's no way out of it so that's when I started that black is lost. My only hope for any form of counterplay is that Tom spends too much time looking for a win and times out as something happened with World Champion Magnus Carlsen about 2.5-3 years ago. But that's not going to happen now.
 [ Q a5 + ] , [ Q x a5 ]  Even better black wants to trade queens. White is a pawn ahead and welcomes this trade. Another consideration is worth noting. Even though I drove the queen off of [ [ d8 ] ] she still protects d8. Here is a secret: When any piece moves it automatically defends the space from which it moved. I know that sounds obvious but consider the implications. Driving a piece from a square does not automatically mean you control the square. More often that square is still in contention as is the case with [ [ d8 ] ] after black's 18th move. The queen exchange will solve that.
 [ Q g8 + ]  [ K e7 ] , [ Q f7 # ]  Mate. Black's main mistake in this game was not utilizing all the pieces properly (the queen didn't even move in this game when it could easily have prevented this mate) as well as not predicting all possible outcomes.
 [ Q x b8 ]  [ R b7 ]  [ Q c8 ]  [ B f3 ] , [ N e4 ]  This move forces white to take the [ e4 ] knight with bishop or lose his rook or queen.
 [ d x c4 ] , [ K c5 ]  And now the game is essentially over as White cannot get his King over in time.
 [ R x d8 + ]  [ N x d8 ] , [ R c8 ]  A pin behold.
 [ f x g6 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ Q x d5 ] , [ B b3 ]  The light squared bishop is emerging a strong diagonal. In comparison what does the [ B c8 ] doing? It is obvious that [ B c1 ] could be easily moved either to [ e3 ] or h6.
 [ B x e5 ]  [ Q x e5 ] , [ R e1 ]  !
 [ N x c4 ] , [ a4 ]  Therefore I'm planning a variation. What I'm hoping to achieve is a passed pawn. If I had more time I might have been successful but there's not enough time for that to happen.
 [ d4 ]  [ c6 ]  [ c3 ]  [ f5 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ e3 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ N b d2 ]  [ d6 ]  [ h4 ]  [ N b d7 ]  [ h5 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ B g3 ]  [ N d7 f6 ]  [ h6 ]  [ g6 ] , [ N h4 ]  The idea was: [ g5 ] 12. [ N g6 ] and if a7xN [ [ h7 ] ] threatening [ Q h5 + ] if the pawn is taken (after exchange in [ [ h7 ] ] so to remove the knight). It is not accurate I reckon.
 [ c3 ] , [ Q a5 ]  third arm...
 [ K x e5 ]  [ f4 + ]  [ K d4 ]  [ Q d5 + ]  [ K x c3 ]  [ B d2 + ] , [ K b2 ]  look at his undeveloped pieces....wot was his pawn doing at c3?
 [ B f4 ]  [ R g2 ]  [ Q h3 ] , [ K f1 ]  28. [ K h1 ] - the rook must be defended but now Freddy announces #7 I worked it out but gameknot analysis showed it to be #8. My calculations were as follows .........
 [ K c5 ]  [ K e2 ]  [ B c1 ]  [ K d1 ] , [ B b2 ]  All part of the Black's plan now White has to worry about the [ g3 ] pawn.
 [ K f1 ]  [ K e7 ]  [ K e2 ]  [ K e6 ]  [ K d3 ]  [ g5 ]  [ B f2 ] , [ h5 ]  The further advanced the pawns are the more likely Black can tie White pieces down to the Kingside.
 [ d6 ]  [ c x d6 ]  [ f6 ]  [ g x f6 ]  [ R d2 ] , [ Q e2 ]  Exact. 47... QxP would let Bogoljuboff's Rook become active.
 [ g5 ]  [ f x g5 ] , [ B f8 ]  note n[ b4 ] has been hanging since move 11
 [ B e2 ] , [ a6 ]  Doesn't showing white where the Black knight [ b8 ] will be developed in the high level of chess masters and GM's sometimes using a mind game technique which they make a silent move a waiting move to see what the opponent will do next what his up to and then they developing there Pisces according to the position its not always effect the position but it gives to the player that using the technique a comfy feeling during the game and its help to make better decisions .
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ a6 ]  We begin here with the evergreen and popular Najdorf Variation of the Sicilian Defence. This modest looking move is designed to prepare ...[ e5 ] without having to worry (overmuch) about White's landing a minor piece on the b5-square and attacking the d6-point. At the same time the move supports an eventual expansion by Black on the Q-side. So purposive is the move it hardly comes under the pejorative 'country move' associated with a move like a2-[ a3 ] or ...a7-[ a6 ] which often signals a timorous approach to the game. The Najdorf is not for the timorous!
 [ B c5 ]  [ K e2 ]  [ f5 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ B d6 ] , [ B g5 ]  Another misplay Alternative variation: 61. [ B e3 ] [Should play back so I have access to both [ f2 ] if he attacks via [ e7 ] or [ g5 ] if he tries g3.] [ B g3 ] 62. B[ g5 ] [ d4 ] 63. [ K d3 ] [ K d5 ] 64. [ B d8 ] [ K e5 ] 65. [ K e2 ] [Similar the the game line.]
 [ R c e8 ] , [ R g6 ]  Lots of threats.
 [ R f b1 ] , [ N x d3 ]  Freddy swaps down. Each exchange of course accentuates his material edge.
 [ f6 ]  [ e x f6 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ B x f5 ]  [ g x f5 ]  [ N b4 ]  [ Q b6 ]  [ Q e3 ]  [ h4 ] , [ N d2 ]  In freeing the knight to attack the bishop and also with the possibility of moving to [ f3 ] applying pressure on the [ h4 ] pawn it leaves its guard of the [ a3 ] pawn.
 [ Q h3 + ] , [ R h6 ]  Black could have moved [ K g7 ] and then [ Q x d7 # ]  [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ c3 ] , [ N f6 ]  I don't "know" the book on the [ c3 ] Sicilian though I have read Chandler's book on it. I haven't done too well recently with 2....[ d5 ] so reverted to 2....[ N f6 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ d4 ] , [ c x d4 ]  I'm not sure about this. At one time I used to resist exchanging on [ d4 ] when White had played [ c3 ] but recently I've tended to play this allowing White to set up his pawn centre.
 [ R d c1 ]  [ R d8 + ]  [ K e4 ]  [ f5 + ] , [ K e3 ]  26.[ K e5 ] and the bishop finally enters the game with decisive result. :-)
 [ R c4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ] , [ K f2 ]  Keeping the knight out of [ f4 ] would have been better.
 [ e4 ]  [ Q g4 + ]  [ K h7 ]  [ N b3 ]  [ Q e5 ] , [ N x c5 ]  An extra pawn might be helpfull at the end-game
 [ O-O ] , [ R a d8 ]  Black's rook claims the file for his people.
 [ b x a4 ] , [ b x a4 ]  Have to complete this exchange first.
 [ b6 ] , [ B b2 ]  11. [ B [ b2 ] ] - Fou Lenoir moves to [ b2 ] to clear the decks. Henry will stay in the centre however.
 [ R c8 ]  [ N e3 ] , [ N b8 ]  ({16:+2.70} 19. ... [ N b8 ] 20. [ N f5 ] [ R x c2 ] 21. [ N [ d4 ] ] [ R c8 ] 22. [ B f4 ] [ B x d3 ] 23. [ R d1 ] [ B g6 ] 24. [ N x g6 ] [ h x g6 ] 25. [ N b5 ] [ K d7 ] 26. [ N x a7 ] [ K x [ e6 ] ] 27. [ N x c8 ] +-) ({16:+0.55} 19. ... [ K d7 ] 20. [ R x c6 ] [ K x c6 ] 21. [ N f7 ] [ e6 ] 22. [ d4 ] [ K b7 ] 23. [ a4 ] [ N h5 ] 24. [ g3 ] [ B e7 ] 25. [ B d2 ] [ N f6 ] 26. [ N g5 ] [ N e4 ] 27. [ N x e4 ] [ d x e4 ] +=)
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ g6 ] , [ e3 ]  a weak third move by White
 [ e x f4 ] , [ N d5 ]  ! White forks [ f4 ] and [ c7 ] threatening a further fork from there as well as taking closer order to Black's exposed King.
 [ Q d2 ]  [ a6 ]  [ B a4 ]  [ B f5 ] , [ B h6 ]  My opponent not moving the stationary [ B f5 ] helps my cause.
 [ b5 ]  [ N e7 ] , [ a4 ]  White's pawns march forward.
 [ R x g2 ] , [ N x g2 ]  I can take the N and with +10 materia points the game is won.
 [ f4 ]  [ e x f4 ]  [ g x f4 ]  [ d5 ] , [ Q d4 ]  OMG no! The queen is lost by knight fork king queen rook.
 [ N b d2 ]  [ N b c6 ]  [ R b1 ]  [ a6 ]  [ a3 ]  [ b5 ]  [ b4 ]  [ B b7 ] , [ e5 ]  White locks up the middle with this P move somewhat cramping Black.
 [ B x e2 ]  [ Q x e2 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ B x e5 ] , [ Q d7 ]  Black could not save the piece with 17...[ Q e7 ] 18.[ Q x e4 ] [ f6 ] 19.[ Q g4 + ]  [ Q x e4 ]  [ f6 ] , [ B d6 ]  OK. So white is a full bishop up and should be winning? Yes but the technical grind is very instructive.
 [ R x c7 ]  [ a3 ]  [ a4 ]  [ N g f3 ]  [ h6 ]  [ R e2 ]  [ g5 ]  [ h3 ]  [ N c e7 ]  [ R a e1 ]  [ N g6 ]  [ g3 ] , [ h5 ]  [ [ h5 ] ] ?? Mistake easily done done so myself in far to many games. Perhaps he's looking at [ [ h5 ] ] [ g4 ] who knows.
 [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ e3 ] , [ O-O ]  black is ready to the expanse on king-side.
 [ d4 ] , [ c x d4 ]  Continuing along the Sicilian line with thoughts of getting a chance to Fianchetto my Bishop at [ g7 ] have to look out for any traps... Such as the Magnus Smith trap that can arise from the Fischer variation If what follows is 4. [ N x d4 ] [ N f6 ] 5. [ N c3 ] [ N c6 ] 6. [ B c4 ] I may not be able to carry out my plan...
 [ c5 ] , [ B c7 ]  I want to keep my clergy's ( bishops ) eye on The [ h2 ] square.
 [ R d1 ] , [ B d5 ]  [ f3 ] is weak. black will exchange rooks after [ B f8 ] will move.
 [ N c3 ] , [ R x b2 ]  I probably should have attacked his rook with my knight.
 [ d5 ] , [ c x d5 ]  ?! 16. [ R e2 ] keeps the black bishops under control for the moment.
 [ b x a4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N e7 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ N b4 ]  [ O-O-O ]  [ a3 ]  [ b3 ]  [ c x b3 ]  [ a x b3 ]  [ R c8 ]  [ K d2 ]  [ B e7 ] , [ R d a1 ]  Time to round up the a pawn.
 [ R a b8 ] , [ B x c6 ]  quick bishop
 [ a x b5 ]  [ R c8 ]  [ b6 ] , [ d4 ]  Letting the bishop cover b7.
 [ K h5 ] , [ K f8 ]  38. ..... [ K f8 ] - puff!
 [ Q h6 ]  [ d3 ]  [ Q h5 ] , [ h3 ]  Checkmate will not come my way! At least not yet.
 [ Q b5 ] , [ c3 ]  Finally he can force that knight away...
 [ B f3 ]  [ Q g6 ] , [ B h5 ]  ?!?
 [ B g2 ]  [ R d8 ]  [ h4 ] , [ N e3 ]  In this moment I thought about exchange pieces.
 [ B x e5 ] , [ Q x d2 + ]  Of course! This "must" win or I am lost!
 [ N f4 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ Q x e5 ]  [ B e8 ] , [ N x d5 ]  30. Nxd5! - taking advantage of the pin on the [ e6 ] pawn as Glenda is hanging behind it.
 [ B g3 ] , [ N h5 ]  Then to chase this bishop instead of developing my pieces was not the right strategy.
 [ N x e3 ]  [ f x e3 ] , [ R e6 x e3 ]  the center hasn't folded yet but it's coming.
 [ K e2 ] , [ h4 ]  I just haven't got time to push forward the g-pawn advance the King get my Rook to h8...
 [ R x d5 ]  [ N x g3 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ N x h1 ]  [ R a5 + ] , [ B e6 ]  ??? He should have just let me get the Rooks with 26... Rf7. While he would lose that way it is better than what happens now.
 [ Q x d8 ] , [ R x d8 ]  Here I resign for after [ B x e4 ] all hope is lost. Being up an exchange and a piece will be an easy win for Freddy.
 [ K d7 ]  [ K f2 ]  [ b5 ]  [ Q a6 ]  [ Q h4 + ] , [ K f3 ]  To guard the B.
 [ b4 ] , [ R x a5 ]  Playing 34. [ a x [ b4 ] ] or 34. [ c x [ b4 ] ] seems to win another pawn for white but after black plays 34. ... [ a x [ b4 ] ] and white recaptures on [ b4 ] white has doubled pawns on the b-file and black responds with 35. [ R c2 ] forking the pawns on [ b2 ] and [ g2 ] and regaining the lost pawn immediately. Worse black then has his own slice of heaven with a rook on his 7th rank.
 [ R d d1 ]  [ N x g3 ] , [ R f3 ]  Attacking hie G3 knight.
 [ B c5 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ B x d4 ] , [ e x d4 ]  You would think that I would get tired of looking at double pawns on the e file. Now there on the d file. Go figure..lol
 [ N g5 ] , [ B h6 ]  A blunder. This game was a while ago so I can't remember exactly what I was thinking but chances are I got lost in possible variations and forgot the threat at hand to my bishop on g4.
 [ B e3 ]  [ c5 ] , [ Q c1 ]  A move that protects the c-pawn.
 [ N f3 ] , [ N e4 ]  What is this ? Black plays the same piece twice ! Yes right.. but black can afford to do so because he already has his king into safety.
 [ N e5 ] , [ B c6 ]  ?? Terrible. Saves a piece at the cost of the game. Black must defend g4.
 [ N b4 ] , [ O-O ]  Protecting of Nxc2.
 [ f6 ] , [ f5 ]  This effectively prevents the horse on [ g8 ] to be in picture early in the game
 [ R x d6 ] , [ R d8 ]  [ R d8 ] was to push his rook back with my bishop on [ f8 ] in next move...
 [ R e7 ]  [ B f1 ] , [ R a e8 ]  Maybe the whole sequence with the idea of doubling the rooks down the e-file is wrong as after a series of exchanges White could penetrate the 7th rank with his rook.
 [ d6 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ e6 ]  [ O-O ] , [ N g e7 ]  7. ......... [ N g e7 ] - after I castled Jim prepares to castle himself with this move. Everything has been so far so quiet do you agree? Well it is all about to change!
 [ e6 ] , [ c3 ]  3. [ c3 ] is often played in this system although I prefer to play [ B d3 ] or [ N f3 ] to develop a piece or 3. [ f4 ] is more aggressive.
 [ N h5 ]  [ K h1 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ R g1 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ B f1 ]  [ e5 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ B x f1 ]  [ R x f1 ]  [ R d3 ] , [ B d2 ]  The mistake. I win back the pawn. After [ g x h6 ] white would have time for this move or simply for the [ B x h6 ] move and then with Qg5.
 [ a4 ] , [ e5 ]  But with the Rook controlling the e-file (black's e-pawn is pinned) there is no immediate threat for white.
 [ R c1 ]  [ Q e7 ] , [ K b2 ]  36. [ K b2 ] - took a couple of days to decide on what move to play. Did not have a clue as to how I could convert this advantage into a victory. Black is still so active. Can't afford to offer a draw here - I will lose 6.5 points! I find a safe move and see what my opponent does. He amazes me with ...........
 [ b3 ]  [ c5 ]  [ B d2 ] , [ N c6 ]  White thrusts forward his Pawns while I focus on piece development.
 [ Q x f3 ]  [ R f1 ]  [ B h3 ]  [ R g1 ]  [ R f d8 ] , [ Q c1 ]  there is no point in denying this is the final flaw after a couple of unfortunate choices... much needed here was at least [ h5 ] [ B g4 ] [ h x g6 ] to create some counterplay...
 [ R d8 ] , [ R d1 ]  ? This trade is winning for black not that it makes much difference after [ R e1 ] [ R d2 + ] [ K c1 ] Ng2!
 [ N c3 ]  [ Q a5 ]  [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ c6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ B d2 ] , [ e6 ]  A very typical scandinavian position has been reached. White has a slight edge (better development and more free game) but black position is still solid.
 [ c x d4 ] , [ N f3 ]  now is too late there is [ Q a5 ] which check your king and attack your bishop. better is Q [ a4 ] which avoids any check.
 [ B e4 ] , [ R e2 ]  Bolstering the guard along the second rank but depriving White's knight of a useful square. [ f1 ] was probably better as was e3.
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ B b5 ]  Spanish game (Ruy Lopez)
 [ g x h5 ] , [ B x h5 ]  I prefer to open the column this way since I can't avoid that.
 [ K e2 ] , [ Q a4 ]  Now the expected C4.
 [ a4 ]  [ K b1 ]  [ a x b3 ]  [ c x b3 ]  [ Q a5 ]  [ Q b2 + ] , [ K g8 ]  22............ [ K g8 ] - king gets out of check and my queen adopts her usual defensive stance. As usual my opponent has the attacking queen and me the defending one. At least my queen succeeds in this role here and will go on to turn the tables against my unsuspecting opponent.
 [ R x c1 ]  [ N x c1 ] , [ b4 ]  Going for another pawn exchange which Ding readily accepts since that'll give him a tempo by attacking the Q.
 [ O-O ] , [ a6 ]  A thematic move in most Ruy Lopez variations: Black puts the question to White's bishop.
 [ N g3 ] , [ B g6 ]  Stable again. He can save his bishop but he cannot play [ d4 ] because he plainly loses it.
 [ d5 ] , [ N c3 ]  2 Knights Variation as promised.
 [ K x e3 ]  [ R c5 ]  [ R e7 ]  [ B d5 ]  [ K d3 ]  [ B c4 + ] , [ K d4 ]  I thought I had lost one of my minors here.
 [ Q a5 + ] , [ N e c3 ]  It seems like [ Q a5 + ] has misplaced the Queen a bit.
 [ N x e4 ]  [ N x e4 ] , [ d5 ]  (!) Well played. This break goes a long way to freeing up Black's Q-side and developing some counterplay.
 [ e x f5 + ]  [ K x f5 ] , [ N e3 + ]  This maintains the threat to [ d6 ] rather than letting black set up the endgame.
 [ Q f3 ] , [ N g5 ]  Moved knight to avoid queen and now have queen under attack
 [ Q c6 ] , [ O-O-O ]  Finally I castle but this is quite wrong; I thought the Bishop on [ d3 ] was lost but 17.[ Q g2 ] pins the pawn. Instead I've handed back my material.
 [ B g6 ] , [ R x f6 ]  Rook takes out pawn and threatens bishop.
 [ R b1 + ] , [ K g2 ]  No I have the advantage here!
 [ e x d5 ]  [ B x d5 ]  [ Q x g5 ]  [ Q x e4 + ] , [ B e7 ]  Material equality has been re-established and Black's position looks a little better. His bishop is very active on [ e7 ] his knight has a great [ c5 ] outpost and a potential home on [ e4 ] that Black can fight for the [ c8 ] rook owns the c-file the [ g5 ] queen is quite active and after ..0-0 Black's king is safe. White meanwhile has 2 bishops in an open position (as he intended) but his [ c1 ] bishop is quite bad (and hard to develop - [ b3 ] and [ B b2 ] will be too slow given ..Bf6) and his king must be content on e2. Since given time White can probably coordinate his pieces and sterilize Black's advantages Black must play actively.
 [ B b4 + ]  [ c3 ]  [ B d6 ] , [ B b5 ]  White repels the invading forces with ease and continues his development.
 [ Q e4 + ]  [ Q x e4 ]  [ R x e4 ] , [ R d2 ]  with the queens gone the white weaknesses are increased.
 [ Q x c8 ]  [ R x c8 ]  [ R c2 x c8 ] , [ N x a2 ]  wrong move Knigt [ a6 ] should be better.
 [ K g2 ]  [ Q x c1 ] , [ N f5 ]  Knight is moved to try and stop the advance of the pawn on h5.
 [ Q e7 ] , [ N c3 ]  Morphy attacks d5.
 [ R b6 ]  [ R a5 + ]  [ K d4 ]  [ h3 ]  [ N e3 ]  [ R x g7 ]  [ N x c2 ]  [ R x f7 ] , [ b3 ]  Then I wanted to get all his pieces out so he couldn't use them later.
 [ e x f2 + ] , [ K g2 ]  I didn't want to take the pawn immediately because of ... [ f5 ]  [ R a e8 ] , [ B b3 ]  Apparently [ R x f2 ] first was more accurate after an engine check but this is also winning.
 [ e5 ]  [ f4 ]  [ e x f4 ] , [ B c4 ]  Standard KB Gambit position. Favored by Bobby Fischer.
 [ g5 ] , [ N f3 ]  I didn't want to lose my knight because I was low on pawns and I needed all the help I can get.
 [ h6 ]  [ B x f6 ] , [ g x f6 ]  ? Okay so this was a blitz game but really? This practically broadcasted to me that he was going to castle queenside. I would have captured with the queen.
 [ Q x f5 ] , [ N e6 + ]  but my mistake was nothing on his mistake...
 [ R c8 ]  [ f4 ]  [ N a5 ]  [ R a d1 ] , [ N c4 ]  Black has a nice tactical shot but it will leave him exposed in the center.
 [ K h4 ] , [ R d2 ]  ??
 [ K h8 ] , [ Q e8 + ]  I love that sacrifice
 [ N f6 ] , [ B e2 ]  with queen on [ d6 ] (or d7) I don't want to give up my bishop pair for nothing so a retreat is the best option white has here
 [ B c4 ] , [ B g4 ]  I have a plan and this is when it came about. Potential checkmate soon.
 [ Q x a8 ] , [ c5 ]  Traps the queen in!
 [ R x a6 ] , [ R h8 ]  Sets up the winning combination for white.
 [ Q c5 ]  [ Q f8 + ]  [ K c7 ] , [ R x e7 + ]  Gotta be careful; black would love to get in [ Q f2 + ] although he'd still need one more move to setup a mating attack.
 [ Q g5 + ] , [ Q e3 ]  I hesitated a little before this move because [ N x c4 + ] forks king and Q. But it really doesn't matter due to that mate in 2 still in play. After 22...[ N x c4 + ] 23. [ K d3 ] Nxe3?? 24. gxh8+!! So the fork continues the trend of Black's attacks lacking teeth.
 [ R x a2 ]  [ R x a2 ] , [ Q b7 + ]  That crazy queen stalker of mine shows up again. My old lady is really gonna give her a beating.
 [ e4 ] , [ d5 ]  My basic opening
 [ K c2 ]  [ b3 + ] , [ K b1 ]  I knew black would use his king to take my pawns but this move immobilized my king. I worked for this sequence 47. [ K f4 ] 48. [ e5 ] Kx[ e5 ] 49. [ f4 + ] Kxf4. If this happens the game will end in a draw a stalemate for my king and [ h4 ] pawn could not move. Winning was impossible but losing was not inevitable.
 [ B g3 ] , [ h5 ]  With two quick pawn thrusts Black grabs the initiative. But it has to be admitted the bishop that has just been chased off had served a useful function in keeping back Black's f-pawn from its usual ...[ f5 ] break. On the other hand it was left a target and is driven to a spot with very little outlook.
 [ K h5 ]  [ f x g5 ] , [ K x g5 ]  Two connected passed pawns!
 [ f3 ]  [ N c5 ]  [ Q e2 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ O-O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ N d4 ]  [ Q d7 ]  [ Q b5 ] , [ N a4 ]  [ N a4 ] avoids 13. ...Qxb5? 14. [ N x b5 ] ... 15. [ N x c7 ] forking Black's rook and queen pawn gaining a pawn.
 [ R f x e6 ]  [ R c7 ]  [ R e c6 ]  [ R d7 + ]  [ R h d6 ] , [ R f7 ]  Now I just have to find a way to double rooks on the d-file and play [ R d7 ] to force an exchange of rooks
 [ b3 ] , [ R h e8 ]  Threatening 18... PxP forcing an exchange of major pieces [if White moves his Rook 19... PxP forces the Queens off the board.] White resigns.
 [ R x d6 ] , [ Q d2 ]  A rook in the pin defended three ways puts more pressure on him. I control the E file now!
 [ B b5 ] , [ c6 ]  Pretty basic stuff here. "BACK OFF" cries Black. This is a development move only. There is no real threat in the centre if black takes my Knight with his then my bishop will take giving me time to castle and keeping the points nice and even.
 [ g x f6 ] , [ Q x d4 ]  Alternative variation: 26. [ R f1 ] [no good but what else?] [ Q d7 ] 27. [ Q e3 ] $19
 [ R x b2 ]  [ N x g5 + ]  [ K h2 ]  [ N f3 + ]  [ K h3 ]  [ B x b2 ]  [ Q x a7 ] , [ B e4 ]  Preventing White from playing R-QKt1 and threatening R-[ R1 ] winning the White QRP.
 [ N x e6 ] , [ b x a4 ]  rather than tamely move the [ R f8 ] Black counter-attacks by uncovering an attack on White's undefended Q
 [ N c3 ] , [ B b4 ]  Pinning and still looking at getting my pawn- removing the defender
 [ R b7 ]  [ R c8 ]  [ K f7 ]  [ R c6 ]  [ g5 ]  [ K e3 ]  [ b5 ]  [ R x c5 ]  [ K e6 ]  [ K e4 ]  [ b4 ]  [ R x e5 + ]  [ K f6 ]  [ R c5 ]  [ b3 ]  [ R c6 + ]  [ K g7 ]  [ R c1 ]  [ b2 ]  [ R b1 ]  [ K f6 ]  [ K e3 ]  [ R b3 + ]  [ K f2 ]  [ K e5 ]  [ K g3 ]  [ K f5 ]  [ h4 ]  [ g x h4 + ]  [ K x h4 ]  [ K f4 ]  [ K h3 ]  [ K x f3 ]  [ K h4 ]  [ K e2 ]  [ K g4 ]  [ K d2 ]  [ K f4 ]  [ K c2 ]  [ R f1 ]  [ b1 = Q ]  [ R x b1 ] , [ R x b1 ]  Here White should have resigned. But he thought he could get a draw by perpetual check or the 50 move rule. Knowing how to close out an ending like this is chess 201. (Chess goes all the way to infinity.) The idea is to close off the King's squares push him to the edge get your own King in opposition. As follows.
 [ K d8 ]  [ R x c7 ]  [ K x c7 ] , [ B e8 ]  Attempting to win a pawn
 [ B b7 ] , [ K x b4 ]  Black now has a dilemma: how to stop the h pawn from queening and keep the pawns.
 [ R e8 ] , [ N d6 ]  Missing the attack with [ N h6 + ]  [ R e e7 ] , [ Q c4 ]  Too eager to get an attack moving. Better was [ K h3 ] making sure there were no checks to interrupt progress.
 [ B e3 ] , [ N f5 ]  Alternative variation: 10...[ N g6 ] 11.[ N e2 ] [ d4 ]  [ B f4 ] , [ B e7 ]  Alternative variation: 11...[ a6 ] 12.[ B d3 ] [ N c e7 ]  [ g4 ]  [ N h4 ]  [ N x h4 ]  [ B x h4 ]  [ g5 ] , [ h6 ]  Alternative variation: 14...[ h5 ] 15.[ g x h6 ] [ g x h6 ] 16.Q[ h5 ] [ B e7 ] 17.[ B x h6 ] [ B f8 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ R h6 ]  [ N b5 ] , [ Q x b2 ]  Alternative variation: 24...[ Q e4 ] 25.[ B f3 ] [ Q b4 ] 26.[ N a3 ] ( 26.[ N c3 ] )
 [ h5 ] , [ N e5 ]  Since White managed to weaken Black's Kingside Black returns to this square.
 [ g2 ] , [ N x b7 ]  White wants Baker to take the rook so that he can finally relieve the pressure around the king and still be up a piece and now White has a passed pawn and [ N x d6 ] ideas. I think White has better defensive options like [ K f2 ] or [ R e1 ] instead of still attacking on the queenside. After [ R e1 ] [ N x f3 ] is not advisable because of [ Q x f3 ] and White has enough pieces for the queen.
 [ Q c2 ]  [ h x g4 ]  [ R h1 ] , [ B c5 ]  Threatens Qe5. plus g3+...
 [ B x d3 ] , [ Q x d3 ]  The obvious choice. The [ c2 ] pawn will be needed for [ c5 ] at a later date to crack open black centre pawn formation.
 [ B c4 ] , [ N x e4 ]  My favorite fork trick that I've learn from playing many other players.
 [ f4 ]  [ R e e1 ]  [ f3 ] , [ g3 ]  (WH) I thought it was all over now: Black's attack must mate. I expected 26 Q-[ N6 ] QxQ 27 RxQ N-[ B5 ] with a clear advantage to Black.
 [ N f3 ]  [ b5 ] , [ a4 ]  [ a4 ] trying to break up the pawn control of the Queenside.
 [ B x b7 ] , [ R b8 ]  I should have considered that before attacking the pawn.
 [ B x b2 ]  [ R b1 ]  [ B c3 + ]  [ K e2 ] , [ R b8 ]  I can take the pawn but much better would be again [ N c6 + ] [Edit:Bc6+]. l didn't see the strong next black's move but I don't know how to stop it anyway.
 [ K f6 ]  [ R c5 ]  [ R b4 + ]  [ K g3 ]  [ h5 ] , [ K h3 ]  51 Kh3? making life easy for the fe chain.
 [ N x d4 ] , [ e x d4 ]  This trade leaves Black with doubled pawns on the d-file. The [ d4 ] pawn will be hard to defend.
 [ B b7 ]  [ R h e1 ] , [ O-O ]  I was expecting 12. 0-0-0 but Black wanted to set up an immediate battery on the c-file.
 [ Q d6 ] , [ N x d5 ]  ..some mini traps here...with the long diagonal very strong...
 [ B g4 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N d7 ] , [ d4 ]  eye his [ f4 ] pawn
 [ b8 = Q ] , [ R x e8 ]  all or nothing...
 [ R x d6 + ]  [ K c3 ]  [ b5 ] , [ R b7 ]  Attacking the pawn from behind
 [ R x b2 ]  [ R x f1 ]  [ R x b3 ]  [ Q d5 ]  [ R x e3 ]  [ R f2 ] , [ Q x d4 ]  Again when you are behind in material don't trade unless you have too.
 [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ a6 ]  I understand this: but this move does not belong in this system...
 [ N f3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ c4 ]  [ c5 ] , [ d5 ]  mostly likely the best because 4. [ d x c5 ] [ Q a5 + ] wins back the pawn with a slight tempo for black.
 [ B g4 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ B g7 ] , [ N c3 ]  Starting to like this!
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ Q f6 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ Q e6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ f6 ] , [ N d5 ]  This was silly. I thought the threat of the fork would be great but it made things a bit clumsy in the end. The ease with which black could play 7... [ c6 ] made this pointless.
 [ N x c5 ]  [ N x c5 ] , [ O-O ]  trying to get breathing room...
 [ N x d5 ] , [ B c4 ]  Bishop over knight move ;) Here bishop can go to [ b5 ] (exchange) [ [ c4 ] ] (tactical) [ e2 ] (solid) or [ d3 ] (!?). [ [ c4 ] ] is the best for me as it virtually attacking the weak point of f7.
 [ Q x f3 ] , [ B e7 ]  Well that wasn't too hard to see. He's a subtle player who doesn't leave gaps like that. I think for a while about whether that queenside gap on his side would serve me best on the b or c collumn. Ultimately this move helped undue me so looking back I put a ? beside it on my score card. But I decided that a gap on the b collumn would leave an isolated pawn he would have to work to defend.
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N d2 ]  [ g6 ]  [ e3 ] , [ B g7 ]  So far nothing too crazy. Neither player is doing much besides developing.
 [ R f8 + ]  [ K e1 ] , [ Q f6 ]  13. ..... [ Q f6 ] - Glenda now orchestrates a deadly pile up on the f column.
 [ R e g1 ]  [ B h6 ]  [ R b d1 ] , [ B g5 ]  one more piece on king
 [ R a d1 ] , [ R c8 ]  The plan here is to make as though I had castled. It just takes four moves as opposed to one. It's bringing a Rook over getting the K down bringing the other R over and then bringing the K back which is how it works.
 [ N e5 ]  [ h3 ] , [ Q e1 ]  and after several more moves black was unable to convert the small advantage and lost on time.
 [ K g8 ] , [ R x g6 # ]  
 [ N x f6 + ] , [ e x f6 ]  A wrinkle derailing my intentions on [ b2 ] but one I can work with since now white has to save his queen and lose his bishop on [ g4 ] to a mere pawn. I credit white's 10th move with a ?: 10. [ N x f6 ] ?.
 [ K e7 ]  [ Q c7 + ]  [ R d7 ]  [ e x d6 + ] , [ K f6 ]  The Rook cannot be taken [20 QxR QxB ch 21 K-[ R2 ] Q-[ [ B5 ] ] ch 22 K-[ N1 ] BxP! 23 Q-[ [ B5 ] ] ch QxQ 24 PxQ B-N6!!! and White has no defense against 25... R-[ K1 ] and 26... R-[ K8 ] mate.]
 [ d5 ] , [ e5 ]  He advances another pawn on that diagonal whilst leaving the h file still relatively weak. That waekness is increased as I threaten the knight the only defender of the weak [ h7 ] square.
 [ B h6 ] , [ Q a5 + ]  !
 [ O-O ] , [ B d3 ]  Looking at castling on the Kingside.
 [ e4 ] , [ d5 ]  I consider this a risky opening for black. It pulls black's queen out early. White can develop his own bishops and knights to threaten the queen. The result is white develops several pieces before black deploys his own bishops and knights.
 [ R c b1 ] , [ R a d8 ]  And calmly finishing development. White now facing threats on the queenside kingside and down the center attempts to simplify but it is too late.
 [ N d6 ]  [ B f3 ] , [ f6 ]  28. ...... [ f6 ] - tempting white into a move like e5?? If he plays it then I will be able to return the complement - Nf5+.
 [ N f4 ] , [ R e1 ]  The last hope was 26 Rfa1.
 [ Q x g2 + ]  [ Q x g2 ]  [ N x g2 ] , [ K x g2 ]  here we are. Now i stil can take the [ d4 ] pawn finishing to breag the white central pawn position and whith a knight in the center it could be very dansgerous for white ...
 [ K f2 ]  [ R h d8 ]  [ K e2 ] , [ R d8 d3 ]  
 [ B x f4 ] , [ B x f4 ]  27. [ B x f4 ] - now a piece trade - I only have the Witch and her castle to contend with now but together they are a very dangerous force. Can my pieces provide a good enough shield for Henry? We shall see.
 [ e x d5 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ d6 ]  [ e4 ]  [ g6 ] , [ h3 ]  Keeping the black LSB away from g4. In the modern Benoni black usually has trouble developing his LSB due to white's grip on the central light squares. One common plan for black is to exchange it early for white's N after white plays [ N f3 ] via ...Bg4->Bxf3. With the text move this option is no longer available and there's hope of black's LSB getting in the way of coordinating his other pieces.
 [ Q x b2 ] , [ N b3 ]  Also [ R b1 ] but my idea is attack for the d-column and not for b
 [ d3 ]  [ e3 ] , [ d4 ]  Finally! I can castle.
 [ R b1 ]  [ a5 ]  [ f3 ] , [ B a6 ]  Complicating the position adding more attack lines...all part of the effort to over-stretch White's defences. As White's king is defending the d2-knight the king is as bound to the knight as the knight is bound to the king! And if the king is stuck in the centre Black has an advantage.
 [ N f3 ]  [ e5 ] , [ d4 ]  I pull a reverse Scandinavian Defense.
 [ B g6 ]  [ N c4 ] , [ N e4 ]  14......[ N b d7 ] developing is better even though the move played allows an eventual [ b5 ] after the double exchange of minor pieces. EA. Houdini gives this as +1.58 for white preferring 14.....[ R e8 ] +0.90 14.....[ N b d7 ] +1.00
 [ Q h4 + ] , [ Q g3 ]  And now that black has gotten his knight into the game he can trade queens the weak pawns on [ f3 ] and [ g4 ] that were enticed to those squares will give black a winning endgame.
 [ B a6 ]  [ R e3 ] , [ R a e8 ]  A better move would have been [ R f e8 ] and then move the a-rook to [ d8 ] attacking my central pawn.
 [ R x h4 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ R f4 ]  ! This forces trades which helps the Black side
 [ Q b8 ] , [ e6 ]  ! the bone in black's throat and the real point behind Nb5. The B controls [ e7 ] and the N will be able to control [ e8 ] from either [ c7 ] or d6. That makes the pawn on [ e6 ] fatal for black.
 [ B x f2 + ]  [ R x f2 ] , [ Q x f2 + ]  Mate in...
 [ K g6 ] , [ N x d4 ]  Like i thought.
 [ h5 ] , [ Q d7 ]  Increasing the pressure against [ g4 ] as originally planned with 25...Qc7.
 [ a5 ] , [ Q c3 + ]  ? bad move (I only realised it a couple of move latter) now white plays [ e5 ] and can shift his queen from [ g5 ] and [ e7 ] and achieves a fortress the outcome of this game should be a draw now...
 [ h3 ] , [ B x f3 ]  Against the logic I decided to take with the knight since it was a little blocked where it was and it wasn't my intention to play c4.
 [ B a5 ] , [ R e d1 ]  Ra1-[ d1 ] might be worth a look but black is beginning to ask more and more questions and it all comes from your weak pawns and slow development
 [ R x a3 ]  [ b x a3 ] , [ f5 ]  Unlike before I don't know why Fred played this. My guess would be to put pressure on the f file.
 [ B g7 ] , [ e5 ]  Bishop threatens so I push forward. They say pawns increase in value as they push further across the board. I am inclined to agree...especially once they reach the other side. ............................................................................. capanson1973: Black is fine.. the [ e5 ] pawnpush is premature. [ N f3 ] (for instance) is better. ............................................................................. You're probably right as the opening seemed to backfire early on. I'll give [ N f3 ] a try next time I think.
 [ a4 ] , [ K a6 ]  White realises that he's had enough and resigned. Exhausting but fun. Please rate the game if you got this far. Cheers D
 [ Q b2 ] , [ Q a8 ]  Obviously hoping to delay the match intending to sacrifice a Rook to stop promotion rather than a Queen. However a poor move showing the pressure has finally got to my opponent. I believe 32...[ N d7 ] to be the best following the line 33.[ e6 ] fx[ e6 ] 34.[ B x e6 + ] Rx[ e6 ] 35.Rxe6.
 [ Q g6 + ]  [ K h8 ] , [ R f1 ]  White has to desist. 39.Bxe5?? lost quickly.
 [ R g4 ]  [ K x h5 ] , [ R f4 ]  Hoping that I will exchange rooks which of course I can't do or otherwise I can't stop promotion.
 [ N x d5 ] , [ N h4 ]  20. [ N x d5 ] .... White happy to exchange and wittle down Black's defence but again Black is his own worst enemy and plays for a higher piece..... [ N h4 ]  [ B x f3 ] , [ R x c8 ]  23. [ B x f3 ] [ R x c8 ]  [ B x b7 ]  [ R b8 ] , [ c6 ]  Appropriately like Whites first five moves is from a pawn and may have been the deal-breaker for conceding. 24. [ B x b7 ] [ R b8 ] 25 c6..... I hope this was of interest to enthusiasts of both disciplines
 [ K b2 ]  [ f4 ]  [ R f1 ]  [ g5 ]  [ h x g5 ] , [ h x g5 ]  We're taking action now!
 [ g x f6 ]  [ N e d2 ] , [ f5 ]  wants f4!
 [ B e3 ]  [ N c5 ]  [ R d e1 ]  [ Q d8 ] , [ R b c1 ]  [ a4 ] might have done something...
 [ Q d6 + ] , [ K c3 ]  forced...
 [ R e a8 ]  [ N d4 ] , [ a x b4 ]  black wisely goes into a line that removes some heavy pieces of the board. However is it enough?
 [ c x d5 ]  [ Q x d5 ] , [ Q b5 + ]  Trading queens
 [ R c8 ]  [ B x e6 + ]  [ f x e6 ] , [ R a c1 ]  Threatening a quick mate. if 19... QxB 20 QxNP ch is devastating.
 [ B e2 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N g4 ]  [ h3 ] , [ N f6 ]  Think the game is even at this point!
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ] , [ N f3 ]  this game comes from my first games as still 1200...
 [ R x c7 ]  [ R h2 + ]  [ K e1 ] , [ K e3 ]  Harrwitz resigns. If he doen't move the Bishop he loses the piece: if he moves the B out of danger R-[ R8 ] mates him.
 [ Q d6 + ] , [ K c4 ]  This is the safest square to avoid forks
 [ N d2 ] , [ Q b5 ]  Support to the bishop and also attacking the [ b2 ] pawn
 [ B x f6 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ N d5 ] , [ B g4 ]  Here I thought I was being quite sneaky.
 [ K f7 ] , [ Q c7 + ]  this is it!
 [ N c6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ d5 ]  Seems to be a mistake Lets my knight take a central position.. And keep it a bit
 [ c6 ]  [ d5 ]  [ B x c3 ]  [ b x c3 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ B x d5 ] , [ N c6 ]  Black can't play [ Q x d5 ] as I would just play [ Q x d5 ]  [ B x c6 + ]  [ K e7 ] , [ B a3 + ]  Black resigns as mate will soon follow with 15...[ Q d6 ] 16.[ B x d6 + ] [ K x d6 ] 17.[ R a d1 + ] [ K c7 ] 18.[ B x a8 ] [ b5 ] 19.Qb7#. This is just warm up annotation latter I will go in great detail on strategy
 [ B x f6 ] , [ Q x d5 ]  now I want to exchange and take the second pawn if it is possible.
 [ d x e5 ] , [ N e4 ]  If white exchanges the knight the pawn wall in the center would be a headache for both players but white's queenside will reveal all its weakness since the dsb is caged kinside. No white doesn't have to wait for that: it is very important now white takes the initiative in a rather surprising way:
 [ N f3 ]  [ a6 ]  [ c3 ] , [ b5 ]  true to the Sicilian Black starts to conquer the Queens' wing...
 [ Q a8 + ]  [ K c7 ]  [ Q x h8 ] , [ Q c6 + ]  After winning a rook I realize that my king better tighten up his laces because he's about to start doing a lot of running.
 [ B x d3 ]  [ Q x d3 ] , [ R c8 c3 ]  attacks my queen
 [ B x e3 ]  [ d x e3 ] , [ Q e2 ]  [ Q x d7 ] [ R x d7 ] [ B x c6 ] [ b x c6 ] would have gave me a nice position. But I didn't like that e pawn. Black was doing fine at this point.
 [ B d6 ] , [ B d3 ]  I load up on his [ h7 ] square pinning his knight in defense.
 [ Q c3 ] , [ e5 ]  Threatening mate at once. I thought about what to do and almost played 22...Qxd3?? At the time I didn't realize that would've allow him to pull a swindle since I would've lost my Q which is really bad. With that being said I didn't refrain from this for the best reason at all. The only reason for my decision not to take on [ [ d3 ] ] is because if I take the R he's in check which leaves me more then a R up. And on top of it I can still stop the threat which will happen. Had 22...[ Q x a1 + ] not been an intermediate check I would've gone wrong since it would've lead to me capturing on [ [ d3 ] ] instead. As that was the only other thing I had considered as bad as it sounds.
 [ O-O ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ N b d7 ] , [ O-O ]  This move surprised me as White had the option to castle Queenside and could've easily started a pawn storm.
 [ a6 ]  [ B a4 ]  [ g6 ] , [ c3 ]  With a Knight on [ e7 ] [ B x c6 ] is still not attractive so White's Bishop will need an escape route. Also as an added bonus [ c3 ] keeps Black's Knight off of b4/d4. White's Q-side Knight and Bishop are a bit hemmed in but after [ d4 ] they should be able to effectively develop.
 [ B d3 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ] , [ N x e5 ]  White's central pawns have fallen and Black is a pawn to the good. White does have more development but I think Black has the edge for now.
 [ R b8 ]  [ c3 ] , [ N c2 ]  he goes ahead and moves here figuring to take 1 rook and my bishop
 [ Q h7 ]  [ R g1 ]  [ Q x h3 + ]  [ N h2 + ] , [ K h8 ]  38. ........ [ K h8 ] - here I wave the white flag on the grounds of unavoidable mate on [ g2 ] or [ h2 ] and there is no way I can try and get a perpetual with Glenda and my other rook all bottled up on the queenside. A sorry end. Hope you have enjoyed this lesson. For further examples of this type of attack I would recommend you read J N Walker's Attack on the King which devotes a chapter to how locking up the centre can lead to mating attacks on the enemy king when you castle on the same side as your opponent. If your opponent's pieces are locked in on the other side of the board you can afford to expose your king here. A cautionary tale however is that if the centre is not locked then you may be punished for moving pawns in front of your castled king as Glenda has netted a few lower rated victims that way! Anyhow I will not give up the fight one day I will get my first half point against an Expert! Unitl then I will keep smiling. Cheers - Joanne
 [ f x g5 + ]  [ K e7 ] , [ R f7 + ]  19. [ R f7 ] - now a fork!
 [ f6 ]  [ B h4 ]  [ g5 ] , [ B g3 ]  The bishop arrives at [ g3 ] and Black now has pawns at [ f6 ] and g5. The question is: does that help White or Black? My thinking is that it helps Black since it restricts the [ f3 ] knight. It does seem to loosen Black's kingside.
 [ R x h1 ]  [ N x c4 ]  [ Q b3 ] , [ Q e6 ]  threatening the knight. it can only drop back to [ g1 ] which loses
 [ Q d8 ] , [ Q c3 ]  Ron was ready to do more damage. At the time I would've overlooked but this is more then just a fork since that would be stopped by my Q. But it would rather be in 3 says. And if Ron is successful he wouldn't just win a pawn but another piece.
 [ R h1 ]  [ B x g2 ]  [ R x h2 ]  [ B f3 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ N g1 ] , [ B g4 ]  Black wants to keep this bishop as white has a weakness on white squares
 [ B x f6 ]  [ h5 ]  [ g x h5 ] , [ R x h5 ]  Black's king is now exposed.
 [ N c6 ]  [ B x h5 ]  [ g x h5 ]  [ f5 ]  [ B d7 ] , [ f6 + ]  I thought this to be the best continuation as he's unable to move the Pawn-[ f7 ] forced to the back eighth row and rooks remain out of play. King-[ g6 ] seem suicidal
 [ c x d5 ] , [ b3 ]  Oh no. [ R e1 ] is a really good move here because if black does not interpose white can play NxP[ g6 + ] (discovered check by the rook). When black deals with that N[ x R h8 ] for further advantage. Black will respond to P[ b3 ] with [ B g7 ] and white's "a" rook will be threatened or the white knight pinned.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ Q x d5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ Q d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ Q e2 ]  [ B x f3 ] , [ g x f3 ]  thinnk about your pawn structure. why not qxf3?
 [ N b d2 ]  [ R a6 ] , [ N b3 ]  A dubious move because I get a tempo with [ a4 ] so White has wasted time with that maneuver. I gain some time advancing my pawns on the queenside so I get a slight initiative. White has delayed attacking on the kingside so my attack comes first.
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ b3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B a3 ] , [ d6 ]  as stated earlier i like to keep [ d6 ] for when enemy black bishop comes into play. my style of play leaves me Well open to the knight [ c7 ] attack it is important to castle quickly
 [ N h4 ]  [ Q f1 ]  [ R a d8 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ Q d4 + ]  [ K h1 ] , [ N f5 ]  25. ....... [ N f5 ] (over the next few moves black consolidates his position and has two heavy pieces on the d file - I double up on the e pawn with Qe2. Black defends with [ Q d2 ] and the queens are then exchanged.
 [ Q d7 ]  [ Q x c4 ]  [ B a6 ] , [ Q b3 ]  This is one of many reasons why I didn't like playing [ Q a4 ] just yet
 [ B h4 ] , [ c5 ]  I saw this move in other games but was not sure if it was good in this case. It does prevent [ d4 ] but on the other side it gives White the strong [ [ d5 ] ] square (he can't use it right now but this may become a factor in the future) and also prevents Black from playing ...[ [ d5 ] ] himself. Maybe 13...[ c6 ] was preferable to prepare ...d5. It does close in the light-square bishop for the moment but that piece is biting on granite anyway.
 [ B e7 ] , [ d4 ]  3. [ d4 ] - after black's somewhat conservative choice I then followed up with d4.
 [ f x e3 ] , [ B x e3 ]  The beauty of this position is that as long as I can maintain it white can't castle.
 [ N e7 + ]  [ K b8 ]  [ N x c6 + ]  [ Q x c6 ] , [ Q d8 + ]  ??? white blackout . Bg5!! followed by [ h4 ] is the plan f.e. [ Q b5 ] 25.[ B c1 ] a5!
 [ N f3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ B d3 ] , [ N e4 ]  The black knight finds a hole in white's wall and invites the white bishop to an exchange.
 [ K f1 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ N d2 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ R g1 ] , [ h6 ]  White is forced to take my Knight now unless they want to throw away their DSB. It doesn't do me that much good... ... What I really want to do is put some pressure on White's LSB.
 [ R f1 ] , [ Q g6 ]  now she's ready...
 [ R c8 ] , [ B d6 ]  19. [ B d6 ] - now a bishop trade is on the cards.
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ a6 ] , [ B g5 ]  As I've noted before I've taken a shine again to this all out assault on the Najdorf however well-trodden it is.
 [ K g2 ]  [ Q d2 + ] , [ K f3 ]  A desperate try that fails to...
 [ B x d5 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ Q x d5 ] , [ Q g6 + ]  26. ........ [ Q g6 + ] - considering a move to [ e4 ] and offering a trade of queens. By moving his king to [ b3 ] he ensures that I force the exchange of queens.
 [ N g f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ g3 ] , [ B d6 ]  Black intends to play aggressively and can get a very solid game with a lot of dynamic chances as long as he follows up with the correct development plan.
 [ B d2 ] , [ R x b1 ]  Seemed the best thing to do I can always go back for the bishop.
 [ K b7 ] , [ Q b5 ]  Black resigns. Even though black was significantly ahead in both development and positioning entering the endgame by using a timely trade White was able to create a winning conclusion. Remember there are exceptions to every rule especially in Chess.
 [ R x b2 ] , [ B d5 ]  Closing the open file and protecting the e pawn at little risk because black has no more pawns available to fire the bishop.
 [ Q x c3 + ]  [ K b1 ] , [ B f5 ]  fishing for a mate if white takes the bishop Black plays 35 ...[ Q c2 ] 36 [ K a1 ] [ B f6 ] #7 [ B e5 ] BXB 38 QxB QxN.
 [ d4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ c4 ] , [ Q f6 ]  Why the queen so fast?
 [ B x e7 ] , [ N x e7 ]  Material is still even. White has some need for development and a coordination of pieces. Black is a little closer to completing development but also has a need to coordinate pieces. Black does have inline rooks while white does not. Not a big factor at the moment but the [ f4 ] rook is hanging.
 [ R f e1 ] , [ N f5 ]  Avoiding the draw again after ...[ g4 ]  [ R c3 ] , [ e3 ]  very complicated and dangerous move by black.
 [ Q x h7 ]  [ R x h7 ]  [ K f3 ]  [ K b7 ]  [ g4 ]  [ K c6 ]  [ K e4 ] , [ R h8 ]  My plan is of course to drive the Knight first and then to advance the RP to clear the way for the NP. I am threatening check on K sq winning the Knight so the latter must now move.
 [ c4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ e3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ a6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ e x d4 ] , [ h6 ]  6....[ N f6 ] develops and fights for the center.
 [ e3 ] , [ Q a5 ]  Was a bit surprised. This probably is also theory. Certainly this is played a lot. It's one of the benefits of [ N d7 ] (or Be7) that the queen is not tied to defending [ f6 ] in order to prevent a doubled pawn on the f-file
 [ Q e6 ] , [ B g5 ]  remember me saying he is better developed
 [ e x f6 ]  [ N x f6 ]  [ N e5 ] , [ d6 ]  I am not sure what black can do at this point. The fork at [ N g6 ] ensures that black cannot castle and trades a knight for a bishop in a game without strong diagonal pawn lines. Diagonal pawn lines constrain bishops in ways that don't constrain knights. So this trade is definitely in the favor of white. This move also makes [ e6 ] a weak pawn. Which will be exploited as soon as the knight is out of danger
 [ e4 ]  [ b6 ] , [ N c3 ]  Preemptively guarding the KP against Black's fianchetto.
 [ R h2 ] , [ N f5 ]  Black demands a high price for that h-pawn. I had set its value by now at higher than the two White passers. Could that value be realised? Let's see!
 [ R d1 ]  [ R b2 b1 ] , [ Q f3 ]  If 24. [ Q g4 ] I most probably would have played 24...[ R x d1 + ] 25. [ Q x d1 ] Rb1. However another move is better because it forces mate in 7. Can you spot it and the mate?
 [ N f5 ] , [ B h3 ]  Indirectly defending [ e3 ] and [ h4 ] because of the pin on the knight on f5. 40.[ R e1 ] N(either)x[ h4 ] 41.Nx[ h4 ] Nxh4.
 [ d6 ]  [ h3 ] , [ B e6 ]  The [ d5 ] square is weak due to black's advanced c and e pawns. Black is forced to defend it with pieces rather than pawns. I played this move thinking to prevent N[ d5 ] but realized a move later that it encourages white to occupy it since Nx[ d5 ] cx[ d5 ] forks black's knight and bishop. [ B f5 ] is better.
 [ Q x e4 + ]  [ N x e4 ] , [ f4 ]  And here White returns the favour; 43. [ K f3 ] might even win. I've looked at a couple of lines and it seems Black will have to give the knight for the pawn for instance 43. [ K f3 ] [ N d6 ] 44. [ K f4 ] [ K g6 ] 45. [ K e5 ] [ N c4 + ] 46. Ke6.
 [ N c3 ]  [ B c4 ] , [ R d4 ]  44. [ R d4 ] - trying to remain as active as possible.
 [ R e6 ] , [ Q f1 ]  This move brings the queen back in play with an additional mate opportunity
 [ R x e8 ]  [ K x e8 ]  [ R c8 + ]  [ K f7 ]  [ a8 = Q ]  [ R x a8 ] , [ R x a8 ]  At this point the programmers stopped the game since the win is obvious even to us mortals. A daunting game where White played with a single idea to promote a passed pawn. For this he sacrificed two pawns one just to open a file for his second rook. Everything worked out great for Rybka and after seeing a game like this one has to wonder what chance could a human player against such an unfathomable strategy?
 [ R a3 ]  [ K d8 ] , [ R c a1 ]  Doubling the rooks.
 [ R c1 ]  [ K f3 ]  [ R c2 ] , [ R d4 ]  good move after i reached my king to be close enough to stop blacks pawns . the idea of .49.[ R d4 ] is after.50. Nxc2- dxc2.51.[ R x c4 ] and black cannot defend longer his pawns there for he has nothing to do but to resign . black resigns . thank you i hope you enjoy my game .
 [ N f3 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ N x e5 ] , [ B d6 ]  Ah looking to recovering some material... but...
 [ c6 ] , [ Q d2 ]  (?) I wanted to attack the b4-knight with the threat of c5(!) forcing the bishop to undefend the knight. But this move allows you to attack my queen gaining development for you. I could have played [ Q e1 ] with the same benefit without you being able to attack the queen.
 [ N x e1 + ]  [ R x e1 ]  [ f5 ]  [ e3 ]  [ R a2 ]  [ N c4 ]  [ N e4 ] , [ e x d4 ]  He made this move and then said "Crap!"
 [ Q d5 ]  [ Q e7 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N g x e5 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ N b5 ]  [ B b6 ]  [ f4 ]  [ c6 ]  [ Q x e5 ]  [ Q x e5 ]  [ f x e5 ]  [ c x b5 ] , [ c x b5 ]  Down a pawn but white is doubled. Black will also regain the pawn as white cannot protect both [ e3 ] and [ e5 ] before black castles and plays Re8.
 [ B f6 ]  [ Q h6 ] , [ Q e7 ]  I want to start my attack and get ready to castle.
 [ R e7 ] , [ g7 # ]  Kind of an odd finish. White has three pieces that never moved and checkmates with a pawn. I hope you enjoy the game please rate and any comments would be appreciated.
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ B b4 ]  Nimzo Indian Defence one of my favorite openings.
 [ R d b8 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ R e7 ]  [ R d1 ]  [ R d7 ]  [ R x d7 + ] , [ N x d7 ]  23. ..... [ N x d7 ] - one pair of rooks have been traded but white can now increase the tension.
 [ d x e5 ] , [ N d2 ]  White prevents the pawn's further advance and possibly prepares an advance by his f-pawn. I could also see that the N was probably aiming to go via [ e4 ] to [ d6 ] which looked like a nuisance but I felt I could live with it.
 [ Q g1 + ]  [ K e2 ]  [ Q f2 + ]  [ K d3 ] , [ Q b2 ]  black has managed to bring the white King out in the open...
 [ K f2 ]  [ h3 ]  [ K g3 ]  [ B x f7 ]  [ K g2 ]  [ B d5 + ]  [ K g3 ] , [ K c8 ]  now my knight's fine
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ g6 ] , [ B f4 ]  A peculiar looking move. Some players tend to go overboard when their opponent plays something out of the ordinary trying to refute moves that they think are not in accordance to the position to the point of ruining their own position on the process. I have to confess I am guilty of this sin and have lost many a game by over-pushing and trying to castigate strange moves.
 [ R e c8 ] , [ R d7 + ]  and BOOM - the checkmate is now (almost) inevitable
 [ Q x c7 + ]  [ R x c7 ]  [ B b6 ]  [ R d7 ]  [ K f2 ] , [ N c8 ]  I would have played 31...[ B g7 ] before ...[ N c8 ] to try and avoid the mess on the dark squares that results from this move and before the bishop gets stuck to the defense of d6.
 [ R x h7 ] , [ B x g5 ]  My last kingside pawn is captured by rook at [ h7 ] and I move my DB out to g5.
 [ N a5 ]  [ Q b5 + ]  [ c6 ]  [ N x c6 ]  [ N x c6 ] , [ Q x c6 + ]  this just increases the material edge
 [ d5 ] , [ N e7 ]  this move made me see visions of chasing the Queen - since her road is blocked thus ...
 [ Q e7 ] , [ Q c6 + ]  Don't want to trade queens
 [ f6 ] , [ K b1 ]  A waiting move to see what black has planned
 [ Q x c2 ] , [ Q x b7 # ]  Mate. I think Black's biggest problem in this game was making too many careless mistakes and taking risks without considering every possible outcome thereby allowing me to take pieces and gain an advantage early on. Also by focusing on taking my pawns with the queen Black essentially killed off the queen and made the queen useless when it came down to forcing mate.
 [ N f7 ]  [ g8 = Q ]  [ B x g8 ]  [ K e4 ] , [ N x h6 ]  And finally here we are. I asked berbatov here to play till the end as I planned to annotate this ending. He graciously obliged. He himself was curious how to finish this as he wasn't sure it can be done either.
 [ Q c1 ]  [ R x a1 ]  [ Q x a1 ]  [ B x f3 ] , [ g x f3 ]  My pawn structure gets smashed...
 [ B g5 ] , [ R a e1 ]  But when he takes I'll get something in return. After which the plan is similar to before and involves some nasty threats.
 [ a x b4 ] , [ N x b4 ]  The pressure begins to build...
 [ N x e5 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ Q f6 ]  [ B x f8 ]  [ K x f8 ] , [ R e3 ]  Getting ready for another sacrifice.
 [ B c4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N a4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ B b5 + ]  [ B d7 ]  [ Q e2 ]  [ a6 ]  [ B x d7 + ]  [ Q x d7 ] , [ N c5 ]  i guess you could call this his blunder but me not taking his N with my B is a real blunder by me...I suppose I was caught in the moment it happens OTB
 [ g6 ] , [ N h6 ]  Pawns are easily blocked and with white's bishop on white squares unless his king can attack the pawn on [ g7 ] he is powerless.
 [ N f6 ]  [ g3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ B g2 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ O-O ]  White can always play d2-[ d4 ] and transpose to a King's Indian but if I wanted to play that I'd play 1.d4.
 [ B g4 ]  [ h3 ]  [ B h5 ] , [ d3 ]  My pawn push is stopped.
 [ R x f4 ]  [ N e2 ]  [ R g4 + ] , [ N g3 ]  24. [ g3 ] - now Henry is safe - at least for a while and I really am threatening Ra8+.
 [ R a1 ] , [ e3 ]  Why support the d-pawn? So black can advance the much more practical e-pawn without losing the d-pawn in the process.
 [ a5 ]  [ b x a5 ]  [ R x a5 ]  [ R e5 ]  [ b4 ] , [ N h4 ]  30.[ a4 ] is better.
 [ B c6 ]  [ N g4 ] , [ d5 ]  ! Pushing the bishop back to a2.
 [ c3 ]  [ c4 ]  [ B c2 ] , [ N f6 ]  Maybe a stronger move here would've been [ B g4 ] pinning the knight?
 [ Q h5 ] , [ h3 ]  Dangerous but best.
 [ Q x e4 ]  [ B x e4 ]  [ B a3 + ] , [ K b1 ]  Know I played this hoping he would play [ N x c3 + ] overlooking the knight because of the fork of king and rook.
 [ g x f5 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ Q x a1 ] , [ B x h4 ]  Black has won the exchange plus 2 pawns.
 [ K x g7 ] , [ h3 ]  so this means I have to play the bishop back home [ B c8 ] [ B d7 ] or Be6? all seams bad choices what if [ Q h5 ] is [ f3 ] playable all white's king's wing pawns will be on light squares...
 [ e3 ] , [ c5 ]  Now this is very optimistic. If such freeing moves for black could be played as early as the third move in a major opening complex such as a reversed Queens Gambit Declined (after 'freeing' the QB with Bf5) then the advantage of the first move couldn't reasonably be considered an 'advantage'.
 [ e x d5 ] , [ c x d5 ]  Now black's pawns are undoubled and he seems to have gained a tempo since both sides have one piece developed but black has the only pawn in the center.
 [ K e3 ] , [ N d5 + ]  31. .................... [ N d5 ] - NOW! - At the end of this rudimentary king hunt there is a vicious knight fork which will win white's queen. Ding dong at last the Wicked Witch is dead! White throws in the sponge. Time for tea and then Round 3.
 [ Q c2 ] , [ N f4 ]  In the game I adopted the rather weak plan of trying to chase the light bishop trade with it and try to ride the slightly better pawn structure to victory. As a result the game is not really going anywhere for a while.
 [ R x d4 ]  [ h x g5 ] , [ h x g5 ]  Ok now I am under two but... black has to be a very tecnical player to win if I play accuraately.
 [ N c3 + ]  [ K a1 ] , [ b2 # ]  Checkmate with a pawn is not something I have often seen but I was quite pleased with this one. Thanks for reading please comment and suggest improvements
 [ Q g3 ]  [ R d e7 ]  [ R f1 ]  [ d4 ]  [ R d1 ]  [ Q b6 ]  [ Q f2 ] , [ N g7 ]  If White takes cxd ...Qxb with some direct threats (with all those rooks)
 [ Q d6 ]  [ B x b7 ] , [ N e2 + ]  this does not accomplish anything.
 [ R g1 ] , [ N x c3 ]  obviously he won't take my knight as i would then come down and check him with my queen. He'd then have to move his king. Although having said that he can't really castle anymore anyway
 [ K f1 ] , [ R x g3 ]  Now if he takes the Rook (or does any else pawn move for that matter) he can't stop me from promotion with 43 ... Kd2. If he chooses 43. [ K e1 ] instead then it is checkmate with 43 ... Kg1#.
 [ K e8 ]  [ e x f5 ]  [ R c8 ]  [ Q g8 + ]  [ K e7 ] , [ Q g7 + ]  and black resigns because of White's un stoppable F pawn marsh to the crown . thank you ...
 [ Q h6 ]  [ B x c5 ]  [ R x d1 + ] , [ R x d1 ]  now its 4 on 2
 [ B g4 ]  [ h3 ] , [ B x f3 ]  This exchange helps me as I now secure my Pawn plus with the completion of it.
 [ N x c6 ] , [ B x c6 ]  White does it for me. How nice.
 [ R e7 ] , [ Q c6 ]  So then... is it really true that White can be saved from the draw? Here is where I'll end the annotation- too many combinations derive from the perpetuals to try to recreate. Did Kasparov have a draw here or is it theoretically possible for White to have stopped it? Thanks for reading the annotation for tolerating my lower-level opinions and I would love your feedback! :)
 [ R x a8 ]  [ O-O ] , [ f6 ]  considered [ B h3 ] yet there was not enough material to substantiate the attack
 [ c4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ d4 ]  [ B b4 ]  [ e3 ]  [ c5 ]  [ B d2 ]  [ O-O ]  [ a3 ]  [ B x c3 ]  [ B x c3 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ R c1 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ d x c5 ]  [ N d x c5 ]  [ B d4 ] , [ B g4 ]  Blunder simply giving away the N on c5. Correct was [ N e6 ]  [ B x c5 ]  [ B x f3 ]  [ g x f3 ]  [ N x c5 ] , [ R x c5 ]  Leaving black with an isolated central pawn and no developed pieces
 [ B x b5 ] , [ K e3 ]  bringing king to centre for active play
 [ N a4 ]  [ R x a6 + ]  [ K b7 ]  [ R e6 ]  [ R d7 ]  [ c4 ]  [ b x c4 ]  [ K c2 ] , [ R d3 ]  The positioning of black's pieces is very strong here.
 [ Q x g4 ] , [ B x a3 ]  connecting the rooks with tempo... this could be a good move in normal conditions but Black is 4 points down! [or he just saw that White could exchange the bishop anyway)
 [ N c3 ]  [ Q a5 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ e6 ] , [ Q f3 ]  I haven't seen this move often but its still book I'm not clear of the purpose of this move for white
 [ B a6 ]  [ g3 ] , [ O-O-O ]  This move is to hazardous. Black castles queenside too risky with removed pawns in front of the King! Not to recommend!
 [ a6 ]  [ K d3 ]  [ a7 ]  [ K c3 ] , [ a8 = Q ]  Too late!
 [ Q d6 ] , [ N b d2 ]  I'm not really sure what 6. ... [ Q [ d6 ] ] was about. My pawn at [ d3 ] is twice defended and awkward for him to get even a 2nd attacker on it. Maybe he didn't want me to threaten his queen with 7. [ B g5 ] but it seems to me he could easily play [ Q [ d6 ] ] when and if I play [ B g5 ] - it didn't seem necessary to run away beforehand. As played black seems to be losing a tempo for no real gain. Now there is little point to 7. [ B g5 ] so I bring out my knight first looking at [ c4 ] as a good home for a knight maybe even gaining another tempo as I chase away the black queen that didn't need to move to [ d6 ] in the first place.
 [ c x d4 ]  [ c x d4 ] , [ B b4 + ]  The incovinient of 6.Na3. Now white has to choose if they wanna get in a position which they are one pawn down or give up castling.
 [ R g1 + ]  [ K h4 ]  [ R x g8 ]  [ K h3 ]  [ R g3 + ]  [ K h4 ]  [ K g2 ]  [ f5 ]  [ R g6 ]  [ e5 ]  [ R d6 ]  [ R d2 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ d4 ]  [ R d5 ]  [ R e2 ]  [ K f1 ]  [ R b2 ]  [ R x e5 ] , [ f4 ]  ? What was wrong with RxPb3? That forces white to move or protect the bishop after which P[ f4 ] works. It will take white two bishop moves to threaten Ph5.
 [ Q f7 ] , [ c3 ]  Now my consolidation is complete. I don't mind if he swaps his active N for my passive B.
 [ R a e8 ]  [ R x e2 ]  [ R x e2 ] , [ R c7 ]  this move seamed good to me at the time but i hadn't thought about this position long enough before moving.
 [ B x f3 ]  [ Q x f3 ]  [ R a7 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ R d7 ] , [ R e4 ]  Looking towards attacking the k-side. EA. Houdini prefers 19.[ Q b3 ] +1.75 compared to +1.31 for 19.[ R e4 ] but by this stage I had tunnel vision towards a K-side attack.
 [ B x e4 ]  [ B x h6 ]  [ B x h6 ] , [ R a1 ]  Both 19. [ Q x h6 ] and 19. [ R e1 ] are almost as good.
 [ B x c6 + ]  [ b x c6 ]  [ h3 ]  [ B x f3 ]  [ N x f3 ]  [ Q f6 ] , [ d3 ]  from here the journey begins...
 [ d x e3 ] , [ B x e3 ]  11...Bxe3! The Bishop on [ e3 ] assumes a very powerful if only temporary post.
 [ N c3 ]  [ a5 ]  [ a4 ] , [ c4 ]  20. ......... c4! Undermines protection on my a pawn. I now try to evacuate Henry from the queenside but Ion thinks this is a mistake. Can you the jury suggest a better alternative for me here?
 [ K f1 ]  [ N d6 ] , [ f3 ]  Looking to swap flanks. Maybe [ B x d6 ] [ K x d6 ] [ a4 ] is better
 [ R d8 d7 ]  [ N c8 ]  [ R d6 x d5 ]  [ R x d5 ]  [ R x d5 ]  [ N x a7 ]  [ R d8 ]  [ N b5 ]  [ R b8 ]  [ a4 ]  [ K g7 ]  [ f4 ]  [ K f6 ]  [ N c7 ]  [ R b7 ]  [ N a6 ]  [ K e7 ]  [ b5 ]  [ K d6 ]  [ K g3 ]  [ R e7 ]  [ K f2 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ a5 ]  [ R c8 ]  [ K e3 ]  [ K d5 ]  [ b6 ]  [ K c6 ]  [ N b4 + ]  [ K b7 ]  [ N d3 ] , [ R c4 ]  at this point Black offered a draw; which I gladly accepted sick of how this game turned out... no [ e4 ] [ e5 ] [ N f3 ] [ N c6 ] [ B c4 ] ever again; I will switch to [ B b5 ] walking Spanish...
 [ c5 ] , [ N x g6 ]  a good move that forces black to play defence and allows white time to play d4-[ d5 ] with a positionally won game.
 [ B x h3 ]  [ g x h3 ]  [ Q x h3 ]  [ N e2 ]  [ K h8 ]  [ N g3 ]  [ Q x g3 + ]  [ K h1 ]  [ Q h3 + ]  [ K g1 ]  [ R f g8 + ]  [ Q g5 ] , [ R x g5 # ]  
 [ d3 ] , [ N e7 ]  After 8. ...Nf6? 9. [ e5 ] embarrasses the knight back to g8.
 [ K d5 ] , [ K f4 ]  
 [ N a3 ]  [ B d5 ]  [ N b5 ]  [ Q g7 ]  [ R c1 ]  [ B b3 ]  [ Q f1 ]  [ R x c1 ]  [ Q x c1 ]  [ B x a4 ]  [ N c7 ]  [ Q d7 ]  [ N g3 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ N a8 ]  [ Q b7 ]  [ N x b6 ] , [ B x f4 ]  Alternative variation: 40... [ Q x b6 ] 41. [ Q c8 ] $11
 [ a6 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ N c4 ] , [ R c2 ]  moved here so he could not progress his pawn unless wanting to kill his knight. Possible [ f5 ] move
 [ O-O ]  [ N f3 ] , [ d5 ]  Holding the [ e4 ] square for the time being.
 [ e5 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ a3 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ Q b3 ]  [ N a5 ]  [ Q a4 + ] , [ c6 ]  11. ...... [ c6 ] - whew! This is a pretty sharp line here. This interposition however opens up a defensive line to my knight on a5. The defender is Glenda no less!
 [ e x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ Q f6 ]  this attempt to rapidly mobilize all the queenside pieces backfires. Best was that old move 6 ... Nf6.
 [ Q f2 + ]  [ K h3 ]  [ B f4 ] , [ R e3 ]  Now White has to give up the Rook for nothing to stave off mate.
 [ c x d4 ] , [ e x d4 ]  He is a move behind using the white squares but I can. Of course If I'd studied theory all this must find familiar. I'm not on the GK db and to look around is something I rarely allow myself to spend time on. I'm not a good student I know :-)
 [ Q c7 ] , [ h4 ]  ! both creating a hole for my King so that I don't have to worry about back rank mates and charging forward to attack the [ B g7 ] now that mate on [ g8 ] is again threatened.
 [ N f6 ] , [ N x e5 ]  In addition to gaining the pawn this threatens Nxf7.
 [ Q x c4 ]  [ Q x c4 + ] , [ K d1 ]  
 [ N d4 ] , [ R x d4 ]  Relatively best.
 [ c x d3 ] , [ N x d3 ]  I decided to take this with knight.
 [ K f6 ]  [ K g3 ]  [ K x f5 ]  [ B x f7 ] , [ K e5 ]  Black goes for the c-pawn to free his queenside pawns but abandons his h-pawn. He needs to stay in the vicinity of the h-pawn. White can't exactly make progress if Black does that but now White regains the advantage.
 [ c5 ] , [ B d2 ]  5. [ B d2 ] is my recommended variation .Yes black will win the [ d4 ] pawn but he is in for a wild ride .Let see
 [ d x c6 ]  [ N x c6 ]  [ B d5 ]  [ B b7 ] , [ N x e5 ]  13... [ N x e5 ] 14 [ B x b7 ] winning another pawn. Of course the [ N e5 ] also threatens the black queen.
 [ R x f2 ] , [ Q b3 ]  Thinking that I had some fight left I go after b7. I thought he'd defend anyhow but instead forces the liquidation and as noted leaves my monarch exposed. In addition I missed what the board was indicating similar to my game against bhidragon. That's because I knew his pieces were damaging but thought that in a sense they were useless. By useless I meant that I didn't they he could use them to deliver mate in this position. I was planning on how to counter that. But his pieces are much worse then they appear.
 [ R x e8 ] , [ B x b2 ]  hmmm i wonder if he thought it would simplify to this >< was that considered a real or sham queen sacrifice? now my goal is to connect my rooks ASAP!
 [ e x d5 ]  [ c x d5 ] , [ R e1 ]  That variation continues with this move. As the idea behind centralizing the Rook is because of what's about to follow.
 [ N f3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ c4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ e3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ a3 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ d4 ] , [ O-O ]  Early castling. So hoping to attack the white side quickly.
 [ K g1 ] , [ Q e1 # ]  Done ! White side is too aggressive. First need some covering for the King then one can attack the other.
 [ B h6 ] , [ N e4 ]  14. [ N e4 ] - my opponent's king is looking very draughty in the centre. Glenda is just itching to get onto d6. My opponent decides to give the [ [ f6 ] ] pawn back up with his king but still I take on [ [ f6 ] ] with Fou Lenoir.
 [ e x d5 ]  [ R x f5 ]  [ R b8 ]  [ b4 ] , [ R a8 ]  
 [ c6 ] , [ c3 ]  [ c4 ] doesn't give me much more. My aim is the white diagonal pointing to [ f7 ] of course.
 [ Q x a6 ] , [ f4 ]  Marching the pawn takes way too long
 [ K h8 ] , [ Q g5 ]  May as well move the Q over towards Black's K.
 [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ B g4 ]  An early attack and an attempt to pin my knight.
 [ N h6 ]  [ N d3 ] , [ b6 ]  He is aiming to stop my queen-side advance. Perhaps he should've been focusing more on his king-side play.
 [ d3 ] , [ a6 ]  i should have developed
 [ O-O ] , [ Q h4 ]  now I'm threatening mate. his only response can be [ h3 ]  [ h3 ]  [ N x f2 ] , [ Q h5 + ]  Huge mistake. [ R x f2 ] [ Q x g3 ] is feel bad but necessary at this point.
 [ K x h7 ]  [ Q h5 + ] , [ K g8 ]  From here [ Q x f7 ] and [ R h3 ] are just as effective.
 [ Q b7 ] , [ Q g2 ]  27. [ Q g2 ] - protecting the doubled and isolated f pawn and renewing the pin along the g file. I am now threatening [ R h g1 ] for a decisive double up on the g column.
 [ B x c6 ]  [ b x c6 ] , [ N e8 ]  Now it will take some tempoes for black to take the pawn... will I be able to use them?
 [ d5 ] , [ c4 ]  This opening is called the queen gambit. A versatile opening which immediatly questions the center and allows for solid development.
 [ e4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f d7 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c5 ] , [ B g5 ]  This internal league game between Gertjan Van der Hoeven and Rob Witt was played at the Dutch Club Caissa and was sent to me recently in relation to the opening. Some of the club's players are familiar with and have tested the opening in club matches. This particular one is a feast of tactical devices and is well worth studying. With the exception of the analysis to White's 16th move the notes are extracted from the game's annotation by Rob Witt.
 [ K b2 ]  [ N g5 ] , [ K a3 ]  Can he be trying to infiltrate c5? To what end?
 [ Q x h3 ] , [ Q e4 ]  I'm not sure why she played this but I'm going to throw in another check.
 [ a4 ] , [ c4 ]  Black applying correct principle that whenever you have pass pawn start pushing it immediately to the Queening square as opponent need to divert his pieces for stopping the pawn from Queening.
 [ N e5 ] , [ N x e5 ]  As intended.
 [ e x f4 ]  [ B x f4 ] , [ N f6 ]  Preparing to castle by developing on the K side.
 [ c4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ c x d5 ] , [ e x d5 ]  This was another good pawn trade for me: they are all connected once again and White's only pawn is immovable so I can get rid of it...
 [ K e4 ]  [ Q h1 + ]  [ K e3 ]  [ Q f1 ]  [ K f3 ] , [ K f6 ]  And black resigned. A well played game by my opponent up until 43...Kxe5. He was very gracious in defeat and a true gentleman. One of my better performances in quite a while:)
 [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ] , [ B b5 + ]  Moscow variation sicilian defense. Canal sokolsky is another name
 [ B x e6 ]  [ R x e6 ] , [ N d6 ]  Redeploying his N. I like the looks of 17...[ N b6 ] in this case given that both are back out I favor this move.
 [ N a6 ] , [ d4 ]  2.[ d4 ] - after my opponent responded with a Freddy-esque reply to my [ e4 ] with [ N a6 ] I just got on with making a strong pawn centre.
 [ N d5 ]  [ N x e4 ] , [ B f5 ]  my troops rush to the frontier line en-mass!!
 [ N x e4 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ B d2 ] , [ O-O ]  castles
 [ K b7 ] , [ R x c4 ]  So now I am luckily up a piece and am winning. The rest is straightforward: push the pawns force the Bishops to sacrifice themselves and mate the king.
 [ e x d5 ] , [ N x d5 ]  i win a pawn but he will equalize with better position... observe.
 [ e5 ] , [ N e7 ]  Usually transposes to the mainline.
 [ B x c5 ]  [ N x c5 ]  [ N g e4 ] , [ N x e4 ]  Why not? After this we are equal in developement.
 [ Q f5 ] , [ Q d5 ]  Pretty much forcing the Queens and the Knights to come off the board inching White's victory closer.
 [ d4 ] , [ d5 ]  Text book Caro-Kann defence.
 [ K h8 ] , [ N x f4 ]  I think 99% of the chess-playing population would have played 28.[ R a8 ] first.
 [ K b1 ]  [ R h1 + ]  [ K a2 ]  [ R a5 + ]  [ K b3 ]  [ R b5 + ]  [ K c3 ] , [ K b6 ]  For the moment Lasker continues to manoeuvre and probe without making any real progress. This is a natural part of the practical playing of such an ending. The pressure of the clock among other things means that such an approach is frequently inevitable.
 [ Q x d2 ] , [ N c6 ]  Developing my Knight and hitting the [ d4 ] pawn.
 [ Q f8 + ]  [ K g6 ]  [ Q d6 ] , [ h5 ]  This is about to be the last nail in the coffin. Now if 44. [ [ h4 ] ] black's plan is 44. ... [ K h7 ] followed by [ R c1 ] followed by [ Q g1 + ] and and Rc3+. If black plays 44. ... [ R c1 ] immediately then white can trade queens with [ Q g3 + ] which is still just as lost but maybe takes longer. So after 44. [ [ h4 ] ] [ K h7 ] 45. [ Q f4 ] [ R c1 ] 46. Rd3?! [ Q g1 + ] 47. [ K g3 ] [ R c4 ] 48. [ Q f2 ] [ R g4 + ] 49. [ K f3 ] [ R f4 + ]  [ Q f4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ R d1 ]  [ Q x d1 ]  [ Q x e5 ]  [ R c1 ]  [ Q e6 + ] , [ K g5 ]  47... [ K h7 ] is almost as good. 48. [ Q x f5 + ] [ K g8 ] 49. [ Q e6 + ] [ K h8 ] 50. [ Q e8 + ] [ K h7 ] 51. [ Q e3 ] (51. [ Q e5 ] [ h4 ] 52. [ Q f5 + ] [ K g8 ] 53. [ Q e6 + ] [ K h8 ] 54. [ Q e8 + ] Kh7) 51... [ h4 ]  [ Q e7 + ]  [ K f4 ]  [ Q d6 + ]  [ K e4 ]  [ Q e6 + ]  [ K d4 ]  [ Q x f5 ]  [ Q g1 + ]  [ K g3 ]  [ R c3 + ]  [ K h4 ]  [ Q x g2 ]  [ Q f4 + ] , [ Q e4 ]  
 [ e5 ] , [ B c4 ]  Bishop's Opening
 [ f x g6 ] , [ Q h3 ]  Poisonous. If Black advances the e-pawn he opens the f-file for White's artillery. On the other hand defending the pawn with 14...[ Q e7 ] loses material: 15.Nxd5! [ e x d5 ] 16.Bxh8. Black can hold with 14...[ Q f6 ] or 14...[ N f8 ] but neither of those are very enticing options.
 [ B h6 ]  [ R f7 ] , [ R d1 ]  30. [ R d1 ] - seizing the open file but ....
 [ e4 + ]  [ g3 ] , [ e3 ]  ...I sacrify the pawn in order to get my Q able to check. I sense it was the right thing to do...
 [ N x c7 ]  [ R x c7 + ]  [ K f6 ] , [ R x a7 ]  And this is I think and interesting endgame. Black is lost but white has to prove it... in a blitz.
 [ Q x c3 ] , [ R x c3 ]  My opponent should have kept the Queens on the board with some such move as 19 Q-N1. With my material advantage any simplifications help me.
 [ R d5 ]  [ R x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ N x d8 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ] , [ c x d4 ]  With the R on the e file Black's K can't get to the passed pawn.
 [ K e6 ]  [ K b6 ]  [ R g2 ]  [ a5 ]  [ R g8 ] , [ a6 ]  Black gives up. This was a fun game. Nice to win against a 1800+player also!
 [ R g8 + ]  [ K f1 ]  [ R g7 ]  [ N e7 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ c6 ]  [ N c7 ]  [ K g6 ]  [ N e8 ]  [ R h7 ]  [ N x d6 ]  [ R h1 + ]  [ K g2 ]  [ R a1 ]  [ N x b7 ]  [ R x a2 ]  [ R x e5 ]  [ R x b2 ]  [ K g3 ]  [ R x b7 ]  [ f4 ]  [ B f6 ]  [ R f5 ]  [ R b2 ]  [ R c5 ]  [ a5 ]  [ R x c6 ]  [ a4 ]  [ R a6 ]  [ R x c2 ]  [ R x a4 ]  [ R c3 + ]  [ K g4 ]  [ R c8 ]  [ f5 + ]  [ K h6 ]  [ R a6 ]  [ K g7 ]  [ K f4 ]  [ R c4 ]  [ R a8 ]  [ R c1 ]  [ e5 ]  [ R c4 + ]  [ K f3 ]  [ B x e5 ]  [ R a5 ]  [ R f4 + ]  [ K e3 ]  [ R x f5 ]  [ K e4 ]  [ R f1 ]  [ R x e5 ]  [ R e1 + ]  [ K f5 ]  [ R x e5 + ]  [ K x e5 ]  [ K g6 ]  [ K e4 ]  [ K g5 ]  [ K e5 ]  [ f5 ]  [ K d4 ]  [ K f4 ] , [ K d3 ]  
 [ Q d8 ] , [ R e1 ]  a poor use of the extra tempi. a more agressive move such as [ Q d2 ] might have been more interesting presumably this is in preparation for [ f4 ] so that after [ N x e3 ] [ R x e3 ] (NOT Nxe3?) the black queen cannot threaten via [ b6 ]  [ N x e3 ] , [ B d7 ]  a waste of time by black- what can the bishop do here that it couldn't have done from c8? pretty much nothing.
 [ B a5 + ] , [ K b7 ]  Ducking clear.
 [ e3 ]  [ b6 ] , [ f3 ]  I chose [ [ f3 ] ] here because of both your fianchetto and your N at f6. Ostensibly I can sort bay of your options for a moment with this move and still leave room for my B at [ d3 ] and the N at e2. I would expect either O-O or [ B b7 ] next from you. Coaching note: i see your reasoning but N[ [ f3 ] ] was still the better move. with [ [ f3 ] ] you disrupt the probable K defence when later you 0-0
 [ f3 ]  [ K e1 ]  [ N d1 ] , [ g5 ]  44. [ g5 ] - again a counter on the kingside but to no avail.
 [ K x g5 ]  [ B x g7 ]  [ e3 ]  [ B d4 ]  [ e2 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ B x b1 ]  [ B e3 + ]  [ R x e3 ] , [ f x e3 ]  I have 3 (maybe pawns against 2 bishops - no way.
 [ R x f6 ]  [ g x f6 ]  [ R c1 + ]  [ K d8 ]  [ Q b7 ]  [ Q d7 ] , [ Q b6 + ]  Forcing 33...[ K e7 ] then 34.[ R c7 ] wins the Queen and subsequently the game. So Black resigned.
 [ K x e6 ]  [ K e4 ]  [ K e7 ]  [ g4 ]  [ K e6 ]  [ g5 ]  [ K f7 ]  [ K f5 ]  [ K e7 ]  [ g6 ] , [ K f8 ]  He did his best to try and stop my pawn from promoting
 [ B b7 ] , [ N b d2 ]  normal development and eases pressure on knight (no doubles pawns)
 [ Q x d4 ] , [ N c3 ]  white contrasts the move on the Rook with a useful developing move
 [ d4 ] , [ Q x h7 + ]  Now however mate will follow [29... K-[ B1 ] 30 QxBP mate.] Black resigns.
 [ N x e4 ] , [ N f3 ]  At this point white must play [ N f3 ] or [ [ g3 ] ] to prevent Qh4+. (There might actually be other moves white can make. I haven't actually considered others yet. Let me know if you find others.) The pawn to [ [ g3 ] ] is definitely rubbish compared to [ N f3 ] since the latter develops a piece and clears the king side for castling. For those of you still very new to the King's Gambit consider what would happen if play went like this: 4. [ a3 ] Qh4+. What can white do in this situation? See if you can identify the permutations; it isn't too challenging.
 [ Q c2 ] , [ c5 ]  Looking to blast open some attacking lines.
 [ c x d5 ] , [ N x d5 ]  while this opens up the diagonal for the Indian B this loses points for black. maybe ...[ N b4 ] would have helped though the advancing pawns make white even more pleased
 [ a6 ]  [ c5 ]  [ a x b5 ] , [ c x d6 ]  I liked this exchange cause the pawn on [ d3 ] is now stranded and it is just a matter of time when it will fall. Meanwhile I opened my a-file for the Rook. This doesn't seem that relevant now but it will become very relevant later. From this point on I am actually looking to take advantage of this a-file opening.
 [ N g8 + ]  [ K g7 ] , [ R e7 + ]  
 [ Q e8 ]  [ Q c3 ] , [ N c6 ]  White respositions Queen to C3. Black moves NC6.
 [ N e7 ]  [ O-O ] , [ N f5 ]  Very good position for the knight! White needs to be careful for king-side attacks.
 [ K d4 ] , [ R f6 ]  He cannot check my king now It will be useless I can move my king forward to [ g6 ] or block with my rock as planned .
 [ B e8 ] , [ N g6 # ]  I didn't expect it to end so much but that's it
 [ R x e8 ] , [ a4 ]  So I am still interested in winning material but he will prevent that.
 [ c x d4 ]  [ e x d4 ] , [ Q x d4 ]  Now the board is owned by white
 [ B d3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N b d7 ] , [ a5 ]  ?! Taking [ b6 ] away from the [ N d7 ] but inaccurate as that N is ultimately better placed on either [ e5 ] or [ g6 ] (via f8). I should just continue developing with O-O.
 [ a5 ]  [ b x a5 ] , [ b x a5 ]  I decided to take with my pawn as [ a8 ] is white and black has no lsb it is also more tricky to get his knight into a useful position on that side which meant that I thought this pawn had some good chances to cause problems
 [ R x d8 + ]  [ K x d8 ] , [ B g5 + ]  this is the badness in Black's position for the move 17......[ R d8 ]  [ B f6 ] , [ B x f6 + ]  and this is not good the best is 20.[ R x f6 ] [ g x f6 ] 21.[ B x f6 + ] [ K e8 ] 22.............
 [ N c3 ] , [ c x d4 ]  White could have played 3. [ c4 ] to transpose into the Englsh or 3. [ d5 ] to continue with the standard Benoni lines. 3. [ N c3 ] is not found in any of my references so here we're deviating already from any reference I know though the GK DB still has some advice.
 [ R d1 + ]  [ N x d1 ]  [ B x d1 ] , [ K d2 ]  24. [ K d2 ] - Henry tries to run for the hills. However .......
 [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ e6 ] , [ N d2 ]  An interesting approach to playing the queen pawn system. It is my opinion that the knight is much better on [ c3 ] where it has greater control over what happens in the center. Also it does not block the DSB which in this game never leaves home base. The lesson to learn here is to always play the optimal move that gives your pieces their greatest scope. In the openning phase development should be your #1 priority.
 [ g5 ]  [ N d7 ] , [ h4 ]  So you see what I mean by reckless moves. Black should be able to punish my action on the kingside with an attack on my under-guarded queenside.
 [ R x h6 ]  [ R x a4 ]  [ h4 ] , [ K f4 ]  Much easy now..
 [ B g5 ]  [ h6 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ Q x f6 ] , [ B e4 ]  I am getting tired of him having his bishop on that long diagonal.
 [ c5 ] , [ B g2 ]  The database favors [ N c6 ] as a response.
 [ h5 ]  [ h3 ]  [ R b3 + ]  [ K g2 ]  [ K h6 ] , [ R d6 ]  Now I think I still have drawing chances if I can just frustrate Black long enough with pins and checks along the ranks - Black has to prove his win as I'm not going to give up without a fight. The computer evaluats the position over the next dozen moves as Black being slightly more than 2 pawns up but no more than that.
 [ K e2 ] , [ d x c3 ]  another piece dies
 [ h x g5 ]  [ N x g5 ] , [ N x d5 ]  A further massive weakening of his king's positions.
 [ K g1 ]  [ R g2 + ]  [ K f1 ]  [ R h2 ]  [ K g1 ] , [ R g2 + ]  I was happy to escape a losing position with a draw although somewhat fortunate. I thought I played fairly well in this game up until I blundered the Bishop. I think I was in a strong position to win the game until that point.
 [ K e2 ] , [ Q a5 ]  queens out now the rook gonna over up a free bishop
 [ N c3 ] , [ g6 ]  Black opts to delay castling so that a wing attack can be placed by [ B g7 ] which provides black some compensation in center control. White will have to keep in mind the x-ray attack on the [ a1 ] rook and the potential for an unguarded [ b2 ] pawn in that line of attack.
 [ Q c3 ]  [ a4 ]  [ B h3 ] , [ N e5 ]  [ N f6 ] was a better move here followed by 31 [ e5 ] [ N e4 ] 32 [ N x e4 ] [ Q b1 + ] 33 [ R f1 ] [ Q x e4 ]  [ d6 ]  [ f6 ]  [ d7 ]  [ R b8 ]  [ K g2 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B e6 + ]  [ K h7 ] , [ e5 ]  I should have played [ Q e3 ] here followed by 35...[ N d4 ] 36 [ B f5 ] [ Q b2 ] 37 [ N f3 ] [ Q b3 ] 38 [ Q f4 ] [ R d8 ] and a good advantage for white
 [ R f3 ]  [ N x e3 ] , [ R x e3 ]  White accepts the idea but this is bad for him. The knight on [ d4 ] is very vulnerable. If white is to accept the loss of the bishop pair why not do it on his own terms as suggested by 12. Bxd5?
 [ N e5 + ]  [ K e7 ]  [ R h7 + ]  [ K e6 ]  [ N g4 ] , [ h2 ]  !!
 [ Q g6 ] , [ B d3 ]  better was [ e x d6 ]  [ Q g3 ]  [ e x d6 ]  [ Q x d6 ]  [ Q x d6 ]  [ c x d6 ]  [ B e4 ]  [ R a e8 ]  [ R x d6 ]  [ B c8 ] , [ R a d1 ]  Now i got an open file all to me and an extra pawn.
 [ N c6 ] , [ N d2 ]  I think my intention was to push [ f4 ] to force the e pawn off and control the f file using my rook.
 [ d5 ]  [ B b2 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ e3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ B g4 ]  SF5 slightly prefers Bd6.
 [ R d h8 ] , [ N f5 ]  I figure that I would take advantage by attacking his Rook. He responds however by placing me in check.
 [ Q x f3 ]  [ B x c5 ]  [ b x c5 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ R e b1 ] , [ B c4 ]  Mistake. I should have protected my B with [ Q d7 ] instead I opened the file for his R.
 [ e5 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ N e2 ] , [ f6 ]  White starts to move his pieces to the Kingside. Black weakens his pawn structure to deal with the pressure.
 [ N b1 c3 ] , [ N f6 ]  Since White didn't threaten anything Black continues development hoping he will be able to castle to safety.
 [ N f5 ]  [ R e b1 ]  [ R x b1 + ] , [ R x b1 ]  Black can now march. My pieces need to relocate very quickly.
 [ B c6 ] , [ Q e6 ]  Again the swap doesn't suit. Black's defending fairly doggedly here I think.
 [ B h6 ]  [ f4 ]  [ d x c3 + ] , [ b x c3 ]  I have no choice but to eliminate the pawn in [ d3 ]  [ Q e1 ] , [ N d5 ]  oh I see what he is up to...he wants to capture my Q by attacking C3 with his bishop
 [ Q x g4 ]  [ B x g4 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ f5 ]  [ B x g4 ]  [ R x g4 + ]  [ K f2 ]  [ O-O-O ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ R a d1 ]  [ R h8 ] , [ N x d5 ]  Up be three but he begins his third and last attack now.
 [ a4 ] , [ R d3 ]  i see the mate threat and must divert it.
 [ Q x a3 ]  [ b x a3 ] , [ N x f4 ]  equalizing material: Black is a tiny bit better; due to Whites' shattered pawn structure and a severe lack in development...
 [ e4 ] , [ c5 ]  A mini-tournament game I'm playing black and opt for the Sicilian. My third annotation today in a row in fact where I play the Sicilian.
 [ K g6 ]  [ Q e6 + ]  [ K h5 ]  [ K x h7 ]  [ K h4 ]  [ Q e3 ] , [ K h5 ]  Kh5?? Maybe he wanted to lose quickly!
 [ Q e2 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ R h d1 ] , [ e4 ]  Black piles on the pressure
 [ K d7 ] , [ N x d3 ]  If Black stops me on the Q-side I can now advance on the K-side.
 [ N x b3 ] , [ B x e3 ]  Unfortunately...
 [ Q x d5 + ]  [ K x d5 ]  [ R c8 ]  [ N d3 ] , [ R x b8 ]  Mm I kind of liked Rb5+. The pawn promotion could wait.
 [ N x e3 ] , [ N x e3 ]  and now he has two bishop against my two knights. Normally this would favour the bishops in an open position but as I said his [ B g6 ] is dead wood for the time being. Although at the time I was confident of my position post-match Gameknot computer analysis gives this as +0.41 to Black.
 [ N c3 ]  [ K g4 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ K x h5 ]  [ K e2 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ K g4 ]  [ N x c5 ]  [ h5 ]  [ N d3 ]  [ h4 ]  [ N e5 + ]  [ K g3 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d1 = Q + ]  [ K x d1 ] , [ K x f3 ]  there's the problem of knights against bishops although he did well to snaffle a few pawns in the meantime
 [ N c3 ] , [ N c6 ]  Development again! Ignoring the attack on the e4-pawn
 [ R e4 ]  [ R a1 ]  [ N a5 ]  [ b3 ] , [ f5 ]  He's also going for promotion- oh no!
 [ e3 ]  [ N e4 ] , [ Q c2 ]  ? This only helps black do what he wants. [ Q b3 ] would have been best.
 [ R c1 c5 ]  [ b4 ]  [ a x b4 ]  [ a x b4 ]  [ R b5 ]  [ b3 ]  [ K d2 ]  [ R a6 ]  [ B x e4 ]  [ R a2 + ]  [ K c3 ] , [ R c2 + ]  Mistake ! I was to greedy looking for the mate instead of simply taking the LSB with my bishop. I had a wining position menacing [ f2 ] with my rook... The winning sequence for black was : 38. ... [ B x e4 ] 39. [ R x b3 ] Rx[ f2 ] (protecting f7)
 [ B d5 ]  [ R d8 ]  [ B x b7 ] , [ R d d2 ]  Two pigs on the 7th hard to defend even if you had a queen on the board. [ R x [ h2 ] ] is mate next. White can throw in [ N g4 ] then [ B x g4 ] and follows 32. [ B g2 ] [ R x g2 ] with mate at [ h2 ] still next move. A case of black seeing some fine tactics. Well played!!! For a site that allows tactical practice and tactics are 90% of the game according to a GM whos name I do not remember: http://chess.emrald.net/ Can't do a link here so copy and paste. Suggest you just click on guest and practice away. I wouldn't worry about score or time but concentrate on finding the best move/tactic. If you'll practice often you should make good progress in your games. Wayne
 [ B x a6 ] , [ N x a6 ]  There are often tricks hidden in the most obvious-looking positions. Black should have taken with the rook. Now White can get something back using his b-pawn...
 [ N c3 ] , [ N x c3 ]  black still has two bishops for the end game..
 [ B a5 ] , [ Q d3 ]  36. [ Q d3 ] - here I decide to cede the c file temporarily. Thank heaven Henry has the [ g2 ] square to escape to should the Wicked Witch land a check on c1.
 [ N f6 ] , [ B c4 ]  White now has a stranglehold on the position.
 [ B x d6 ]  [ e x d6 ]  [ K e8 ]  [ K c2 ]  [ K d7 ]  [ K c3 ] , [ K x d6 ]  40. .......... [ K x d6 ] - Henry has his fav. prawn on toast for brekkies on the battlefield. That is white's first casualty resulting out of his 37th move.
 [ e5 ] , [ g3 ]  4. [ e3 ] and 4. [ d3 ] are all main lines also.
 [ N c6 ] , [ e3 ]  ..protecting against [ f4 ] advance...
 [ K g7 ]  [ N f5 + ]  [ K f6 ] , [ Q d4 + ]  Offering to exchange queens which in light of the positional advantage black has was a mistake. I should have maintained an attacking position without exchanging any pieces.
 [ B x h2 + ] , [ K f1 ]  From this point i have put my eye on the position of the White's king and queen a dangerous position and i tried to make the most of it.
 [ R d a8 ]  [ B c3 ]  [ a x b4 ] , [ a x b4 ]  I have a mobilized queen side pawns and easily crack things open with a well timed b4-b5.
 [ d3 ] , [ N f6 ]  ...and I get ahead on development with my other knight to control all the centre squares. These early moves were half-consciously made as I didn't know what else I could do...
 [ N d5 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ Q x d5 ] , [ R b8 ]  The black rook on [ a8 ] was en prise and needed to be saved though in retrospect 14. ... [ B b2 ] feels more powerful. I think I decided against it because I believed white would retreat the queen with a threat against the queenside pawns so I preferred to make sure to cover them both.
 [ N f6 ] , [ e5 ]  Opening the E-file is clearly fatal for black. With all my pieces swarming a rook on the file of his king will be the final straw.
 [ K g5 ]  [ R g7 + ]  [ K h4 ] , [ R c7 ]  Now I return to defending and have some serious difficulties as the black a pawn is now passed.
 [ N x e4 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ B x h4 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ N x e4 ] , [ B e7 ]  The bishop moves yet again.
 [ K e7 ]  [ K d4 ]  [ R c8 ] , [ e5 ]  Short on ideas; short on time. I wanted to keep some distance between our Kings for now.
 [ Q d8 ]  [ N d6 ] , [ B c6 ]  18. ........ Bc6?? - how many more question marks would you like to give this move Freddy? You suggested [ Q c7 ] which would have gained me a tempo to a. chase away that nasty horsie on [ d6 ] and b. I might have been able to have contested the e file and tried to get rid of another set of heavies.
 [ e x d4 ] , [ g4 ]  pressure on the knight
 [ a5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ B b7 ] , [ B d3 ]  Perhaps not the best place for the bishop but it does line up against the king side where I am expecting black to castle
 [ K g5 ] , [ e4 + ]  3 this is just amazing. take a minute to absorb this.
 [ Q h1 + ]  [ K b2 ] , [ R d6 ]  Cutting the d-file.
 [ f4 ]  [ h7 ]  [ K g7 ] , [ h8 = Q + ]  KxQ [ R b8 ] wins. RxQ [ c8 = Q + ] too. I'm glad to have seen it this kind of position is always tricky. Thank you for reading and I hope you get some amusement. Would you have fallen like black did?
 [ B x a1 ]  [ R x a1 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ R c1 ] , [ N x f3 + ]  No need to worry about the c pawn as I'm exchanging with check which allows the defence of the c pawn latter
 [ K f2 ] , [ K f6 ]  The only way White can win is if he gets his king active and the only way to do that is to get it to b4.
 [ B x f6 ] , [ Q x f6 ]  threatens the Rook on [ a1 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ d4 ]  gaining space and two pawns on account of white's misplacements
 [ e5 ]  [ R h4 ]  [ h6 ]  [ b4 ]  [ N e6 ]  [ f4 ] , [ R d4 ]  Now I will win back the Pawn adding to my advantage.
 [ Q h4 + ]  [ K d1 ]  [ Q g4 + ] , [ B e2 ]  Fantastic! This alows me to cover getting into the game my last piece.
 [ Q x a6 ] , [ N e4 ]  Going for a [ R x f2 ] but my opponent has other plans. This was a terrible move on my part. Better perhaps would have been [ R a2 ] or Kf8.
 [ B f5 ] , [ N f3 ]  The Short Variation is one of the best lines for White in this system.
 [ N g f4 ]  [ Q f5 ] , [ g4 ]  This indeed chases my queen away again but it's still a threat on [ d7 ] but this weakens his kingside even more.
 [ N f3 ] , [ d6 ]  and planning my usual Najdorf
 [ R x e4 ]  [ Q h4 ] , [ K g2 ]  Even at this stage white makes these calm moves even that he could try to go for more direct options.
 [ Q d8 ] , [ h4 ]  My maneuverability is severely limited right now but it doesn't cause me much alarm.
 [ K h1 ] , [ Q f6 ]  here it is black are ready to sign for a queen exchange as they have two points advance.
 [ Q h5 ] , [ g6 ]  White played the expected move and black responded as planned. I felt the black king was just safe enough where he was. I was wrong.
 [ K g6 ] , [ a8 = Q ]  Getting a third queen of the game. My win is inevitable now.
 [ B x d5 + ]  [ Q x d5 ]  [ N e f3 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ f5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ Q d6 ]  [ d4 ] , [ c4 ]  Didn't want to take [ d4 ] pawn because I wanted to continue to block white from kingside.
 [ B e5 + ]  [ K g8 ] , [ N h6 # ]  
 [ K h6 ] , [ Q x g6 # ]  Game finished... 0-1
 [ K d4 ]  [ K c6 ]  [ K x e4 ]  [ K x b6 ]  [ K d5 ]  [ K x a5 ]  [ e4 ]  [ K b5 ]  [ e3 ]  [ a5 ]  [ e2 ]  [ a6 ]  [ e1 = Q ]  [ a7 ]  [ Q e8 + ]  [ K b6 ]  [ Q a8 ]  [ K a6 ] , [ K c6 ]  N here he finally throws the towel in n gives me a very satisfying n memorable win-:) Hope you guys had a fun time following this one...sayonara-:)
 [ K g7 ]  [ N x f8 ] , [ R x f8 ]  White now has the original four pawns plus a minor piece.
 [ Q d4 + ]  [ K h1 ] , [ N f4 ]  Forgetting that after...
 [ N f6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N b d7 ] , [ B d3 ]  White's development now surpasses my own but a trade of bishops on [ d3 ] only enhances this advantage. My bishop shall remain on g6.
 [ N f4 ] , [ a6 ]  (!) At last! The h-pawn is a goner of course but with it will go a pair of rooks - not an undesirable thing from Black's point of view.
 [ e x d5 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ d6 ]  [ c x d6 ]  [ c3 ] , [ B g4 ]  10..... [ B g4 ] - attacks the Wicked Witch of the West who in turn feasts her glare upon Henry next move with Qa4+.
 [ N f6 ] , [ d4 ]  Going into a more mainstream opening
 [ B x b6 ] , [ N e5 + ]  right here.
 [ K h7 ]  [ Q x e8 ] , [ B x h3 ]  There was a mate on [ g8 ] which he obviously didn't see. This was supposed to be his win as his pieces are more active and all my pieces are on the queenside and I can't really defend my queen. I was lucky to win this.
 [ e4 ] , [ e5 ]  I dedicate this game to my brothers of the King Apostles team and particular to Captain Big Paul...through the building of this new team and his ongoing encouragement my chess skill has expanded 10 fold. I have more arrows in my quiver and I play a more quieted pace and watch the board more calmly which provides me with better options...often times the first option is not the best. Psalm 46:10 reminds us "Be still and know that I am God". Let us rest for in rest we may see another option...... Please enjoy this game. --Capt_Rook
 [ b5 ]  [ Q d6 + ]  [ K e8 ] , [ Q e7 # ]  The theme for this game in a word: development.
 [ R e1 ]  [ d5 ]  [ d4 ]  [ h6 ]  [ B h4 ] , [ N e4 ]  12. ...... [ N e4 ] - this move triggers off an exchange of dsbs.
 [ N b d2 ]  [ B e6 ] , [ h3 ]  Hmph not what I expected.
 [ R d6 ]  [ N h4 ]  [ g6 ]  [ B e2 ] , [ c x d5 ]  (GT) I thought this exchange necessary here as White is threatening to play his Bishop via [ N4 ] to K6. If he retook with the BP I intended to exchange Bishops and rely on the 2 pawns to 1 on the Q-side. I did not expect him to retake with the KP which seemed to expose him to a violent K-side attack. (JC) Black's judgment in this instance I believe to be faulty. Had White retaken with the BP as Black expected Black would have had the worst of the Pawn position as White would have had a passed Pawn well supported on the Q-side. Black's only advantage would lie in having a very well posted Bishop against a badly posted Knight. If Black had played 26... B-[ B1 ] he could have replied to 27 Q-[ N3 ] with 27... PxP preventing 28 BPxP? on account of 28... BxP ch winning the Exchange.
 [ B b4 + ]  [ B d2 ] , [ K f8 ]  Odd that he didn't exchange off his bishop for mine I mean I know he's behind but I think it would have been better to exchange.
 [ c4 ]  [ e6 ] , [ Q b3 ]  This was my first surprise I though I would see the traditional 3.Nc3. I just followed the book here.
 [ B g4 ]  [ Q b3 ] , [ b6 ]  Proventing [ Q x b6 ]  [ R a e1 ]  [ N d7 ] , [ h3 ]  Trying to force my bishop away
 [ B x f6 ]  [ Q x h8 ]  [ B x h8 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ N e7 ] , [ N b5 ]  There's a triple fork from [ N c7 ] here but moving [ K d7 ] now might have helped a little.
 [ Q a4 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ B x e3 ]  [ R x e3 ]  [ R x e3 ] , [ Q x e3 ]  28. [ Q x e3 ] - just what I want a plethora of exchanges. Now it is just the queens and rooks.
 [ R x d3 ]  [ N x d3 ] , [ K g2 ]  this is the best error of my entire life!!!!!!!!! i was busy and i mistook [ N f4 ] is the end!!!!!!!!!
 [ N e5 ] , [ d4 ]  Pushing d pawn and attacking pawn at [ c3 ]  [ N a c4 ] , [ Q c7 ]  Moving queen on to [ c7 ] where she can control a central diagonal pointing towards h2. Also threatening knight at e5.
 [ K e2 ] , [ N b5 ]  A good knight move there are many dangerous squares for it to go to now and they're all black!
 [ c3 ]  [ Q e7 ] , [ e3 ]  To get his Bishop out I think.
 [ K b1 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B c3 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ R f d8 ] , [ Q f3 ]  Now it becomes clear that taking the knight before on [ g3 ] was not a smart choice. The f-file is successfully being used by white and his plan is quite clear.
 [ a5 ] , [ b x a5 ]  The computer analysis would rather me have moved Rxc2. This would have prevented the situation that followed in a few moves. However I already saw that coming and it was not a concern. I would be able to maneuver through the situation with ease from my point of view.
 [ a4 ]  [ b4 ] , [ N e2 ]  Only safe place for the knight to go.
 [ R x b5 ]  [ a x b5 ] , [ Q a7 ]  now the king can duck to [ g7 ] without white being able to force the exchange of queens on d3.
 [ R g6 + ]  [ K c5 ]  [ R h6 ] , [ K b6 ]  Here he goes. Now I threat mate.
 [ B b7 ]  [ N e7 + ]  [ K h7 ]  [ N d2 ]  [ R f e8 ]  [ N f5 ] , [ R e2 ]  19. ............ [ R e2 ] - time to get nasty! This rook move suddenly puts the cat among the pigeons in the white camp and look at those 2 prelates - what long diagonals they have!!
 [ N d4 ] , [ R e4 e5 ]  Hoping for a discovered atack on Queen with an attack on pawn/knight/rook but nothing is falling into place for a cheap attack..
 [ Q h2 + ] , [ K f1 ]  Now [ R f4 + ] wins a queen for a rook and the game but I played so quickly... then I realized I forgot.
 [ K x h2 ]  [ Q d6 + ]  [ g3 ]  [ Q x d2 ]  [ Q x d2 ]  [ R x d2 ]  [ c5 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ R f e1 ]  [ g5 ]  [ N d4 ] , [ R x f2 + ]  Black resigns
 [ B d5 ] , [ R b8 ]  hes forced to reinforce the lsb or swap them out he opted to reinforce it
 [ R x c4 ]  [ R x c4 ] , [ R b1 ]  My b pawn needs protection. 20.b3?? is not an option as it would lose a piece without any compensation. 20...[ Q x c3 ] 21.[ Q x c3 ] (forced) Rxc3.
 [ R h2 ] , [ c x b6 ]  The knight falls having stood pinned and hanging for 12 moves.
 [ e x f4 ] , [ R b2 b3 ]  Just side-stepping the Bishop going to [ e5 ] and hitting my Rook.
 [ f x g4 ]  [ Q x g4 + ] , [ K h1 ]  37. Kh1?? - this move loses you will see how in just one minute!
 [ R d4 ]  [ B g2 ]  [ R x a4 ] , [ b x a4 ]  In the end game swindon should have tried to avoid an exchange when he was 3 pawns down...
 [ h5 + ]  [ K h3 ]  [ g4 + ] , [ K g2 ]  He didn`t want to trade but now the pawns can`t move any more. Now I can start trying to create a passed pawn.
 [ R e1 + ]  [ R x e1 ] , [ Q x e1 + ]  This however is where I resign because he'll mate. As now 34.[ Q g1 ] is forced allowing 34...[ Q x g1 # ] Once again I'm proud of how long I lasted. And this shows that despite my ratings remaining the same for the last few months that I have improved. That's because I lasted 23 moves in my last game against easy19. Shortly after that I lasted 26 moves in the recent Wizard Chess. I'm confident that sooner then later I'll be able to surpass that 36 mark and even make it to 40 moves against strong opposition like this.
 [ h5 ] , [ h4 ]  Fritz says this is an accurate move. Still Black's pressure on the K-side is unpleasant.
 [ Q x f3 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ] , [ Q x b7 ]  Black has equalised.
 [ N x e5 ]  [ Q f6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ d6 ]  [ N c4 ]  [ f x e4 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ Q f7 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ N b d7 ]  [ O-O ]  [ h6 ]  [ B h4 ]  [ g5 ]  [ B g3 ]  [ h5 ]  [ f3 ]  [ h4 ]  [ B e1 ]  [ e x f3 ]  [ R x f3 ]  [ h3 ]  [ g3 ]  [ b6 ]  [ R e3 + ]  [ K d8 ]  [ B f3 ]  [ R b8 ]  [ b3 ]  [ g4 ]  [ B c6 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ B x b7 ]  [ R x b7 ]  [ Q d3 ]  [ Q h7 ]  [ R d1 ]  [ B h6 ]  [ R e2 ]  [ Q x d3 ]  [ R x d3 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ R x e8 + ]  [ K x e8 ]  [ B d2 ]  [ B g7 ] , [ B f4 ]  27. Bf4. Here is the final position before I let myself be provoked into an interesting but unwise move. Material is even. My pawns being intact I reason that exchanging a minor piece for two pawns may be worth the investment. On the other hand given that both sides are somewhat depleted N (or B) for P+P may not be a very good idea.
 [ K d7 ]  [ h x g5 ] , [ Q e7 ]  must do something quickly ...
 [ R x g2 ]  [ K x g2 ] , [ K f5 ]  
 [ B e8 ] , [ R a6 ]  White threats another pawn wants to weaken Blacks position so much as possible!
 [ N x e4 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N c6 ]  [ d3 ] , [ N f6 ]  With his dark bishop free and having castled White seems to have a couple of tempi for his pawn sacrifice. On the other hand a pawn is a pawn and I was expecting 5. [ d4 ] leading into Canal's Attack after 5. ... exd4; 6. [ R e1 ] d5; 7. [ B x d5 ] Qxd5; 8. [ N c3 ] when White recovers all his material with a good game (though the position's quite defensible for Black).
 [ K a8 ] , [ N c7 # ]  1-0. I know that at first my aim was around my dark square bishop and dominating the dark squares but mid-way through my plan changed. I saw that I could win most of his pieces and have a good endgame for white so I took that option. Again this is my first attempt at annotating so feedback would be appreciated both good and bad.
 [ K h5 ] , [ R f5 + ]  I move my king across to [ h5 ] and black brings his rook to [ f5 ] checking the king and with queen at [ g3 ] the king has nowhere to go.
 [ Q x b6 + ]  [ K e8 ]  [ R x e7 + ]  [ K f8 ] , [ Q d8 # ]  CHECKMATE
 [ Q e3 ]  [ Q e7 ]  [ Q f4 + ]  [ K g1 ]  [ K h6 ]  [ Q f8 + ]  [ K g5 ] , [ Q e7 + ]  44. [ Q e7 + ] - Glenda keeps her glare on the black king.
 [ d4 ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ B x d4 ] , [ e x d4 ]  ...need to link the rooks so to find a home for the dark square bishop...
 [ b4 ] , [ c x b4 ]  Which loses a pawn
 [ R f8 + ]  [ K g3 ] , [ R c8 ]  Necessary to avoid the mate.
 [ N x h3 + ]  [ g x h3 ]  [ B x h3 ] , [ R e4 ]  This move forces the endgame black is aiming for but if they don't play it then black keeps queens on with a very exposed white king which is dangerous. Black is looking for [ R e8 ] and getting all the pieces in. Note white's queenside. Totally undeveloped. And not really going anywhere that soon. It's tied up and they need to defend the passed pawns.
 [ N e2 ]  [ R c8 ]  [ K e7 ]  [ a6 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ R c4 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ R c7 + ]  [ K d6 ]  [ R a7 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ R a8 ]  [ B c6 ]  [ R g8 ]  [ N e6 ]  [ a7 ]  [ N c7 ]  [ R x g7 ]  [ N b5 ]  [ R g6 ]  [ N x a7 ]  [ R x f6 + ]  [ K c7 ]  [ R x h6 ]  [ N b5 ] , [ R x c6 + ]  That eliminates the last prospects of me losing. I figured I had enough of an advantage to force the win so saccing the rook was an extravagance I could afford.
 [ Q g3 ]  [ R e2 ]  [ R x e3 ]  [ R g1 ] , [ Q h3 + ]  My plan here is obvious!
 [ R e1 ] , [ R f e8 ]  Rooks are facing each other.
 [ Q d3 + ]  [ K f2 ]  [ e3 + ]  [ K f3 ]  [ e2 + ] , [ K f2 ]  Here's where I looked for awhile and didn't find any way to queen that pawn successfully. So I trade it for another one that causes me problems.
 [ K b1 ]  [ c5 ] , [ g5 ]  Better was the othe pawn h5. Anyway the issue is to surprise him (with not that bad moves).
 [ b x a5 ] , [ B c4 ]  Controlling d5. If 22. [ B d3 ] (my first idea) [ N d5 ] 23 [ e4 ] [ N f4 ] and black is better (or less equal)
 [ B b7 ]  [ Q x f8 + ]  [ K x f8 ] , [ B d3 ]  After the exchange white still have 2 pt more than I have but with this kind of position I still prefer my queen to my 2 rooks.
 [ e3 ]  [ e6 ] , [ c4 ]  now black may be having a space shortage or at least his center is under pressure.
 [ N f6 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N d2 ]  [ c5 ]  [ c3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ f4 ]  6. [ f4 ] - after some rapid piece development on both sides this move sets up the Stonewall. It is very hard for either side to get a result but sometimes these breakthroughs do happen!
 [ d x c4 ] , [ R x c4 ]  Did white recapture with the wrong piece?
 [ Q f6 ]  [ f4 ]  [ N b4 ] , [ a4 ]  ..while white is behind and in trouble...maybe [ Q b1 ] is a last hope...so black has the lovely trap that white cant accept or its curtains and brings the 2nd knight to zoom into the king.....
 [ K h1 ]  [ N e3 ]  [ R c1 ] , [ N d5 ]  Black's knight is trying to harass White's position and vaguely threaten it. White has had enough and wants to free up his well-positioned bishop on b2.
 [ g5 ]  [ N d3 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ h3 ]  [ f5 ]  [ g3 ]  [ K f6 ]  [ a3 ]  [ a5 ]  [ b3 ] , [ f4 ]  Each side has been mostly advancing pawns.
 [ R x h3 ]  [ f3 ]  [ R x f3 ] , [ R f1 ]  This is good for me since I am so far ahead now I don't mind exchanging pieces. This was your only other attacking piece.
 [ K h7 ] , [ R e2 ]  ! A very flexible move. The reason behind this move is that when white plays [ g5 ] black might block the position with [ [ h5 ] ] and [ [ g6 ] ] when the hole on [ f6 ] will become a weakness. [ R e2 ] allows the queen to come to [ f3 ] so that if the [ [ h5 ] ] [ [ g6 ] ] maneuvre is played the queen can exploit the hole on f6. Furthermore the rook is better positioned here as it can come to the c-file or d-file if necessary where as on [ e4 ] it cannot come to c4. It sometimes seems unecessary to do this move and if black had certain threats/counterplay it probably would be a waste of a move. However black do anything productive so white can afford to take his time.
 [ N f6 ] , [ d3 ]  I did this to open up the bishop for a possible [ B g5 ] pinning the knight against the queen...
 [ B e3 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ Q a2 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ R f b1 ]  [ R f c8 ] , [ N x c6 ]  My knight wasn't doing anything. His was putting pressure on my pawns. So I liked this exchange.
 [ R d1 + ]  [ R x d1 ]  [ N x d1 ]  [ K e1 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ f4 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ R a6 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ R x a3 ]  [ N b5 ]  [ R a1 + ]  [ K e2 ]  [ K b8 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ R b1 ]  [ N e6 ]  [ g6 ]  [ N f8 ]  [ R h1 ]  [ K f3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ K g2 ]  [ R b1 ]  [ K f3 ]  [ R x b4 ]  [ g4 ]  [ R e4 ] , [ N x h7 ]  Mm definitely like 43. [ g5 ] better. The black knight has to move then P[ h7 ] becomes a freebie (free pawn). Actually this isn't too bad either--NxN KxR. I guess it is a cheap pawn either way.
 [ N d3 + ]  [ K e3 ]  [ N x b2 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ c6 ]  [ R e1 ] , [ R e8 ]  the wrong idea...
 [ Q x f5 ]  [ B h4 ]  [ g3 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ B f3 ] , [ Q c6 ]  Oops. This won't defend against BxB. P[ c6 ] would have protected the bishop.
 [ N d5 ]  [ Q h3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B g6 + ]  [ K g8 ]  [ e x f6 ]  [ R d8 ]  [ B x f7 + ]  [ K f8 ] , [ Q h8 # ]  
 [ f6 ] , [ Q c1 ]  Regrettably I am forced to pull my queen out of the game and my previous moves assisted black in making a strong pawn structure. My pieces are becoming closed in all because I let black control the centre with his pawns.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ] , [ d4 ]  I free up my queen and bishops in conjunction with the centre game...
 [ R e1 ] , [ N g4 ]  Threatening among other things ... [ Q h4 ] and [ Q x h2 ] or Qxf2.
 [ B g7 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ] , [ R e1 ]  Notice that it's now taken White 3 moves to fully set up a pawn-push he had the option of playing on the 2nd or 3rd move of the game. Meanwhile Black has already gained a lead in development merely by playing naturally.
 [ B e2 ] , [ b6 ]  This proves to be to slow for Black. I was thinking ...[ B a6 ] but it never comes. Better for Black is 8...[ N c6 ] guarding the e5/[ d4 ] squares so Black's queen can retreat to [ g6 ] safely.
 [ f3 ]  [ e x f3 ] , [ B x f3 ]  33. [ B x f3 ] - Fou Leblanc hits at the [ b7 ] pawn.
 [ K f6 ]  [ R b8 ]  [ g4 ]  [ R g8 ]  [ K f5 ]  [ R f8 + ]  [ K e5 ]  [ R g8 ]  [ K f4 ]  [ R g6 ] , [ e5 ]  After 60 moves the valued e soldier decide to move forward
 [ e x f6 ]  [ Q x f6 ] , [ N e4 ]  As one example of my last post the Q is forced which allows Sasha to complete her development at once whereas Julio still has 2 pieces undeveloped. And she'll take advantage of that to attack his Q again. In return blacks K will officially be exposed.
 [ N e5 ]  [ B b4 ]  [ B d2 ]  [ B x c3 ]  [ B x c3 ]  [ Q d5 ]  [ f3 ] , [ O-O ]  Black King into a safer position !
 [ Q x e3 + ] , [ B e2 ]  Forced on account of the mate after 17.Kd1.
 [ R f4 + ] , [ K g7 ]  now the move which i said earlier the dangerous central pawn moving up with all support wins the game for white
 [ N f6 ]  [ d3 ]  [ B b4 ] , [ B d2 ]  After 6.[ d x e4 ] [ N x e4 ] 7.[ Q d4 ] [ Q e7 ] Black has a comfortable game: 8.[ B e2 ] 0-0 9.[ B d2 ] [ N x d2 ] 10.[ Q x d2 ] c6! (10...[ B g4 ] has also been played) 11.[ N f3 ] (11.dxc6?! [ R d8 ] 12.[ Q c1 ] Nxc6; 11.0-0-0 [ c x d5 ] 12.[ B f3 ] [ B e6 ] and ...Nc6) 11...[ c x d5 ] 12.0-0 [ N c6 ] (Bardeleben-Blackburne London 1895)
 [ d4 ]  [ B x f5 ]  [ d x e3 ] , [ B x e6 + ]  At this position I think was still a chance to bring the game into a draw.
 [ K f3 ]  [ f x g4 + ]  [ K x g4 ]  [ R c8 ] , [ R a1 ]  I panicked here and went for active looking counterplay against the black king
 [ R x g6 ]  [ f x g6 ] , [ K f2 ]  ?? Arguably the losing move. We don't often describe failures to win material as "blunders" in the way that we describe moves that lose material; but this move surely qualifies as such. I completely failed to see the weakling at [ e6 ] and was still obsessed with my King's scope for activity (a worthy obsession in the endgame but unforgivable when it blinds one to match-winning opportunities): "Blunder: -1.36 » 39. [ K f2 ] [ K g8 ] 40. [ B e2 ] [ B x e2 ] 41. [ K x e2 ] [ K f7 ] 42. [ a4 ] [ K x f6 ] 43. [ [ c4 ] ] [ [ b6 ] ] 44. [ K d3 ] [ c5 ] 45. [ K c3 ] [ a6 ] 46. [ d5 ] [ K e7 ] 47. [ K d3 ] [ K d6 ] Best: +2.34 » 39. B[ [ c4 ] ] [ B c2 ] 40. Bx[ e6 ] [ B d3 ] 41. [ [ c4 ] ] [ [ b6 ] ] 42. [ K f3 ] [ B b1 ] 43. [ a3 ] [ B d3 ] 44. [ K e3 ] [ B e4 ] 45. [ B f7 ] [ K h7 ] 46. [ h5 ] gx[ h5 ] 47. Bx[ h5 ] Kg8"
 [ N x e3 + ]  [ B x e3 ]  [ B x e4 ]  [ B x e4 ]  [ R x e4 ]  [ R a e1 ]  [ N x c4 ]  [ f3 ]  [ N x e3 + ]  [ R e2 x e3 ]  [ R x e3 ]  [ R x e3 ]  [ Q c2 ]  [ R e2 ]  [ Q d1 + ]  [ R e1 ]  [ Q d3 + ]  [ R e2 ] , [ R e8 ]  and finally I resigned having run out of wriggle room and further possibilities of encouraging Black to blow his advantage.
 [ Q x c7 ] , [ R x c7 ]  Fritz recommends 29. [ R x f7 ] (10.02) I am now + 4.
 [ Q f3 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ O-O-O ]  [ N b d7 ]  [ g4 ] , [ b5 ]  The pawn storms have started
 [ g x h3 ]  [ B e4 ]  [ B x e4 ]  [ Q x e4 ]  [ Q g5 ]  [ K x h3 ]  [ R x f1 ]  [ R x f1 ]  [ Q e3 + ]  [ Q x e3 ] , [ B x e3 ]  Massive trade off and I cannot protect my two pawn from the coming attacks
 [ N x e4 ] , [ Q d4 + ]  16. ...........[ Q d4 ] ?? Ion stated that he thought this move was terrible because it is "compounding the error. Had I played 16...[ R x [ e4 ] ] I would have got out with only the loss of the exchange: 16...[ R x [ e4 ] ] 17.[ B x [ e4 ] ] [ Q d4 ] 18.[ Q x d4 ] [ B x d4 ] 19.[ K h1 ] [ f x [ e4 ] ] and Black at least can make a game of it." The intent of this move here was to get out of the pin with check and to reclaim the piece by capturing on [ e4 ] with the f pawn unfortunately white gets his knight out of the road by playing [ N f2 ] - Ion is a piece for a pawn down. The position is not resignable yet - remember a pawn can crown a piece cannot. The defender must find some vigorous counterplay however or white could increase this material advantage. Ion now creates complications and as mentioned in a previous note they earn him half a point. I do not know the rating differentials of the two protagonists here - this could also have some bearing on the decision to play on or not.
 [ B x f3 ] , [ B x f3 ]  8. [ B x f3 ] seems really strange to me. It's the 4th time in the first 8 moves that black moved that bishop and he could have just played that on move 6 and been done with it and saved a tempo in the process. I have no analysis of this opening to tell me whether black is following sound opening theory or not but the move seems strange to me.
 [ f x g6 ] , [ h x g6 ]  White's light-square bishop is pining the black's f-pawn and exerting a tremendous infleunce on the diagonal!
 [ N c5 ] , [ b4 ]  Now? [ N e6 ] admits the move as a mistake which it was.
 [ Q d4 + ]  [ K c2 ]  [ Q e4 + ]  [ K d2 ] , [ e5 ]  This was a key position for me. I was in the Netherlands for training. I didn't get out of training and back to the hotel until about 9 or 9:30 and I ordered room service (way too expensive for way too little food) and I started analyzing this position. No family around so why not. In fact you'll appreciate this ... I had internet access so I tuned in to www.kjic.org ("King Jesus is Coming" a Southern Gospel station I've been listening to since April in the car that broadcasts from south of Houston). I built a decision tree until about 1 or 1:30 in the morning looking at about two dozen lines. I was hoping for [ B b2 ] because I'd get to play d4. If I got to that point I could trade queens and win that endgame despite opposite color bishops. Every line I looked at won for me except for one [ Q f3 ] because I'd have to trade queens I felt and then I didn't see a way to force a win in the endgame. My bishop's been patient the entire game watching the rest of his army do the fighting but he's going to participate when it counts!
 [ B x d3 ]  [ Q x d3 ]  [ c4 ]  [ Q c2 ] , [ b5 ]  the logical way to go in the Sicilian...
 [ K g3 ] , [ B d5 ]  ...of K-side pressure.
 [ e5 ]  [ f4 ] , [ e x f4 ]  2. .... [ e x f4 ] - this is the King's Gambit Accepted. I usually accept the offering because a pawn is a pawn.
 [ N b8 ]  [ B h4 ]  [ f6 ] , [ B g3 ]  I really wanted to trade off his good bishop at this point. I started to hate that bishop a lot because something about attacking along the diagonal wasn't making me feel comfortable at all.
 [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ a6 ] , [ B e3 ]  English attack
 [ N b3 + ] , [ K b4 ]  Despite whie's heavy pieces my K (I bet) is safe!
 [ c4 ]  [ f5 ]  [ Q h4 ] , [ B c5 + ]  though ill throw in a check here it cant hurt me.
 [ R e8 ] , [ B d2 ]  Over the next several moves I thought of applying Silman's endgame principle of "torturing the opponent" to further induce mistakes in the enemy's position...
 [ K g2 ]  [ R d2 + ]  [ K g3 ]  [ R x c2 ] , [ K f4 ]  White moves into a claustrophobic area
 [ N g5 ] , [ d6 ]  forcing matters: no option is Qe6...
 [ R h5 ] , [ N f6 ]  Now I must move the Knight. But I gain a tempo by again attacking the Rook.
 [ d4 ]  [ g6 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ N b d2 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ e3 ]  [ a6 ]  [ c3 ]  [ b5 ] , [ B d3 ]  7.[ B d3 ] An excellent London System against a Hypermodernist. The London System can be used for virtually every defense the the Black pieces can conjure. This offensive opening has foolowed all the opening principles thus far and should be a sound position. Seemingly passive? Ha...just goading Black to advance poorly! On the other side of the board Black has chosen to wiat on a good home for the King's Knight. this is a theorectical ploy in the Modern Defense. Either [ N h6 ] looking for [ f7 ] after the f-pawn advances or [ e7 ] after that pawn advances. Often here you may find a "Hippo" structure without the advanced b-pawn. Also a very strong defense. Obviously this game is starting very positional and will play well to those wanting a highly strategic game.
 [ Q x h4 ]  [ R g3 ]  [ Q f6 ]  [ Q g2 ]  [ K g7 ]  [ N f2 ] , [ R g8 ]  In retrospect I fail to understand this move.
 [ N x e4 ]  [ Q x e4 ] , [ R x f2 ]  ...but Black has other ideas!
 [ K a4 ]  [ Q b6 ]  [ K a3 ] , [ K c3 ]  Mate in 2
 [ Q d6 ]  [ R f e1 + ] , [ K f7 ]  22. ...... [ K f7 ] - oooh I forgot to mention in my last note I finally developed that horsie to [ f6 ] on move 18 to pave the way for castling. However white had other ideas with his last move - still with the absence of white's lsb I can start a castling by hand manoeuvre by putting Henry on f7.
 [ K g2 ]  [ N b1 ]  [ c4 ] , [ N d2 ]  Rather than taking on [ c4 ] and leaving White with two connected pawns.
 [ R e8 ] , [ N x d6 ]  The pin is not scary. All options can be defused.
 [ R c2 ]  [ B h5 ]  [ R c5 ] , [ B f7 ]  Securely guarding the Knight.
 [ e4 ] , [ B e6 ]  I am realizing that I am playing a fool since it becomes clear that I cannot push the pawn further. So I tried a last way to scramble the game: to sac it.
 [ N g1 ] , [ B g4 ]  So black things he has a noticeable advantage at this point. But it's much harder then that. White is still planning by moving back and forth but in a very patient manner because chess takes patience and it's important to note that this is reverse psychology or a trick because white wants black to keep bringing things in the center because of he will subsequently do later as his long term plan.
 [ Q e1 ] , [ B h6 ]  Threatening the rook.
 [ R h1 h2 ] , [ N x e5 ]  capturing the pawn with an additional threat to the white queen.
 [ R c6 + ] , [ K f7 ]  Bad move. Allows Black to take the pawn with check.
 [ N c6 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B c4 ] , [ O-O ]  7........ 0-0 black tucks his king away - I will castle queenside and this will be a race to mate!
 [ R b8 ]  [ R x c6 ]  [ R x c8 + ] , [ K h7 ]  How to win (most accurately) from here?
 [ c5 ] , [ N c2 ]  I didn't want to open the b file for him and give some point to 8...Rb8. I saw later on the opening database that 11. [ d x c6 ] e.p. [ b x c6 ] 12. [ R b1 ] [ c5 ] 13. [ N c2 ] seems to be a good line for white.
 [ Q x e5 ]  [ g5 ]  [ R a d8 ] , [ B d3 ]  I would need all my pieces in the attack if I want it to be successful
 [ N e4 ] , [ R f8 ]  39. ..... [ R f8 ] - rather a passive square but I am thinking about protecting the back row just in case my knight is compelled to move away from d7.
 [ B x c6 ]  [ d x c6 ]  [ N b8 ]  [ N d5 ] , [ Q e8 ]  The [ c6 ] pawn will be lost now.
 [ B x c6 + ] , [ b x c6 ]  Naturally I take back with sights on the newly opened b file for my rooks.
 [ N f2 ] , [ R h d8 ]  Alternative variation: 24... [ R h g8 ] 25. [ K h2 ] [ R a c8 ] $17
 [ R d4 + ]  [ K a3 ]  [ K b5 ] , [ R h3 ]  Here I decide that I should try to make some things happen maybe if I can trade off a few pawns I'll be able to distract black from getting the a pawn down the board.
 [ d4 ] , [ N e4 ]  Back to the ASP.
 [ N x c4 ]  [ d x c4 ] , [ c6 ]  because [ N d5 ] was still threatening...
 [ O-O ]  [ B a3 ]  [ d6 ] , [ d5 ]  This next move seemed relatively obvious to me though refer to my rating for the relative value of obvious. I expect you'll [ e x d5 ] to save the N.
 [ Q d5 + ]  [ K h6 ] , [ Q d2 + ]  whichever way the king or rook go I have a check.
 [ N x e5 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ B x e5 ]  [ Q e7 ] , [ B b2 ]  Now I'm a pawn up so it's time to complete my development.
 [ B x g6 ]  [ K d5 ] , [ B x c5 ]  And now Black loses.
 [ B d3 + ]  [ K a1 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ Q f3 ] , [ B f6 + ]  the end...
 [ K x h2 ]  [ N f4 + ] , [ K g1 ]  [ N h3 + ] just keeps the tension but..
 [ N x d4 ] , [ B f3 ]  Some would be happy to trade a Knight for a Bishop but that would let him develop his Queen and I am already down by two pawns. In this kind of opening we want to create pressure not trade pieces.
 [ B x b5 ]  [ a x b5 ] , [ B x h6 ]  !? Wins a pawn.
 [ h6 ]  [ R d1 ]  [ Q e7 ]  [ a4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ e3 ]  [ e4 ]  [ N h4 ]  [ N g4 ] , [ N f5 ]  I'm not sure what is stopping black's BxN here.
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B b4 ]  [ e3 ]  [ O-O ] , [ B d3 ]  Book play so far.
 [ B f4 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ Q e6 ]  [ Q e2 ] , [ g5 ]  ah... agression finally...
 [ N x c1 ]  [ N x c1 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ h4 ]  [ B d6 ] , [ c4 ]  P[ d4 ] PxP Nc1[ d3 ] saves the knight.
 [ K c6 ]  [ B x c4 ]  [ N f2 + ] , [ K f3 ]  52.[ K f3 ] (not [ K f5 ] which is OK to keep opposition on his K) maintains the scope of my R (53.Rb5!) and pressures his N.
 [ K g2 ]  [ R x b4 ] , [ f3 ]  After he takes I decide to connect my pawns in an attempt to promote. Of course that's never going to happen but this is a very interesting position.
 [ Q x d6 ] , [ B c5 ]  
 [ Q f4 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ R g1 ]  [ R x g1 + ]  [ K x g1 ]  [ B d6 ] , [ Q a4 ]  Seeing that he gets nothing from the position Carlsen traded Rooks to change the dynamics of the game. Now he does not have to worry about being mated as the King can always escape the Black Queen. This gives him time to try to exploit Black's weaknesses.
 [ Q e4 ]  [ Q d7 ] , [ B c1 ]  a devious silent move preparing f4: not Bb2; other moves would encourage h6...
 [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ d6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ h3 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ B x d4 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B e2 ]  [ a6 ]  [ N d5 ] , [ e5 ]  What else do you think are black's alternatives here?
 [ K e7 ] , [ N x e6 ]  This was my favorite capture of the game.
 [ Q x f3 ] , [ Q d1 ]  White prepares to let his Queenside pawns dissolve while he gets Black's Kingside and threats against the King. And although objectively best is 25. ...[ Q d1 ] 26. [ R f d1 ] [ R b7 ] (or 26. ...[ R b2 ] 27. R1[ d2 ] with a likely draw) Black has other ideas.
 [ N c5 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ R x e5 + ]  [ B e7 ] , [ N c3 ]  Seeing that my [ B a4 ] is en-prise I protect.
 [ K d7 ]  [ Q x f8 ] , [ f5 ]  ?? As I had mentioned earlier my f pawn is now protected but this is not a good choice. 20...[ [ f6 ] ] would have been best for he will force an exchange with 21.[ e x f5 ] [ R x g2 ] but I am far behind. On the other hand 20...[ [ f6 ] ] also protects but without the exchange.
 [ Q x d6 ] , [ R d2 ]  I see 29...[ Q b4 ] and the ensuing attack and move to preempt it. At this point I have a dangerous h-pawn and pretty decent mobility so I should have decent endgame chances once I deal with the Black push on the queenside.
 [ N g8 e7 ] , [ Q h5 ]  Black's in trouble now.
 [ N b5 ]  [ e4 ]  [ Q b3 ] , [ B e5 ]  Black has no desire to trade his best piece for a mere knight.
 [ O-O ] , [ O-O-O ]  Still according to the DB.
 [ R d c1 ] , [ R d e8 ]  26. ........ [ R e8 ] and DRAW OFFER! or more pertinently for me 6 rating points are on offer - I decide to run with the money! In a post match analysis Coach Ion had the following to say:- "I don't know what you had planned for next move but [ B a3 ] looks OK with the view of coming in at [ c5 ] after which a2-[ a4 ] and/or b3-[ b4 ] suggest themselves." So this is all worth noting if I find myself in a similar position later on. For now I am a very happy lady and now get ready for Near-Expert Draw Part II.
 [ Q x d8 ]  [ R a x d8 ] , [ N d5 ]  This is an excellent move by white. I can't capture white's knight with my knight due to the pin. After 15 . . . [ N x d5 ] 16. [ B x d8 ] [ R x d8 ] 17. [ c x d5 ] Rxd5. If I decide to protect my [ f6 ] knight due to the double threat white wins a pawn with 14. Nxc7. Since I am going to be down one point I need to make the best of my situation. Generally speaking when you are down a point more pieces are better. In addition I have lost several games because of one pawn. Being down 1 point due to a rook traded with a knight and a pawn can sometimes be better.
 [ R h5 ] , [ B f3 ]  Harassing my R. Will it give black something?
 [ B b2 ]  [ B d6 ] , [ a3 ]  Uhhhhhh what???
 [ O-O-O ] , [ B e2 ]  white begins to prepare for a kings castle
 [ N x e5 ] , [ N c6 ]  ?! Standard is 3...Qf6.
 [ K f1 ]  [ B g2 + ]  [ K e1 ] , [ R x f2 ]  Nice ending! The faster approach
 [ B c3 ] , [ N x c4 ]  And now it's a two pawn endgame. Black needs to help white reduce his material. Those pieces really need to come off.
 [ N h5 ] , [ B x h7 + ]  Again from here I see baldvin2 as emerging victorious at the end of this battle.
 [ R e6 e3 ]  [ N d1 ] , [ R e3 e1 ]  32. ...... [ R e1 ] - hmm will Freddy now trade rooks?
 [ B e7 ]  [ B b2 ]  [ d6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ O-O ] , [ N d5 ]  a good point to rule from.
 [ N f5 + ]  [ K d7 ] , [ g5 ]  38. [ g5 ] - pawn roll can I stop the Wicked Witch of the West making an appearance? Read on.
 [ B x d5 ] , [ c3 ]  if d4[ x [ c3 ] ] b2[ x d4 ] and then ....[ c3 ] [ c4 ] to remove the [ d5 ] bishop (always targeting the king...)
 [ Q d2 ]  [ B c8 ]  [ Q e1 ]  [ N b8 ] , [ g3 ]  While White was fooling about with the Queen offering no immediate threats. Black contorts his pieces to protect and get them into a better attacking position. Bishop can take over from Queen who intended to head for [ d8 ] to link with both [ B e7 ] and Rook.
 [ R d7 ] , [ R f8 ]  Reclaiming the open file.
 [ O-O ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ Q b3 ]  [ N e3 ]  [ R f3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ B x h7 + ]  [ K x h7 ]  [ R x e3 ]  [ R x e3 ] , [ Q x e3 ]  they bleed really fine too...
 [ N f d7 ] , [ O-O ]  I castle at once. But the idea here was more then just K safety which is in general the only reason for me playing this. In this situation this was also played because of what Loyd does next. It does confirm my instinct about him wanting to continue with his development.
 [ R f8 + ]  [ K c7 ]  [ R f7 + ]  [ K b6 ]  [ e5 ]  [ R x a4 ]  [ g5 ]  [ K x b5 ]  [ R x b7 + ]  [ K c6 ]  [ R x h7 ]  [ K d5 ]  [ R a7 ]  [ K x e5 ]  [ g6 ] , [ R g4 ]  That extra g pawn has not helped in this game. It needs to be carefully considered how such an exchange can affect the endgame.
 [ d4 ] , [ N g e7 ]  Black is all crowded together with no way to exchange pieces. My next move is an attempt at a cheapo tactic.
 [ B d2 ] , [ Q c5 + ]  ! Diffusing the white idea with check and delivering a rather nasty idea of his own. Black is taking advantage of weaknesses that white has created in his position.
 [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ g6 ] , [ Q d3 ]  Now Black must sac the major exchange.
 [ K e4 ] , [ K g7 ]  Let's kill those 2 pawns.
 [ b3 ] , [ g6 ]  Black wastes no time in fianchettoing the dark-squared bishop.
 [ R g6 ]  [ N c5 ] , [ B c6 ]  30. ….. Bc6? (Bc8) - loses pawn.
 [ B x g4 ] , [ Q x g4 ]  The first big blunder by White. He missed 32. [ R x g4 ] [ R f1 ] can be met with 33. [ B e1 ] holding the game together.
 [ c3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ B b6 ] , [ h3 ]  [ B g5 ] is also possible.
 [ Q d2 ] , [ Q f6 ]  White now didn't choose 18.[ R a d1 ] [ B x d4 + ] or 18...[ Q f4 ] 19.[ Q x f4 ] [ g x f4 ] since this endgame is weaker.
 [ e x d5 ] , [ N f6 ]  [ Q x d5 ] is bad here due to [ N c3 ] getting white a tempo.
 [ c x b5 ]  [ a x b5 ]  [ N x b5 ] , [ c4 ]  The point [ c5 ] is freed for the Black pieces.
 [ B c8 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ N d5 ] , [ R c1 ]  Much better was [ R e1 ] preparing to take control of the open file
 [ K g3 ] , [ e x f4 + ]  20. Kg3? allows black to win the pawn gaining another tempo from the check. I considered 20. ... [ B x f4 + ] instead but then after 21. ... [ f x e4 ] black ends up with tripled isolated pawns on the e-file. This way black's e and f pawns trade places and remain adjacent to each other.
 [ d3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B g2 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ f3 ] , [ N x f3 + ]  And after trading bishop for knight black picks up another pawn.
 [ Q x e5 ]  [ Q x e5 ] , [ f x e5 ]  If 27.[ d7 ] black will be more than happy to give back a piece for the two Pawns.
 [ R c6 ] , [ a5 ]  Inching closer to queening. This move also keeps black's rooks in check.
 [ K b1 ] , [ Q b3 + ]  .
 [ d5 ] , [ e3 ]  !? Intersting. I was expecting 3. c4. White gets his LSB active.
 [ B h7 ] , [ R x f6 ]  At this point I decided I was lost and it was time to make the game as intimidating as possible. Black has a win here with 28. ... Qxf6! 29. [ N x f6 ] [ B x g7 ] and black should win.
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ] , [ B d7 ]  Invites White to play a Maroczy Bind
 [ Q e5 ]  [ f3 ]  [ Q c5 + ]  [ K h1 ] , [ b5 ]  25.... b5? Black tried to protect [ b7 ] pawn that's no need to be protected. It's much better black to attack white's pawns since the rooks were not connected yet. 25.... Qc4! then 26.[ R a1 ] Qe2. If 27.[ b3 ] then 27.... [ Q b2 ] or if 27.[ R b1 ] then 27.... Qc2.
 [ Q x g2 ]  [ R f1 ]  [ Q x h2 ] , [ c3 ]  Instead of scaring black's knight white should deal with the threat of Bh3. What will black want to do next? Probably Bh3. [ Q g3 ] would be an expensive answer given that down 5 points fair trades favor black. But otherwise white stands to drop two more points with the bishop/rook exchange.
 [ h3 ]  [ R f7 ]  [ Q e5 ] , [ b6 ]  21. ........ [ b6 ] - a tentative step to Glendadom. I will soon put my rook on [ b7 ] to try and support the passed b pawn.
 [ N e8 ]  [ B g6 + ]  [ K e7 ] , [ d x c5 ]  A little tactical trick here can you see it?
 [ O-O ]  [ O-O ] , [ R e1 ]  Just trying to continue to develop normally and wait for black to move his bishop from d6.
 [ K e2 ] , [ Q x a1 ]  and Black takes the rook and threatens to steal another pawn
 [ B f5 ] , [ B c6 ]  Black continues to push back at White's attackers
 [ B a6 ] , [ c4 ]  And I push my passed pawn being that it's protected by my Ne3.
 [ Q e6 + ]  [ K h8 ]  [ K h1 ]  [ R a d8 ]  [ R a d1 ]  [ R x d1 ]  [ R x d1 ] , [ R d8 ]  Black's queen makes this move possible and forces white off of the d file. Black is now trying to take advantage of white's back rank while protecting his own.
 [ Q e8 ]  [ Q h4 ]  [ R g8 ] , [ N c7 ]  23. [ N c7 ] - fork. Black tries to get out of it by threatening mate on [ g2 ] but my rook will then attack the BQ. When she moves out of the way then the rook on [ a8 ] will be demolished by my knight's huge mace!
 [ d x e5 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ Q x d1 ] , [ R a x d1 ]  Here Black should play ... [ B c5 + ] followed by ... [ N h5 ] and then Black gains the upper hand.
 [ a6 ] , [ h4 ]  English purists are busy getting upset around now but Black's play is just too slow. White can always throw in [ e5 ] opening the h1-[ a8 ] diagonal or f2-f4-f5. Importantly if Black can play [ b5 ] so what? b5-[ b4 ] isn't going to help him and [ b x c4 ] [ d x c4 ] won't achieve much either. Suddenly White has a free attack.
 [ e4 ] , [ N d4 ]  I knew with the queen trade that this was going to happen. a minor inconvenience.
 [ Q b7 ]  [ R c d1 ] , [ R h8 ]  30. ...... [ R h8 ] - here I am planning to put Glenda on [ c8 ] piling up on the pinned [ [ h3 ] ] pawn. White moves his rook to [ f1 ] on move 31 and his knight to [ g1 ] on move 32 to guard this beleagured [ [ h3 ] ] pawn.
 [ d5 ] , [ K x d5 ]  Nice try.
 [ R x c4 ]  [ b x c4 ]  [ B x a1 ]  [ R x a1 ]  [ R c8 ] , [ R c1 ]  White might be better off counter-attacking with a move like Rd1. One advantage of this strategy is that rook endgames are usually drawn if there are pawns on only one side of the board.
 [ N g4 ] , [ h3 ]  
 [ e5 ] , [ R c1 ]  But White has targets and begins to pick at them as a feint. The real goal is Queen penetration to get behind Black's pawns.
 [ B a6 ] , [ f4 ]  ...and here it comes his attack. I won't lose time.
 [ R e1 ] , [ K x e5 ]  ...and my knight...
 [ B e6 ] , [ N c5 ]  If I cannot take her LSB I have a different tactic. What is it?
 [ R x f4 ]  [ R x f4 ]  [ Q h2 + ]  [ N e2 ] , [ B x e2 ]  Best move for white is Ke3. But... my opponent resigned. sensibly. [ Q g3 + ] and he loses another exchange. Thank you for reading!
 [ f5 ] , [ K x a4 ]  Now I have to clear a path to promotion.
 [ R f a1 ]  [ N h5 ]  [ R a4 a8 ]  [ N f4 ]  [ R x f8 + ]  [ K x f8 ]  [ K h2 ]  [ R b2 ]  [ K g3 ]  [ g5 ]  [ R a2 ]  [ R x a2 ]  [ B x a2 ] , [ N x d3 ]  Now the pawns are even and white has the doubled f's to deal with. However the passed c-pawn could be trouble. My knight is consumed by blocking it for awhile.
 [ Q x g4 + ]  [ Q x g4 ]  [ N x g4 ]  [ B x e4 ] , [ d x e4 ]  The e pawn is immune for the moment (...Bd5). My opponent would like to double attack it and moving the king to chase away the black knight seems like a good plan preventing a rook pin in the event of [ R x e4 ] Bd5. But [ N c3 ] [ N g5 ] and [ N d2 ] are somewhat better for white then Kg3.
 [ Q b4 ]  [ b6 ]  [ R a2 ] , [ R a b8 ]  18. ...... [ R a b8 ] - sticking a rook on the same file as the Wicked Witch of the West.
 [ Q e8 ] , [ g4 ]  16. [ g4 ] - risky but I must break that pin.
 [ N d7 ]  [ B x c5 ]  [ b6 ]  [ B f2 ]  [ b5 ] , [ B h4 + ]  17. [ B h4 ] !! - black must now drop a whole rook - his rook must interpose black is almost smothered mated!!
 [ K c1 ] , [ Q a1 # ]  I think Black was lucky to have their attack hit first helped by the [ N f3 ] mistake. If White had been able to stymie Black's attack White has the better opportunity to win. This was my second game against Tamakun. Both were tense well-played games where I had to rely on counterpunching because my worthy opponent built a better position.
 [ h5 ] , [ B e5 ]  So which side to push.... [ c5 ] would be a mistake as after Kx[ c5 ] I would still have to herd 2 pawns to the h&g corner and he would have time to get back
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ] , [ B c4 ]  Bishop's opening.
 [ e4 ] , [ B e7 ]  This is still as previous game.
 [ Q f6 + ]  [ K g2 ]  [ B f3 + ]  [ K g1 ] , [ B e2 ]  17. .... [ B e2 ] - Ion does not take my rook. This is a really horrible move as not only does it threaten a royal fork on [ f3 ] but Old Matey is threatening to descend onto f1.
 [ d5 ]  [ b3 ]  [ B f5 ] , [ B a3 ]  More and more interesting. It's not so easy as it appear move the e pawn without losing the castling rights.
 [ B x c6 ]  [ b x c6 ]  [ Q e2 ] , [ Q g4 ]  I think that was my only move to prevent death.
 [ K e7 ]  [ N f5 + ]  [ K e8 ] , [ Q e3 ]  Threatening [ c5 ] pawn (guarded by knight at d7.) Also help protect castled position.
 [ f x g3 ]  [ e ] , [ p ]  Anderssen instead captures the Pawn.
 [ K d7 ] , [ R c7 + ]  Totally winning now is the prozaic 18. 0-0! [ h x g5 ] 19. d6!! followed by Qf7... But this is also winning...
 [ R e2 ] , [ B e8 ]  prepare to free g way
 [ N x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ] , [ Q x d5 ]  And I
 [ Q a4 ]  [ B x d4 ]  [ B x d4 ]  [ b3 ] , [ R x c2 + ]  rook sac! force mate! awesome!
 [ N e3 ]  [ d x e3 ]  [ f x e3 ] , [ R x e3 + ]  Now he's is tremendously hot water. There are slim to NO good options here.
 [ R x e8 + ]  [ K x e8 ]  [ N c7 + ]  [ K d7 ]  [ N b5 ]  [ B x c2 ] , [ N x a7 ]  I spot the free pawn so I immediately capture it to try to regain as much material.
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ g6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ B e3 ] , [ Q b6 ]  Interesting. I could have got beaten bad in this game but I capitalized better on his mistakes than he did on mine.
 [ Q x b7 ] , [ B d3 ]  Trying to scare rook so queen can slip in and take king
 [ B d2 ] , [ B a3 ]  I thought I was about to lose here. as I could see no way to prevent [ B b2 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ c x d3 ] , [ R h3 ]  Now [ B b2 ] seems to win!
 [ B e3 ]  [ b6 ]  [ O-O-O ]  [ B b7 ] , [ N f3 ]  Move 10 In three moves i've got pieces around my pawns.
 [ e x d5 ]  [ Q x d5 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ Q d8 ]  see what I mean?
 [ B g7 ]  [ Q b3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N d2 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N f4 ] , [ g5 ]  I wanted to get rid of N near center of the board. He was getting control of [ e6 ] which was scary. Thought for a long time for advancing my pawns near king. But saw no immediate danger. Would have been very interesting game if he would have played [ h4 ] instead of castling subsequently.
 [ N f6 ] , [ h3 ]  This move was made to avoid an exchange on g4. I did not want to trade Queen's at this point since mine is crucial to holding my position together. I was focused on keeping my Pawns where they were. Fritz 8 says I should've made the move Nc3.
 [ K b5 ]  [ K f5 ]  [ K c4 ]  [ K f6 ] , [ K d5 ]  centralizing king complete
 [ b5 ]  [ K f2 ] , [ K g6 ]  There is nothing black can do.
 [ c x b5 ] , [ a8 = Q + ]  I like this guy!
 [ R g3 + ]  [ K h1 ] , [ B d6 ]  ? What happened to Rxg4? Black's rook doesn't need protection. This is viewed by the computer analysis as a blunder. Why? Because now there was the opportunity for a mate in 2! Alas though I did not see it at all. I am unable to show you the puzzle for the comments do not allow me but check out puzzle #121689 to see how the game would of ended if I did play the sequence.
 [ d5 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ e3 ] , [ e6 ]  Wow. I went in that once. He was playing to fast.
 [ N g3 ] , [ B f5 ]  Being down on material does not mean this is a logical move.
 [ R e5 ]  [ h x g4 ]  [ K h2 ] , [ R g h8 ]  Now I threaten gxh and [ N g5 + ] forking the rook.
 [ N a c3 ] , [ Q c7 ]  Here I became really tempted by 25.[ R x f6 ] even getting to the point of deciding 26.[ Q [ [ f5 ] ] ] would be the best follow-up but decided there wouldn't be enough compensation for the exchange. It would destroy his kingside pawn structure remove an attacker of [ d4 ] and make [ [ f5 ] ] a nice-looking square for a knight. However White's pieces are not in very good spots to take advantage of these factors. For instance the quickest way to get a knight to [ [ f5 ] ] is to advance the g-pawn (allowing Ne2-g3-f5) but the half-open g-file gives Black counterplay against that pawn. Black also keeps his counterplay down the b-file. Trying to set up the sacrifice with 25.[ Q d2 ] was also considered but found wanting and Black could also reply 25...Bg5. White just doesn't have a strong enough position to sacrifice material.
 [ Q g6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ N f7 ]  [ Q d3 ]  [ c6 ] , [ c4 ]  White continues a central pawn occupation hoping for some edge.
 [ h4 ]  [ R c5 ] , [ B b4 ]  Now Black will endure suffering. You may have thought that Excalibur would resign by now....... but that is one defect with the model I use - it NEVER resigns. Nonetheless this does mean my endgame skills are always tested!
 [ e x d5 ]  [ R x e7 + ] , [ K f2 ]  There were two reasons behind this king move; 1) The king is set to halt any advance by the f-pawn should Black want to do something with it 2) White doesn't want a rook intrusion on the second rank
 [ Q x f5 ]  [ R f6 x f5 ] , [ f3 ]  ...at least now will be an engame. With a piece less... a lost position.
 [ B x d4 ]  [ Q x d4 + ]  [ K f1 ] , [ b x a3 ]  28....0-0 or 28.....[ Q b6 ] how can White win?
 [ Q g2 + ]  [ K e1 ] , [ R x e4 ]  opponent resigns. a free queen and his entire attack has also petered out. and the following rook would shortly drop also and then he would also have a hanging lsb. i hope you all enjoyed the game. tied with my highest rated beaten opponent ill take it! 2-2
 [ Q d4 + ]  [ Q x d4 ]  [ R x d4 ]  [ a x b2 + ] , [ K x b2 ]  32. [ K x b2 ] - I am now a whole rook up in a rook and pawn ending. Beginners - here is how you clean up your opponent who opts not to wave the white flag!
 [ R c1 + ]  [ K d2 ]  [ R f1 ] , [ R e7 + ]  Now I resigned and I have probably been irritating for my opponent as I kept moving so I felt it was right to say sorry that I kept continuing and so I did. It looks like I need to go back to learn basics as material doesnt win against mighty pawn arsenal. Somebody might wonder why I didnt try to go for draw by someway and truth is I didnt find one and other reason is that I hate draws as I want only to win but in lost position I will go for draw if I find it even that I hate it.
 [ Q a5 + ] , [ B d2 ]  of course: [ N e7 ] is lost...
 [ N h5 ]  [ B x g7 ] , [ N x g7 ]  Maybe [ f5 ] with [ N f6 ] is good too.
 [ B e7 ]  [ O-O-O ] , [ B g4 ]  I think if I were black I would have castled here this move allows me to start pushing my pawns forward.
 [ R a b8 ] , [ g4 ]  advancing for attack ! ?
 [ N d5 ]  [ e6 ]  [ B x g7 ]  [ K x g7 ]  [ Q c3 + ]  [ f6 ]  [ N d f4 ] , [ b5 ]  Here we go! This is the point at which I had to make the decision that would color the rest of my game: play energetically or passively? ...There's only one answer for me.
 [ B c4 ]  [ h6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ a6 ]  [ a4 ] , [ f6 ]  I don't really understand Black's thinking with any of the moves after [ e5 ] to be honest. he's just happy doing his own thing so I just contented myself with doing mine.
 [ f4 ]  [ Q e4 ]  [ R f2 ] , [ a x b6 ]  The conditional move I left for him here is [ Q x b6 ] Bxf4; [ Q x b7 ] Rb8.
 [ B b4 ] , [ a3 ]  ? Useless move since I can ignore the threat due to the hanging R.
 [ Q d1 + ]  [ K f2 ]  [ Q e2 + ] , [ K g3 ]  Dancing 'round the e-pawn and into the jaws of the unavoidable Mate Trap.
 [ K x e7 ] , [ K g1 ]  Trying to bring the king to the middle of the board a bit behind at this point however.
 [ B x d5 ] , [ N c4 ]  A bad mistake and I took two days to make this move. And I noticed my mistake just after I made my move funny how often that happens to me. Now black can play B*[ g2 ] forcing me to move my rook then he can play Q-[ h3 ] with a strong attack. I should have played [ e4 ] driving his bishop back and then played N-c4. I can get so wrapped up in a certain variation that I don't look at other possibilities. In short I can become so fixated on one variation that it produces an inhibiting effect on all my other thoughts. This happens in my life as well. I'm thinking at the time 'oh no I've done it again'. I was already in a bad losing streak and saw it continueing with this move.
 [ N b6 ] , [ B b3 ]  6. [ B b3 ] - this time I decide to keep Fou Leblanc. I also decide to create a bolt hole for him by playing [ a4 ] to counter a possible b5.
 [ Q x e6 ] , [ R x f8 # ]  A splendid finish.
 [ R f8 ] , [ K e2 ]  The idea is to tie the rooks then [ R h f1 ] is powerful.
 [ B x g5 ] , [ R b8 ]  an attempt to get rid of the Rook... I agree
 [ R h8 + ]  [ K g6 ]  [ R g8 + ]  [ K h5 ]  [ R h8 + ]  [ K g6 ]  [ R g8 + ]  [ K h6 ]  [ R h8 + ] , [ K g7 ]  Black still refuses the draw
 [ K a2 ]  [ Q x h3 ]  [ Q x b7 + ]  [ K g8 ] , [ Q b8 + ]  I prefer Qc8ch here keeping guard over the g-pawn.
 [ R e1 ]  [ B g4 ] , [ B g5 ]  Symmetrical game again
 [ R e6 ]  [ g3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ K g2 ] , [ K g7 ]  We both improve our kings.
 [ e x f5 ]  [ B x f5 ]  [ h4 ]  [ R x h5 ]  [ K d2 ]  [ B x d3 ]  [ N x h5 ]  [ R f7 ]  [ K x d3 ] , [ R x f2 ]  29. ........ [ R x f2 ] after the resulting disastrous exchanges I am a whole piece down. My rook does his best to hold things together - maybe if my opponent had an extra bishop instead of a knight I might have stood a better chance but that knight just hops about everywhere! I will not further annotate this game as this is an exercise in futility - I resigned the game as I was about to go deeper into the red materialwise - Marin's last move was a horrible echo of what happened at the end of our previous game). I think the best way forward is to finish the current games agains the Experts and then take stock. What I am now going to do is to play more unrated games in the 1600s to 1800s bracket and try and work my way up. Hopefully if I can get some good results against these I can have another stab at challenging an Expert (other than a training game) and give him or her a much tougher assignment - possibly reach that elusive utopia of half point or dare I hope more!
 [ d x e5 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ K d8 ]  [ f4 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ g4 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ B d1 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ c3 ]  [ B h4 + ]  [ K f1 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ K g2 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ N d2 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ B c2 ] , [ K e8 ]  With a won game Black starts to drift. He should be thinking how to get his [ a1 ] rook activated.
 [ O-O ] , [ O-O ]  We castled so far a quiet game. Noone is risking.
 [ R c8 ] , [ B b2 ]  another development move c4? not a good idea at this point maybe later.. I'd love to play [ e5 ] though - so let's prepare to that - [ R e8 ]  [ R e8 ] , [ B b5 ]  pining my knight - first attempt from my opponent to gain a small edge on the other end it gives me time to strenghten my pawn structure even more in the queen side with [ a6 ] but he will exchange and I will have to recapture with my queen and then [ N e5 ] will give him intiative I'll block with my Bishop [ B c6 ]  [ B c6 ] , [ B a6 ]  hmmm he keeps bothering me ok I'll run him away [ R b8 ] if he wont retreat then [ b5 ] and the bishop will fall
 [ K d4 ]  [ h4 ]  [ K d3 ]  [ h3 ]  [ K d4 ]  [ h2 ]  [ K d5 ] , [ h1 = Q ]  Hash browns ya
 [ R x d7 ]  [ R x d7 ] , [ N x e5 ]  ? The wrong way to take back! Much stronger for white is 16. [ B x e5 ] [ B d6 ] 17. [ B x g7 ] [ R g8 ] 18. [ B f6 ] [ R x g2 ] 19. [ N d4 ] +- This move equalizes for black and possibly even pushes the edge in that direction!
 [ Q e7 ] , [ R f e8 ]  Activates the Rook with tempo.
 [ K c2 ]  [ N b4 + ] , [ K b3 ]  Once again I get a draw offer. I don't say a word.
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ] , [ e3 ]  Queen's pawn (D00) stonewall attack.
 [ B x f5 ] , [ Q x f5 ]  we trade bishops
 [ Q e5 ]  [ R c1 ]  [ K g7 ]  [ B c6 ]  [ Q e7 ]  [ R c f1 ]  [ R e5 ]  [ Q c3 ]  [ K h6 ]  [ B d5 ]  [ R e g5 ]  [ Q b3 ]  [ Q e5 ] , [ R d1 ]  I've built up my position to the maximum extent. I had foreseen the following sacrifice and judged that it had to be winning. I was later severely criticized for playing the sacrifice but it was a later error that cost me the game. Although a rook is a very heavy investment I felt that the sudden exposure of White’s king and the prospect of obtaining two connected and far advanced passed pawns hurtling down the board just had to be worth the high price.
 [ K f1 ]  [ B x c5 ]  [ N x c5 ]  [ K e7 ] , [ N e4 ]  White wants to get his knight to d6-Not the most accurate idea but it is fine. This will help white build pressure on the file.
 [ B x d4 + ]  [ K h1 ]  [ f6 ]  [ B h4 ]  [ g5 ]  [ B g3 ]  [ B x b2 ] , [ R a c1 ]  ?
 [ e x f6 ] , [ Q x f6 ]  The queen is not well placed in this position. I immediately put black on the defensive with my next move.
 [ d x e5 ] , [ N x e5 ]  Tom also could've recaptured with his B but is interested in exchanging my B.
 [ e x d8 = Q + ] , [ K b7 ]  Once the rook captures then I queen my [ e7 ] pawn by capturing the rook at [ d8 ] which checks the king at c7. The king moves out of check to [ b7 ] as that is the only move available.
 [ Q x c2 + ]  [ K g3 ]  [ B e6 ] , [ Q b7 ]  Attacking the Knight and the Rook at once
 [ c x d6 ] , [ B x f6 ]  and I HATE Knights! especially late in the game...
 [ d4 ] , [ g6 ]  Here I'm playing black with the modern defense. It's a blitz game timed 5min+15.
 [ b5 ] , [ N b4 ]  27. ..... [ N b4 ] - for one moment it looks as though I am gonna lose either my rook on [ c2 ] or my knight on a3. However [ R b2 ] takes my rook out of the line of fire and counter-attacks his knight. William took off my knight and then offered me that draw which would lead to an endgame where it would be a rook and pawn ending with just those kingside pawns. I accepted and was pleased to gain one rating point from that high draw! I will soon be writing another annotation about Q v 2 rooks so more from Yours Truly later! Until then have a good read - Kind regards - Joanne
 [ R x a7 ] , [ R f3 f7 ]  So at this point my goal is to put pressure on the seventh rank. The other story is that I want to confine his position but unfortunately the plan is not going to work.
 [ Q f6 ] , [ O-O-O ]  Essential because [ b2 ] was hanging.
 [ Q f2 ] , [ Q h6 ]  I intend to place the queen at [ g6 ] so that it can survey the weak point [ h7 ] after white takes control of the h file
 [ e4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ] , [ e6 ]  Standard Icelandic move.
 [ R x a7 ]  [ R a8 ] , [ R x b7 ]  My opponent claimed the easy captures and left me with a sizeable disadvantage.
 [ N x c5 ]  [ B f3 ] , [ N b3 ]  I hope opponent avoid to take my [ b7 ] Bishop and opponent really avoid
 [ K b3 ]  [ Q c6 ]  [ a4 ] , [ d5 ]  Preventing the K from escaping into the center of the board.
 [ Q a4 ]  [ b5 ]  [ c x b5 ]  [ a x b5 ]  [ Q x b5 ] , [ R f b8 ]  19. ...... [ R f b8 ] - although I am temporarily a pawn down the Witch is skewered in front of her [ b2 ] pawn and she cannot retreat to defend it so I get the pawn back and give my opponent that bone in the throat.
 [ N x e4 ] , [ f x e6 ]  and now ? which one first ?
 [ N e c4 ]  [ R e7 ] , [ N e4 ]  To try and conquer the center
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ f4 ]  [ e x f4 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ d6 ]  Kings Gambit Fischer defense. I've played thousands of KG games as white (and hundreds of Latvian Gambits as black) yet this one was unique as I very soon found myself under early attack. Normally it's the other way around: the gambiteer should be the early attacker. That being said under a threat of mate Caissa smiled and I found a sneaky way out...and was able to turn the tables just in time.
 [ R x g6 ]  [ B x a3 ]  [ R x e6 ]  [ R g8 ]  [ R x h6 + ]  [ K g7 ]  [ R h7 + ]  [ K f8 ] , [ R x b7 ]  I let him run wild. I'm lucky to get a draw.
 [ B g2 ] , [ h5 ]  I probably wouldn't have thought of this on my own; credit the database here. The point is that it forces a weakening of the kingside pawn structure no matter what White does.
 [ K h7 ] , [ R e3 ]  ...and attack the queen.
 [ B b5 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ] , [ a6 ]  Hitting my Bb5. I was hesitate on deciding whether to take or not. I am keeping in mind what Ken said about not exchanging for the thrills of it. But I decide to do it anyway. However it's not because I can (which has been done before the training.) The real reason behind taking is due to in my opinion Loyd leaving himself with a weakness by playing 2...[ N c6 ] before advancing the c pawn. So I was trying to take advantage of that weakness which you want to do in chess. That's because I view that N as worth more then my B since I think I know what it's capable. By taking it my thought process is that black will wind up in trouble.
 [ B e4 ] , [ N h4 # ]  and the knockout for me that wasn't one of the greatest game ever this is the best game of all time . i hope you enjoyed the game thank you and i would like to read your comments
 [ Q x g7 ] , [ B f6 ]  A natural forcing move although the knight is re-pinned. 10. [ R f8 ] is also worth considering.
 [ g x h4 ]  [ g x h4 ]  [ K d4 ]  [ B a6 ]  [ K c5 ]  [ K f6 ]  [ K b6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ a6 ]  [ B x a6 ]  [ K x a6 ]  [ K e5 ]  [ K b5 ]  [ f4 ]  [ K c4 ]  [ K e4 ]  [ K c3 ]  [ f3 ]  [ B e1 ]  [ K e3 ]  [ B d2 + ]  [ K f2 ]  [ K x d3 ]  [ e1 = Q ]  [ B x e1 + ]  [ K x e1 ]  [ K e3 ]  [ f2 ]  [ K f3 ]  [ f1 = Q + ]  [ K g4 ]  [ K e2 ]  [ K x h4 ]  [ K f3 ]  [ K h5 ] , [ K f4 ]  63. ... [ Q x h3 ] probably finishes faster.
 [ R e8 ] , [ N c3 ]  Threatening to win a pawn with the exchange on [ e4 ] so: (No you're not going mad - I did just repeat my own annotation for two different moves. It's called unpoetic license).
 [ Q d5 ] , [ Q x d5 ]  I don't like the trade but it allows...
 [ Q f4 ] , [ K h8 ]  Playing safe but I could have played Nxf5! [ N x f5 ] [ B x f5 ] [ Q x f5 ] Rxe5! White's queen cannot move off the f file because I have a mate threat on f1. [ Q f4 ] Re6! is powerful because I am threatening [ R f6 ] with a skewer and if [ B x f6 ] fe [ Q x f8 ] [ K x f8 ] I am material up and still threatening mate on f2. But this is a computer line that I didn't see in the game but could have found if I looked for the forcing move [ N x f5 ]  [ Q f1 ] , [ B x d4 ]  The combination involves getting rid of the protector of [ e2 ] after which it is all over
 [ Q x g3 ]  [ h x g3 ]  [ N e7 ]  [ a4 ]  [ f6 ]  [ e x f6 ]  [ g x f6 ]  [ g4 ]  [ e5 ] , [ B d2 ]  Still nothing past the second rank for white----but that h file is some compensation.
 [ f x g4 ] , [ B x g4 ]  And this bishop is finally developed.
 [ B e5 ]  [ f4 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ Q e3 ]  I think this game illustrates very well the folly of neglecting development. Also the futility of attacking with only two minor pieces.
 [ B x h3 ]  [ R x e7 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ R x c7 ]  [ N x h5 ]  [ R x c6 ]  [ R b4 ] , [ f4 ]  28. [ R x d6 ] is disastrous for white. [ R g4 ] 29. [ K h1 ] [ R f2 ] from here black should lead white into checkmate.
 [ Q x e4 ] , [ N f6 ]  I capture black's pawn at [ e4 ] with my queen and black moves his knight to [ f6 ] attacking my queen at e4.
 [ Q x b5 ]  [ B b6 ]  [ R b4 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ R d1 ]  [ Q x a2 ]  [ R a4 ]  [ Q c2 ] , [ R a a1 ]  
 [ N x e6 ]  [ f x e6 ] , [ B b2 ]  This is a reason why. With the completed doubled fianchettoed the B's are going to be monsters. At the moment white's [ B g2 ] only covers 2 squares and the [ B b2 ] only covers 1. But with a pawn move or the N moving that would all change. If and when that happens things will become dangerous for black.
 [ b6 ]  [ f4 ]  [ b7 ] , [ N d7 ]  rather than taking immediately this makes white waste another move
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ B c4 ]  White transposes the 4N opening to 2Ns as he avoids playing the usual 4.[ B b5 ] instead prefers 4.Bc4. But text allows
 [ N x e2 ]  [ B d2 ] , [ R e a1 ]  The rook is out of harms way here but is not doing very much.
 [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ] , [ Q c7 ]  I'm surprised that he played this as opposed to 4...[ N x d4 ] in which case I'd play 5.[ Q x d4 ] Of course there's nothing wrong with this move. My guess is that he's doing this to strengthen his position on the Q side which makes sense since there's added pressure to the c file. Nontheless I will take and force an exchange. Now we were still at the phase where I thought that you just should against stronger players. However I know otherwise that you don't just do so because you can. And I feel that taking is going to strengthen his position which is why he would play this.
 [ R x d2 + ]  [ R x d2 ]  [ N e x d2 ] , [ N x c7 + ]  And in my haste to get to a defensible position on his side of the board......
 [ Q x e5 ] , [ Q f6 ]  This is the move that lost Black the game.
 [ Q e7 + ]  [ Q e2 ]  [ B e6 ] , [ N f3 ]  White has no easy way to take this pawn.
 [ B x c2 ]  [ B x b5 + ]  [ K f7 ]  [ N x c2 ]  [ B x b2 ] , [ a4 ]  already the winning move: with the Bishop pair guarding the free pawn promotion is only a matter of time...
 [ Q x b7 ]  [ B f4 + ]  [ K g1 ] , [ B x e5 ]  Better is 39...[ g5 ] getting the Q back into the game.
 [ e x d5 ]  [ O-O ] , [ N e2 ]  ?! why do the knight go to that square?
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e3 ]  [ e6 ] , [ B e2 ]  I'm not sure this was best. [ N c3 ] is more common. But with the Black pawn on [ g6 ] [ B d3 ] isn't the best diagonal.
 [ a x b5 ] , [ a x b5 ]  40. ..... [ a x b5 ] - here I am being conservative yet again. I just wanted to eliminate any chance of white getting a passer on the queenside which cannot easily be rounded up in time. I now have 3 queenside passers.
 [ B h2 ]  [ K f7 ]  [ B c7 ]  [ h6 ] , [ g x h6 ]  Maybe white could wait with 36.[ R d1 ] as in the game?
 [ Q e8 + ]  [ K h7 ] , [ Q x e6 ]  regains the material
 [ N e3 ]  [ c7 ] , [ N d5 + ]  
 [ N x f7 + ] , [ K d7 ]  The only refuge.
 [ K g1 ] , [ d x c3 + ]  he doesn't expect this.... move
 [ d4 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ e4 ]  [ g6 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N e5 ] , [ f4 ]  Black loses the knight.
 [ N f5 ]  [ B x f5 ]  [ B x f5 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ Q h4 ] , [ g6 ]  Forced pawn advance gives access to [ h6 ] for the white queen..black pieces are helpless on his queen-side
 [ R d6 + ]  [ K c4 ]  [ h4 ]  [ b3 ] , [ h5 ]  Nope. Allows the next move.
 [ Q x e7 ]  [ R x e7 + ]  [ K h6 ] , [ R x b7 ]  Black resigns.
 [ N x d4 ]  [ Q x d4 ] , [ g6 ]  Usually I played [ e6 ] and developed the Bishop on [ e7 ] but I couldn't resist the potential later tempi on Qd4. Also I knew that in the Dragon variation the Queen has to be on [ d2 ] to support eventual [ B h6 ] so I figured if he wants to play this way I will again gain a few tempi while he sets it up. So everything looked rather rosy at the moment. Objectively the game is equal.
 [ e x d4 ]  [ c x d4 ] , [ d5 ]  Not bad. I have a potentially annoying pin that requires a lot of weakening pawn's moves from white.
 [ B f4 ]  [ Q c8 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ a6 ]  [ B x c6 + ]  [ Q x c6 ]  [ R a c1 ]  [ h6 ] , [ Q x g7 ]  ??? resigns!! why: after rg8! the queen moves i go q[ x g2 ] mate he has to give up his queen!! please leave a comment or two and rank it on the star system thank you!!
 [ a x b6 ]  [ d x c3 ]  [ R x a7 ]  [ R x a7 ]  [ b x a7 ]  [ c x b2 ]  [ B x b2 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ Q g7 ] , [ R f8 ]  20..[ Q g8 ] better but black thinks that white have to do 21. [ B x g6 ] and chance to get one of white's Bishop. By moving ..Qb6. But he falls here
 [ d6 ] , [ b3 ]  Going for my normal diagonal pawn defense.
 [ Q x c6 ] , [ d5 ]  the pawn achieves its mission buying another tempo at the same time
 [ B x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ] , [ g4 ]  kick the bishop im not afraid that he will trade white bishop for knight
 [ B b5 ] , [ R f c1 ]  taking over the c-file...
 [ B e5 ]  [ B x e5 ]  [ Q x e5 ] , [ h5 ]  Maybe not the best. Maybe k[ f1 ] and k[ e2 ] was better.
 [ R e8 ]  [ Q d3 ] , [ Q b6 ]  The black Queen advance threatens with many difficulties. I analyzed in-depth a sacrifice of the [ b2 ] pawn which leads to complications. Black rejects the sacrifice.
 [ K g6 ] , [ Q f5 + ]  At this point I am already starting to feel the pressure.
 [ K d6 ] , [ K d4 ]  I have to stop his king entering my position. Computer says +1.72 to Black
 [ R a4 ]  [ B f6 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ R d8 ]  [ B e6 + ]  [ K f8 ]  [ B d6 + ] , [ K e8 ]  ruthless...
 [ Q b3 ]  [ a5 ]  [ Q d1 ]  [ c4 ] , [ N e1 ]  a bit odd but I can't forfeit the pawns now and if he get's a knight in he might be able to fork I miss those more often then I should so I'd rather get him out of the way
 [ B a6 ] , [ N d4 ]  He's also attacking f5.
 [ N x f3 ]  [ Q f4 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ h x g6 ] , [ e6 ]  This was an obvious mistake resulting in mate in 5. Better was [ h x g6 ] when I was planning [ Q h2 ] and Black will have trouble covering both focal points of [ h7 ] and h8.
 [ O-O ]  [ c3 ]  [ a5 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ c5 ]  [ B f4 ] , [ B a6 ]  Black tries to exchange White’s key Bishop.
 [ N c3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ N x c6 ]  [ N x c3 ]  [ N x d8 ]  [ N x d1 ]  [ K x d1 ]  [ K x d8 ]  [ e4 ]  [ e5 ] , [ B c4 ]  I decide to attack the f pawn...
 [ N c7 ]  [ R c d1 ] , [ N e8 ]  I guess he didn't really want to trade Knights
 [ B e7 ]  [ c3 ] , [ O-O ]  evgraan) Well played. A good strong move. Solidifying your center and supporting the strong knight on e5. Black's position is solid but he needs space. and time to develop so O-O tries to give some space. A primary concern for black is the strong knight on e5...
 [ O-O-O ]  [ N c4 ]  [ Q a7 ]  [ Q e2 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ Q e4 ] , [ B d7 ]  16... [ B f5 ] looks better here however White's uncoordinated assault will give way to Black's prepared and coordinated attack.
 [ g x f3 ]  [ Q x d4 ] , [ B e3 ]  There's no rush for 15 [ N x [ c7 ] ] . The text develops another piece with tempo and the [ c7 ] fork will still be there for the taking.
 [ B x e7 ]  [ K x e7 ]  [ Q g5 + ]  [ K f8 ] , [ R x e5 ]  uh oh! black is in trouble!!
 [ K g2 ] , [ c5 ]  
 [ R a b1 ]  [ a5 ]  [ a4 ]  [ R b8 ]  [ K f1 ]  [ R b d8 ]  [ R x d5 ]  [ R x d5 ]  [ K e2 ] , [ K f8 ]  A blunder! Now White can force a material lead.
 [ h5 ] , [ K e8 ]  My king has to help too.
 [ d4 ]  [ B b6 ] , [ B g5 ]  Threatening my queen but I see that this attack has no support and the bishop is hanging. A better way of attacking the queen would be to play 7.[ N f3 ] and follow that with 8.[ B g5 ] so that the bishop has some support. In addition [ N f3 ] develops a piece and opens up castling lines.
 [ B x e3 ]  [ B x e3 ]  [ R x d1 + ]  [ K x d1 ]  [ Q d6 + ]  [ K c2 ]  [ R d8 ] , [ B e2 ]  Still forced since all other roads lead to checkmate or losing White Queen.
 [ N f3 ]  [ N b d7 ]  [ e3 ]  [ b6 ]  [ B d3 ] , [ e x d5 ]  We finally see [ e x d5 ] but Black still has his bishop trapped...
 [ g3 ] , [ h6 ]  Making him retreat.
 [ B e7 ] , [ B f4 ]  I want to double up on this diagonal with my queen so I have to move my bishop first.
 [ N c6 ] , [ N d5 ]  I think [ e4 ] was better since I am moving the same piece twice. But if Black trades knights then I'll get an open c-file and superior control of the center.
 [ B x c3 ] , [ B x c3 ]  I don't mind this exchange I'd prefer to keep the bishop as the board clears
 [ N e1 ] , [ B g6 ]  Hoping for a chance to play 23...f4!
 [ d6 ]  [ c4 ] , [ e5 ]  This takes us out of the Gameknot database. The aim is prohylaxis it limits the white dsbs threats into my kingside. As it happens this is maintaned for much of the game.
 [ a6 ] , [ b3 ]  This is a pretty unusual move and I have a feeling it's a slight mistake. Because you have more pieces out you should be trying to create some initiative and attacking chances. I think it's better to try to keep getting pieces out and castling as fast as possible then trying to launch an attack.
 [ K f2 ] , [ K b3 ]  Now I can advance my RP.
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ d6 ]  Ah Philidore. Creates an early strong point at e5. This is not exceptable to me. I wish to open the game and complicate with tactics! White will counter attack this without delay!
 [ a6 ]  [ B d3 ] , [ Q f4 ]  Black would seem to be trading down queens here? Via [ Q e3 ] or Qe5. However white can finally win his pawn and gain an attack. Though this also allows black to become dangerous. I choose chaos.
 [ b x c5 ] , [ d x c5 ]  ...otherwise the white's d pawn will become very strong.
 [ B e7 ]  [ Q e3 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ N c5 ]  [ R x a1 ]  [ R x a1 ] , [ Q b6 ]  Looking for tactical possibilities if the N retreats.
 [ K g8 ]  [ R d4 ]  [ g6 ]  [ R h4 ]  [ Q f6 ]  [ N g4 ]  [ Q x b2 ] , [ N e5 ]  Black recaptures a pawn presumably a forlorn attempt to maintain material gain. Black has now though blocked off the queen from the dark diagonal and white is free to operate on the h file at will.
 [ N c6 ] , [ K d2 ]  Getting out of any n[ d4 ] checks.
 [ a5 ]  [ N b d2 ] , [ b5 ]  My opponent is unsure of what to do I think.
 [ K f7 ] , [ R e1 ]  He still does not play h7. White will pay dearly for this foolishness.
 [ Q f2 ]  [ Q d5 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ N a3 ]  [ Q c6 ]  [ c3 ] , [ N f5 ]  Nice trap for white's queen here. Unfortunately there's no way I can fool myself.
 [ R c3 + ]  [ K h2 ]  [ R x c4 ]  [ R a8 + ]  [ K f7 ]  [ R a7 + ]  [ K g6 ]  [ h x g5 ]  [ K x g5 ]  [ R x a2 ]  [ R d4 ]  [ R a5 ] , [ f4 ]  Now it's honestly quite over you can finish looking at the game if you want.
 [ Q e8 ]  [ R a d1 ]  [ Q g6 ]  [ N a3 ] , [ e4 ]  Alternative variation: 18... [ R a c8 ] 19. [ B x c5 ] [ d x c5 ] 20. [ B x c6 ] [ R x c6 ] 21. [ f3 ] $15
 [ K d2 ]  [ N b5 ]  [ K c2 ] , [ N c3 ]  Now this is good . i will get bishop for free King must move away
 [ B x c4 ] , [ B a6 ]  !?
 [ R e2 ]  [ R c d8 ] , [ R a e1 ]  Sets a potential threat.
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ] , [ e3 ]  I thought this was intresting. I had never seen it before but I didn't doubt the skills of a 1350.
 [ N x d7 ] , [ Q x d7 ]  another Q move and still no improvement in Black's position. In fact Black's pawns are a mess and he's one down
 [ b x c3 ] , [ Q x c3 + ]  there is no escape. Every response is now fatale
 [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ a6 ] , [ B g5 ]  As I've taught her she develops. However I sense that there's more to it then meets the eye after our last game. Normally this wouldn't happen but that blunder involved pressure against my Knight with her Bishop. By overlooking the threat Sue won a piece for a pawn early as some of you know.
 [ N c5 ] , [ b4 ]  Now I start seizing space on the Queenside.
 [ R x e4 ]  [ R x a2 ]  [ N b3 ] , [ N c5 ]  And White's position collapses
 [ N x c5 ]  [ b x c5 ] , [ R e1 ]  As I learned from tactical-abyss in a previous snapshot analysis thread one of controlling the center is to attack it. So by placing the R on the center square that is attacking the opponents center.
 [ N f3 ]  [ N x c3 ]  [ N x g5 ]  [ N x d1 ] , [ R a x d1 ]  It looks like I let him out of the bag. But WT is much better here with his strafing B-pair imo. The K-side defenders are now down to 2 the K and R. There is the immediate threat of 14.[ N x f7 ] or 14.[ B x f7 ] which he cannot take either or gets backrank mated. And there is something of a bind on developing his Q-side pieces at all I hope to bring more pieces to bear and try to infiltrate to win material. I'm not expecting Mate from here. So he pulls The Best Move out of his hat here ...
 [ h6 ] , [ c3 ]  White now wanted to move his queen side pawns. That is a bad idea because he does not have a strong attack with it and it weakens white's defense. Meanwhile I decide to continue development and castling.
 [ R d b8 ] , [ R f7 ]  The threat is to the queen or mate with g7.
 [ Q h4 ] , [ b4 ]  And the white pawns start to roll. White's position is totally winning.
 [ R h d8 ] , [ Q f3 ]  White's pieces are much more active here.
 [ K e7 ] , [ B e3 ]  My dark square bishop is eyeing c5...
 [ K d8 ]  [ R d1 + ] , [ K c8 ]  I finished my opponent off by trying to forcefully budge the Bishop away from Black's knight.
 [ O-O ]  [ e5 ] , [ d5 ]  by not taking the pawn on [ e5 ] I keep your pawn structure bad and increase pressure in your position with the push.
 [ f x e2 + ]  [ K x e2 ] , [ N c4 ]  It was here I realized my e-pawn was weak and a target.
 [ Q x h5 ]  [ B d4 ]  [ K h2 ] , [ R g8 ]  I know hit white with everything I've got.
 [ N c3 ] , [ a6 ]  plan is to go [ b5 ]  [ a4 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ d3 ]  [ g6 ] , [ N g5 ]  a waste of time.
 [ a5 ]  [ K d4 ]  [ a4 ]  [ e4 ]  [ a3 ]  [ K c3 ] , [ R a8 ]  40. ..... Ra8! - not a2? as the WK can blockade it with [ K b2 ] and Ka1. This ensures that at the very least white must give up her rook for Glenda. This is exactly what happens. It is amazing that at the sight of a big black queen how many opponents wave that white flag. Gail duly waved it as soon as Glenda appeared. Gail would have been a whole rook and pawn to the bad and my rook would have no trouble in cleaning up the white pawns and then checkmating the WK. I hope this will help if you do get stuck in a won position but you are wondering just how to convert it. I hope you have a good read. Bye for now - Joanne
 [ N x e6 ]  [ N d5 ] , [ R f4 ]  No! Now my rook will be....
 [ R e1 ] , [ N f e4 ]  14. .... [ N f e4 ] - both steeds back each other up. I try and put a choke on Chris' position but can I make further progress? We shall see.
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ N g5 ] , [ d5 ]  Usually I would castle at this point but this move takes me into the attack with king attacking white knight.
 [ Q x e5 ] , [ N e4 ]  Every single White piece is participating in the attack. The center is about to break wide open; Black can maintain something close to material equality with 20...[ R h6 ] or 20...[ R f8 ] but White may simply choose not to crush down on [ f6 ] until his Rooks both occupy the d-file and his Queen is on b3. There is no adequate defense and no time to rush to the queenside. Material is still nearly equal but there is no hope left for Black with three critical pieces sitting useless on his back rank.
 [ B d6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ N e5 ]  [ c5 ] , [ f4 ]  Planting the [ N e5 ] is a good step.
 [ B x f6 ]  [ K x f6 ]  [ Q g3 ]  [ R g8 ]  [ Q f3 ] , [ R g4 ]  I thought this is best move at this situation
 [ Q x h4 ]  [ g x h4 ]  [ B x c3 + ]  [ R x c3 ]  [ R a2 + ] , [ K e1 ]  White needs his king guarding [ f1 ] so that B[ f1 ] will stop mate...........for now.
 [ d x e5 ] , [ N x g3 ]  only move to keep my pawn advantage
 [ e4 ]  [ g6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ c4 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ N c3 ]  The move e4-[ e5 ] is tempting but not very good
 [ R x c5 ] , [ R d c8 ]  The pin looks nasty (and [ R x c8 ] [ R x c8 ] would be a big mistake) but my advanced pawn and Bishop are strong. And black's king is a lot worse than mine.
 [ N c3 + ]  [ K e1 ]  [ d2 + ]  [ K f2 ]  [ d1 = Q + ] , [ K g3 ]  ......at first sight a chess player will capture the R but it's stale mate!!!! So...
 [ Q h6 + ]  [ K c2 ]  [ B f5 + ] , [ B d3 ]  By exchanging undeveloped pieces my disadvantage can be somewhat reduced: Black must avoid to get into a siuation where the perpetual is his best option. Of course [ K b3 ] allowed [ Q b6 + ] and must be avoided.
 [ K d2 ]  [ K d6 ]  [ R d e1 ] , [ R e7 ]  I am trying to bring my Knight into the center
 [ O-O ] , [ B e3 ]  Again White refrains from [ N [ f3 ] ] causing me to think awhile. Eventually I reasoned that if 6...[ e5 ] would have been my move with the N on [ f3 ] it must still be good with it on [ g1 ] ...
 [ K g2 ] , [ R h6 ]  The black rook would like to play along the whole width of the board harassing white pawns far and near but some of those files are blocked by black's other pieces and pawns so the rook leaves the bank rank and sets up camp on the 6th.
 [ B b3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ e5 ] , [ B h6 ]  This wins a pawn. The white pawn on [ f4 ] can be defended but it will remain pinned and unable to defend its fellow pawn on e5.
 [ R x e8 ]  [ R f2 x f7 ]  [ B x f7 ]  [ R x f7 ]  [ R a8 ] , [ R f1 ]  I would have preferred 40. [ B e3 ]  [ B f4 ] , [ h4 ]  Suicide. 41. [ h3 ] [ e5 ] was feasable...
 [ N e5 ]  [ h4 ]  [ h5 ]  [ B g5 ] , [ R c5 ]  My book knowledge runs out soon. St George decides that the time is right to attack
 [ B d5 ]  [ B a5 ] , [ c3 ]  First things first.
 [ B x f4 ] , [ N x f4 ]  What is really doing his knight in f4?
 [ K e4 ] , [ K c6 ]  The Black King cannot stray too far from the [ e8 ] square.
 [ R h8 + ] , [ K d7 ]  a tough decision: after [ R d8 ] [ R x d8 + ] Black has made no progress...
 [ c5 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ] , [ c3 ]  This is the Gambit. White gets a tempo open lines and space advantage for the price of pawn.
 [ B g5 ] , [ B x f3 ]  ! White must do gxf3.
 [ N h5 + ]  [ K h2 ]  [ N f4 ] , [ h4 ]  ?? why not going back with the king to g3?
 [ a x b5 ]  [ Q x b5 ]  [ Q x b5 ]  [ B x b5 ]  [ R e4 ]  [ R c e1 ]  [ d4 ]  [ R x e4 ] , [ B x e4 ]  Black has come up with a clever way to preserve a free pawn...
 [ N x e3 ]  [ f x g5 ]  [ N x d1 ]  [ g x f6 ]  [ N e3 ]  [ f x g7 + ]  [ K x g7 ]  [ R f7 + ]  [ K g8 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ N d5 ] , [ N g4 ]  
 [ Q x d8 ]  [ Q d1 ] , [ Q e7 ]  25. ....... [ Q e7 ] - Ion decides not to trade queens. If that had happened even though Ion had the bishop pair and a slight spatial edge my drawing chances would have been good sans les reines. Glenda's "control" of the d file is somewhat illusory only [ d2 ] is available to her.
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ] , [ c4 ]  Nothing special
 [ Q b3 + ]  [ K d6 ] , [ B f4 ]  Pinning the knight which is black's extra piece to the king and making the king keep guard. This was blacks best piece so it must be pinned. If the 13. [ g x f3 ] to get the piece back ...[ N x f3 ] is painful for white as white is vulnerable to forks... For instance... 14. [ K d1 ] [ K e5 + ] 15. Kc2?? [ N d4 + ] winning the queen.
 [ Q c8 + ]  [ K h7 ]  [ Q x a6 ] , [ Q g4 ]  Qg4! But he's a fox! He threatens Qd1#.
 [ B x c3 ]  [ B x c3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ e3 ]  [ b6 ]  [ B d3 ] , [ B a6 ]  I would have probably moved to b7.
 [ Q b6 ] , [ B e3 ]  Now if [ Q a6 ] [ R c7 + ] is strong. Then if [ K e8 ] ([ K d8 ] Bg5+) [ R x g7 ] with threats of both [ N x d6 + ] and Nc7+. If [ K g8 ] then [ B h6 ] is strong.
 [ h5 ] , [ c5 ]  pawn from both the players are attaking
 [ N x e5 ]  [ f x e5 ]  [ N e4 ] , [ B x e4 ]  I played this move fast. I didn't want to analyze the pros & cons of letting the Knight hand there on e4.
 [ R f1 ]  [ c3 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ c x b2 ] , [ R x b2 ]  ok now this opened the b-file and gives some activity to the white rook but i hardly see any counter-play but the c2-pawn is a big target right now
 [ Q e3 ] , [ Q f6 ]  Preparing a discovered check.
 [ a x b4 ] , [ a3 ]  ! Recapturing with the Bishop doesn't accomplish what Black needs to accomplish and actually should lose in short order: 27...Bxb4? 28.[ Q x [ e5 ] ] [ K f7 ] 29.Rdf1! Remember Black's playing a game of keeping everything together *just long enough*. The pawn on [ e5 ] is still important and the goal is to break into White's castle which 27...[ a3 ] does splendidly.
 [ R f e1 ] , [ e4 ]  19...e4. Why not just 19...[ f4 ] 20. [ B f2 ] [ Q e8 ] and 21...Qh5? Then ...[ R f5 ] seems to bring some serious threats against the W K-side.
 [ B e2 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ Q f4 ]  [ d6 ] , [ N g5 ]  He threatened mate and a fork on [ f7 ] but he didn't see that it was easily met.
 [ K f7 ] , [ Q e6 # ]  
 [ e4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B b4 ] , [ B d3 ]  4.e5... (Winawer variation) is the most common line as well as 4.Bd2...
 [ e4 ]  [ b6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ B b7 ] , [ Q f3 ]  He is definitely aggressive going after [ f7 ] quickly.
 [ B f3 ]  [ R f d8 ]  [ Q c3 ]  [ R d7 ] , [ R a8 ]  25. [ R a8 ] - maintaining control with a pin on my [ b8 ] knight.
 [ h x g5 ] , [ Q x g5 ]  the position of the black is so bad that with a piece down white is winning easily
 [ K e3 ]  [ K b4 ]  [ K d2 ]  [ K b3 ]  [ K c1 ]  [ c3 ]  [ K b1 ] , [ c2 + ]  Now the king can only move right or left.
 [ g5 ]  [ h x g5 ]  [ B x g5 ]  [ B x a4 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ Q x f6 ] , [ Q h5 ]  With queen in position I'm hoping to pull off a double check. However [ K e8 ] would prevent this.
 [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ N c3 ]  Three Knights Opening....
 [ K b5 ]  [ K d2 ]  [ c4 ]  [ B x h7 ]  [ c3 + ] , [ K c2 ]  And he lost on time.
 [ B e7 ] , [ N e1 ]  Preparing to play [ [ f4 ] ] and bring yet another piece into play my rook. In fact the Ne1-[ [ f4 ] ] combo is what I need to bring all of my pieces into play.
 [ B x b5 ]  [ Q x b5 ]  [ a3 ] , [ Q c6 ]  The king on [ g7 ] seems to be a lot safer my rooks are connected and I have the c file.
 [ Q c2 + ]  [ K h1 ]  [ a3 ] , [ f7 ]  Can white support this pawn? Has he another choice?
 [ R a e1 ]  [ h x g4 ]  [ B x g4 ]  [ B f8 ]  [ R e6 ]  [ Q x a4 ]  [ Q e3 ]  [ Q d7 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ a4 ]  [ N h3 ]  [ a3 ] , [ N g5 ]  Here I was determined that a passive defence would lead in lose. This move is risky and maybe look like a blunder but I think it is my only hope. Any other move looked too slow for my attack.
 [ c3 ]  [ O-O ] , [ b4 ]  First aggressive move forcing the Bishop to retreat to [ d6 ] or e7.
 [ K h1 ] , [ N x e1 ]  Well I guess I get the pawn anyway.
 [ Q g3 ]  [ N x c6 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ R c8 ]  [ R a c1 ] , [ B x e4 ]  I thought to double paralyze ([ N c6 ] and Be4) with 25.Re1...
 [ B a4 ]  [ R b8 + ]  [ K f7 ]  [ c6 ]  [ B x c2 ]  [ R b7 + ]  [ K f6 ]  [ R d7 ]  [ R e2 ] , [ N d5 + ]  !! this move wins the game.
 [ a x b7 + ]  [ K x b7 ] , [ B x c6 + ]  Other moves (e.g. [ Q h4 ] [ R b1 ] Qb3) may be too slow. Or may end up similar; not entirely sure! This at least keeps up the checks.
 [ g x f5 ]  [ N f6 + ] , [ K f7 ]  This position was set in motion by 3...Be6.
 [ a3 ]  [ N x c2 ]  [ Q x c2 ] , [ Q e7 ]  Black wants to increase his power on e file
 [ R g6 ]  [ R x f2 + ]  [ K e1 ]  [ R f6 ]  [ R h g1 ] , [ R x g6 ]  Too quick. Should have strengthened my position with ...[ R e8 ] or ...e5.
 [ N c3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ g3 ] , [ B b4 ]  The most successful Black move in this position according to the database not that I have much faith in the statistics therein. Too often I choose what looks like the most successful line only to discover that my opponent chooses a continuation that gives him a much higher winning percentage...
 [ c4 ] , [ e6 ]  he stops me from taking on the center (a comman move)
 [ R d8 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B e7 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ f4 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ f x e5 ] , [ B x e5 ]  now I'll need to keep putting pressure over black during middlegame as the consequent endgame might bet better for him because I have three pawn islands while he has only two
 [ K c3 ]  [ B d3 ] , [ B x d3 ]  [ B g2 ] [ e4 ] looks a bit safer: this will connect Blacks' passed center pawns...
 [ g x h5 ] , [ R c1 ]  Staying calm... The [ g1 ] check is wotrthless. To be able to say that I spent a lot of time analyzing variants such R[ g1 ] Kh7. 29. [ R g5 ] Kh6. It comes to a stall so I explored 30. [ f5 ] d6xe[ f5 ] 31. Rxf5. But... then? Looking for the a or b column with my rook is worthless since the black king escapes through white squares... unless my king or central pawns can stop it! It wouldn't have happened if I didn't exchange rooks so 27. RxR was a mistake!
 [ K e6 ]  [ B f5 + ]  [ K d6 ]  [ Q x g7 ]  [ f x g5 ] , [ b x c3 ]  Material advantage is still mine but the position is just horrible.
 [ K h2 ] , [ R f1 ]  One move left this looks good for a puzzle.
 [ e5 ] , [ B b5 ]  A not-so great move
 [ e x d5 ] , [ g5 ]  The only way to continue the attack.
 [ Q g7 + ]  [ K d6 ]  [ R x f8 ]  [ N e2 + ]  [ K h1 ]  [ Q b6 ]  [ R d1 ] , [ B d7 ]  the motivation for this move is unclear to me the threat of [ B e3 ] is match winning.
 [ N d5 ] , [ B d6 ]  This is a move I really suspect of being attributable to the database. Even though 8...[ B d6 ] is only in the database twice Black won both times. However I don't see how it can be good as it blocks the d-pawn.
 [ b4 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ b6 ]  [ B d3 ] , [ f5 ]  Black's plan of blocking the center like this is not terribly convincing. White could try to take advantage of this with the immediate 13.[ c x d5 ] after which 13...[ e x d5 ] leaves too many holes and 13...[ Q x d5 ] 14.[ B c4 ] should be advantageous for White.
 [ B g2 ] , [ O-O-O ]  7.[ B g2 ] O-O-O I fiancetto my light squared Bishop to build up pressure on the centre (Xray on [ e4 ] [ d5 ] c6). Black castles long.
 [ d6 ] , [ f4 ]  I have achieved my goal.
 [ c3 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ g3 ] , [ K f8 ]  ? It is generally a bad idea to move the king at this time except to castle. Now the rooks are confined to the edges of the board. It will take many moves to align them on center files.
 [ d x e5 ]  [ f x e5 ]  [ f3 ] , [ d4 ]  I thought that [ f3 ] was a weak move and I can afford another pawn move. Wanted to make his [ N c3 ] uncomfortable advance the pawns and/or open up his e-line before he attempts to castle.
 [ f x g3 ]  [ e ]  [ p ]  [ f x g3 ]  [ a4 ] , [ N c1 ]  20.[ N a5 ] [ b6 ] 21.[ N c4 ] (or 21.[ N c6 ] Qd7) ...[ b5 ] 22.[ N a5 ] [ c5 ] looks a little dangerous (though I think it's probably better) so White chooses the safe route with this secure but awkward retreat.
 [ K g7 ] , [ R a e1 ]  This Rook should have been developed fifteen moves ago.
 [ R x h6 ]  [ K c7 ]  [ R x f6 ]  [ R e6 ]  [ R x e6 ]  [ a5 ]  [ R x e5 ]  [ b5 ]  [ R x b5 ]  [ K d6 ] , [ R x a5 ]  so Black won...
 [ B g7 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ Q d6 ]  [ d3 ] , [ R h f8 ]  White continues his development while Black struggles to put an attack together before White can consolidate. At this move I foresaw what I thought was a strong combination to blast open the WK.
 [ R x e2 ]  [ R x e2 ]  [ K f6 ]  [ K g2 ]  [ h5 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ B b4 ] , [ h3 ]  
 [ R g7 ] , [ g1 = Q ]  51. ... g1=Q! This is the end for white!
 [ R d1 ] , [ R a d8 ]  white is happy to take the rook
 [ N c1 ]  [ a5 ]  [ b x a5 ] , [ b x a5 ]  28. ...... [ b x a5 ] - nothing better than to have allowed the pawn trade.
 [ B d2 ]  [ Q h4 + ] , [ R f2 ]  ...but anyway this queen is not such a big problem
 [ N c3 ] , [ Q c7 ]  hmmm...[ N a4 ] -> [ N c5 ] is too strong so waiting again
 [ N b d2 ]  [ h6 ] , [ N c4 ]  Here White to decide whether to try to prevent Black's plan. It could have been done by [ B a4 ] (14. Ba4!?and if Black insists 14... [ N h7 ] then comes an important move 15.[ c3 ] bx[ c3 ] 16. bx[ c3 ] White's pieces are harmoniously placed. The next move will be [ [ d4 ] ] capturing the centre. If 16...[ f5 ] 17.ex[ f5 ] Rx[ f5 ] 18.[ [ d4 ] ] ex[ [ d4 ] ] 19.[ B x c6 ] [ d x e3 ] 20.Bxa8)
 [ K h8 ] , [ R x d6 ]  but I didn't resign as I worked out that I had some useful counter-attacking options that just might level the game up.
 [ B b4 + ] , [ N c3 ]  If 7. [ B d2 ] [ N x d4 ] and white is in serious trouble
 [ N x c4 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ g3 ] , [ e5 ]  contesting the centre...
 [ d5 ]  [ b3 ]  [ e5 ]  [ B b2 ]  [ f6 ]  [ e3 ]  [ c5 ] , [ N c3 ]  I don't comment white's opening it's made by weak moves.
 [ B f6 ] , [ R f e1 ]  Capturing on [ b2 ] was not really a threat as white wins back the pawn and gets to put a rook on the seventh rank after 24...Bx[ b2 ] 25.Rab1. Note also that 25.g5? was impossible due to 25...Bxg5.
 [ B f6 + ] , [ K h6 ]  22...KxB would be followed by 23. [ N e7 ] which loses my queen.
 [ g x h5 ]  [ N x h5 ] , [ K f3 ]  I had less than two minutes here but it was enough to win the game especially since I had almost caught up on time
 [ Q x d5 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ N d4 ] , [ d6 ]  Going for promotion
 [ B f3 ] , [ K b6 ]  Moving to avoid the discovered check. Maybe not necessary yet as the [ e4 ] knight can't move anywhere too frightening but I'm going to have to move the king anyway in order to escape via [ c7 ] or a7.
 [ Q b7 ] , [ B x d6 ]  This was an error on my part. I was hoping to get the pawn advantage. Unfortunately 20. ...[ N x e4 ] 21. [ B x e7 ] [ Q x e7 ] gives the opponent a slight lead. Should have done [ N c3 ] to bring it back to action.
 [ B e5 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ B d4 ]  [ R b a3 ] , [ K e7 ]  I thought this was a blunder during the game but I was proven wrong.
 [ R x h4 ] , [ g x h4 ]  Black should avoid swapping down. The simpler the position gets the more telling is my material advantage.
 [ K g7 ]  [ K a8 ]  [ R f8 + ]  [ b8 = Q ]  [ R x b8 + ]  [ K x b8 ]  [ g5 ]  [ R g3 ]  [ K g6 ]  [ a5 ]  [ g4 ]  [ a6 ]  [ K g5 ]  [ a7 ]  [ K f4 ]  [ R x g4 + ]  [ K x g4 ] , [ a8 = Q ]  
 [ R b8 ] , [ N x e5 ]  recovering 1 paw...
 [ h x g5 ]  [ Q x h8 ]  [ R x h8 + ]  [ K g2 ] , [ Q c6 ]  At this point I believe that White has some strong opportunities if he attacks along the h file and seeks to bring a rook to Black back rank so I push my attack and better my pawns.
 [ B d3 ] , [ N c6 ]  5. ..... [ N c6 ] - at last he develops a knight!
 [ R x f5 ] , [ Q e6 ]  Otherwise Qe1+. only apparent sac since I recover the piece soon.
 [ B f3 ] , [ Q b3 ]  [ Q d7 ] might prevent white from counter threatening the queen evading the pin.
 [ K b8 ]  [ d4 ]  [ N b6 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ N a4 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ N x c3 ]  [ R d3 ]  [ N x a2 + ]  [ K b2 ]  [ N b4 ]  [ B x b4 ]  [ R d e8 ]  [ B a5 ]  [ R e2 ]  [ R b3 + ]  [ K a8 ]  [ B x e2 ]  [ R b8 ]  [ B x c7 ]  [ R b7 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ h6 ]  [ B f3 ]  [ g5 ] , [ B x c6 ]  can't take my rook because it will be check
 [ h6 ]  [ B x f6 ] , [ Q x f6 ]  Queen @ F6 . Opponents play that alot.. I don't like.
 [ c5 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ Q x d4 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ Q a5 ] , [ B x f6 ]  I did this to disturb his pawn structure and discourage kingside castling.
 [ c5 ] , [ a4 ]  oh it's a tactic.......(?)
 [ Q x d5 + ]  [ B x d5 ]  [ R e3 ]  [ R f c8 ]  [ K h2 ]  [ B x b3 ]  [ c x b3 ] , [ c2 ]  here white resigns because he can't prevent Black's pawn promotion.
 [ c5 ] , [ d3 ]  This move took me off guard. But it's a small way of learning how intense openings can be. I'm used to seeing 2.[ N f3 ] or even 2.[ d4 ] played in the Sicilian Defense.
 [ B e6 ]  [ a3 ] , [ N d4 ]  This will leave him an isolated (but passed) pawn.
 [ d6 ]  [ K c6 ]  [ N g4 ]  [ R d7 ]  [ N e3 ] , [ R c5 ]  But here [ d6 ] is still going to fall and then [ c3 ] is doomed as well so I decided I had seen enough and resigned this game. I had had my chances but overall Black was better in this game assessed his position better and deserved to win it. A disappointing start of the second half of this tournament... Still 3 games to go. Will I get over this?
 [ f3 ] , [ B g6 ]  I move pawn to [ f3 ] and black LB retreats to g6.
 [ N c3 ] , [ N f6 ]  Hum !!! I spoke to soon..........no pressure here.
 [ R d6 ] , [ f4 ]  ? a very poor move to make I wanted black to take it so maybe [ f3 ] would have been more accurate.
 [ B x f4 ]  [ N x c5 ]  [ N x c7 ]  [ R a c8 ]  [ d6 ]  [ e x d6 ]  [ e x d6 ] , [ B x b2 ]  that the free pawn that Fischer saw that he can capture with out trouble brilliant . now Fischer with pawn a head and good position has chances to win this game however serial good moves by Botvinik and not so presies moves by Fischer helped Botvinik to force draw on the American World champion .
 [ R h3 ]  [ g x h5 ] , [ R x h5 ]  It was only then at an overall 5 POINTS AHEAD that I realised how much trouble I really was in. I couldn't flee with the king: 25.[ B x h7 + ] stopped me in my tracks. Staying where I was I had 25.[ N g6 + ] to deal with. Advancing the pawn? Also 25.[ N g6 + ] or maybe 25.Rxh6+. But the move I played was doubtless the worst of my options...
 [ B d3 ]  [ a5 ]  [ f4 ]  [ a4 ] , [ f5 ]  White even has chances to win now.
 [ N x h4 ]  [ N a5 ]  [ N d2 ]  [ N e3 ] , [ R e1 ]  Here came the blunder. If you are under 1400 think about my next move.
 [ B g5 ]  [ h6 ]  [ B e3 ] , [ d4 ]  I fork two pieces. I was expecting 12 NxP PxN 13 BxQP but White surprised me with a sacrifce to open my King's position up.
 [ N f3 ] , [ N x e4 ]  A pawn for rapid development.
 [ d5 ]  [ f x e5 ] , [ N x e4 ]  restore equality in a sharp start... white needs to start forming a plan to win now!
 [ e x f4 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ g5 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ g4 ] , [ O-O ]  A Muzio Gambit a very risky line [against an opponent of equal strength] with the piece sacrifice.
 [ B x c7 ]  [ Q e7 ]  [ h3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B h2 ]  [ e5 ]  [ O-O-O ]  [ g4 ]  [ h x g4 ] , [ f5 ]  I think P[ x g4 ] would have been better. This would pin white's black bishop against the rook.
 [ R x c2 ]  [ R x e4 ]  [ R c7 ] , [ R e5 ]  The central pawns hadn't ever been my threat here. I think he'd have been better playing 46...[ R a4 ] or 46...[ K f8 ]  [ B x b7 ]  [ R x b7 ]  [ R x d5 ]  [ a6 ]  [ K g7 ]  [ a7 ]  [ R a5 ] , [ K f4 ]  Thanks to luck I don't deserve I still have just enough time to get over there and finish it.
 [ Q f6 ]  [ e5 ]  [ Q g6 ]  [ Q x g6 ] , [ f x g6 ]  8. ... fxg6?! My opponent feeling good on 3 pawn island as result of immediate attack on f-file but I don't see an advantage either.
 [ a4 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ f x e5 ] , [ R x f1 + ]  oh oh so much exchanges means black has something in mind.
 [ N c5 ] , [ a4 ]  adding further support to my b pawn as I may want to move my knight or my bishop [ e5 ] will follow
 [ b x c6 ] , [ e3 ]  Finally.
 [ N f3 ] , [ Q b6 ]  Adding pressure to d4.
 [ R a6 ] , [ a3 ]  almost played [ N b3 ] (probably a better choice ...possibly wins bishop with Nc5). this [ a3 ] is part of white's overcommitment to the poor plan of [ c4 ] (and it's failure to take in to account the problems of putting the knight on c4).
 [ B g5 ]  [ h6 ]  [ B h4 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N d5 ]  [ g5 ] , [ N x g5 ]  A knight sacrafice in hopes of taking black by surprise and opening up the kingside for attack.
 [ B b7 ] , [ b4 ]  A mistake in my opinion. The forcing sequence isn't that difficult to spot but there's quite a bit to calculate. Black can win a pawn with 9. [ N x [ b4 ] ] 10. [ a x [ b4 ] ] [ Q x c3 + ] which is fairly obvious and there's little that White can do about it. That being said it isn't as simple as it appears since after 9. [ N x [ b4 ] ] White has the fascinating response of Nxb5! doing the exact same thing. It took me a long time to calculate whether or not [ N x b5 ] works but found that after 9. [ b4 ] [ N x [ b4 ] ] 10. [ N x b5 ] [ a x b5 ] 11. [ N x b5 ] you have the cheeky Nxc2+. Taking it with the queen means that 12. [ Q x c2 ] [ Q x c2 ] follows with a very easy game for Black. Therefore the only option for White is to move the king. If 12. [ K f1 ] then you meet that with 12. [ N x e3 + ] 13. [ f x e3 ] and without the dark squares bishop you can play [ Q b6 ] escaping the [ N b5 ] threat. If the king goes to [ d2 ] then you have 12. Qa5+. 13. [ K x c2 ] [ R c2 + ] and with the pawn on [ e4 ] also falling in the future with Bx[ e4 ] it seems grim. Checkmate seems inevitable. It seems rather easy when you have an analysis board next to you but calculating everything OTB was surprisingly difficult. After running everything through my head a few more times I decided to go on with my plan although I felt like something wasn't entirely right.
 [ K f7 ]  [ K h6 ]  [ K f6 ] , [ K h7 ]  If [ K h5 ] then White tightens the barrier with a [ N c3 ] [ N e4 ] maneuver
 [ R x d1 + ]  [ K c2 ] , [ B h8 ]  ({13:+3.14} 35. ... [ B h8 ] 36. [ B x e6 + ] [ K x e6 ] 37. [ K x d1 ] [ N c7 ] 38. [ f4 ] [ R d8 + ] 39. [ K c1 ] [ N c d5 ] 40. [ b5 ] [ K d7 ] 41. [ Q [ f5 ] + ] [ K c7 ] 42. [ Q e5 + ] [ K c8 ] 43. [ f5 ] [ b6 ] +-) ({13:+0.06} 35. ... [ B x c4 ] 36. [ Q x g7 + ] [ K e6 ] 37. [ K x d1 ] [ R g8 ] 38. [ Q x g8 + ] [ N x g8 ] 39. [ R x g8 ] [ B d5 ] 40. [ R a8 ] [ K e5 ] 41. [ K e2 ] K[ f4 ] 42. [ R x a7 ] [ B x f3 + ] 43. [ K d3 ] =)
 [ d5 ] , [ e3 ]  Setting up for a Stonewall attack.
 [ Q g5 ] , [ f4 ]  his queen moving to [ g5 ] I don't really understand but I push my pawn hoping to free up space for my rook
 [ Q c2 ]  [ f4 ]  [ R b d1 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ B e4 ] , [ B g4 ]  18. ............ [ B g4 ] - hitting out at the [ e2 ] pawn so Fou Leblanc defends.
 [ N x e5 ] , [ Q x d4 ]  The black knight does not need to move as [ B d6 ] is ok.
 [ O-O ] , [ B e3 ]  White's setup seems a little passive so I decide to let him sacrifice on [ e6 ] as I will have the two bishops in an open position and an open f-file for the 1 pawn equivalent material investment.
 [ K h1 ] , [ R a c8 ]  If white moves his bishop (to sacrifice a pawn for example) the [ g8 ] rook could be left defenseless.
 [ d x e4 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ R e1 ] , [ Q b6 ]  A simple threat to play [ B x f2 + ] but it's still effective and has to be dealt with. Fortunate [ Q e2 ] is a common move here anyway.
 [ g5 ]  [ h x g5 ] , [ Q x g5 ]  I take with queen cause that way I treaten to take on [ a4 ] (you see the pin on the 5 file? ). Also that way I join more pieces in my kingside attack. Not to mention that it was doing nothing on [ d2 ] cause my [ e2 ] knight is enough to defend the [ c3 ] pawn.
 [ N c6 ]  [ f4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ d5 ]  Here I could exchange on [ d5 ] first and then play [ B b5 ] having [ e4 ] square for my Knight after [ d4 ] but i wanted center to be closed and didnt see any problem about Ne2. Thus I played the next move 5-[ B b5 ]  [ B b5 ] , [ d4 ]  i would love it if my opponent exchanged on [ e4 ] but as i said earlier i expected this and it was ok.
 [ B c4 ] , [ B h4 + ]  Checking the king
 [ f4 ]  [ d x c6 ] , [ K c8 ]  Not too smart at this point; the king gets checked again on the next move. Might have been better to move the king to [ d8 ] but at this point checkmate is inevitable.
 [ N c3 ] , [ N a6 ]  10. ...... [ N a6 ] - development and heading for b4.
 [ K g7 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ f5 ] , [ f4 ]  ? [ e x f5 ] wins another pawn!
 [ R g7 ]  [ B x g7 + ]  [ K x g7 ] , [ B d3 + ]  [ B x [ h5 ] ] would have been a bad move because after ...[ K h6 ] the white bishop becomes a burden for the white offensive. Furthermore the black pawn on [ h5 ] will be the guillotine for te black king.
 [ Q a1 ]  [ R e e3 ] , [ h4 ]  threatening a triumph march of the h pawn... so I expect [ f4 ]  [ R h3 ] , [ Q x f4 ]  and now we have balanced material but two pieces are easier to coordinate (one being the queen) than three...
 [ e x d5 ]  [ B x d5 + ]  [ K f2 ]  [ B x h1 ]  [ R x h1 ]  [ N g5 ] , [ B x g5 ]  Not too sure why this move was made I wouldn't have been in such a hurry as white to do that.
 [ c4 ] , [ N f6 ]  This 2 moves are very common(the first moves when you look in the chess database)
 [ N x g2 ] , [ K x g2 ]  Taking the knight while defending h3.
 [ K e6 ] , [ R f e1 + ]  but there is no escape
 [ B x a1 ] , [ f4 ]  Offering another trade which I will gladly accept especially as it comes with check.
 [ e5 ] , [ B c4 + ]  at this point Black was using up his last minute of playing time; I was losing but had minutes to spare: so I stirred up some additional complications; driving the King away from [ R f8 ] thus pinning Nf6...
 [ Q b3 ]  [ Q f2 ] , [ Q x b7 ]  There is no better option [15 R-[ Q1 ] is answered by either 15... B-[ Q7 ] or 15... BxR].
 [ B a1 ] , [ R a d8 ]  21.Rfd1~! is Much better now preventing [ B [ d4 ] ] and forcing R removal or trade with same position produced minus my having an inactive Rook at f1. But that's blitz I'm down to 28 seconds. Now after I err with 21.[ R [ h3 ] ] he must play a piece to [ d4 ] and then recapture if I play Bx[ d4 ] to stave off a mate awhile. Maybe long enough with my time situation. He's a good player but misses he must sac to live longer!? Maybe but I think instead he put the burdon on me to see it or whether I just "developed" the Rook to [ h3 ] unaware of the Sac such as to protect my [ N g5 ] from capture. And it does not cost him a piece to find out .... The answer is expensive but quick to BL but was a quite legitimate try imo.
 [ Q b6 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ B x e5 ]  [ Q x e5 ] , [ R a d8 ]  The pressure in center was a constant from now my pawns are in a difficult situation but the Black rooks are a little beat passives behind the pawns
 [ g x f6 + ]  [ N x f6 ]  [ h x g6 ]  [ N x g6 ]  [ N x g6 ] , [ B x g6 ]  And his bishop is pinned I wonder if I can make use of that.
 [ N c6 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ h5 ]  [ b4 ]  [ g5 ] , [ a3 ]  34. [ a3 ] - to add additional support to my b pawn should Fou Lenoir have to move from his lofty dias!
 [ K g1 ] , [ R f8 ]  I wanted to double my rooks and take [ f2 ] when he run away but he thought for long time and his time is almost finished less than 1 sec.
 [ Q e4 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ N d2 ]  [ Q d7 ]  [ K c2 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ Q x f5 ] , [ Q x f5 + ]  Not sure why White forgot about my queen protecting the bishop
 [ Q x g2 ]  [ h x g2 + ]  [ K h2 ]  [ g x f1 = Q ] , [ R x f1 ]  black has recuperate the disadvantage and is now on a winning position
 [ Q x h4 ]  [ Q e2 + ]  [ N e7 ]  [ Q b5 + ]  [ B d7 ]  [ Q e2 ]  [ O-O-O ]  [ Q e4 ]  [ f5 ]  [ Q f3 ]  [ Q f6 ]  [ d3 ]  [ Q d4 ]  [ Q x f4 ]  [ Q c5 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ Q a5 ]  [ B x b6 ]  [ Q x b6 + ]  [ Q b4 ]  [ Q x b4 + ] , [ K x b4 ]  With Queens off the board White's king is ... unstoppable! LOL!
 [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ B x d5 ]  [ Q f2 ] , [ R a e8 ]  23. …… [ R a e8 ] - 'bout time I brought my big guns into action!
 [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ a6 ]  Keeping the white pieces off of [ b5 ] always a good idea in the Sicilian and in many other defenses as well.
 [ B d7 ] , [ f4 ]  ...And WHAM if he moves his knight then [ N g5 + ] wins his queen.
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ] , [ B f4 ]  The London
 [ d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ d x e5 ] , [ Q e2 ]  7. [ Q [ e2 ] ] - the Wicked Witch of the West comes to [ e2 ] - although she blocks in the white lsb she causes major problems in pinning my e pawn. I look at the db options and I realise that if I choose [ B e6 ] which seems the best of the bunch I see a very nasty queen fork on [ b5 ] where the [ b7 ] pawn will fall leaving a gaping hole in my queenside pawns. No thank you! So I rack my brains and come up with [ c6 ] - another pawn move. Now Ken picks off the gambited pawns.
 [ Q c4 ] , [ R f d1 ]  ! Should I go to [ [ d1 ] ] or e1? It was a choice that I made on intuitive grounds. After 32. [ R e1 ] I was uneasy about the pin on the e-pawn. It turned out that I was right: 32. Re1? Nxd7! 33. ed [ R x e1 + ] 34. [ N x e1 ] Qxh4! (a move I didn’t see!) miraculously stops the pawn from queening and threatens mate. I’m glad that I trusted my gut and put the rook on [ [ d1 ] ] instead.
 [ K f7 ]  [ R c3 ]  [ K e7 ] , [ R e3 ]  I was hoping white would make this move and pin my rook. I will end up forking white's rook and king.
 [ d5 ] , [ b5 ]  aaaah. benko gambit. very interesting choice indeed. fun for both sides normally.
 [ K f7 ] , [ h4 ]  Offering a draw but I've got one more plan.
 [ N f g4 ]  [ Q a1 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ R f1 ]  [ N x d3 ]  [ Q d1 ]  [ Q x d1 ]  [ R x d1 ] , [ N d x f2 ]  This endgame liquidation is slightly better for White but very close to equality
 [ N e5 ] , [ K f2 ]  It would have been more interesting if white had played fxe.
 [ Q a4 ] , [ h4 ]  White is prepared to abandon his Q-side in the interests of attack. Here comes his infantry assault column.
 [ g3 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ B g2 ] , [ N x c3 ]  As I thought black are going to exchange every single piece
 [ B x c4 ]  [ c5 ] , [ d5 ]  !? Correct: white tries to open the white diagonal. But what would she do after [ e5 ] by black followed by e4?
 [ K e2 ] , [ B b4 ]  The B wasn't completely tied and now threatens to support the pawn's further advance. White can't take on [ a2 ] because of the fork on c3.
 [ R a7 ]  [ Q f6 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ Q f3 + ]  [ d5 ]  [ N f7 ]  [ Q b2 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N b6 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ N b3 ]  [ a5 ]  [ Q e3 ] , [ R g4 ]  This is a mistake but in fairness to black there's not much he can do.
 [ B g2 ] , [ N f2 + ]  Forces checkmate.
 [ e x f3 ]  [ e ]  [ p ]  [ N d1 ]  [ h5 ] , [ b4 ]  [ N f2 ] brings a defender closer and blocks the [ f3 ] pawn. White saw [ N x b2 ] and was trying to remove the pawn to safety. [ N f2 ] does keep the pawn safe as there is no longer a RxN at [ d1 ] possibility after the exchange on b2.
 [ e3 ]  [ B b4 + ] , [ B d2 ]  I defended with the bishop rather than blocking with the pawn because I thought that in the case he was to exchange it would only help me develop but in the case he withdrew he would be forced to move back to either the edge of the board (a5) or possibly [ d6 ] losing a tempo.
 [ N f3 ]  [ d x c4 ]  [ e3 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ B x c4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ h3 ]  [ B x f3 ] , [ Q x f3 ]  Light-pieces exchange.
 [ B c5 ] , [ Q g3 ]  ..and again guarding the [ f2 ] square and lining an assault on the far right-hand corner.
 [ N d5 ]  [ B x e7 ] , [ K x e7 ]  [ N x e7 ] is prohibited...
 [ Q e8 ] , [ R d8 ]  A lovely position isn't it? Black DOESN'T threats [ R x d7 ] because after [ R x d7 ] [ R x c2 ] Kd1! ([ K b2 ] Rc1#) and it can shield behind [ f2 ] and black will lose the Q. He cant' take my Q either. But what can I do??
 [ N f6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ b5 ]  [ B a2 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ Q b3 ]  [ O-O ] , [ R f d1 ]  The wrong Rook! I have read so many commentaries by Danish GM Bent Larsen on this theme... In this case it is not the Rook but the plan which is the problem. White wants to answer 15. [ Q c7 ] with 16. [ R a c1 ] so the Black Queen only has the active goal at [ b6 ] for the moment. The plan then is to chase the Black Queen with [ e4 ] and [ B e3 ] but the lack of support of the Pawn on [ f2 ] becomes critical.
 [ B h3 + ]  [ K g1 ] , [ N g6 ]  The white rook is blocked from being introduced into the game while at this point the rook is threatening a mate.
 [ N f2 + ]  [ K g2 ] , [ Q h2 # ]  A good finish black didn't prolong the suffering prefering a quick decapitation. Always the best way as messing around to win material can lead to a downfall. Feel free to message me with any comments / improvements to make to the annotation.
 [ B e3 ]  [ B f5 ] , [ a3 ]  Preventing Nb4.
 [ N a5 ]  [ R e1 ] , [ R f4 ]  ! White must now defend Black's Rook attack on the f file very precisely.
 [ R a d8 ]  [ R f d1 ] , [ g6 ]  Now I can not only win a Pawn but threaten to trade off a pair of Rooks in doing so.
 [ h6 ] , [ N f6 + ]  Game note "21.Nf6+! Fork Q K so ...[ g x f6 ] is forced and I grab the low hanging [ h6 ] pawn. Naked K!!"
 [ e5 ]  [ d5 ] , [ N d4 ]  White can't capture the knight because [ e x d4 ] [ a3 ] [ d x c3 ] [ a x b4 ] [ c x b2 ] is strong for black.
 [ R e1 + ]  [ B e7 ]  [ Q x f6 ] , [ R h7 ]  ?? Better was 20...[ R f8 ]  [ Q g6 + ]  [ R f7 ]  [ d6 ]  [ Q x d6 ]  [ Q x f7 + ]  [ K d7 ] , [ N c3 ]  The cavalry belatedly arrives making White's attack irresistible. The threat is N(x)[ b5 ] and the arrival of the Q Rook
 [ N e2 ] , [ N g6 ]  I'm thinking black wants to start a riot on the kingside.
 [ R c1 + ]  [ K d6 ]  [ a3 ]  [ B a5 ] , [ d4 ]  It is not necessary to help my opponent to have the pieces in its natural square (b6).
 [ f4 ]  [ e4 ]  [ R h3 ]  [ a4 ] , [ R x h2 ]  Now white can't allow [ R x f2 + ]  [ K e2 ]  [ R h3 ]  [ a5 ]  [ R b3 ] , [ R c2 ]  White should keep advancing the pawn.
 [ N f6 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ f4 ]  [ d6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ B g4 ] , [ N c3 ]  A blunder by white trying to attack when not everything is defended.
 [ Q x g2 ] , [ R f1 ]  Checkmate or loss of queen in 2 moves
 [ R f d8 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ f x g6 ] , [ f x g6 ]  14. ............. [ f x g6 ] - at last the pawn formation around the black king is disturbed.
 [ R f2 ]  [ c5 ]  [ d x c5 ] , [ N x c5 ]  At this stage with every move Black's position seems to improve.
 [ c6 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ B g4 ]  now we can see that [ b6 ] was not in place. instead black could already play [ N b d7 ] or e6.
 [ O-O ] , [ h6 ]  More pawn moves.
 [ e6 ] , [ e3 ]  White strives to set up a pawn formation at [ c3 ] [ d4 ] [ e3 ] and f4. He is glad that Black has chosen to close off the [ c8 ] Bishop from the c8-[ h3 ] diagonal.
 [ d5 ]  [ c3 ] , [ N c6 ]  This is a clear loss of a tempo for black whilst white supports his centre pawns
 [ B f3 ] , [ N x c5 ]  I guess that was the logic behind this exchange which seriously reduced my chances of winning. I forgot that I needed the Knight myself to protect the pawns as they advanced. But the long and complex computer analysis 44. [ N d6 ] [ B d5 ] 45. [ K f2 ] [ N b4 ] 46. [ K g3 ] [ N d3 ] 47. [ a6 ] [ N x b2 ] 48. [ N c8 ] [ B a8 ] 49. [ N e7 + ] [ K f7 ] 50. [ B x c5 ] [ N d3 ] 51. [ B d6 ] [ N e5 ] 52. [ N c8 ] [ N c4 ] 53. [ K f4 ] [ K e6 ] 54. [ B c5 ] [ B h1 ] 55. [ a7 ] [ B b7 ] 56. [ N e7 ] [ N e5 ] 57. [ g6 ] [ N d3 + ] 58. [ K g4 ] [ N x c5 ] and the g-pawn Queens was way beyond me. I was just thinking - Black has no pawns; he can't win. I forgot another chess axiom something about opposite squared Bishops?
 [ h x g3 ] , [ a3 ]  I know I won't actually queen this Pawn successfully but I hope to use it to win more material.
 [ d4 ] , [ c x d4 ]  Just as it's suposed to be played.
 [ Q c2 ]  [ b5 ]  [ a x b6 ]  [ e ]  [ p ]  [ N d x b6 ]  [ N x b6 ] , [ N x b6 ]  So I was thinking this isn't too bad for me. She has an isolated a pawn and her bishop is bad while mine was good.
 [ e6 ]  [ N b5 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N d6 ] , [ R b8 ]  The knight finds a nice home
 [ B x b2 ]  [ b x c5 ]  [ B x a1 ] , [ Q x a1 ]  Clearly advantage for Black. Note that lonely Bishop has not move never since he get there
 [ N x f5 ]  [ Q d3 ] , [ N h4 ]  The only way to stir up some dust and some forced moves...
 [ h6 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ f3 ]  [ b5 ]  [ N x c6 ] , [ B x c6 ]  11. ........ [ B x c6 ] - this bishop's control over the a8-[ h1 ] diagonal will prove decisive in my opponent's favour later on. Black is mounting a pawn storm already and I think the knight exchange was to try and take some of the sting out of black's attack.
 [ R h8 ]  [ R h f1 ]  [ B x d3 ] , [ Q x d3 ]  19. [ Q x d3 ] - the exchange of lsbs was to try and relieve some of the pressure around Henry. I thought I had things well in control here particularly as I have a rook controlling the h column. I just wish I could swap Glenda and my [ b8 ] rook around though then I could have got an attack going down the h column onto white's doubletons on the g column. Alas I only realised two moves later that it is the F COLUMN that is under the hammer and white exploits this very well.
 [ B e1 ] , [ Q h6 ]  Wonderful square isn't it? ;-/
 [ N x d4 ] , [ Q x d4 ]  Now I'm defending a pawn with the Queen! I even realized how absurd this was as I was playing the game. I don't want to hand the pawn over but I needed to do something quickly to find another defender even if it was simply a rook sitting on that file.
 [ B x f3 ] , [ B b7 ]  Defending [ c6 ] but my bishop is cramped.
 [ N x c7 ]  [ R c8 ]  [ Q d5 + ] , [ K f6 ]  ??? a mate was missed here... 16... [ K f8 ] was losing the queen. 16... [ K e7 ] 17. [ R a e1 ] [ K d7 ] (17... [ K d8 ] 18. [ N e6 ] ) 18. [ N b5 ] is still lost but can play on...
 [ b4 ]  [ c4 ]  [ Q d7 ]  [ g4 ] , [ N h7 ]  When one has an advantage in space one should try and deny the opponent threats. Retreating pieces to prevent the opponent from freeing his game is acceptable per Znosko-Borovsky.
 [ B g2 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ] , [ R e1 ]  Finally prepearing to move E-D pawn!
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B b5 ] , [ a6 ]  3. ........... [ a6 ] - the most popular way of meeting the Ruy Lopez.
 [ g4 ] , [ B g6 ]  [ B x b1 ] might be an option: but [ N b1 ] has no moves anyway...
 [ N d8 ]  [ N g5 ]  [ N f2 ]  [ b5 ]  [ N x c6 ] , [ h5 ]  40. [ h5 ] - I run with the h pawn but to no avail.
 [ B x d7 ]  [ Q x d7 ]  [ N f4 ] , [ K e8 ]  This gives up the pawn without a fight. Since Black ends up sacrificing the exchange with [ R h6 ] the next move anyway if he was going to do this this move would probably have been a much better time to do so because it is not so easy to win an exchange that way seeing that White's knight cannot safely advance any further.
 [ Q d2 ] , [ B x g3 ]  24. ...... [ B x g3 ] - firstly I make that trade that I envisaged a few moves back. I now have those opposite colour bishops and white's extra pawn is doubled.
 [ e x f6 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ Q x f6 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ N g e7 ] , [ Q d3 ]  On the one hand I want to play [ B [ a6 ] ] in the near future. Then if ...[ B x [ a6 ] ] [ Q x [ a6 ] ] [ K b8 ] [ N b5 ] and Black's king is in a spot of bother. But then if Black did not play ...[ B x [ a6 ] ] my attack would not succeed and I would lose the under-defended pawn on [ d4 ] into the bargain. So I moved my queen to [ d3 ] where it can back up the bishop move to [ a6 ] and defend the pawn on d5.
 [ b5 ]  [ N e2 ] , [ R c8 ]  Black hits a hanging pawn regaining the initiative.
 [ f5 ]  [ R b1 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ e5 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ f x e5 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ Q d5 + ] , [ K h8 ]  Now that White has thrust his Queen into the thick of things some care must be taken not to allow Black to clamber back into the game by attacking her with developing tempi.
 [ N a6 ]  [ a3 ]  [ K g7 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ N b8 ]  [ K g2 ]  [ R d8 d3 ] , [ a4 ]  That juicy [ e3 ] pawn cannot be taken as long as he has a rook on the 2nd rank.
 [ d5 ]  [ c4 ] , [ e6 ]  Queens gambit declined one of my favorites. It has the rep of being a quiet game but it does have some very flashy variations.
 [ N f3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ a3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ g6 ]  Oho we've tangoed ourselves right into a King's Indian Defense more or less.
 [ Q x c3 + ]  [ Q d2 ] , [ Q x a1 + ]  unfortunately he didnt see the consecutive bishop rook attack....
 [ B x c3 + ]  [ b x c3 ] , [ R h g8 ]  He develops his rook attacking my g-pawn.
 [ R c3 ]  [ b5 ] , [ R c5 + ]  ?? A horrible move! what's my response?
 [ Q c6 ]  [ Q e6 ] , [ Q b7 ]  Vacating [ c6 ] for the Knight.
 [ N e c6 ]  [ c3 ]  [ N x e2 ] , [ Q x e2 ]  Now there is no reason to delay the attack.
 [ K f2 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ B d2 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ c4 ] , [ N x d4 ]  mistake and if he had played [ N x d4 ] I probably would have lost.
 [ O-O-O ]  [ N c4 ]  [ B x c4 ]  [ R x c4 ]  [ h4 ] , [ b5 ]  Alternative variation: 14... [ Q a5 ] 15. [ h5 ] $16
 [ d3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ e5 ]  here i have a nice central grip and also managed to kick the bishop w tempo.
 [ g6 ] , [ B e3 ]  Black seems to be playing toward the Dragon but 5. ... [ [ g6 ] ] may be a bit early. My opening library recommends 5. ... [ d6 ] 5. ... [ e6 ] or 5. ... [ e5 ] at this juncture. However I don't really see anything wrong with 5. ... [ [ g6 ] ] so I continue with development reinforcing my knight on [ d4 ] against the inevitable pressure from black's fianchetto on g7.
 [ R e8 + ]  [ B e2 ] , [ N h5 ]  With the dual threat of [ N f4 ] and Qxg5. If 12. [ N f3 ] [ N f4 ] 13. [ N g1 ] [ Q f6 ] 14. [ K f1 ] [ B f5 ] [This has a powerful threat of 15. ... [ Q g6 ] 16. [ [ g3 ] ] [ N x e2 ] 17. [ N x e2 ] [ B d3 ] and white is crushed.] 15. [ [ g3 ] ] [ N x e2 ] 16. [ N x e2 ] [ B e4 ] 17. [ R h2 ] (17. [ R g1 ] Bf3) 17... [ B f3 ]  [ R x e2 ]  [ Q x e2 ]  [ N f4 ]  [ Q f3 ] , [ Q x g5 ]  Gaining two pieces for the rook. Now 15. [ K h1 ] [ Stops the immediate threat.] [ B e6 ] 16. [ N a3 ] [ a6 ] 17. [ R f e1 ] [ N d7 ] 18. [ R e3 ] [ N g6 ] 19. [ R a e1 ] ( 19. [ [ g3 ] ] Bxh3) 19... [ N f6 ] 20. [ R g1 ] [ K g7 ] 21. [ Q e2 ] (21. [ R e2 ] [ B g4 ] 22. [ Q d3 ] (22. [ h x g4 ] [ R h8 + ] 23. [ Q h3 ] [ Q x g4 ] 24. [ R e3 ] [ N e4 ] 25. [ R f1 ] [ R x h3 + ] 26. [ R x h3 ] [ N x f2 + ] 27. [ K g1 ] [ N x h3 + ] 28. [ K h1 ] Q[ [ g3 ] ] ) 22... Nf4) 21... [ R h8 ] 22. [ R f3 ] [ N [ h4 ] ] 23. [ R e3 ] [ N e4 ] 24. [ Q e1 ] [ Q f4 ] 25. [ [ g3 ] ] [ N x f2 + ] 26. [ K h2 ] [ N f3 + ] 27. [ R x f3 ] [ Q x f3 ] 28. [ h4 ] [ R x h4 # ]  [ N d2 ]  [ N x h3 + ]  [ K h1 ] , [ B g4 ]  If 17. [ Q d3 ] [ N f4 ] 18. [ Q g3 ] [ N e2 ] 19. [ Q d3 ] (or Qe3) [ Q h5 + ]  [ Q e3 ]  [ N x f2 + ]  [ Q x f2 ] , [ Q h5 + ]  1-0 19. [ Q h4 ] [ Q x h4 + ] 20. [ K g1 ] Bh2+! forces mate.
 [ N x f3 ]  [ R x f3 ] , [ Q e5 ]  White's Queen is still trapped.
 [ N b d2 ] , [ B b4 ]  White: [ N b [ d2 ] ] Black: [ B b4 ] I don't know if it's considered a good move or not but I like Black's choice to play [ B b4 ] here. My first reaction was to take with the a pawn but I quickly saw how that sequence would result in the loss of the rook on a1. The a pawn is effectively pinned and he's got a strong attack on the Knight on [ d2 ] and my king who still hasn't castled. We were playing with semi-tight time restraints as it was a blitz game so there wasn't a lot of time to analyze position. I played [ N b [ d2 ] ] continuing my KIA development and blocking the check on my King.
 [ B x f7 + ]  [ K e7 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ b6 ]  Black wants to play Ba6+.
 [ B e2 ] , [ N e3 ]  Building the net. If he doesn't play BxKn that kn will be a thorn in his side! If he takes then PxB and the pawn attacks [ d2 ] and f2. The goal is to attack all squares surround his king then the net is built. He'll be like a fish out of water!
 [ K g8 ] , [ Q h7 + ]  Which white offer at this point and I accept.
 [ B f5 + ] , [ R x f5 ]  So this is a nice turn. I can save myself with gxR. It defends my [ g2 ] but then black can go [ Q x b2 ] and... I was running out of time too!
 [ b x c2 ] , [ e6 + ]  Put an ! on this move. 27. e6+! took a long time for me to work out to figure out that all the angles were safe. With a combination of [ Q c7 ] and [ R [ b3 ] ] white has several mating threats that black must carefully avoid. 27. ... [ K a8 ] buys him the most time but then he immediately loses material with 28. e7. White's pawn forks the two rooks so 28. ... [ N x e7 ] is forced after which white plays 29. [ N x e7 ] winning black's knight and threatening the black queen. 29. ... [ Q b6 ] blunts white's mating attacks but creates new problems after white plays 30. [ b3 ] and the black knight has nowhere to run. But any other queen move leaves black dangerously vulnerable to white's mating threats. And white still holds [ Q e5 ] forking the [ d5 ] and [ g7 ] pawns to win another pawn. Faced with all the threats black chose to resign.
 [ e x d4 ]  [ B x d7 + ] , [ N x d7 ]  16. ...... [ N x d7 ] - thought I had better rid myself of black's lsb at the cost of Fou Leblanc as that prelate could be lethal to Henry.
 [ d4 ]  [ f5 ]  [ e3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ O-O ]  [ c6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ b3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N e5 ]  [ N b d7 ]  [ N x d7 ]  [ B x d7 ]  [ a4 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ f x e4 ]  [ B e2 ] , [ B x h2 + ]  a good plan... sacrificing a bishop so he can try to mate... a little bit too soon... maybe first [ h6 ]  [ K g1 ] , [ R f6 ]  trying to move a rook to [ h6 ] so he could try a mate
 [ h3 ] , [ B x f3 ]  I decided to give up the bishop pair for a few reasons: There aren't many good squares for the light-squared bishop...[ B e6 ] [ B x e6 ] [ f x e6 ] [ e5 ] looks awful for me. [ B d7 ] blocks the knight and doesn't have a clear future and [ B c8 ] would waste time and encourage [ [ f4 ] ] or [ g4 ] with an attack for white. Also after[ B x f3 ] I can gain development time with b5. If [ Q x f3 ] then I have ideas with q[ b6 ] attacking d4. I think [ g x f3 ] should be considered for white opening the g file and looking to play [ [ f4 ] ] f5.
 [ h3 ] , [ B x f3 ]  ?! This move is not positionally correct. White will open up the centre sooner or later and Black will do well to keep his bishops because it is said that bishops work well when the centre is open. Better is 10...Be6.
 [ B d7 ] , [ Q x c5 ]  The consequences of this is for Black much greater than the the loss of a piece for a pawn. For the moment Black can't castle and his bishop is a very poor minor piece (one of the down-sides of the French Defence is the so-called 'French Bishop' - blocked in by pawns). Black never does succeed in improving its prospects.
 [ g3 ] , [ N d6 ]  threatening combinations on the e5-[ e4 ] push basis.
 [ B x f6 ] , [ Q c2 ]  Gets out of the pin and connects the rooks. All the same it's not clear what White's plan of attack is going to be. White misses the dark-squared bishop here since he can't try to establish a central majority by [ b3 ] and [ c4 ] as this would allow [ d4 ] to be taken.
 [ e x f6 ] , [ Q x f6 ]  I have a good advantage now.
 [ K f1 ] , [ R f8 ]  Black threatens 23...B-[ R6 ] mate and if Spielmann tries 23 Q-[ N3 ] ch 23... B-[ K3 ] dis ch! is decisive. So Spielmann throws in the towel. A tremendous attacking game by Black.
 [ N x e5 ]  [ d6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c6 ] , [ B d3 ]  6. [ B d3 ] - the last moves have been very bookish - I now play [ B d3 ] to enable me to castle kingside and to shoo away the enemy knight.
 [ d x e6 ] , [ B x e6 ]  he exchanges pawns allowing me to develop my bishop the centre i feel now is mine.
 [ B f4 + ]  [ N d2 ]  [ N c7 ]  [ B x b6 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ Q c4 ]  [ g5 ]  [ K b1 ]  [ R e7 ]  [ Q g8 + ]  [ K d7 ]  [ N e4 + ]  [ N d5 ]  [ B a4 + ]  [ B c6 ]  [ Q x d5 + ]  [ K e8 ] , [ Q g8 # ]  Many thanks for reading this I hope you enjoyed it please leave some comments and rate it with the star system.
 [ B a3 ]  [ N e3 + ]  [ K d2 ]  [ N x c2 ]  [ B b2 ] , [ R c5 ]  Once you are up in pieces eliminate the opposing pawns. They are the only pieces that can win the game for white at this point if one can manage to clear the end of the board.
 [ b x a4 ]  [ R a b8 ]  [ R h f1 ]  [ B b3 ]  [ Q b2 ] , [ B x d1 ]  misses 22.[ Q x a4 ] intensifying the pins but Black is strong either way.
 [ K d6 ] , [ B x d8 ]  Now that white captures the Queen it is checkmate on Black King
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N b d2 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ c6 ]  [ e3 ]  [ B x e5 ] , [ d x e5 ]  Dream position for a London player.
 [ Q d6 ] , [ R e8 + ]  A desperation check White is simply hoping to buy time and hopefully allow Black to make a mistake
 [ d4 ] , [ c6 ]  [ f6 ] takes longer to win.
 [ B x h3 ]  [ K x h3 ] , [ Q e6 + ]  Once again I mate the king following his capture of my DB.
 [ N c3 ] , [ B b4 ]  Well I'm already off the reservation. My little bit of resources suggests 2. ... [ N f6 ] 2. ... [ N c6 ] or 2. ... [ d6 ] in that order but the GK DB seemed to show this move 2. ... [ B b4 ] as more successful so I went with it.
 [ N x f5 ]  [ R x c6 ]  [ N x e3 ] , [ R x a6 ]  34. [ R x a6 ] - I anticipated [ N x e3 ] because I had [ R x a6 ] up my sleeve. I think I can get a queenside passer out of this.
 [ g5 ]  [ K b3 ]  [ h4 ] , [ K c3 ]  49. [ K c3 ] - the WK tries to stop the black pawns from reaching Glendadom but it will be to no avail.
 [ Q f6 ] , [ O-O ]  Development as well as adding protection to f5. I also figured that when the N's are exchanged I'll have an attack on the Queen.
 [ B b5 + ] , [ B d7 ]  Not 12. ... axb5? allowing 13. Rxa8.
 [ d x c5 ] , [ e5 ]  white with his last move gave black also the center.
 [ R x d5 ] , [ Q f3 ]  I think perhaps 34...[ Q f7 ] 35.[ R a1 ] [ R d8 ] 36.[ K g2 ] [ Q b7 ] is slightly better but far from a winning move.
 [ e5 ]  [ f4 ] , [ e x f4 ]  The King's Gambit accepted.
 [ e5 ] , [ N f3 ]  Developing a piece and attacking a pawn.
 [ K h2 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ Q d4 ] , [ f5 ]  The only way to stop g4. But now black's queen is out of the game.
 [ R x c7 + ]  [ K x c7 ] , [ K f1 ]  I like this move. Although it doesn't accomplish that much since Erika doesn't have a mate we're well into the endgame. So the K becomes a weapon now.
 [ N f3 ]  [ B h6 ]  [ Q c2 ] , [ R f4 ]  giving way so [ e4 ] is possible
 [ N g6 ]  [ B e3 ] , [ b5 ]  Black sees that there is no obviously good squares for the dark squared bishop so he decides to trade of white's bishop make room for the light squared bishop and double white's pawns trying to later prove them as weaknesses. Later in the game we'll see that altough doubled black has no queenside pawn majority so the doubled pawns are maybe not so weak. This is probably what white expected when playing 8.[ Q e2 ] as the queens rook may be active on his original square after eventual hxg3.
 [ K e2 ] , [ R d2 + ]  This potentially allows white some reprieve. Better would be [ e x f3 ] [ g x f3 ] as this opens up the first and second ranks where black can easily take control with his rook and queen. Alternatively c3. If white moves the knight he loses his rook
 [ K d2 ] , [ c5 ]  Now the bishop can fly [ g7 ] is defended.
 [ K b2 ]  [ K f3 ]  [ K c3 ]  [ K g4 ]  [ K d4 ]  [ K x h4 ]  [ K e5 ] , [ K g5 ]  I was expecting [ K g3 ] slowly advancing the h-pawn while defending with the king but it turns out that this is much more effective
 [ R h g1 ] , [ K a5 ]  P[ a6 ] was still a good move.
 [ B e3 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ Q d2 ]  When white plays [ B e3 ] in the Sicilian he almost always wants to play Qd2. Especially if black has played the Fianchetto. The reason for this is that later on white can setup all kinds of tactics on [ f6 ] and [ h6 ] with the support of the king pawns. But here this maybe a tad too early because this blocks the escape route of the DSB. Allowing black to play his next move. Alternative variation: [better is ] 10. [ f3 ] O-O 11. [ Q d2 ] [ R c8 ] 12. [ R a d1 ] [=]
 [ e5 ]  [ B g2 ] , [ d5 ]  Now I've built up a full pawn centre.
 [ B x e3 ] , [ N x e3 ]  Probably my opponents intention was not to lose tempo in case of 18.[ R x e3 ] [ d5 ] where he should have retreated with the knight in a more defensive position as d as my next move would have been [ d4 ] pushing my pawn forward and chase his knight if he retreated to e3. If he chose 19.ex[ d5 ] cx[ d5 ] no problem he should have retreated with the knight and I gained tempo anyway.
 [ c x d4 ] , [ a4 ]  White's doubled pawns are a death sentence. D6 can fall at any moment and [ d4 ] cannot be saved. Still black is in no hurry to chase pawns when he can chase a queen instead. Hmmm better not take that out of context...
 [ B b3 ]  [ b4 ]  [ N c e2 ] , [ N a5 ]  13.... a5!? is a better alternative 14. [ N x c6 ] [ B x c6 ] black still has intiative. Although the move played is not a bad one. 14. Qxb4? [ d5 ] 15.[ Q d2 ] [ d x e4 ] black is in a much better position than white.
 [ g4 ] , [ N a5 ]  Hoping to chip away at the defenses of White's king by trading off the less active knight on [ c6 ] for the important defensive piece on b3.
 [ R f2 ] , [ b x c4 ]  cant afford 2 lost pawns and also took a step back thought of an annotation i once read on GK which in my own words said to imagine all the pieces but the pawns remained in an endgame connected pawns are more powerful than isolated pawns always try and keep them connected so thinking of the endgame I retake with 29.[ d x c4 ]  [ d x c4 ] , [ e4 ]  and here comes the [ e4 ] push
 [ e x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ] , [ B x d2 + ]  Black tries a largely benign attack though it does serve to prevent White from castling.
 [ h3 ] , [ N a6 ]  I never liked that move [ h3 ] but I see it all the time. I play my queen's knight to [ a6 ] not wanting to block my bishop. This move looks awkward but in replaying several master games of this defense I came upon this move being made again and again. I think it is just within the nature of this opening.
 [ f6 ] , [ B x f8 ]  In retrospect I should have moved [ h4 ] rather than capture the rook. Perhaps I lost my nerves and wanted to secure a material advantage
 [ e x d4 ]  [ O-O ] , [ a6 ]  I was surprised to see Stanley hit my B but I do what must be done to defend.
 [ a5 ] , [ B e7 ]  Switching diagonals and coming to [ d6 ] with tempo.
 [ B x a4 ]  [ R b1 ]  [ R d e8 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ N h5 ]  [ B h2 ]  [ R a d8 ]  [ g4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ g5 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ N c4 ]  [ c6 ]  [ b x c6 ]  [ b x c6 ]  [ N d6 ]  [ R e6 ] , [ e5 ]  Black has a rook and knight eying that pawn while white has it covered by the bishop only.
 [ d5 ]  [ d3 ]  [ e5 ]  [ B g2 ] , [ N f6 ]  To avoid a lot of theory I have a tendency to play the same three moves whether I’m playing black or white. It’s called the Modern Defence but I prefer to call it the rat. The crux of the strategy here is one of non-engagement. I allow my opponent free rein in the center so number one there are few forcing variations (a good way to avoid a lot of theory) and two…I’m hopefully giving my opponent all the rope he needs to hang himself. I call this opening or system of development ‘the Rat Reversed.’
 [ e x f6 ] , [ N c5 ]  The Knight is closing in on my King.
 [ R a x b8 ] , [ B c2 ]  Preparing to move the bishop to a better place on the board. I need to wait to see which square is best though but [ B c2 ] can't hurt.
 [ N f6 ] , [ N x b5 ]  Now threatening the fork on c7.
 [ B e2 ] , [ Q c8 ]  14. ....... [ Q c8 ] - black does not wish to exchange queens - he is preparing to put his rook on d8. I now castle in order to prepare a contest of the d file.
 [ R c8 ]  [ R d1 ] , [ N d8 ]  Now if I play 30 R-[ Q5 ] 30...N-[ N2 ] defends the Pawn.
 [ B x f6 ] , [ B x f6 ]  The bishop's diagonal is obscured but Black believes the [ c5 ] break should remedy this.
 [ d3 ]  [ e5 ] , [ R h3 ]  here i thought: what if i do d7-d5? then i could get the rook with my bishop
 [ f3 ] , [ f6 ]  It seems like we were thinking alike these past couple of moves.
 [ N x f6 + ]  [ Q x f6 ]  [ d3 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ g6 ] , [ Q a5 ]  5 was a wide open rank that I took advantage of and now keeps me offensive.
 [ N h4 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ B f3 ]  [ R b8 ]  [ N d2 ] , [ g5 ]  ?! i think best is 0-0.
 [ B b6 ] , [ Q g4 ]  An aggressive move recommended by Dzindzichashvili in some of his interesting [ B d2 ] lines against the Winnawer pin on the [ c3 ] knight in the advance French it makes sense to play this now that the bishop has committed itself away from the defense of the pawn and [ g6 ] is an awkward weakening of the dark squares on black's KS.
 [ N c3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ B e2 ]  This opponent has his own way of playing. I tend to see the LSB develop to [ c4 ] more often than this.
 [ N d2 ] , [ R c8 ]  I remember this being a common move in this line.
 [ R d6 ]  [ f5 ]  [ R e7 + ] , [ R f7 ]  This is difficult. I would play [ K h6 ] as keeping your rook is your only vague hope now.
 [ B x e5 ]  [ f x e5 ] , [ e4 ]  Well this was just out of my calculations. Now how to proceed?
 [ N a5 ]  [ B a2 ] , [ R c8 ]  Challenging my open file. How irritating. Black's queenside expansion is really beginning to worry me now. Oh yes and before I forget the drawback to this move...
 [ Q g4 ]  [ Q f6 ]  [ b x c6 ]  [ b x c6 ]  [ a4 ] , [ Q x f2 + ]  here we go nothing to lose really. I can't see a complete way through but after [ R x f2 ] [ R x f2 ] ... Ra-[ f8 ] is a strong attack.
 [ B x g7 + ]  [ K x g7 ] , [ R h g1 ]  Well at least some countertactic for me... I need one!
 [ Q e5 ]  [ R a2 ]  [ R d8 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ Q d5 ] , [ R e1 ]  [ f3 ] was the last chance to stay alive but not for long i suppose
 [ K e2 ]  [ R c1 ]  [ K f2 ]  [ R x c3 ]  [ N e2 ]  [ R c2 ] , [ R h a1 ]  Black's king is beleaguered...but on the other hand White's rooks are powerfully placed down the a-file...
 [ R d1 ]  [ R e5 + ]  [ K c4 ] , [ K e6 ]  I have to slowly push White back.
 [ Q x d6 ] , [ g3 ]  white gives his bishop a retreat square so black is once again faced with the problem of preventing Nb2. Kasparov would have had to have seen this at least as early as move 21 else 21...[ g5 ] would not have made much sense.
 [ R x a4 ]  [ N x c4 ]  [ R x c4 ]  [ R x b5 ]  [ b3 ]  [ g5 ]  [ K f2 ]  [ h6 ]  [ K f3 ]  [ h5 ]  [ g3 ]  [ K e5 ]  [ K e3 ]  [ K d5 ]  [ K d3 ] , [ R b6 ]  I went for a better rook placement.
 [ B d3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ O-O ] , [ B d6 ]  At this point of the game I very happy where this game was going. We are now playing into a style that I'm used to seeing all time. So I started to relax and play normal with no stress.
 [ a5 ]  [ R a4 ] , [ R b2 ]  I preferred this to exchanging rooks as I was hoping to get a passer of my own
 [ e x f6 ]  [ B g4 + ]  [ K d2 ]  [ g x f6 ]  [ a x b3 ]  [ f5 ]  [ e x f5 ]  [ B x f5 ]  [ K e2 ]  [ B g4 + ]  [ K f2 ]  [ R f8 + ]  [ K g3 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ R a d1 ]  [ K e7 ]  [ B g5 + ]  [ K d7 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ B c2 ] , [ B x d6 ]  I was trying to be too clever here...
 [ N c3 ]  [ e6 ] , [ e4 ]  White goes for the big center and will have an advantage in space. Black has to try to knock it down.
 [ d5 ]  [ N x e5 ] , [ Q e7 ]  Not what I expected I expected d5-[ e4 ]  [ d4 ] , [ c5 ]  Attack on my knight's defender. It seems I wasn't thinking so well at the moment
 [ K g7 ] , [ N g5 ]  16. [ N g5 ] - threatening a family fork on [ e6 ] so black must play BxN.
 [ N d6 ]  [ R g8 ] , [ R f b1 ]  Threatening [ R x b7 ] [ K d8 ] (forced) [ R b8 ] winning the g8-Rook.
 [ R b6 b4 ]  [ R a3 ] , [ d5 ]  To start the kingside pawn majority advance and to prepare an attack on the remaining pawn in case of exchange. I should play it before Nc3.
 [ B h4 ] , [ g5 ]  another attack. !
 [ N x e4 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ] , [ R e1 ]  Trying to build a discovered attack on the black queen.
 [ B b3 ] , [ Q h4 ]  development completed with all pieces (except the [ a8 ] rook) active and ready to participate in the attack.
 [ K e7 ]  [ R x a5 ] , [ R d4 d1 ]  Trying to keep both Rooks on one file. But I think this is a mistake as Joe will win another pawn. In this position I'd play 35...[ R a8 ] as black to protect a7.
 [ Q f2 ] , [ a6 ]  creating more space...
 [ Q e2 ]  [ h6 ] , [ N e4 ]  Wins the bishop back. However I've trapped one of his bishops.
 [ N x d5 ]  [ B h6 ] , [ N f4 ]  I wanted to give him some bait to get off h6. I wanted to castle
 [ N c7 ]  [ Q a4 ]  [ N b5 ]  [ K a1 ]  [ Q c8 ] , [ h3 ]  my plan is to get his queen out of the way so i can push!
 [ N c3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ B e3 ] , [ N f6 ]  this move is to be prefered over [ d6 ] as the pawn move is "inflexible" as the game shows.
 [ N d8 ] , [ B b5 ]  Trying to trade knight for bishop.
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ c4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ b6 ]  Another popular moves in this variation are 4...[ N f6 ] 4...[ B e7 ] 4...[ B b4 ] 4...[ B f5 ] .
 [ h x g6 ]  [ f x g6 ]  [ O-O-O ] , [ B x h4 ]  Black equals the material but open the h-column what were a blunder. Here I was too optimist and gives the knight in [ [ f2 ] ] to make a mate attack. Las negras recuperan el material pero abren la columna h. Acá me sentí muy optimista y entregué el caballo en [ [ f2 ] ] para realizar un ataque de mate.
 [ N c6 ] , [ Q d2 ]  Proceeding with my plan..
 [ Q f4 ] , [ g3 ]  This move seals the black queen. There is no place for her to go !!
 [ N c6 ] , [ N f5 ]  Trading the knights decreases the intensity of my attack. Now the threat is [ N g7 ] winning the queen.
 [ c6 ]  [ b5 ]  [ a x b5 ]  [ a x b5 ] , [ c x b5 ]  The computer says I now have a 1.21 advantage
 [ d4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ e4 ] , [ d5 ]  Of course we have now reached the standard position in The French Defence which is normally reached via 1. [ e4 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ e5 ] , [ N f d7 ]  White can at this stage play 6. [ h4 ] with a pawn sac which is perfectly sound but has been analyzed to a draw. My book devotes a chapter to this. The move I preferred exchanges White's bad bishop which has limited mobility due to the pawns on [ d4 ] and [ e5 ] in return for Black's good Bishop. White has a slight edge.
 [ d5 ] , [ c4 ]  Oh THAT old chestnut. Shall I resign now. Very tempted.
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ c5 ]  [ d5 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ e4 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ a6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ b5 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ h6 ]  [ B h4 ]  [ c4 ]  [ B c2 ]  [ g5 ] , [ R e1 ]  [ e5 ] was better but not disastrously so
 [ Q d2 ]  [ Q x b2 ]  [ R b1 ]  [ Q a3 ]  [ f5 ] , [ b5 ]  not playing the main line. the main line here was 10...[ N c6 ] and keeps black ahead. the move in the game give white the advantage as Black's queen will soon be hanging on [ a5 ] and the [ b8 ] cant move to good positions.
 [ B b3 ] , [ R f8 ]  I try to drive the Queen.
 [ N f6 ]  [ N g5 ] , [ d5 ]  His pawn move stopped my fork
 [ B x f6 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ N d5 ] , [ N x f3 + ]  getting the [ b2 ] pawn.
 [ K g1 ]  [ R a1 ] , [ N f7 # ]  And there it is. Not a common mating pattern and consequently one that is quite satisfying. In this case it involved a little luck for me that black didn't spot it.
 [ Q c3 ] , [ B h3 ]  I will be up the exchange but lose my bishop pair.
 [ Q f7 + ]  [ K d6 ] , [ O-O-O ]  ...and now [ d6 ] is threatened again. Now if something like [ Q e7 ] I can happily exchange my Q and I'll be fine though not winning.
 [ K e2 ] , [ Q g2 ]  ??
 [ K f8 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ Q h4 ]  [ g3 ]  [ Q x d4 ]  [ d3 ]  [ h4 ] , [ B e3 ]  i think it's an error but i haven't seen anything
 [ Q x d1 ] , [ R f x d1 ]  Retaking with the other rook would have allowed a fork.
 [ R e2 ]  [ b5 ] , [ R x e7 ]  The winning tactic.
 [ R d8 ] , [ d3 ]  mainly to prevent [ c4 ] at this stage and prepare g4...
 [ B b7 ]  [ R a d1 ]  [ N a6 ] , [ Q d3 ]  then castling./swap
 [ Q c8 ] , [ K f2 ]  So time to sort something out about my king....

In an error-strewn encounter possibly White's shrewdest move; on the defensive I spot the opportunity for a mating net. Well what else have I got going for me?
 [ R x f6 ]  [ R x b3 ] , [ K g4 ]  Protect against [ R x f3 ]  [ R d3 ] , [ B f7 ]  Finally an opportunity for a forced checkmate with 44. Rh6. Black Resigns.
 [ b x a6 ] , [ Q x c6 ]  I saw a free knight so I took it. :D
 [ g4 ] , [ h6 ]  Space grabbing and weakening. I already see an [ e5 ] to come with threat on h7. How to force it?
 [ Q d5 ] , [ B e6 ]  So I bring my bishop back to defend [ c4 ]  [ Q c5 + ] , [ Q e7 ]  Now if he exchanges I can at last develop my R(h8)
 [ Q g2 ]  [ Q b5 ] , [ e x d4 ]  Availing the tactical possibility.
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ] , [ e5 ]  The Advance Variation as recommended by Greek Grandmaster Kotronias in his book "Beating the Caro Kann". It's a long time since I read this book but I loved its devil take the hindmost attitude.
 [ R e8 ] , [ K f2 ]  I offered a draw but he didn't accept it. I want to get my rook to [ d1 ] and chase his rook off of that file so I need my king on [ e2 ] to do that. But when he moves his rook to [ e8 ] I have to go back to [ f2 ] because my pawn on [ e3 ] is pinned and his knight threatens to get back into the game with Nxf4.
 [ R h d8 ]  [ h4 ] , [ N c5 ]  as planed
 [ N f7 ] , [ K d5 ]  The Black king is regrouping!
 [ Q f1 + ]  [ K d2 ]  [ Q f2 + ] , [ K d3 ]  ! Instead of ducking for cover the White King bravely ventures out to snatch pawns. Why not? — there's no risk of mate.
 [ N b c3 ]  [ N c2 + ]  [ K d2 ]  [ N x a1 ]  [ B b2 ]  [ N x b3 + ]  [ a x b3 ]  [ Q b4 ]  [ f3 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ K c2 ]  [ Q c5 ]  [ R d1 ]  [ c6 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ O-O ]  [ K b1 ]  [ Q d6 ]  [ K a2 ]  [ Q g6 ]  [ R d2 ]  [ R b8 ]  [ f4 ]  [ Q h6 ]  [ g3 ]  [ N g4 ]  [ N f5 ]  [ Q e6 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ Q c8 ]  [ h3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ R c2 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N a4 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ N e2 ]  [ Q a6 ]  [ N e c3 ]  [ Q d3 ]  [ R c1 ]  [ R b4 ]  [ R d1 ]  [ Q c2 ]  [ R x d5 ]  [ Q x b3 + ]  [ K a1 ]  [ R x a4 + ]  [ N x a4 ] , [ Q x d5 ]  
 [ N f6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N b d7 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B e7 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B g5 ] , [ N d5 ]  Hoping that Bishop at [ c4 ] will cut the Knight then the black pawn could emerge into the d file and then attack through the e file.
 [ R c8 ] , [ Q e1 ]  Here I was in a worry on what move to make with the queen in order to engage the white rooks. [ Q d2 ] followed by [ R f d1 ] etc. Finally I played this in order to allow [ N e6 ] by strengthening defense on c3.
 [ N f d7 ]  [ f4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N e2 ]  [ B b4 + ]  [ N b c3 ]  [ c5 ]  [ a3 ]  [ B a5 ] , [ R b1 ]  here we can see a tactical domination by whites i see here no weakness except [ c4 ] pawn
 [ e x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ] , [ Q h5 + ]  Aggressive move deploys the queen and opens up the rooks file after the bishop is moved.
 [ R a8 ]  [ b6 ]  [ N d3 ] , [ R c2 ]  I am confused why this move was made (other than to avoid the Knight). The following looks much more interesting: 31. [ Q x a7 ] [ R x a7 ] 32. [ b a x7 ] [ N x b2 ] 33. [ a8 Q + ] [ K g7 ] (still though black is winning).
 [ N f6 ] , [ Q b3 ]  Attacking f7.
 [ e x f7 + ]  [ K x f7 ] , [ B g2 ]  Defending the [ e4 ] which is critical to whites position.
 [ R d a1 ] , [ R f a8 ]  yeah yeah you don't really scare me
 [ Q a5 + ] , [ Q d2 ]  12.[ N d2 ] was also possible as 12....[ B x g2 ] 13.[ R g1 ] [ B b7 ] 14.[ B h6 ] [ B f6 ] and now the move I missed 15.Bxg7. Having missed this I played 12.[ Q d2 ]  [ Q x d2 + ] , [ K x d2 ]  13.[ N x d2 ] was an option and may have been preferable. I didn't play it because of 13.....[ B x g2 ] but like the previous note [ B x g2 ] is weak.
 [ R a5 ]  [ R x e4 ]  [ N x d6 ]  [ Q g5 + ]  [ K c8 ] , [ c4 ]  Protecting the knight over the rook? [ N e7 + ] at least gives white black's black bishop (QxB).
 [ R x g2 + ] , [ B x g2 ]  Not to take could have been a little better as strange as it may seem. No time to prove it thoug. From here the mate is almost forced.
 [ d x e4 ] , [ N d2 ]  Making his bid for the [ e4 ] pawn clear.
 [ g x f6 ]  [ N a c1 ]  [ f5 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ a5 ]  [ N c5 ]  [ N x c5 ] , [ B x c5 ]  M: I take back with tempo ... now my two Bishops are nicely positioned ...
 [ d x c4 ]  [ B x c4 ] , [ R b8 ]  not sure why this was played an imediate [ b5 ] is better then the rook can pick its best square later on instead of commiting itself to [ b8 ] so early
 [ Q h3 ] , [ Q x c4 + ]  ...with check so my advantage is now decisive.
 [ B d3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ B b4 + ]  Was that a good move?
 [ N x e7 + ]  [ Q x e7 ]  [ Q x d6 ]  [ Q x d6 ]  [ R x d6 ]  [ c3 ] , [ N b3 ]  cuts off any nonsense. Actually I think Black may have just dropped another pawn here can't be sure. If 22...[ c x b2 ] 23[ R x a6 ] White restores its pawn advantage. BUT I'm not sure they will be able to get any pieces into position to support the isolated b pawn ere the king snaffles it up. Will have to analyse.
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ f4 ]  [ d6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ c3 ]  my personal setup for the Grand Prix Attack (GPA)... I prefer this over the closed Sicilian with [ N c3 ] such as 1. [ e4 ] [ c5 ] 2. [ N c3 ] [ d6 ] 3. [ f4 ] for many reasons mainly concerning Nc6; after [ N f6 ] we now have d3... the main object here is [ g3 ] [ B g2 ] 0-0 and develop...
 [ e4 ]  [ c6 ] , [ N c3 ]  Usual move is 2.[ [ [ d4 ] ] ] but with 2. [ N c3 ] after Black 2. ... [ d5 ] White can play 3.[ [ [ d4 ] ] ] returning to the main line. On my opinion 2.[ [ [ d4 ] ] ] is more flexible while White can choose between 3.[ N c3 ] 3.[ N d2 ] 3.[ e5 ] after Black's usual 2. ... [ d5 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ N x e4 ] , [ N d7 ]  Previous moves were clear. Sometimes someone plays 4. ... [ N f6 ] but after 5.[ B c4 ] [ N b d7 ] 6.[ d4 ] Black have no [ N e5 ] with exchanging the active white bishop. After a move in the game very active 5. [ B c4 ] meets [ N e5 ] [ N x c4 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ Q e2 ]  [ N x c4 ] , [ Q x c4 ]  What we have after exchange: no active White bishop White Queen made 3 moves to get in the position Black Knight made 3 moves and was exchanged... so after completing 7th move Black doesn't lose a tempo and exchange a powerful Bishop. Not bad.
 [ e4 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ B x e4 ]  [ B x e4 ] , [ R x e4 ]  after exchanges I lost my key-bishop but I won territory and I was better developed.
 [ N x d4 ] , [ e x d4 ]  Symmetry was fun but I'll keep my Queen thank you. And I musn't forget my Knight is skewered to my Queen.
 [ R d7 + ] , [ K h6 ]  I have to go there or the game will be at a dead end.
 [ N f5 ]  [ h3 ]  [ N f d4 ]  [ Q d3 ]  [ B x f3 ]  [ B x f3 ]  [ N x f3 ] , [ Q x f3 ]  Not the best from my pinning position...
 [ R x e3 ]  [ R c1 + ]  [ K g2 ]  [ R c2 + ] , [ K f3 ]  This is a mistake from white one that I was hoping for but not expecting.
 [ B h3 + ]  [ K e2 ]  [ B g4 + ]  [ K f1 ]  [ R x d1 + ]  [ K g2 ] , [ Q d2 # ]  0-1
 [ R g f2 ] , [ a5 ]  Basicaly moving my pieces forward while I wait the position on the kingside to be stuck.
 [ g5 ] , [ f5 ]  This pawn is now a passed pawn and after all passed pawns must be pushed! It's a bonus that the promotion square is also forking square
 [ K g2 ] , [ h3 + ]  Driving back the King. I'm still optimistic but White rather hands it to me...
 [ K d4 ]  [ K g5 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ N e6 + ] , [ K c4 ]  I'm going to win that [ a6 ] pawn eventually
 [ R x c5 ] , [ b x c5 ]  The exchange took place. Things are looking a little rosier.
 [ b x c6 ]  [ e ]  [ p ] , [ N x c6 ]  If 28...[ B x f4 ] 29. [ c7 ] and the pawn promotes for sure...
 [ c3 ] , [ f x e4 ]  after [ N c6 ] [ e5 ] [ d6 ] (Black has to cover c5) Ne3! Blacks' center collapses...
 [ N b6 ]  [ Q h6 ]  [ N x a4 ]  [ b3 ] , [ N c3 ]  Only now did I care about losing the advantage. I throughout the game develop a plan to start up another one but every time I do so I only receive interruption.
 [ g6 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ N x d4 ] , [ Q x d4 ]  11. [ Q x d4 ] - knight trade. Well I have castled short but my queenside pieces need to come out. After Maria castles short Fou Lenoir develops with a threat to Maria's [ f8 ] rook.
 [ b6 ]  [ a6 ] , [ B c3 ]  ? a subtle mistake but one that loses. i believe [ B e3 ] was the only move to save as the bishop was vulnerable to capture from the rook. the reason the bishop is so important to white is he must take the knight with it at some stage though not yet or he loses material. now he cannot capture the knight and as such is in deep trouble. i cannot be 100% sure but i think black now has mate in 12 assuming best play from both. if anyone feels like analysing feel free to post your findings. i spent hours analysing this part of the game and i reckon mate in 12. i get there quicker though.
 [ N c3 ] , [ c6 ]  Covering [ d5 ] both so I can advance my d-pawn and to keep white from playing his knight there.
 [ e4 ] , [ c5 ]  The Sicilian defense. This is probably the most defying and exciting response to white's opening [ e4 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d3 ] , [ e6 ]  Even from here it is noticeable that this will be a more positional Sicilian than the sharp battles we're used to seeing.
 [ R d b1 ] , [ a6 ]  If [ Q x d4 ] then I play [ B x b7 ] and Black's king's position falls apart.
 [ R a6 ] , [ a3 ]  Weakening the king.
 [ R f7 ]  [ N x a4 ]  [ b x c6 ]  [ b x c6 + ]  [ K a8 ]  [ N c5 ]  [ f x g4 ]  [ N x e6 ]  [ N x e6 ]  [ R x f7 ] , [ g3 ]  White has won a exchange but black has four pawns to two. Two of these pawns are on the sixth rank.
 [ B c6 ] , [ R c1 ]  White slowly puts pressure on the Bishop. It know is pinned to the King and the Queen
 [ d3 ] , [ N x c2 ]  P[ x d3 ] would have opened up the e-file for white's rook aimed right at my king. Seemed risky so I decided against it. Besides the knight at [ c2 ] keeps his rook off of [ e1 ] for a while (he must save his rook on a1. The tempo I gain while white saves that rook lets black gain a pawn here though doubled isolated pawns on the d-file aren't very strong unless I can liquidate all the white pieces before he grabs them.
 [ R b3 ] , [ B x c4 ]  Maybe black didn't calculate this move.....or he just thought :-I can quietly recovery the disadvantage-.
 [ N c4 ]  [ B f4 ] , [ O-O ]  Here White castles into my king side attack however I have to be very careful over how Black works those strong centered knights. My first step of action is to reduce the strenght of these knights and continue to mobilize my pieces against the castled king.
 [ R f e1 ]  [ Q g6 ] , [ Q d3 ]  this gives me a discovered attack on his queen protects my knight and both pawns and moves my queen to a better location assuming he is planning to double his rooks on the e file
 [ f5 ]  [ R c d1 ] , [ Q x c4 ]  I really thought he would proceed with the King's Rook keeping [ c4 ] under surveillance.
 [ K g5 ] , [ R c2 ]  still too nervous about white [ c6 ] pawn
 [ N f6 ]  [ Q h3 ] , [ R f e8 ]  And I also go on the attack myself in case Tom has similar future plans.
 [ B x e1 ] , [ g x f4 ]  44. ..... gxf4!! - Double and Treble Ouch! - Freddy's queen is pinned to his king and that can only mean one thing! His queen is gonna drop.
 [ h4 ]  [ g x h4 ] , [ R h2 ]  Trying to regain the Pawn he just sacrificed.
 [ f6 ]  [ N d3 ]  [ a x b4 ] , [ N d x b4 ]  The move that practically costed the game for White. Have given a great deal of thought to it but honestly I still do not see what my opponend had in mind. He had played well so far so there must have been something there I am sure of it. Taking back with the other knight would have given a better counter play. The black pieces are better organized still and both bishops are active but the position was far from decisive.
 [ f x e5 ] , [ R x c6 ]  I capture the rook at [ e5 ] with my pawn and black captures my passed pawn at c6.
 [ K x g7 ] , [ b3 ]  saving the pawn... though for now there was no need to make this move because that pawn would have been poison e.g. 20.[ h3 ] Qxb2?? 21.Rfb1! wins the queen... Better safe than sorry I guess
 [ K h1 ] , [ B e4 ]  The only place for the bishop where there is no fork for White's queen.
 [ R b5 ] , [ N d6 ]  This is where moving my King up would have really paid off.
 [ Q f1 ] , [ N x e3 ]  At this point I could take his knight [ f x e3 ] and provide additional protection on the knight at [ d4 ] but I must have (I can't recall specifically now after the fact) seen the potential for a trapped knight and must have been really worried about the possibility of the queen causing havoc so I trade queens.
 [ K x b7 ]  [ K g5 ]  [ K c7 ]  [ K x g6 ]  [ K d6 ]  [ N c4 + ]  [ K d5 ]  [ K f6 ]  [ K d4 ] , [ K x e6 ]  
 [ Q d3 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ N d2 ] , [ O-O ]  I hate my position.
 [ K a5 ] , [ Q b4 + ]  I do not want the king there this may look like a wasted move but I really hated to king to be there. the square is too good for his pawns.
 [ B x d4 ]  [ R a6 x a5 ] , [ B x c5 ]  White obviously doesn't agree!
 [ d x c3 ] , [ K a2 ]  Preventing the further loss of his kingside pawns.
 [ N c3 ]  [ N b d7 ] , [ N a4 ]  Again she is under pressure. No real good square so time to retreat.
 [ Q x g5 ] , [ K g8 ]  His situation is bleak but I feel that Shredder should at least try to push his passed pawns - it's the only thing going for him!
 [ B d2 ] , [ N c6 ]  Which enables him to continue with his development.
 [ K h7 ]  [ N f5 ]  [ B g6 ] , [ Q g3 ]  White is thinking about possible avenues of attack with the strong knight on [ f5 ]  [ B x f5 ] , [ R x f5 ]  Black takes the knight off but the heavy pieces are getting involved. White had to look at [ Q x f5 ] to see if black could get two rooks for the queen luckily ( and it was lucky ) the queen on [ g3 ] guard the rook on e1.
 [ f5 ]  [ R f3 ]  [ B h6 ]  [ R e1 ] , [ R f6 ]  protects the [ e6 ] pawn
 [ e x f5 ]  [ e x f5 ] , [ R f e1 ]  ! The battery on the e-file dominates the game for the next 10 moves.
 [ Q a5 ] , [ K b1 ]  Perhaps this move is too slow and actually moves the white king towards the location I'm attacking. But admittedly the threat of ... [ b4 ] and [ Q x a2 ] doesn't look very inviting.
 [ N c3 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ N e2 ]  [ N b3 ]  [ N c1 ]  [ N g4 ]  [ R e2 ]  [ N x c1 ] , [ R x c1 ]  I was glad that knight was gone because it looked menacing. Black could have played [ R b8 ] instead of exchanging but there is wasn't much reason for the pawn being on [ b3 ] anyways - it would probably become a target for attack.
 [ d4 ]  [ e x d4 ] , [ Q x d4 ]  5. [ Q x d4 ] - pawn trade.
 [ Q f3 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ O-O ] , [ f5 ]  Threatens my knight.
 [ h x g6 ] , [ h x g6 ]  after [ K g7 ] [ Q x c7 ] threatening Qxd8+! [ Q x d8 ] [ N x e6 + ] recapturing the Queen...
 [ O-O ] , [ N b d7 ]  Botvinnik: A bad mistake. Now White has the two important squares [ Q5 ] and [ Q B4 ] at his disposal and his spatial advantage becomes crushing. After 22...N/4-[ Q2 ] 23 B-[ B3 ] B-[ K4 ] 24 BxB NxB 25 BxP R-[ N1 ] White has no more than a minimal advantage. Fischer: I couldn't disagree more. Why should Black return the Pawn?
 [ Q d2 ]  [ g5 ] , [ c3 ]  black is also beefing up left side for a potential attack
 [ e4 ] , [ e5 ]  A fun game against a friend I play black and build a crushing pawn advantage on the queenside then screw it all up and watch it go up in smoke.
 [ e x d4 ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ R e8 + ]  [ N g e2 ] , [ a5 ]  Here I was looking for space so the logical would have been [ b5 ] any ways he´s move had no sense
 [ B d6 ] , [ g3 ]  To prevent the intrusion on [ h2 ]  [ R x b7 ] , [ R f c8 ]  Now I recognised the reality of my plight and relied on Black's eagerness to be away so I chose an innocuous-looking move and offered a draw.
 [ b5 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ B b7 ] , [ d4 ]  now it is too late. [ d3 ] was better although black has the initiative and the better chances.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ d3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ d6 ] , [ N a4 ]  Should never have done that
 [ g3 ] , [ Q x h4 ]  He can't take my queen because the pawn is pinned to his king. This is why I didn't care if he doubled my pawns because it allowed me a big attack on the g-file.
 [ a5 ]  [ R d c3 + ] , [ K d5 ]  This played into my hands here...
 [ Q c7 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ B x e5 ]  [ B x e5 ] , [ Q x e5 ]  that's where i didn't want to be
 [ Q e3 + ]  [ R f2 ]  [ Q e1 + ]  [ R f1 ]  [ Q e3 + ]  [ R f2 ]  [ Q e1 + ] , [ R f1 ]  
 [ K h2 ] , [ R e2 ]  You can calculate the remaining moves. This is my best attack in terms of planning and execution to date!
 [ B x c4 ]  [ R x c4 ] , [ N c e2 ]  !?!? Totally unknown variation in the Dragon. White usually sacs a pawn after 14.[ h5 ] Nx[ h5 ] 15.[ g4 ] [ N f6 ] and White has the solid options 16.[ K b1 ] 16.[ N b3 ] and 16.[ N d e2 ] or the aggresive options 16.[ B h6 ] and 16.[ e5 ] however my coach has a materialistic mindset and did not want to sac the pawn.
 [ N x h7 ] , [ B c5 ]  development and threatening to regain the lost material with Qh4! (White loses his knight as he has to protect against the mating threat) my next move stops that but I didn't see Qh4...
 [ b5 ]  [ c x b5 ]  [ a x b5 ]  [ R b2 ] , [ c6 ]  38.Ra4!? [ R x b5 ] 39.[ R x a7 ] and white would have slightly better chances to get into game if black makes mistake.
 [ Q h2 + ] , [ K e1 ]  forced as [ K f3 ] looses to [ R h3 ] #
 [ d x c5 ] , [ B x c5 ]  out comes the bishop
 [ N d6 + ]  [ K e7 ] , [ e6 ]  Pushing on! Black's King is starting to feel exposed.
 [ N c5 ] , [ O-O-O ]  Seems safe for black. But maybe he was just as safe in the center. (Developing the rook with a view to supporting a future advance on the kingside. )
 [ b5 ] , [ B x d5 ]  winning a pawn for free?
 [ e4 ] , [ e5 ]  very important: just play like you always would...
 [ O-O ] , [ h3 ]  The games quoted above went 9.0-0 but this move seems a very good alternative. Sooner or later White will want to play f2-[ f4 ] and he doesn't want to be outflanked by a knight or a bishop coming in at g4.
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ f5 ]  ?! The key move of the controversial Latvian Gambit. Very rarely seen at high levels Black gives up a pawn (and usually much more) for a lead in space and development.
 [ Q b5 ]  [ B x c5 ]  [ Q x c5 ]  [ R a c1 ]  [ Q x d5 ]  [ R x c6 ] , [ d x c6 ]  And I'm back in business.
 [ d x e4 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ B g5 ] , [ Q x d3 ]  No side has played brilliantly so far. This is for the Black the chance to turn the game to his advantage: from now on there will be a target.
 [ Q c7 ]  [ R c5 ]  [ Q c8 ]  [ R f c1 ]  [ Q b7 ] , [ R a5 ]  [ a6 ] now has three attackers and only two defenders.
 [ b6 ]  [ a4 ] , [ c5 ]  Black forgot about the pin but this doesn't cost him any material. Eventually this costs him the game.
 [ B x c4 ] , [ b x c4 ]  A player can not go on the offensive he is tripping over himself! Also I have created a new opening along the b-file.
 [ Q g3 + ]  [ N g4 ] , [ h3 ]  I'll lose [ g4 ] because it's pinned
 [ N h6 + ]  [ K h8 ] , [ Q g8 + ]  and i love this
 [ e4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ d4 ] , [ N f6 ]  This is kmccrate541's characteristic move in the French Defence. Probably White's best response to this is to transform the game into a species of Alekhine's Defence and play 3.e5. In the sequel Black keeps a level pegging. More usual is to contest the centre at once by 2...d5.
 [ N f6 ]  [ R b8 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ R x e8 + ]  [ N x e8 ]  [ a8 = Q ]  [ K f8 ] , [ c5 ]  Idea is to let my LSB in.
 [ K g1 ]  [ B d4 ]  [ Q f4 ]  [ R g6 ]  [ R e2 ]  [ h6 ] , [ Q x f5 ]  32. [ B e3 ] was presumably the best but I understand he wanted to equalize and then salvage what he could by a properly timed [ Q d5 + ] forcing the trade of Queens. As it turns out that choice saddles him with what will be a bleak endgame.
 [ f4 ] , [ Q d5 ]  Really this represent a change of heart but I am not sure where better I could have put it either
 [ e7 ]  [ N e6 ] , [ R e1 ]  The passed pawn pays off. 30.[ N d6 ] [ N c7 ] 31.[ N x b7 ] also wins.
 [ R h g6 ]  [ f4 ] , [ c6 ]  Slow but sure. Push the pawns forward for the finish.
 [ d6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ O-O-O ]  [ O-O ] , [ B c4 ]  Completing my development. Now the middle game begins.
 [ O-O ] , [ d4 ]  White follows up with [ d4 ] attacking my bishop and pawn on e5.
 [ N c6 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ c x d4 ]  Not technically the best because it opens up the [ c3 ] square for the White knight. Better is 5... Qb6.
 [ K f3 ]  [ f4 ] , [ a4 ]  I had overlooked that. 48.[ b4 ] could cause a few problems for Black.
 [ R x d6 ] , [ K c4 ]  The rest was blitz playing for the opponent to lose on time. But fortunately 2 min were enough for me to get the game into the safe mate-harbour.
 [ R e7 ]  [ K x g4 ]  [ R x e4 + ]  [ K f5 ] , [ R e8 ]  I think I would have played 41.[ f3 ] and then 42.c4. But this move is fine.
 [ R h2 ]  [ e7 + ]  [ K e8 ] , [ B e6 ]  ?? Fatal mistake that allowed the draw.
 [ a x b3 ] , [ B x c2 + ]  The time is ripe for a sacrifice!
 [ h3 ]  [ Q b5 ]  [ R c1 ]  [ Q b7 ] , [ K h2 ]  31. [ K h2 ] - now what is King Charles up to?
 [ N b4 ] , [ B e8 ]  Consistent with the previously mentioned plan but fatally relinquishing control of d5.
 [ N e6 ]  [ N b6 ]  [ N x f8 ]  [ R x f8 ] , [ B f4 ]  With the exchange of minor pieces Black has lost the right to castle king-side and my bishop will be perfectly nagging behind his pawn chain and near his future queen-side castle.
 [ d6 ] , [ d4 ]  0-0 is the book move but [ d4 ] pushes the aggressive center attack.
 [ B x f3 ]  [ Q x f3 ] , [ Q d7 ]  Looked like he wanted to castle. [ N d4 ] seemed dangerous but not yet (and even after O-O-O). I was going to fiancetto shore up my positions with my rook before withdrawing the bishop to a safer location (or exchange for the knight if forced to do so).
 [ N e7 ] , [ N d4 ]  Now bringing the steed into the attack. Black has seen enough: 1 - 0
 [ K d4 ]  [ K e6 ] , [ R h3 ]  I saw my planned [ K c4 ] would be punished by Bb5+!
 [ B x e5 ] , [ d x e5 + ]  17. [ d x d5 + ] - he trades off his dsb however and gives me a central and well supported passer - it is also check. This passer is gonna be a killer.
 [ B h4 ]  [ Q d7 ]  [ h3 ]  [ N g6 ]  [ B g3 ] , [ B x g3 ]  finally...
 [ c3 ]  [ b5 ]  [ N b3 ]  [ a5 ]  [ a4 ]  [ b4 ] , [ d4 ]  Just like my other annotated game 'Dodd Q vs Jefferies L' here White plays the move which I'm hoping for(allowing me to attack him on the dark squares). Even worse for White here is that Black now has a good move !
 [ Q x e8 ]  [ R f x e8 ] , [ R d1 ]  I chose this candidate to put pressure on the d square. That will be explained on move 21.
 [ R d e8 ]  [ Q f2 ]  [ R e4 ]  [ R a e1 ]  [ b5 ]  [ a x b5 ] , [ c x b5 ]  29. ...... c x [ b5 ] - the beginnings of a pawn break. I decide to exchange one pair of rooks as I do not like his rook camped on e4. However the pawn break moves ever closer. In hindsight I should have kept my bishop on [ e3 ] or [ f2 ] to protect the foremost pawn should the chain be attacked at the base.
 [ R x f7 ] , [ Q x e2 ]  [ R x f7 ] slightly increases my score according the post-game analysis and [ Q x e2 ] slightly decreases it again - not sure why.
 [ B e3 ]  [ e5 ] , [ d5 ]  It's most of the time better to close the position for white since it blocks the way for the bishop on [ g6 ] and black has less space to move his pieces.
 [ K x g7 ]  [ Q g5 + ] , [ K f8 ]  If white plays ANY move that doesn't deliver a check he is lost.
 [ K c7 ]  [ Q g7 + ]  [ K c6 ]  [ h8 = Q ]  [ Q x h8 ]  [ Q x h8 ]  [ f3 ] , [ a6 ]  The fastest way. Now when the queen arrives on [ f6 ] Black will either have to allow the a pawn to gueen or let his king fall into a mating net.
 [ e5 ] , [ R c7 ]  The point is to double up on the c file. Probably [ R d7 ] was the correct rook move though.
 [ e3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ c3 ]  My opponent is scared by my superior ELO and plays passively but... hey! It happens that he is playing almost as I do (but my dsb is out!).
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ d3 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ Q f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N e2 ]  [ d6 ]  [ h3 ]  [ B e6 ] , [ B x e6 ]  White trades pieces in early phase.
 [ d4 ] , [ g6 ]  Here playing black with the modern opening. It's a blitz game timed 5min + and I'm fight a 2250 elo guy so I thought my chances were pretty bad!
 [ B d6 ] , [ N d5 ]  The final attack begins
 [ N c6 ] , [ a3 ]  Adding defenses to b4.
 [ O-O ] , [ N h6 ]  !? Black prepares the same maneuver again with a twist--rather than play ...[ f6 ] and open the center with his King still vulnerable he holds [ g4 ] against the WQ (after [ N g3 ] Bg5) and also threatens to play ...N[ g4 ] and ...[ h5 ] with a decent attack against the White King (especially after ...O-O-O). If White wants to get rid of the Knight he'll have to cope with an open g-file staring right at his King--and no LSB to defend weaknesses if he's forced to play g2-g3.
 [ f4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ N h7 ]  ...exd would at least let Black play something like ...[ Q c7 ] and ...[ c4 ] with the N back to [ d7 ] where it should already be and then to c5. Decentralizing the N makes things even worse.
 [ a5 ] , [ R e1 ]  [ B a3 ] was no good either as after [ b5 ] the Black attack is going to run through very very quickly
 [ B f5 ] , [ B f4 ]  This was not one common response. I just thought I could put some pressure through the hole. I was thinking of rather doing Qf3.
 [ O-O ] , [ O-O ]  As per plan.
 [ B e2 ]  [ g6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ d3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ c3 ]  [ N e7 ]  [ O-O ] , [ O-O ]  the Hungarian variation in the Sicilian: although the setup does not always run so smoothly; White has no desire to interfere...
 [ N d b5 ] , [ B e7 ]  Black is already lost because of his failure to understand the position.
 [ N x f3 + ]  [ Q x f3 ]  [ c x d6 ] , [ N x d6 ]  with [ N f3 ] still in place [ e x d6 ] would be winning: but this will work too...
 [ K h2 ]  [ Q x g5 ]  [ Q d3 + ]  [ K h8 ]  [ N g6 + ]  [ K g8 ]  [ N e7 + ]  [ K h8 ] , [ N g6 + ]  Here I thought he may have been looking for a draw by repitition
 [ K x g2 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ R d3 ] , [ O-O-O ]  Every trade now plays to white's advantage.
 [ Q f3 ]  [ B c5 + ] , [ K h1 ]  White misses yet another chance to develop her [ B c1 ] - to [ e3 ]  [ R x c2 ]  [ N e3 ]  [ B x e3 ] , [ Q x e3 ]  and now no doubt white didn't want her [ b2 ] pawn to drop
 [ Q a4 + ]  [ N d7 ] , [ N f7 ]  12. ...... [ N f7 ] - that pesky rook stealing knight extricates himself from the corner.
 [ Q x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ] , [ c6 ]  
 [ O-O ] , [ e6 ]  Preventing [ B d5 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ R e8 ] , [ Q d2 ]  Presumably looking at the [ B g5 ] pin I decided to defend this by attacking.
 [ K f4 ]  [ K c6 ]  [ R h2 ] , [ a4 ]  49. ...... [ a4 ] - in for a penny in for a pound at least I now have the full 7 days on my clock!
 [ R a3 ]  [ R c2 ]  [ K g6 ]  [ K e2 ]  [ K f5 ] , [ K e3 ]  Activating my king - now to try and take advantage of the two extra pawns.
 [ Q b8 ] , [ R a3 ]  ...and get this 'problem' taken care of
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ g3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ N g e2 ]  [ a6 ]  [ B g2 ]  [ e6 ]  [ d3 ]  [ N e7 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B h6 ] , [ d5 ]  just playing the Hungarian variation of the Sicilian like I did a million times before; equalizing is [ B x h6 ] [ Q x h6 ] but I had other plans...
 [ Q c2 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ B x f6 ] , [ e4 ]  Confronting my pawn.
 [ K f8 ] , [ R a d1 ]  Preparing to do [ R d8 # ] if Black doesn't intervene.
 [ O-O ] , [ O-O ]  Quick castling on both sides resulted in open game
 [ K d4 ]  [ f5 ]  [ K e5 ]  [ h5 ]  [ a8 = Q ]  [ B x a8 ]  [ K x f5 ]  [ K x d6 ]  [ K g5 ]  [ B f3 ] , [ K h6 ]  Game note: "54.Kh6?? allows me to get my K around to capture his last pawn. He's finished."
 [ a x b4 ]  [ a x b4 ] , [ B a4 ]  I didn't understand the point of this move
 [ N x f3 + ] , [ Q x f3 ]  Black captured on [ f3 ] giving check removing the only defender of the DSB out on g5.
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ B c4 ]  Giucco Piano - also called the Italian game.
 [ Q f4 ] , [ R c8 ]  completing Black's development on move 30! If the White R takes on [ h7 ] Black plans to double on his seventh rank.
 [ Q x d8 ]  [ R a x d8 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ f3 + ] , [ K f1 ]  The more 'tenacious' 23.[ K g1 ] would lose to 23-[ N c3 ] 24.[ b c3 ] - Be5.
 [ e x d5 ]  [ c x d5 ] , [ B b3 ]  Not [ B b5 + ] as this will only force him to develop a pice.
 [ Q e7 + ]  [ K g8 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ R f8 ]  [ g4 ]  [ B d8 ]  [ B x f7 + ]  [ R x f7 ]  [ Q x d8 + ]  [ R f8 ] , [ Q e7 ]  30 [ Q a5 ] and it will be hard for black to stop the queenside pawns since the king's rook has a hard time getting into play.
 [ c5 ]  [ e3 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ B x b8 ] , [ R x b8 ]  White's 4th move gains a tempo. In future cases black has to ready for such cases because King's Indian players tend to favor their Knights.
 [ N e6 ]  [ B x h8 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ B c3 ]  I extricate my bishop.
 [ N f6 ] , [ f3 ]  It looks like [ b e3 ] would also be good here.
 [ B x d5 ] , [ b5 ]  Black can capture [ f2 ] or not. It wouldn't change the course of the game much now. Better to just forge ahead with winning moves rather than chasing a trapped isolated doubled pawn that isn't going anywhere.
 [ R e3 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ d3 ]  [ B e6 ] , [ R a2 ]  Having two pawns less white doesn't have a real plan to attack and got confused gifting a rook (5) for a bishop (3).
 [ Q x g5 + ]  [ Q x g5 ]  [ B x g5 ]  [ N c8 ]  [ K f7 ] , [ N x a7 ]  Now the knigth are out of the game and the last chance to not lost is 34 [ c4 ] 35 [ N b5 ] allows the exchange.
 [ R f e1 ]  [ Q g6 ] , [ Q d3 ]  No such luck it seems. And the queen exchange at this point was not to my favor so I decided to ease my king to a safer place.
 [ R x d6 ] , [ N e c6 ]  He's trying to defend...Well now i'm thinking if 26.[ B x c6 ] would be good...
 [ B e7 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ c6 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ N e8 ] , [ B f1 ]  9. [ B f1 ] - looks passive but is clearing a path for my rook.
 [ N x d5 ] , [ Q x d5 + ]  here it is !!! nice isnt it ?
 [ f x e3 ] , [ R x g3 ]  White resigned. 0-1 29. [ R x g3 ] [ Q x g3 ] 30. [ K h1 ] [ Q x h3 ] 31. [ K g1 ] ([ Q h2 ] [ N g3 ] 32. [ K g1 ] [ R f1 ] 33. [ R x f1 ] Qxf1#) [ N g3 ] 32. [ Q g2 ] [ Q x g2 ] 33. [ K x g2 ] [ N h5 ] leaves black with a knight and connected passed pawns more than enough to win. 29. [ K g1 ] [ Q x h3 ] after which black should give up on mate and trade down to the won endgame mentioned a moment ago. Please feel free to message me if you have comments questions or find any mistakes (I'm sure I left a ton of them - think of them as Easter eggs). :)
 [ b8 = Q ]  [ h6 ] , [ K d6 # ]  Checkmate with a king - or at least a king move. Can you get more stylish than that? Star Chess emitted a tiny beep that could have been the equivalent of a sigh as the little red light on the side switched off. The silicon chips went to sleep...for today. So the score is 1 to fatcat2 0 to the Computers. The next round will be coming soon!
 [ h3 ]  [ B h5 ] , [ N d5 ]  This is an excellent square for the Knight and it takes advantage of the annoying pin on Black's f6-Knight.
 [ B g4 ] , [ N c7 ]  i do not want to lose the [ e6 ] pawn.
 [ N c3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ B g4 ]  5. [ B g4 ] is my first offensive move.
 [ d4 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ B f5 ]  Probably to avoid 6.[ B d3 ] for black doesn't want to play [ c4 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ N b d2 ]  Enabling 8. [ B c4 ] but closing the d file for the queen. Would [ N a3 ] have been better ?
 [ K b7 ]  [ R d5 ]  [ K c6 ]  [ e5 ]  [ f6 ]  [ R d6 + ]  [ K c7 ] , [ R x f6 ]  Now I'm two pawns up and have a passed KP. I feel my chances have improved significantly.
 [ K f2 ]  [ K f8 ]  [ K e3 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ K d4 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ K e5 ]  [ h5 ] , [ K f6 ]  ...and black resigned. What a major break I caught! As I write this I still can't believe it. I finish the 2007 Space City open with 3.5 points and as I record my result I notice that the young lady who I need to win as well still hasn't finished her game. I go over to take a look and her game looks pretty even to me with lots of pieces left on the board for both sides and plenty of time left. I force myself to walk away as not to jinx her and mill around outside with the other smokers for about an hour. Then the door opens and I see her emerge from the playing hall with a big smile. She confirms her win and we exchange high fives. We split the combined 2nd and 3rd place cash and each walked away with $150. Overall a really good feeling:) I hope you have enjoyed these games:) - Thomas
 [ N f3 ] , [ R b2 ]  attacking both bishops
 [ N c6 ] , [ O-O ]  Almost symetrical except for the placement of the king's bishop. The bishop placement becomes critical in a few moves.
 [ g3 ] , [ B g5 ]  Covering the h6-[ c1 ] square - this will be handy later. His bishop now blocks his retreat
 [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ B c4 ]  All book so far
 [ N e5 ]  [ Q c3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N b5 ] , [ R h6 ]  My opponent has increased the value of two of his poorly placed pieces but the scope of his bishops still makes the Black position critical.
 [ R b8 ]  [ g4 ]  [ R c8 ]  [ h4 ]  [ K d7 ]  [ g5 ]  [ K e8 ]  [ K d4 ]  [ R b8 ]  [ h5 ]  [ R b6 ]  [ K c5 ]  [ R b4 ]  [ g6 ]  [ h x g6 ] , [ h x g6 ]  If 50... [ R b7 ] 51. Bf7+.
 [ Q e7 ]  [ Q x f4 ]  [ N x e4 ] , [ R e1 ]  a death wish...
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ g3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ c4 ]  [ c6 ]  [ B g2 ]  [ d5 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ N e4 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ Q d5 ]  [ b3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N x c6 ]  [ Q x c6 ]  [ B a3 ]  [ R d8 ]  [ R c1 ]  [ Q a6 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ e3 ]  [ Q e6 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ B f6 ]  [ R c2 ]  [ b6 ]  [ B b4 ]  [ Q d5 ]  [ R f c1 ]  [ a5 ]  [ B c3 ]  [ R a c8 ]  [ B f1 ]  [ e5 ]  [ B c4 ] , [ Q d7 ]  If white takes the pawn at [ e5 ] black wins it back with 24. ... [ Q x d2 ] 25. [ R x d2 ] [ R x d2 ] 26. [ B x d2 ] Bx[ e5 ] and black doesn't have a double pawn anymore so [ d5 ] is better.
 [ N f5 + ] , [ K h2 ]  First black will exchange and get a piece back. But suppose that weren't so Joe now has a better structure. So while material wise white has the edge I think that in general it's even. When I say that what's important to note is that you don't base things solely on material. For example just because it's even (so the score is 0 doesn't mean it's a draw.) And being a pawn or two up doesn't=a win. For instance there was another game where material wise it was even but one side had a forced win regardless. And resignation from the other wasn't premature as there was an inevitable mating in that position.
 [ R f7 + ] , [ K e8 ]  Now he's out of checks. How will he continue the attack?
 [ B x d4 ]  [ R d3 x d4 ]  [ R x d4 ] , [ R x d4 ]  Black has lost a pawn in the trading sequence but it doesn't matter white has not enough material left to prevent a pawn promotion.
 [ f x e4 ]  [ N x e5 ] , [ Q g5 ]  This is the poisoned pawn variation of Latvian gambit the sharpest opening ever!
 [ R f g8 ] , [ N f5 ]  24. [ N f5 ] - the killer there is no way I can avoid losing Glenda except by copping Old Matey. I therefore resigned on the grounds of ruinous loss of material as per this analysis. Variation A 24. [ N f5 ] [ Q f8 ] 25. [ R h6 + ] [ Q x h6 ] 26. [ Q x h6 # ] Variation B 24. [ N f5 ] [ Q g5 ] 25. [ R h6 + ] [ Q x h6 ] 26. [ Q x h6 # ] Variation C 24. [ N f5 ] [ B x f5 ] 25. Rf1[ x f5 ] [ R h8 ] 26. [ R x h5 + ] [ K g8 ] 27. [ R g5 ] [ Q x g5 ] 28. [ Q x g5 + ] His mating attack was overwhelming. Well played Ken.
 [ h6 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ N x f6 ] , [ f3 ]  bhidragon: OK so I want to get a little esoteric here and touch on a way of looking at the game of chess that is new to me. Hang with me a little while I touch on the highlights of this way of thinking. Let's start by looking at the first moves of the Spanish and Italian games. 1. [ e4 ] [ e5 ] I'll make the claim that these moves are understandable to even novices. They grab a piece of the center and open development lines for the bishops. 2. [ N f3 ] [ N c6 ] Attacks and defends while putting more pressure on the center. This resulting position is understandable! We know what each piece is doing. You can play these moves comfortably knowing that they make sense and form the basis of a good position. However let’s take a look at the start of the Indian defenses. 1. [ d4 ] [ N f6 ] 2. [ c4 ] [ e6 ] I’ll claim that these moves are not as intuitively correct as the first couple of moves in the Spanish. To the untrained eye they do not really answer the fundamental requirements of a good opening position. So why play them? We play the first few moves of the Indian openings because we understand (have been taught or learned through experience) the pros and cons of the future EVOLVING positions. Rather than looking at a specific position at a specific point in time we are looking at the POTENTIAL of the position to evolve along certain paths. Let’s look at our Najdorf position. White is setting up an attack on the King-side. How should Black THINK ABOUT his response? First off let’s not invent a checklist. Let’s just consider things. What are the general objectives for Black in the Najdorf? Control of the center and attacking chances against White’s Queen-side especially using the half-open c-file and speed. So your central pawns are probably in good shape. The question you have to answer is who has the advantage in speed? Can White’s attack do real damage before Black can get a significant attack going. That should guide how you approach the next few moves. thewrongreason: I like this new way. For me there was always something different that I just wasn't used to which would take me off guard and I now realize that it is because of how a position evolves which can be sudden. With that there's a lot that I didn't realize right here which shows how little I know. As far as who has the advantage it's very hard for me to guess. I'm thinking that white has a very small edge because of how things evolved with the a pawn. That would've been easy for me to overlook the attack but before my last move my thought process was that if I didn't do something you could sac your B and get that devastating. With that I think that white can do quite a bit of damage before black develops an attack. And I'm thinking about the pawn chain that you now have with your last move. I'm just not quite sure what to do as I don't have a candidate move to consider yet in this position. But I'll really have to give it thought.
 [ R d1 ]  [ R x d1 + ] , [ K x d1 ]  All the really strong pieces are now gone.
 [ N g f6 ] , [ d3 ]  Preventing .....[ N e4 ] and a spot for white's knight .... 7. Nbd2.
 [ Q x d6 ]  [ Q x d6 + ] , [ K x f7 ]  The king is stalemated so every check is checkmate...
 [ d4 ] , [ N c4 + ]  Even better now I can trade it off the board.
 [ K c5 ]  [ R a6 ] , [ R e2 ]  I think allowing this pawn to drop is a big mistake as it is going to make defending much easier. However it will be hard to defend the pawn and deal with my advancing e pawn as well.
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B b4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ b6 ]  [ c x b6 ]  [ a x b6 ] , [ a3 ]  Don't think I saw that the bishop didn't have to move :-) No harm though.
 [ R e8 ]  [ g3 ]  [ e5 ]  [ d5 ] , [ N e7 ]  This move offered some chances to harass the white queen.
 [ f x g4 ] , [ g x h4 ]  This got complicated awfully fast. Black is threatening to win both White pawns and lines to the WK are about to open. Look through the main variations: White suddenly has no clear way to maintain material equality! (A) 13.[ g x h4 ] [ B x h2 + ] 14.[ K h1 ] [ h x g4 ] looks terrible. (B) 13.[ g x h5 ] [ h x g3 ] [1] 14.[ h x g3 ] [ R x h5 ] or [2] 14.[ K h1 ] [ R x h5 ] or [3] 14.[ Q d3 ] [ R x h5 ] don't seem to be any better and at any moment Black will castle long and bring the other Rook into play on [ g8 ] or h8. So what is White to do?
 [ h4 ] , [ g4 ]  Calling White's bluff and inviting the attack on f7.
 [ B e3 ] , [ f4 ]  ?! Black sacrifices a second pawn to open roads to the WK.
 [ d x e5 ] , [ Q x e5 ]  I think I'm looking better here. I'm now threatening his [ b2 ] pawn. There's not much left of his center pawn structure now. I have a lot of space on the king side. My bishop is blocked but is also providing needed support for my [ d5 ] pawn.
 [ R a1 ]  [ d7 ]  [ R a8 ]  [ K e5 ]  [ R d8 ]  [ K e6 ]  [ K f8 ]  [ R f2 + ]  [ K g7 ]  [ K e7 ]  [ R a8 ]  [ d8 = Q ]  [ R x d8 ] , [ K x d8 ]  Now it won't be long.
 [ K f3 ] , [ a4 ]  'a' pawn puts pressure
 [ N x e4 ]  [ O-O ] , [ e5 ]  After I castled this move became a mistake due to the surprising 13.Re1.
 [ B f8 ]  [ Q h3 ] , [ Q c7 ]  Trying to create queen side play.
 [ B b7 ]  [ d4 ]  [ Q g5 ] , [ a3 ]  This seems like a wasted move.
 [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ c3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ d6 ]  [ h3 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ d3 ]  it's a bad placement for the d pawn in this kind of structures both the d and the b pawn can rapidly became week and be captured
 [ f x g5 ] , [ f x g5 ]  Black can force a passed pawn now but can he Queen it?
 [ b5 ] , [ B d7 ]  for a moment at least !
 [ c x d6 ] , [ N e4 ]  Centering that N where it is stronger and also attacks both queen and [ d6 ] and at the same time defends f2.
 [ B d6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ O-O ] , [ N b5 ]  We are now out of the opening.
 [ R x h6 ] , [ B d5 ]  White should complete his development first.
 [ R x c2 ] , [ h5 ]  27.[ R x c2 ] [ Q x c2 ] and it is hard to see how White can reinforce his attack. White plans to lever open at least one of the g- or h-files.
 [ d5 ] , [ N f3 ]  So it is a Gruenfeld...
 [ g x h3 ]  [ f6 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ R g8 ]  [ B x h6 ] , [ a5 ]  6 points up and then my momentum starts to slow. There is never any danger of losing the game for white but for some reason finding holes is harder than I feel it should be...considering my opponent seems to be moving without rhyme or reason...
 [ B x c5 ] , [ B h5 ]  Another blunder the sacrifice is easily repelled.
 [ R f4 ] , [ R e5 ]  Menacing 30. ...[ R g5 + ] 31.[ R g4 ] [ R x g4 # ] Unavoidable except if white had sacrified his queen by 30. [ Q e2 ] [ R g5 + ] 31. [ R g4 ] [ R x g4 ] 32. [ Q x g4 ] [ Q x g4 + ] and black would be one queen and 2 pawns ahead. So that white submits.
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ] , [ Q f3 ]  Out with the queen already? Ambitious!
 [ R e6 + ]  [ K a5 ]  [ N b7 + ] , [ N x b7 ]  I thought that I had temporarly gotten myself out of trouble. I couldn't calculate everything but thought that if I got out with the monarch in anyway moved he'd mate. By playing this it appeared that I was in better shape. But it's coming one way or another with no to defend against it.
 [ O-O ] , [ B d6 ]  Developing the bishop so I can play Ne7.
 [ N c3 ]  [ Q d6 ] , [ Q x d6 ]  I accepted this queens-exchange.. For my feeling I had the better position. Those two extra pawns from my opponent could be neutralized by my knight.. (at least that's what I hoped for)
 [ Q x d8 + ] , [ K x d8 ]  white chooses to further simplify the game by exchanging queens
 [ K g3 ]  [ R b7 ]  [ R h1 ]  [ K f6 ]  [ R h6 + ] , [ K e5 ]  60. ...... [ K e5 ] - Henry makes for the queenside where the two passers are.
 [ Q g4 + ]  [ f5 ] , [ Q x f5 # ]  
 [ N f3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e3 ]  [ c5 ]  [ c3 ] , [ N c6 ]  Now happily in my comfort zone looking for a sensible way to develop further.
 [ N x b6 ]  [ d x e3 ]  [ B b5 + ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B x c6 + ]  [ b x c6 ]  [ Q a5 ]  [ e x f2 + ]  [ K x f2 ] , [ N f6 ]  Uh oops again. Remember rule 4--can you prevent your opponent acquiring a HVP? Because while PxN is right out (QxRa8+) [ R d8 ] might stave off disaster a few more moves.
 [ Q x e5 ] , [ R e1 ]  This is an annoying pin. It would be tragic if it wasn't for...
 [ O-O ]  [ Q b6 ]  [ R a b8 ] , [ Q d4 ]  forced: after [ N f5 ] Black is still in control; but Whites' clock ran out right at the last move...
 [ B f6 + ] , [ K h7 ]  Blacks position is a total disaster! To add injury to insult Kasparov can now execute a tactical breakthrough
 [ f4 ] , [ h6 ]  Creating a retreat if it proves needed.
 [ R f e1 ] , [ N f6 ]  Literally - my strategy here was PUSH! Get some space.
 [ N e6 + ] , [ K c6 ]  I move my knight back up [ e6 ] checking the king who moves to c6.
 [ O-O ]  [ B b7 ] , [ d5 ]  Tempting and topical. Better alternatives was probably 13. [ Q e2 ] [ N a5 ] 14. [ R a d1 ] [ R e8 ] 15. [ R f e1 ] with long lasting initiative for white.
 [ N a6 ] , [ B h6 ]  Proud of this shot even though the computer programs don't rate it. EA. Interesting is the gameknot engine changes the position rating from+0.79 down to +0.39 after 24.[ B h6 ] and Houdini rates similar. From exhilaration to the taste of ashes. My masterpiece is flawed.18.[ Q g4 ] =0.78 is preferred by both engines.
 [ N c7 ] , [ N f7 ]  13. [ N f7 ] - I feel sufficiently developed to execute the knight fork and try and restore material equality.
 [ B d2 ]  [ Q x a2 ] , [ B b5 + ]  now white will try to trap my queen i have to be very carefull
 [ K d2 ] , [ R x d5 ]  Now it is safe to munch the pawn!
 [ R d7 ]  [ e4 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ N x e6 ]  [ R x d1 ]  [ R x d1 ] , [ f x e6 ]  21... [ R x e6 ] is a better choice. Here white exceeded the time control and lost. What should happen is ...
 [ B e2 ] , [ B g7 ]  There's the fianchetto.
 [ N c3 ]  [ N x c3 ] , [ Q x c3 ]  Here Black is already losing. It may seem a slightly worse position but the c7-pawn is the burden here. After Bisguier moved him hell was unleashed. Note the features of the board however the e-file is lost on Black most notably [ [ e5 ] ] and the repercussion of a fork on [ [ e5 ] ] is brutal. Also Black can't castle thanks to the pin on [ e7 ] and this tied down piece means that White is in essence a piece up.
 [ N g5 ]  [ B x g5 ] , [ h4 ]  he pushes my bishop back
 [ N e3 ]  [ R b4 ]  [ N x g4 ] , [ R x e4 ]  OK I believe the endgame will be easy now
 [ N b2 ] , [ Q e5 ]  Now any knight move is met by qa1++. k[ [ c1 ] ] leads to severe loss of material. It looks like [ [ c3 ] ] is the only move. After [ [ c3 ] ] bx[ [ c3 ] ] n[ d3 ] [ c2 + ] it looks like I have a strong attack. [ K x c2 ] loses to q[ b2 + + ] and k[ [ c1 ] ] q[ a1 + ] k[ d2 ] cxd1=q is winning.
 [ N d e5 ]  [ e x f7 + ]  [ N x f7 ]  [ B h4 ] , [ h6 ]  [ h6 ] prevents Ng5. The pinned [ N f7 ] is really a problem for Black.
 [ a x b5 ] , [ N e7 ]  Now if 20. [ b x a6 ] [ B b5 ] 21. [ Q d1 ] (21. Qe3?! [ N f5 ] 22. [ Q f4 ] Bd3) [ B d3 ] leaves the rook nowhere to hide. 22. [ R b2 ] [ Q x a6 ] ([ B c3 ] right away allows [ b4 ] which is trickier.) 23. [ K h2 ] [ B c3 ]  [ B x b5 ]  [ Q e1 ]  [ R c2 ] , [ K h2 ]  22. [ R b2 ] [ R c7 ] 23. [ K h2 ] [ R f c8 ] 24. [ Q h1 ] [ B d3 ] [To prepare Qa1.] 25. [ N c4 ] (25. [ N b1 ] [ Q a1 ] 26. [ B d2 ] [ Q x b2 ] (26... [ B a3 ] 27. [ N x a3 ] [ Q x b2 ] 28. [ R a1 ] [ B e4 ] 29. [ B e3 ] [ N f5 ] 30. [ Q e1 ] Nxe3)) 25... [ d x c4 ] 26. [ b x c4 ] [ B x c4 ]  [ Q a2 ]  [ R b2 ] , [ R x b2 ]  White resigns. If play continues ...
 [ K g8 ]  [ g4 ]  [ K f7 ]  [ K g3 ]  [ B d8 ] , [ h4 ]  50. [ h4 ] - at last he moves a pawn to h4. I think he is trying to penetrate with his own king!
 [ K g1 ]  [ d x e3 ]  [ Q x e3 ] , [ Q g3 ]  He can now capture my h pawn without penalty. He should have taken it already on move 24.
 [ K x f2 ] , [ N x e4 + ]  10. FREE MOVE for me. A few favorite tatics of mine come out in this game...the discovered check is one of the best...I knew I had a free move but wasn't exactly sure what to do with it...I figure maybe I get one more point back.... [personal scared level = HIGH] I still haven't removed the Rook/Queen fork...and I know I can't keep him in perpetual check....or can I..... :) 10 [ N x e4 ] or [ N g4 ] were the only moves that saved my Rook. Just a discoved check wouldn't of saved my dear friend...and we all know how I love my Rooks.
 [ Q x h6 + ]  [ K g8 ]  [ N h5 ] , [ B e8 ]  Alas 45...[ N c3 ] was black's last try to defend with a plus 7.5 score for white. Mate in four two ways to get there. I choose the easiest.
 [ R f d1 ]  [ N b d7 ] , [ R a c1 ]  It soon becomes apparent that this rook is better placed on [ B1 ] and that this move simply loses time.
 [ B x d3 ] , [ Q x d3 ]  Off course not with the c-pawn. Taking it with the queen is much better.
 [ B d6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ N d7 ]  Just getting my pieces out.
 [ Q x a2 ]  [ R c1 ]  [ B e6 ] , [ h3 ]  ? Now white's attack is beginning to stall. White had a better try namely 26.h4! for when black is sooner or later going to be mated.
 [ a8 = Q ]  [ R x a8 ]  [ R x a8 + ]  [ B f8 ]  [ B b4 ] , [ h6 ]  stubborn as hell: that is what you get with beer in the sun...
 [ N g4 ]  [ K g8 ] , [ N x f6 + ]  No perpetual draw any more. GK engine recommends to place the knight in [ h6 ] to keep me under pressure.
 [ f5 ] , [ g6 ]  Black resigns mate can't be stopped.
 [ e4 ]  [ h5 ]  [ R h1 ]  [ g4 ] , [ K e8 ]  I didn't fear black's passed e pawn but this gave it to me for free.
 [ R x e5 ] , [ f x e5 ]  Only pawns left...
 [ Q x d2 ] , [ c x d4 ]  still pawns to take
 [ N x e4 ] , [ N x e7 # ]  
 [ N e4 ] , [ Q h5 ]  Yes my Q can be harassed. But his lsb is trapped in for a couple of moves and the dsb is also far from my Q.
 [ b3 ]  [ R d8 ]  [ Q a7 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ Q e3 ]  [ h6 ]  [ N h4 ]  [ B c8 ]  [ f4 ]  [ a5 ]  [ f5 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ Q d8 ]  [ g3 ]  [ Q d5 ]  [ g4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ K f2 ]  [ a4 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ B b7 ]  putting pressure on [ f3 ]  [ h4 ]  [ f6 ] , [ e6 ]  not sure what white's after here... he's got a crisis brewing by his king and chooses to advance the pawns
 [ B d3 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ Q f2 ]  [ O-O ] , [ g4 ]  14. [ g4 ] - I now start a pawn storm on the kingside. It proves to be a pity that Glenda isn't occupying [ g2 ] already.
 [ B c6 ] , [ K d4 ]  Note that with [ b6 ] my king cannot penetrate. Only with great difficulty I could have loosen his defence. But he played...
 [ N c4 + ] , [ K b1 ]  Barely better is [ K a1 ] since I am not checked on the next move. (Well I guess it's no better at all.)
 [ R a d1 ]  [ K h8 ] , [ g4 ]  interesting. tjere is a majority of white pices in the center.
 [ K b8 ] , [ B g2 ]  I planned here to retake the [ e4 ] pawn after the exchanges and thanks to the check these exchanges will leave me with a pawn in [ d6 ] and two well placed rooks to defend it. It can be an interesting way to overcome the -1 pawn I am actually.
 [ B d5 ] , [ R d8 ]  Black is now willing to trade down to remove the defender of g2.
 [ B x d5 ] , [ R x d5 ]  Problem is solved. My only price would be [ f7 ] but this is affordable.
 [ N f6 ] , [ N f3 ]  Unusual. I figured I might as well take the pawn as go straight into the Two Knights' Defence by transposition (3. ... Nc6).
 [ Q h4 + ] , [ K g1 ]  This is a mistake. [ B h3 ] ugly as it is is better here.
 [ O-O ] , [ N h6 ]  Black tries to free herself.
 [ Q e3 ]  [ B d5 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ c x d5 ] , [ R x d5 ]  Rxd5? is probably bad. Instead 24 Qxa7! seems to leave white with a winning position.
 [ R x d8 + ] , [ N x d8 ]  ...and I get the other rook exchange. OK my knight landed back on its starting rank but I am ahead on material despite having fewer long-range pieces in the endgame where no piece is worth more than three points and I am trying to weaken his counterplay.
 [ N b4 ] , [ B b2 + ]  Time to bring this puppy home. I had to keep an eye on the clock.
 [ B c4 ] , [ e6 ]  White might sac on [ f7 ] and put massive pressure down the f-file.
 [ Q e3 ] , [ Q g2 ]  protecting the [ e4 ] pawn but not quite the best move
 [ K x b3 ] , [ K g5 ]  He resigned. I would queen my pawn and he would be lost.
 [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ] , [ Q x d5 ]  I think [ e x d5 ] is better here.
 [ R h c1 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ Q d5 ]  [ Q x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ R x a8 ] , [ R c7 ]  This will hardly be a positional win... I begun think about draw. How to force a draw here?
 [ R x h7 ] , [ R d2 ]  But after taking I go after one of his pawns knowing that one will fall since one of them is confined to [ f2 ] and one is lost because of my [ R a4 ] due the high level of mobility with my position.
 [ K f7 ]  [ d6 ]  [ K e8 ] , [ d7 + ]  38. [ [ d7 ] + ] - I now realise that if the BK blocks my [ d7 ] pawn Fou Lenoir will kick him out of [ d8 ] with a check on h4. This spells Glendadoom for Andy's king.
 [ B b1 ]  [ g6 ]  [ h4 ] , [ Q c7 ]  Better would be [ Q d2 ] with winning the b2-pawn. I wanted to play against the King and so I didnot saw this.
 [ Q h1 + ] , [ B h3 ]  If 73... P-[ N8 ] (Q) 74 Q-[ R5 ] ch! forces a draw.
 [ R x d8 ]  [ R x d8 ] , [ Q e1 ]  ? In demoralizing positions blunders come easily like this natural-looking one. White can still bail out and minimize the carnage (again as at move 27) with 29. Nd5.
 [ K d7 ] , [ K c5 ]  My king seems to be better than his now
 [ b x a5 ]  [ N x e4 ] , [ d x e4 ]  this is Avery terrible move because it allows the black Queen to attack King side. i was looking for this position when i moved my night to [ e4 ] square
 [ B b5 + ] , [ K f8 ]  This move is virtually forced after black's mistaken bishop b7. White has a definite advantage in this position and I studied the board for a while sensing that it was crucial to maintain the developing attack.
 [ N b d7 ]  [ e4 ] , [ b4 ]  my knight looks much better on C5 anyway
 [ K e7 ] , [ R a d1 ]  Now 22. ... [ R c7 ] is the only move to defend the [ B [ d7 ] ] but Black is pinned every which way. 23. [ Q f3 ] ratchets up the tension to breaking point - [ Q e8 ] (to stop Qh5) might be met with exchanging twice on [ d7 ] and simply replacing the [ N e5 ] and [ R d1 ] with their colleagues. Instead Black self-destructs.
 [ h3 + ]  [ K x h3 ]  [ N g5 + ]  [ K g2 ] , [ B h6 ]  Now White is ahead four pawns. The endgame is easily won but exchanges will need to be made to reduce complications.
 [ B f4 ] , [ Q d7 ]  Again my queen is harassed. She cannot leave the 7th rank or the [ [ f7 ] ] pawn will fall (white's bishop blocks the attack so the queen has more options right now but a single move by the bishop such as [ B x h6 ] and white is back in business on the [ [ f7 ] ] pawn). The straight jacket is so uncomfortable!
 [ e6 ] , [ B d2 ]  12. [ B d2 ] - development and clearing the decks for castling either side.
 [ B g3 ] , [ g5 ]  mmm lets put the King away
 [ N e5 ]  [ Q f1 ]  [ R b6 ]  [ R b1 ] , [ g6 ]  Now black will open the position against the weak white king-The advanced pawns are a perfect contact point. As you can see the pawns are great for attacking but bad for defense in so many ways.
 [ R d3 ] , [ R x d5 ]  Surprisingly this is forced. The threat was 42 ...Nc3+. Moving the rook away e.g. 42. [ R b7 ] allows 42. ...[ R d1 + ] 43. [ K c2 ] [ N e3 + ] picking up the other rook whilst 42. [ K c1 ] walks into a snap mate after 42. ...[ R a1 + ] 43. [ K c2 ] [ N b4 ] mate.
 [ B d3 ]  [ B b7 ] , [ B e2 ]  He offered a draw. I accepted. Why? Well it looked like an equal position to me and the draw made my rating go +4.5 and his -30.5! What do you think people? Is this position equal?
 [ Q x b6 ] , [ R d c8 ]  Giving some back-up for his knight; a normal move but quiet inactive for black..
 [ f x e5 ]  [ N x e3 ]  [ Q c1 ] , [ N x f1 ]  A queen and a knight for a bishop and a rook?! Well just to lose a knight is not that bad finally!
 [ b5 ]  [ h x g6 ] , [ h x g6 ]  I though he would have taken with the [ [ [ [ [ f7 ] ] ] ] ] pawn. Here one of the variants I found interesting: 16. [ N [ [ h4 ] ] ] [ N [ [ [ f6 ] ] ] ] 17. [ N x [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ g6 ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] f7[ x [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ g6 ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] 18. Q[ x [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ g6 ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] [ Q [ e8 ] ] 19.

 [ d x e4 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ N x f6 + ] , [ B x f6 ]  Now white is a little better again.
 [ Q c3 ] , [ N g4 ]  ?? And this is where Mary blunder. She did have an exchanging pieces in mind but now I can win her Rook before that and without compensate. Much better would've been to complete her development at once.
 [ d4 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ d6 ]  in an effort to play [ e5 ] to start undermining the central pawns
 [ d3 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ B d2 ]  [ B g5 ] is the text book move but I wanted to develope my bishop to where I could use it to attack either side of the board. I am fairly new to this sport so I do not know if this is a strong move.
 [ f x e4 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ B x h3 ]  [ R e1 ] , [ e6 ]  I remember a Bobby Fischer blunder where a pawn cuts off the bishop's escape. Don't have an opportunity to do that just yet. https://www.chess.com/video/player/fischer-blunders-a-bishop----or-did-he
 [ R x c3 + ]  [ K b4 ]  [ R c2 ] , [ a4 ]  Ignoring the threat to my kingside pawns to push my passed pawn
 [ K g5 ]  [ b4 ]  [ c x b4 ]  [ a x b4 ]  [ K f4 ] , [ K d4 ]  Not letting the WK get in front of the queenside pawns.
 [ N c3 ] , [ N f6 ]  I then thought whilst his queen is out I would start attacking it
 [ N x c6 ]  [ b x c6 ]  [ B x e4 ] , [ Q d6 ]  Here White started paying attention to sacrifices on g3.
 [ R x d7 ]  [ B x d7 ] , [ f6 ]  Another !. Black has a winning material advantage (even two Rooks vs. Queen is generally better) but White has created a mating net.
 [ f x e4 ] , [ N f4 ]  An important move to keep white at my whim.
 [ B h5 ] , [ b4 ]  With the kingside about to explode [ b4 ] is another wasted move. It does prepare for [ B b2 ] but the long diagonal is blocked and the bishop currently protects the soon-to-be critical [ g5 ] square. [ B e3 ] is better as it protects d4.
 [ Q e2 ]  [ R f d8 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ B g4 ] , [ B x f6 ]  I wasn't too afraid of my pawns being doubled - I felt on an open board like this the bishops are better than knights and the doubled pawns give an element of central control. In particular [ e5 ] is protected by a pawn now.
 [ Q d6 ]  [ B e3 ] , [ B d8 ]  I dont know why he made this move but this is the moved that killed him in end.
 [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ B e3 ] , [ N e5 ]  Inaccuracy I believe. What is the purpose or threat of this move? A common plan here is a6-Qc7-b6-[ B b7 ] making the 'hedgehog'
 [ e4 ] , [ e5 ]  We open up our kings' pawns to free our queens or kingside bishops...
 [ R d3 d6 ]  [ Q g7 ]  [ R d1 d2 ] , [ e4 ]  Black first limits the influence of white's bishop then goes pawn grabbing
 [ B x f6 ]  [ g x f6 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ N f4 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N h5 ] , [ f5 ]  A bishop is doing the job of a Pawn. That is easier to break down as I can just swap material and open the file up.
 [ Q x c4 ] , [ R x e8 + ]  he has only one move
 [ K f3 ]  [ f x e5 ]  [ f x e5 ] , [ B g5 ]  Finally activating my bishop.
 [ Q x f6 ]  [ c x d5 ] , [ e x d5 ]  Black gains open space and the C8 Bishop is alive again...
 [ b4 + ] , [ K a4 ]  Very very dangerous. I bet on my calculations.
 [ h4 ] , [ R d6 + ]  I bring my rook back into play.
 [ d x e5 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ B b7 ] , [ B f3 ]  Offering up a forced set of trades.
 [ N f6 ] , [ N x e5 ]  Though it's not much of a miscalculation black may have been better off with 11. ... [ N x f3 ] . As played 11. ... [ N f6 ] allows white to double up the black pawns on the e-file.
 [ Q d7 ] , [ N e1 ]  White thinks that his dsb is more valuable than my knight. That can be true but I know that in the endgame a bishop's pair IS a lot. And this looks to be a two sides pawns' endgame for sure. No way.
 [ c6 ]  [ e3 ] , [ Q b6 ]  4....... [ Q b6 ] - putting the [ b2 ] pawn under the hammer. I defend with 5. Rb1.
 [ R e1 ]  [ R a7 ]  [ R d d1 ]  [ R a e7 ]  [ c3 ]  [ N g5 ]  [ N x g5 ]  [ f x g5 ]  [ N f1 ]  [ f4 ]  [ B c1 ]  [ g4 ]  [ Q b1 ] , [ Q h5 ]  Black need to take its Queen off the diagonal c1-[ h6 ] threatened by the White Bishop
 [ R c5 ]  [ B b4 ]  [ R x c4 ] , [ e5 ]  the idea is nicely prepared from Svenne13. He knows that [ Q h1 ] could not win the [ e1 ] rook.
 [ B x e5 ] , [ d x e5 ]  Nothing clear came after 16.[ R x h6 ]  [ K f1 ] , [ Q x e5 ]  Now white really needs to do something strong in order to win the game. Playing defensively thinking about [ f5 ] does not seem like an alternative.
 [ Q h3 + ] , [ K f3 ]  [ K h5 ] gets the King trapped after [ K h7 ]  [ K e3 ]  [ h x g3 ]  [ K d2 ] , [ g2 ]  White Resigns with the g-pawn certain to queen. Lesson to learn Don't exchange when down on material
 [ Q h6 ] , [ R g6 ]  Alternative variation: 12... [ R x g2 ] 13. [ B f4 ] [ Q d4 ] 14. [ B e3 ] [ Q e5 ] 15. O-O-O [(Kmoch)]
 [ N f6 ] , [ d x e5 ]  Black hasn't castled and I have so I want to open up the centre quickly before he gets a chance to finish developing his pieces..
 [ N d7 ] , [ B d3 ]  Another piece moves into position with tempo.
 [ K d8 ]  [ K d4 ]  [ K e8 ]  [ R h3 ]  [ K f8 ]  [ N d3 ]  [ R e8 ] , [ e5 ]  51. [ e5 ] - another decisive pawn break this exchange is virtually forced.
 [ R x e5 ] , [ B d3 ]  contesting the center
 [ K h2 ]  [ R x d1 ] , [ Q h5 # ]  a nice end for a great game. any comments will be in place. enjoy.
 [ R c1 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ B b1 ]  [ N c5 ] , [ N e1 ]  An error leaving the KP en prise.
 [ d6 ] , [ B b2 ]  I thought about attacking [ c5 ] with 12.[ [ b4 ] ] but 4 moves down it didn't seem to pan out in my favor. 12.[ [ b4 ] ] cx[ [ b4 ] ] 13. rx[ [ b4 ] ] qa5... Opponent Pieces being developed while they are focusing on my [ c3 ] knight.
 [ Q x d4 ]  [ Q x d6 ] , [ R a d1 ]  Stacking begins. He should do the same but the threat of my Knight scared him away I guess so he moves...
 [ R e1 ]  [ Q x g5 ]  [ R x e4 ] , [ R f2 ]  How will white defend [ g2 ] now? I spotted this when proposing the R exchange. (Thanks "my favourite tactic trainer I owe you one!")
 [ Q f7 ] , [ R g5 ]  ! White's 26th and 27th moves set up a crushing sacrifice on h5. For instance 27...[ R h8 ] 28.Rgxh5! [ g x h5 ] 29.[ R x h5 + ] [ K g7 ] 30.[ R g5 + ] [ K f6 ] 31.[ Q e5 + ] [ K e7 ] 32.Rg7.
 [ h6 ] , [ R f1 ]  (!) A brave sacrifice. Right now I am hoping I can pull through on this one.
 [ N c5 ]  [ R e3 ]  [ R e7 ]  [ R f3 + ]  [ K g7 ]  [ R c3 ]  [ R e4 ]  [ B d1 ] , [ R d4 ]  Botvinnik: This move gave me new heart. By 38...R-K8! White's defenses could have been completely disorganized. Fischer: After 38...R-[ K8 ] White plays simply 39 B-B3.
 [ N f3 ] , [ N x d3 ]  Black has just played 3 consecutive moves to swap this N off and open a file for my other rook.
 [ B b3 ] , [ B d6 ]  11 .. Bd6?? 12 [ R d1 ] threatening black's queen and bishop
 [ R f e8 ]  [ R d c1 ]  [ B d6 ] , [ h3 ]  So I play positionally right now.
 [ N x e4 ] , [ B x e4 ]  What now for Black? White has the bishop pair as well as an extra pawn. 19....[ f5 ] looks aggressive but to my mind rather weakens Black's K-side without achieving a great deal. Instead I sought counterplay on the other wing. It has to be said prospects didn't look promising there either.
 [ g4 ] , [ Q d1 ]  Oops I left my [ c3 ] pawn hanging. Better was [ Q d1 ]  [ B x d5 ] , [ e x d5 ]  This was black's critical mistake. This allows for a nice juicy open e file for white to exploit.
 [ B x f3 ]  [ B x f3 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ O-O ]  [ Q c2 ]  [ a6 ] , [ a4 ]  Before going on with the king-side attack White decide to stop the possible breakthrough on the queen-side. Unfortunately this weakens control over [ b4 ] square which Black knights find very attractive.
 [ h6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ c6 ]  [ R d1 + ]  [ K c7 ]  [ a3 ]  [ a5 ]  [ b3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ f3 ]  [ b6 ]  [ c4 ] , [ B c5 ]  WT can trade Bishops here. But then the prior remarks about the K-side pawns would not apply to those on the Q-side as well. And WT would have a pawn on [ b3 ] to defend from BL attacking it with his open file and potentially would end up having to tie his pieces to that task. Which makes no headway toward winning. But overall this is a very drawish looking game irregardless.
 [ B b1 ] , [ R x a3 ]  White moves LB to [ b1 ] attacking my rook at [ a2 ] which I move to [ a3 ] and capture the DB which has been sitting on this square for the whole game since being developed.
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ] , [ d4 ]  Old Phil.
 [ R g3 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ N f4 ] , [ N e4 ]  Trying to allow the Queen out in the hope of relieving pressure.
 [ Q h5 ] , [ f5 ]  Giving the K an escape route. I have to be very careful about these escape routes because I've lost soundly by swearing all was done.
 [ e x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ] , [ B b5 ]  Perhaps [ B b3 ] would have been safer. I could have continued with [ a6 ] and [ b5 ] but the bishop would not have been completely trapped so I went for something more aggressive.
 [ Q e5 + ] , [ K d7 ]  Black decides not to take the pawn.
 [ B x f6 ] , [ N a4 ]  Now I'll try to make use of the mobility of my knight among those pawn islands.
 [ N x c3 ] , [ b x c3 ]  The exchange of knights strengthens the white centre still further. Black generally attacks White's centre with ...[ c5 ] and ...[ B g7 ] often followed by moves such as ...[ Q a5 ] ...[ c x d4 ] ...[ B g4 ] and ...Nc6. White often uses his big centre to launch an attack against Black's king.
 [ Q d3 ] , [ Q b7 ]  Computer prefers [ Q b5 ] but I really don't want to exchange queens in this position!
 [ N g f3 ] , [ B x f2 + ]  the sac is there now.
 [ Q c2 ]  [ Q g6 ]  [ B d2 ] , [ c5 ]  Trying to open the Queen side a bit to make my rooks active. Note that right now [ b5 ] would not be good as white can simply reply [ c5 ] completely lokcing the queen side
 [ N a3 ] , [ f3 ]  Opening up more space around the White King.
 [ d5 ]  [ B g2 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ d3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B e7 ]  [ b3 ]  [ O-O ] , [ e4 ]  ?! This allows me to forward my centre pawns one rank and liberate my light-squared bishop. It also makes his fianchettoed bishop bad. I can say that the bishop on [ g2 ] won't play any role whatsoever in this game. Unfortunately my opponent didn't need it!
 [ N x d4 ]  [ B x d4 ]  [ b6 ] , [ g4 ]  Shredder says that I should have played 13.[ [ e5 ] ] here giving the line 13.[ [ e5 ] ] dx[ [ e5 ] ] 14.Bx[ [ e5 ] ] [ B c6 ] 15.[ Q f4 ] [ N d7 ] 16.[ B x g7 ] [ K g7 ] in which I've accomplished my goal of trading off the dark square bishops with a good position.
 [ B f3 ] , [ h6 ]  Time to drive away that pesky knight. Maybe even steamroll enough pawns to drive the bishop off of F3 so my knight can eat eat the [ g2 ] pawn.
 [ Q b8 ]  [ Q d3 ]  [ a6 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ g x f6 ] , [ N d4 ]  Forced to retreat.
 [ Q x d7 ] , [ h3 ]  I saw combinations of [ [ h6 ] ] attacking my dark bishop and blacks night on the [ g4 ] sqaure in my future without this move. Although I did almost move Ra1-[ e1 ] here I did not want to give up a chance to attack on the queen side near his idle queenside knight. With 11. [ h3 ] I made h7-[ [ h6 ] ] a pointless waste of time and gave my self a few moves to get over to his queen side without his night in my house.
 [ K b1 ]  [ R a5 ] , [ B b5 ]  (!) A very neat tactical shot even if it had been played before. Not only is the bishop protected by a threatened fork (18.Nc7ch) but Black can not castle neither on account of 17... 0-0 18.Bxc6ch [ b x c6 ] 19.Nxe7ch etc; or 18.[ B x c6 ] [ B c5 ] 19.[ B x b7 ] [ R a7 ] 20.[ B c6 ] [ B x f2 ] when Black doesn't have enough for the piece. What to play then?
 [ Q g8 ] , [ Q f1 ]  No I do not want to trade queens. Black wants the easy way out of a winning game by mindlessly trading until the board is simple enough to exploit his material advantage. If you're good you'll know that being up a piece this early in the game isn't winning yet. It is unclear since there are so many pieces on the board.
 [ e5 ]  [ b3 ] , [ N f6 ]  i open up the knight that proves to be very useful later in the game
 [ Q d1 ] , [ d5 ]  The queen's pawn comes down to attack my pawn and bishop.
 [ e4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ c6 ]  With Black having 2 pawns on the central dark squares 4...c5! seems to be indicated. Afterwards the plan would be to move the Queen Knight to [ c6 ] and [ d4 ] centralizing it nicely.
 [ f x g2 + ]  [ R x g2 ] , [ Q x d1 + ]  ?? Luckily for me my opponent had about 9 seconds left at this point and panicked taking with the first piece that came to hand but this exchanges into a clearly lost endgames it was essential for black to keep queens on. Correct was 40...[ B x d1 ] 41.[ R x g7 + ] [ B x g7 ] and by keeping the queens on the ending is almost certainly winning for black. Though still quite interesting
 [ N e4 ] , [ B e7 ]  I could have played [ B c7 ] or NxN (recommended by GK engine) but I wanted to "tempt" him to...
 [ R f d1 ] , [ N d4 ]  Once again effective maneuvering by black's knights. Now white is in a poor position despite having two bishops.
 [ b6 ]  [ B d5 ]  [ f x g4 + ] , [ R x g4 + ]  The 4th rank has been a line in the sand that white just has not been able to cross.
 [ K b7 ] , [ B a4 ]  There are two pieces of black's that I wish to get rid off the Bishop and the knight. Even I should be able to gain victory after that. Let's threaten [ d7 ] to see if black would do an exchange?
 [ c6 ]  [ Q x c6 + ]  [ Q d7 ]  [ Q x a8 + ]  [ Q d8 ]  [ Q x d8 + ]  [ K x d8 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ N x f7 + ]  [ K e8 ]  [ N x h8 ]  [ B x f1 ]  [ K x f1 ]  [ K d7 ]  [ N g6 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ R c1 ]  [ B d4 ] , [ R d1 ]  Black resigns!
 [ R f7 ]  [ b4 ]  [ R f8 ] , [ B c5 ]  33. [ B c5 ] - preparing a pawn advance.
 [ Q e2 ]  [ Q h6 ] , [ c4 ]  White's piece can't move: [ g1 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ B x d4 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ B x c5 ] , [ N x c5 ]  The knight is not easily driven from [ c5 ]  [ B c2 ] , [ a4 ]  White has a cramped position. White's piece can't move: [ g1 ]  [ R d1 ] , [ Q h5 ]  Black is ruining his position Alternative variation: 27... [ R d7 ] 28. [ e5 ] [ R x d1 + ] 29. [ Q x d1 ] $11
 [ e x d5 ] , [ c x d5 ]  And now there is no pawn on [ c4 ] to worry about.
 [ N c3 ]  [ Q d8 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ c6 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ N a6 ]  [ a3 ] , [ N c7 ]  13. ......... [ N c7 ] - to support [ e6 ] and prepare for the lsb to develop on that square and to contest the control of d5.
 [ g4 ] , [ Q h5 + ]  Wins pawn.
 [ B g7 ] , [ h3 ]  Preventing the ubiquitous pin.
 [ d5 ]  [ e5 ] , [ N d7 ]  My only real move here. [ N e4 ] leads to the queen trade and then [ d3 ] wins my knight.
 [ R h7 ]  [ d4 ]  [ B x f3 ]  [ g x f3 ]  [ Q e8 ]  [ K g2 ]  [ Q h5 ]  [ f4 ]  [ R g7 ] , [ Q d1 ]  Computer says I'm almost back to even as of a few moves ago. I foiled his threat and built my own attack with initiative. But the text move is wimpy slow and clunky. [ Q e3 ] or even [ B d1 ] would have been better.
 [ B e3 ] , [ R f5 + ]  And he delays that nasty check by placing Boris in check first.
 [ K b7 ] , [ f4 ]  now or never...
 [ K h2 ]  [ b3 ]  [ h6 ]  [ b2 ] , [ R d8 ]  Threatens to skewer my pawn with [ R b8 ]  [ b1 = Q + ]  [ K h2 ] , [ Q c1 ]  If [ h7 ] then clearly [ Q h6 + ] gains the pawn
 [ R f3 ] , [ R x f3 ]  So I decide to move my rook to [ [ f3 ] ] and this means that the black rook will have to come down to the 3rd row to capture my rook. The [ [ f3 ] ] square is protected by my LB at e2.
 [ d5 ] , [ K g2 ]  With another torpedo on it's way and the 'corner-fort defense' now in place Safeway would likely begin to develop his remaining pieces
 [ g8 = Q ]  [ f x g3 ]  [ Q g7 + ]  [ K c8 ] , [ Q f8 + ]  Things definitely look simple for White. All Kosteniuk needs to do is to keep on checking and get a draw out of it.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ N f6 ]  The Four Knights' Game usually considered quite drawish.
 [ Q f7 + ]  [ K d6 ] , [ N b5 + ]  The King-hunt is on in earnest.
 [ f x e5 ]  [ f x e5 ]  [ N f5 ] , [ Q d3 ]  Now Fritz gives me the continuation 15... [ N x b4 ] with Bb5. I analized only 15... [ B x b4 ] but falls 16 g4.
 [ N f3 ] , [ Q c5 ]  This is where Kleiman played 9. … Qg4?! against me and went down to a rapid defeat. The text move seems like the most principled answer putting pressure on [ c2 ] and preventing me from castling. The trap initiated with 5. [ B d3 ] doesn’t lead to a forced win or even a forced advantage; it simply forces Black to make a lot of difficult decisions while White has an easy initiative. In practical chess playing against a human I would take White’s position any day of the week. Against a computer of course it’s not quite so easy.
 [ N b4 ] , [ N c6 ]  ! I fork both of Black's a pawn and his rook! He also can't trade knights here as 30...[ N x c6 ] 31.[ d x c6 ] and white's passed pawn is extremely dangerous.
 [ d3 ] , [ R f5 ]  Can you tell where this rook is headed?
 [ R c3 ]  [ Q f5 ] , [ R x c8 ]  
 [ Q c1 ]  [ R d5 ]  [ Q e1 + ]  [ K g4 ]  [ Q a1 ]  [ c4 ] , [ Q g1 ]  56. .... [ Q g1 ] - Glenda continues to make empty token threats.
 [ B f4 ]  [ B b7 ] , [ N d2 ]  If [ N f3 ] at once some players play BxN just to scramble my pawns. I would have an edge but even so I didn't want to play this line.
 [ f5 ] , [ R f d1 ]  This was probably a mistake on my part. I think I was better off with 22. Pxb5.
 [ N c3 ]  [ R b a1 ]  [ N x e4 ] , [ d x e4 ]  Even if I am only +1 in theoretic material my bishop is too well placed. IMO white should have kept the lines closed as long as possible with [ K x e4 ] ([ R d4 ] [ K f3 ] and my rook is to at its ease there ([ R c1 ] threatening c6...)
 [ K g1 ] , [ Q x d1 + ]  White's in deep now. 23. [ Q f1 ] allows 23. ... Qxf1#. But after 23. [ K g2 ] black plays 23. ... [ Q f3 + ] 24. [ K g1 ] [ Q f2 + ] 25. [ K h1 ] [ Q e1 + ] 26. [ K g2 ] Rf2#. So it's mate either way. White chose to resign.
 [ R x d7 + ] , [ K e8 ]  Threatens the rook but [ K f8 ] would have saved the knight
 [ B b4 ] , [ B d2 ]  Black has gained a time here. 9.[ B d3 ] seems more active
 [ h4 ]  [ Q c7 ] , [ h5 ]  White throws caution into the wind.
 [ R x d5 ]  [ Q b6 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ Q x b2 ]  [ R a d1 ]  [ Q x a2 ] , [ B c5 ]  Shily trying to complicate the game. Laudable effort but no result.
 [ K g2 ]  [ g5 ]  [ h x g5 ] , [ f x g5 ]  This sequence of pawn trades was not recommended by Fritz. But it's part of my plan and will make winning more simple. I believe white now has zero drawing chances. I like simple when one will retain one's winning chances.
 [ K a2 ]  [ K b4 ] , [ K b1 ]  If [ K a1 ] then [ K b3 ] [ K b1 ] is the final mating net.
 [ f3 ] , [ B e6 ]  White saw black's plan of Bxg2!
 [ N f6 ] , [ B g5 ]  His first pin on my donkey.
 [ a3 ]  [ B d6 ] , [ Q d2 ]  13.[ B e2 ] better slightly. again it is interfering with aggressive development.
 [ h5 ] , [ Q d1 ]  14. [ Q d1 ] - the Wicked Witch retreats to transfer herself over to the kingside but my opponent sends his development into reverse!
 [ B x e5 ] , [ Q b6 ]  !? threatening [ Q f2 ] at any point
 [ Q x c7 ] , [ B x d4 ]  trading away my queenside pawn but now I need something else to defend against his passed pawn. However that pawn never comes into play because my opponent never uses it.
 [ N c6 ]  [ f4 + ] , [ K g4 ]  30. ........... Kg4?? - see my next note.
 [ N c3 ] , [ N c6 ]  He indicates a preference for one of Closed Sicilians lines.
 [ Q x d5 ]  [ Q b1 ]  [ B g4 ] , [ R d2 ]  25. [ R d2 ] - dodges the line of one bishop but .....
 [ N f1 ]  [ N f2 ] , [ K x f2 ]  21. [ K x f2 ] - forced as Glenda and my king rook were forked.
 [ Q e7 ] , [ O-O ]  I finally get around to castling... also taking the half-open KB file.
 [ B f2 ] , [ R e5 ]  Committing to the following idea
 [ a6 ] , [ B a4 ]  8. [ B x c6 ] gives up the bishop pair for no advantage.
 [ R b8 ]  [ R b7 ]  [ R x b7 ] , [ B x b7 ]  White is winning here. There are pawn majorities on both sides of the board. The e-pawn is now a passed pawn. And with pawns on both sides the B should be superior to the N due to its speed.
 [ Q x g2 ] , [ R x g3 ]  The Knight has fallen and the White Queen pinned on its King made me sure that the end was near.
 [ R e b1 ]  [ B x c3 ]  [ Q g4 ]  [ R f5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ R a f8 ] , [ b4 ]  Here I was focused on the doubling of my rooks and trapping his queen and overlooked the pawn threat to my queen. It is simply answered by [ Q a4 ] followed by 24. ...Rf4. I played this move in haste. Was on the way out. Bad me.
 [ B g6 ]  [ B x g6 ]  [ f x g6 ]  [ Q x g6 ] , [ R f7 ]  23. ...... [ R f7 ] - the only way to avoid mate on g7.
 [ e4 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ e5 ]  [ c3 ] , [ d5 ]  4 d5!? is tactically possible because of white's pawn moves.
 [ B d4 ] , [ R a b1 ]  I guess i'm doing it good so far and i have no serious worries.
 [ R e8 ] , [ Q b3 ]  [ g4 ] was also an option.
 [ Q x f3 ]  [ N b d7 ] , [ c4 ]  I decided to play [ c4 ] before I bring out the knight to help challenge d5.
 [ d3 ] , [ Q x f3 ]  A little surprising white declines the trade given that black can double white's pawns.
 [ e5 ]  [ R d1 ] , [ Q e7 ]  The position is still very complicated but White's chances are probably already better.
 [ R e1 ] , [ f5 ]  A tough call. 18. ... [ f5 ] or 18. ... d5. I went with the move as played (obviously) choosing to not block the a8-[ h1 ] diagonal though I was sorely tempted to liberate by backward d-pawn and get him into the center.
 [ h6 ] , [ c3 ]  You never know when your bishop might need a bolt-hole in a pinch. And I plan to make some attacks with the queen which would leave [ d4 ] weak so this move shores it up.
 [ B d6 ] , [ N f7 ]  Phooey. I had plans such as [ B x h7 + ] [ K h8 ] [ R x h1 ] and winning the Queen. Yeah right! Should've known that wouldn't have happened!
 [ Q f3 ] , [ R a3 ]  An indirect attack against black's rook threatening 24. [ N c4 ] discovering the attack from the white rook on [ a3 ] against the black queen on f3.
 [ K c5 ]  [ b4 + ]  [ K x b4 ] , [ Q x c6 ]  Although it was decisive here Black fights to the bitter end.
 [ K f5 ] , [ K e1 ]  You had warning last move. Computer prefers [ N e3 + ] so a point for that too.
 [ N f3 ] , [ R e6 ]  A reasonable counter.
 [ R f c8 ] , [ B x c5 ]  Black is playing this game with great enegry he "increases the activity of the [ R f8 ] and will make the decision about the destruction of whites pawn structure later! Often it is said that the "threat to do something is greater than the execution"!
 [ R d2 ]  [ R a3 ]  [ R d5 + ]  [ K h4 ]  [ N d2 ] , [ K g3 ]  Blunder. But it was not easy to find the right way to act.
 [ K f2 ] , [ N c8 ]  finally releasing the Knight with an attack on a4...
 [ B e6 ] , [ c4 ]  16. [ c4 ] defends the knight but black is willing to exchange freely now with his large material lead. 16. [ N e3 ] was probably safest.
 [ B x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ R x d5 ]  [ R a c8 ]  [ B d2 ]  [ a6 ] , [ B c3 ]  Hoping for pawn move to [ [ [ f4 ] ] ] one day. Problem is that knight will attack now 'empty' [ [ [ f4 ] ] ] and get counter play. Bishop belongs to [ d2 ] to check on [ [ [ f4 ] ] ] at least until I find some other place for queen on e2.
 [ N c6 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ Q a5 ]  Black decides to develop his queen too early anyway. You should refrain from developing the queen until you have pieces to back it up
 [ K d1 ] , [ N f2 + ]  forking the queen and king tho my queen is also free to take
 [ B x e4 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ Q x e4 ] , [ R e8 ]  perhaps a discovered attack comes next?
 [ Q e2 ] , [ R f6 ]  -
 [ K g8 ] , [ N x e6 ]  to be closer to the king and attacking the queen. !!
 [ B c6 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ Q e8 ]  [ O-O ] , [ R c8 ]  I don't really understand why he played this move.. Someone ? Personally I would've preferred [ R b8 ] which gives an opportunity to start pushing my b-pawn (as black).
 [ Q h2 ]  [ N x b2 ]  [ Q h6 + ]  [ K g8 ] , [ N f3 ]  This may be a losing move but let's see if and how he takes advantage of it.
 [ R a2 x a6 ]  [ R x a6 ] , [ b x a6 ]  Now White has a remote protected passed pawn. Black might as well resign even if he can take the Bc5.
 [ Q x c7 ] , [ N a6 ]  While this is a decent move for black white might respond with BxNa6. Every trade now benefits white. This trade doesn't double blacks pawns though since black can reply with QxBa6.
 [ K f6 ]  [ g4 ] , [ f4 ]  Gaining space and preventing my king from advancing. Again I had missed this.
 [ B g4 + ]  [ f3 ]  [ B x f3 + ]  [ g x f3 ] , [ R x g8 ]  Incredibly I am still +1!
 [ f5 ]  [ g x f5 ]  [ g6 ]  [ h x g6 ] , [ B d4 ]  The difference now is that my rook can mate in h8. He can hardly escape.
 [ h6 ]  [ B c6 ]  [ Q b8 ] , [ N a3 ]  Bringing the knight in on the attack
 [ N g4 ] , [ O-O ]  I add extra pressure to the f pawn
 [ e4 ] , [ d6 ]  The idea behind the Pirc and/or Modern defense is to allow white to establish a pawn center and then try to undermine it.
 [ R g8 ] , [ R x h6 ]  21. [ R x h6 ] - the seeds of a plan are beginning to germinate. Black naturally pushes his pawn.
 [ R x f6 ] , [ Q f3 ]  This was the idea behind not conceding a single tempo to black (taking the N). Now my threat is Qh3. A weak plan since black here has e.g. g5. So the soundness of both my sacs is heavily questioned! I didn't want to play the f pawn for sure and the simple [ N d2 ] (developement without a plan) is just a losing option.
 [ Q x e7 + ] , [ N d7 ]  once again the queen is a better interposer.
 [ g x f3 ] , [ B x h3 ]  And now I have 2 main threats that can't be met. 1.[ B g2 ] 2.Rg5ch
 [ N d4 ] , [ N b5 ]  Here I am targetting the seemingly unprotected pawn on [ d6 ] with my knight and queen....I just need to try to shift the black knight on [ d4 ] by pushing the c pawn.
 [ c x d4 ]  [ c x d4 ] , [ d5 ]  The position is equal already. Now Black will play for the advantage.
 [ R d2 ] , [ b4 ]  Attempting to break open the kings position.
 [ K h4 ]  [ R x g3 ]  [ K x g3 ]  [ K g6 ] , [ K h4 ]  And I gladly accept his draw offer. Whew!....this little monster sure took a lot out of me. At the end of day #1 I'm sitting at 1.5/3. It's going to take a big day #2 to secure any prize money but by this time of the night I'm really not thinking too much about that. My favorite restaurant in Huntsville closes in an hour and half and my friend and I both are finally going to get those margaritas we have been thinking of all day:)
 [ d5 ] , [ K g2 ]  With another torpedo on it's way and the 'corner-fort defense' now in place Safeway would likely begin to develop his remaining pieces
 [ d6 ] , [ Q h5 ]  Keeping the queen in close proximity to the black king.
 [ N x c4 ] , [ Q e2 ]  I had wanted to play 18. [ Q g2 ] until I noticed the family fork on [ e3 ] ....yuck! The text is not a bad move however because the the xray through to Black's King a finesse Black now obligingly walks into.
 [ N c4 ] , [ g6 ]  '?' - Too slow. Black is lost.
 [ Q x c4 ] , [ N a6 ]  Nothing much Black can do in this situation really but perhaps [ N f6 ] would have been better? (sorry to sound like a broken record with the [ N f6 ] move :P)
 [ e x d5 ]  [ Q x d5 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ B b4 + ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ B e2 ]  White prepares to castle
 [ B d7 ]  [ Q x h6 ] , [ B x h4 ]  It's also interesting 32... [ B x f5 ] 33. [ e x f5 ] [ e4 ] 34. Rxg7+! [ Q x g7 ] 35. [ Q x g7 + ] [ K x g7 ] 36. [ B x e4 ]  [ Q h5 ] , [ R h6 ]  A big blunder. 33...[ B f6 ] was probably best After 33... [ B e8 ] white has 34. Rg6! with a promising position. Let's see: a) 34...Bxg6?? 35.[ f x g6 ] and white wins b) 34... [ B f6 ] 35. [ N f2 ] (Threatens 36.[ R h1 ] If 35. [ R h1 ] [ Q c7 ] 36. [ K g1 ] [ R x c2 ] 37. [ B x c2 ] [ Q x c2 ] 38. [ N g5 ] Qc1+) and now: b1) 35... [ Q c7 ] 36. [ N g4 ] [ B x g6 ] 37. [ f x g6 ] [ R c8 ] (If 37... [ R e8 ] 38. [ N x f6 ] [ g x f6 ] 39. g7!) 38. [ R f1 ] b2) 35... [ Q d8 ] 36. [ N g4 ] [ B x g6 ] 37. [ f x g6 ] [ R e8 ] 38. a4! (Not 38. [ R f1 ] [ K f8 ] 39. [ N x f6 ] [ R x f6 ] 40. [ Q h8 + ] [ K e7 ] 41. [ Q x g7 + ] Ke6) 38... [ b x a4 ] 39. [ R f1 ] [ R e e6 ] (If now 39... [ K f8 ] 40. [ N x f6 ] [ R x f6 ] 41. [ Q h8 + ] [ K e7 ] 42. [ Q x g7 + ] [ K e6 ] 43. Bc4+! wins) and after 40.Kg2! white has a strong pressure. Despite material advantage black is tied up
 [ Q x a4 ]  [ R x b7 ]  [ B f8 ] , [ Q d3 ]  I used to like the rook on [ a6 ] and now for some reason I chase it back to a8. Maybe 27. [ N f5 ] and 28. [ Q g3 ] would have been more fun. Well at least white can still play those moves.
 [ R e8 ]  [ Q c2 ] , [ d x c4 ]  8... P-[ B3 ] was better.
 [ Q e8 ] , [ N x e8 ]  Just a slice in the throat.
 [ B b4 ] , [ Q h4 + ]  i had seen this earlier but did not want to play it to early - wins a rook
 [ R x g6 ]  [ Q d2 ] , [ R d8 ]  A good rule in a good position is to keep the preasure normally your opponent will make a mistake if you continue to do that.
 [ f x e6 ]  [ N x e6 ]  [ Q f7 ]  [ N f g5 ]  [ Q e7 ] , [ Q e2 ]  a good move 14.Qe2! another double attack and black all most hope less because of he's un abillity to castel and run away hes king from danger another idea by the move 14.Qe2! is to keep more and more pressure on the center .
 [ Q c1 ] , [ f5 ]  I probably should have played [ a5 ] before the [ f5 ] break.
 [ B b7 ] , [ N f3 ]  As planned.
 [ d5 ]  [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ B f4 ]  This was a mistake. [ e3 ] was what I should have done which is pretty obvious in retrospect. This move accomplishes exactly nothing.
 [ Q d6 ] , [ f4 ]  if he takes with the pawn I can force a trade of queens
 [ R h4 ]  [ h5 ]  [ f4 ]  [ e x f3 ]  [ e ]  [ p ]  [ Q f2 ]  [ Q f6 ]  [ B d2 ]  [ O-O-O ]  [ O-O-O ]  [ g5 ]  [ R h2 ] , [ B d6 ]  White is still cramped white should push the e pawn or put his rook on [ f1 ] although pushing the e pawn may lead to a knight sacrifice as the idea of a later [ h5 ] has good possibilities as does the poor position of the knight on [ g1 ]  [ h4 ] , [ R h1 ]  The pawns are just going to rumble on
 [ K x b6 ]  [ K h5 ]  [ a5 ]  [ b x a5 + ] , [ K x a5 ]  Draw is assured. If [ R f5 + ] [ K a4 ] and I'll threaten his pawns from the back. He has to exchange R in order to take my h pawn and this will give me time to grab his pawns.
 [ N c3 ] , [ g6 ]  Because of the LSB black is forced to take the DSB from [ g7 ]  [ B g4 ] , [ B x c4 ]  Regaining the material
 [ N f3 ] , [ d6 ]  The first step to creating the strong compact Sicilian Najdorf pawn structure
 [ B x g4 ] , [ N d7 ]  Around here yoshark announced that he had an interesting new plan that took advantage of 2...g6. I can't say that I saw how in the succeeding moves.
 [ K g8 ]  [ N x e6 ]  [ g5 ] , [ K g2 ]  38. [ K g2 ] - time to eject the [ h3 ] knight splitting up the black kingside pawns.
 [ R e6 ] , [ R b1 ]  34. Rb1. There is no saving my [ b7 ] pawn and Ken will crown at least one of those advanced passers and I would have to sac my rook just to stop one of them so I waved the white flag. Well played Ken!
 [ B g7 ] , [ B c4 ]  Clearing the way for castling.
 [ e x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ N g5 ]  [ B e7 ] , [ R x e6 ]  !! Trading a rook for 3 pawns an open King and a fierce attack. Pretty good deal to me!
 [ R c4 ]  [ R x c4 ]  [ Q x c4 ]  [ Q d8 ]  [ R c1 ] , [ Q b6 ]  Black is really getting nowhere. White has dominated the center and is dominating the open c-file. I can find no flaw in white's play for me to exploit. Just spinning my wheels.
 [ B x d5 ] , [ N e5 ]  Threatening to recapture with the rook and keep the weakened long light-squared diagonal open aiming particularly at f3.
 [ R a8 ]  [ R c1 ] , [ R e8 ]  ?? don't he sees the fork? he can play [ c6 ] to avoid my fork.
 [ Q e2 ] , [ Q e7 ]  4....... [ Q e7 ] - Nf6?? drops the queen to the discovery 5. Nc6+.
 [ c4 ]  [ g6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ e4 ] , [ d6 ]  All standard book moves to this point.
 [ e4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ N f3 ]  Lost a tempo. [ B e3 ] is an alternative
 [ R b3 ] , [ a4 ]  OK no point in letting him have his draw. Besides I think I found a way to get a queen. I spent lots of time here. If this had been a timed game in a tournament room my time would surely have run out. Well I would have spent less time and gone with my gut much sooner. I decide to let black have his slice of heaven back.
 [ N d6 + ]  [ K c7 ] , [ B f4 ]  ! This makes black's defense difficult due to the double check of Ne8. After 24.[ N e8 ] (if it was white's move here): a) 24... [ K b6 ] 25.[ Q d6 ] [ K a5 ] 26.[ d x e8 = Q ] is easily winning or 25... [ K b5 ] 26.[ N c7 ] or 24... [ K b7 ] 25.[ Q c7 ] [ K a8 ] 26.[ e x d8 = Q ] b) 24... [ K c8 ] 25.[ Q a8 ] instantly would end the game.
 [ K c5 ] , [ h5 ]  Black will have to trade but can lean on the rook first.
 [ B x b2 ] , [ N f4 ]  Y'know... wouldn't most people have moved the OTHER knight out of the way? for like avenging the rook?
 [ a x b4 ] , [ e6 ]  Amazing position and now black is defenceless.
 [ g x f6 ]  [ B x f6 ] , [ Q d7 ]  all white needs to do is get his queen to the kingside and black is in serious trouble
 [ O-O ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ d4 ] , [ N d6 ]  The main line.
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ c4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ e3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B d3 ]  [ c5 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ N x f6 + ]  [ Q x f6 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ R e8 + ]  [ K f1 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ B x f5 ]  [ Q x f5 ]  [ R c1 ]  [ R a c8 ]  [ R x c8 ]  [ R x c8 ]  [ h4 ]  [ R c2 ]  [ Q e1 ] , [ Q c8 ]  it's over
 [ R h6 ]  [ K b6 ]  [ K c3 ]  [ R d7 ] , [ R g6 ]  Only Carlsen can win this position although unlikely that Caruana will blow it. After all he is the 2nd ranked player in the world!
 [ g6 ] , [ R c f1 ]  Lining up on the f-file. Already there is the possibility of RxP QxP RxQ KxR QxP .
 [ c x d4 ]  [ e x d4 ] , [ N x d4 ]  White cannot avoid giving up the bishop pair here without further material loss. For example 17. [ K g2 ] [ N x f3 ] 18. [ B x g7 ] [ N h4 + ] 19. [ K g3 ] Nf5+. However the opposite square bishops give White some hope.
 [ O-O ] , [ B f4 ]  More developing getting the dark squared bishop outside a potential pawn chain.
 [ O-O ] , [ Q d2 ]  Consistent with my plan of exchanging his fianchettoed dark squared bishop my own dark squared bishop
 [ Q f6 ] , [ e4 ]  intending attack on queen with 15.[ e5 ] or 14.[ d x e4 ] 15.[ N x e4 ]  [ f5 ]  [ e x f5 ] , [ R x f5 ]  building pressure on [ f7 ]  [ N e7 ] , [ R f3 ]  [ R e5 ] may be better option. comments welcome...
 [ R f x d1 ]  [ B b4 ]  [ B x b4 ]  [ N x b4 ] , [ a3 ]  [ c6 ] is also possible and maybe stronger
 [ N x e3 ] , [ f x e3 ]  Now white has a very strong centre but black can fight on the white squares and the fry seems roughly even or at least defendable.
 [ O-O ]  [ N g e7 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ a6 ] , [ B d6 ]  Bd6! Already pressuring Black's poor set-up.
 [ N h1 ] , [ R x g2 + ]  Here sacking the Rook to get rid of a pawn. The defenses of the White king is fading away...
 [ N g4 + ] , [ K g3 ]  22.[ K g3 ] The better choice! Good for Black the variation: 22. Kg1? [ Q h4 ] 23. [ R e1 ] Qxf2+!-+ e.g. 24. [ K h1 ] [ Q h4 + ] 25. [ K g1 ] [ Q h2 + ] 26. [ K f1 ] [ Q h1 + ] 27. [ K e2 ] [ Q x g2 + ] 28. [ K d1 ] [ R a8 ] 29. [ Q b1 ] [ B a4 + ] Alternative variation: 22. Kh3?! Bd7!-/+
 [ B c4 ]  [ N g5 ]  [ N d2 ] , [ R c6 ]  Threatening Nxe4.
 [ g x f5 ]  [ e x f5 ] , [ R f7 ]  (!?) For the moment Black dare not take the f-pawn owing to 16...[ B x f5 ] 17.[ B x f5 ] [ R x f5 ] (17...Nxf5? 18.Bxf8) 18.[ B x g7 + ] [ N x g7 ] 19.[ R x g7 ] [ K x g7 ] (20...Rxf3?? 21.Qxh7#) 20.[ Q x f5 ] and White emerges from the massacre with an extra piece. The purpose of this rook move was to unpin the g7-knight allowing the recapture at f5. During the game I thought 16...[ R [ f6 ] ] more accurate as it obviated White's next move. But 16...[ R [ f6 ] ] 17.[ B g5 ] with 18.[ f6 ] to come would have been similar to a line discussed after Black's next move.
 [ K g7 ]  [ K d2 ] , [ Q f2 + ]  29. ..... [ Q f2 + ] - and so the Wicked Witch of the West will take my knight next move. This is the one move blunder I fell into. However I feel that it was only a matter of time before black uses one of those black passers on the kingside to resurrect the evil one's sister the Wicked Witch of the East and both those besoms would make Henry's life sheer hell on earth. There was only one thing to do wave that bally (as Coach Ion would say!) white flag.
 [ N d3 ]  [ K d4 ] , [ N e1 ]  After [ N f4 ] I play [ e2 ] and White cannot stop promotion
 [ f5 ]  [ e4 ]  [ N c7 ]  [ e x f5 ]  [ e x f5 ] , [ N d f3 ]  Another Knight enters the Kingside arena.
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ e5 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ O-O ]  [ a4 ]  [ c6 ]  [ a5 ]  [ N b d7 ] , [ B f4 ]  (?) I put a question mark on this move due to the fact that the Knight does not have sufficient support on e5. The Bishop can be removed by my King Knight. If he takes my knight that knight has moved from [ g1 ] to [ f3 ] to [ e5 ] only to be traded on [ d7 ] wasting valuable development.
 [ B c2 ]  [ K g5 ] , [ B d1 ]  Now this move scared me *after* I made my move. I reacted (which is bad in a correspondence game) by simply toggling. I realized if he posted his bishop at [ f3 ] it allows his king the freedom to march queen-side. My king could march over to shore up the position but I was not 100% sure I could safely handle the two pass-pawns on the e and g files with just my bishop.
 [ O-O ] , [ Q f6 ]  White castles Black advances [ Q f6 ] (Another test position by black). Note white Knight position expecting line of dark squared bishop of white to open to attack the black queen which I noticed after I moved the Queen
 [ f5 ] , [ R f3 ]  I think [ e x f6 ] e.p. would have given White better attacking chances.
 [ c3 ]  [ a6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ b5 ]  [ B b3 ]  [ B g4 ] , [ d x c5 ]  For whatever reason my opponent didn't retreat the attacked Bishop so I gladly snap it up.
 [ e6 ] , [ b3 ]  Preparing to fianchetto the other bishop although I never did. Also this move supports c4.
 [ R e8 ] , [ d6 ]  38. [ d6 ] - Freddy pushes his passer. Black now lands a nasty check on [ e2 ] though. With a black rook on the third rank things are starting to look a little ominous for Freddy's king. At least with one white rook near his king Old Matey will be kept at bay for a little while yet.
 [ N d5 ] , [ B x d5 ]  The tactics begin. I desire to simplify the game as I'm a Pawn ahead so I will take every opportunity to exchange.
 [ B x b7 ]  [ Q x b7 ] , [ R g1 ]  Any other rook move would lose material but what about f3? It would allow the king to go to [ f2 ] and give some breathing room for the coming storm from my hungry pieces.
 [ B f3 ]  [ R h8 ]  [ B e4 ]  [ K g7 ]  [ K g5 ]  [ f6 + ] , [ K f4 ]  i guess white would be happy with a draw... i am not sure.
 [ B e2 ]  [ O-O ] , [ c4 ]  This is a typical move by me where I put immediate pressure on the centre.
 [ K d8 ] , [ R b7 b8 # ]  Finishing with a linear mate but [ Q d7 # ] was also possible. I played this opening better than I thought I would. I like the positional play and opportunities for theatrical tactics in this opening. A won game because of some weak choices by black and some reasonably clever positional and tactical play on my part.
 [ B x e4 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ Q x e4 ]  [ h2 + ]  [ K h1 ]  [ g2 + ]  [ K x g2 ]  [ h1 = Q + ]  [ R x h1 ] , [ R x h1 ]  Neat take me with the king and get royal forked.
 [ N e2 + ]  [ K h2 ] , [ N x c3 ]  both captures lose.
 [ h5 ]  [ B d2 ] , [ K e4 ]  54. [ K e4 ] - centralising his king and going for the [ d5 ] pawn. Fou Lenoir tries to protect it but finds himself on the next turn overloaded.
 [ B f6 ]  [ R g g8 ]  [ R c b1 ] , [ R a c8 ]  34. ................ [ R a c8 ] - my rooks take advantage of the open files available to them. I think I have some play for my 2 pawn deficit.
 [ N x d3 ] , [ N x f6 ]  ?? Of course I couldn't take on [ d3 ] since this would lose my R. But this was the final blunder as it guarantees Stanley an instant win. 27.[ g3 ] was essential because of what's about to unfold.
 [ h4 ]  [ f3 ]  [ a4 ] , [ f2 ]  Now we took action. I played it out just a bit longer but I couldn't hold him off.
 [ N b d2 ] , [ B c5 ]  I usually play 8.......[ N e7 ] to go to [ g6 ] and then [ f4 ] but this looked inviting
 [ e6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f d7 ] , [ N c e2 ]  This seems like a good place to start the annotation. Instead of 5. [ [ f4 ] ] leading to the Steinitz this move betokens the modern treatment of the Classical. The idea is for White to create a "super-center" with [ c3 ] [ [ f4 ] ] and Nf3. In these positions the standard break at ...[ f6 ] is not so good as it leaves Black with a terminally weakened pawn structure. This is a fact which determines this game even though we leave book very early. Anand has played this several times with great effect. For some truly amazing games check out Anand-Shirov 2000 and Anand-Morozevich 2000.
 [ B x a1 ] , [ R x a1 ]  A quick positional assessment shows that there are bishops of opposite colors which means that there is some potential for reaching a draw typically. But the material difference will make that less likely. White has a pawn majority queen-side and black does on the king-side. Both players should try to centralize the king usually but in this game the 2 rooks will make that difficult for white. A strategy for white may be to try and create a fortress on the queen-side for the king after exchanging pawns king-side. For black the best strategy is to make the most of the rooks perhaps by [...[ R d1 ] ] to exchange rooks for a greater advantage.
 [ d x c4 ] , [ b x c4 ]  Not falling for 17. Qxc4? [ B x c3 + ] where White can resign with a clear conscience.
 [ B a3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ R x d5 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ R x d4 ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ Q h4 ]  [ d3 ]  [ K d2 ]  [ d x c2 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ Q x h1 ]  [ K x c2 ]  [ Q x g2 + ]  [ K d3 ]  [ R c d8 + ]  [ K e4 ]  [ Q g6 + ]  [ K f4 ]  [ R d4 + ]  [ N e4 ] , [ f5 ]  
 [ N x d5 ]  [ K b8 ]  [ c4 ]  [ R g1 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B c8 ]  [ N e8 ] , [ R g6 ]  White's N is trapped and has no safe squares.
 [ R f2 ] , [ B d5 ]  ?????????????????????????????????????????????????The worst mistake i've ever seen in a chess game.....hahahahahahahaaahahhh thank u
 [ K f3 ]  [ b4 ]  [ R x d2 ] , [ b3 ]  Now material is level and I was expecting that the game would probably be drawn. My outside passed pawn couple is nice but my king can't get away to help them. However it turns out...
 [ B b4 + ] , [ c3 ]  This move "converts" the doubled pawns on the c-file into more aggressive doubled pawns on the b-file. That's a good thing however White is no longer in any position to be aggressive. Again a quote by Steinitz comes to mind: "When you have an advantage you are obliged to attack; otherwise you are endangered to lose the advantage. [...] Only the player with the initiative has the right to attack" (or he will end up even worse). In the game at hand 15.[ Q d2 ] [ B x d2 ] 16.[ B x d2 ] is better: it still loses the Queen but at least it develops the Bishop.
 [ f x e5 ]  [ Q x e5 ] , [ Q x e5 ]  I am willing to give up the queen as I have point and piece advantage
 [ B x g5 ]  [ N x g5 ]  [ Q x g5 ] , [ h x g4 ]  White has to keep up with captured material.
 [ Q x e7 + ]  [ Q x e7 ]  [ R x e7 ] , [ B d7 ]  ?? Completing my development. The problem was that I did not count how many more defenders they had then me. By playing this they'll win another piece. Might sound contradictory and thus strange but the only other move that came into consideration was 15...Nxd5?? with the idea of winning back material. However that would lose immediately because this would give them an immediate back rank mate with 16.[ R e8 # ] With that being said I'm not sure what the best move was but something else had to come into consideration.
 [ K x a7 ]  [ a x b6 + ]  [ K x b6 ]  [ K c2 ]  [ Q x f2 ] , [ b4 ]  The heaviness of the inevitable has broken my back..
 [ R f6 ]  [ R x f6 ]  [ Q x f6 ]  [ Q d2 + ]  [ K f1 ]  [ Q g2 + ]  [ K e1 ]  [ Q x h1 + ] , [ K e2 ]  Now I'm down by five and my only hope is that my queen and bishop are threatening checkmate and it will be hard for him to defend.
 [ B x f2 ]  [ Q x f2 + ]  [ K b8 ]  [ c4 ] , [ R f8 ]  white is won with his central pawn....
 [ R x f7 ]  [ B x f7 + ]  [ K x f7 ]  [ d3 ]  [ N d4 ] , [ a3 ]  ...and this move is not in the database.
 [ c x b4 ]  [ B x b4 + ]  [ B d2 ]  [ B x d2 + ]  [ N x d2 ]  [ b6 ]  [ B d3 ] , [ N c5 ]  Little lost now!
 [ d6 ] , [ f3 ]  I play the Sämisch Variation. It is named after Friedrich Sämisch who developed the system in the 1920s. This often leads to very sharp play with the players castling on opposite wings and attacking each other's kings. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King's_Indian_Defence#S.C3.A4misch_Variation:_5.[ f3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B e3 ]  [ e5 ]  [ d5 ]  [ c6 ]  [ B d3 ] , [ N b d7 ]  This is all commonly seen. I now come up with a move which is questionable. Correct is [ N g e2 ] or Qd2.
 [ B c4 ] , [ d6 ]  And Stanley waists no time to develop since there's now an open line for the Bc8. As black I probably would've fianchetto'd with either 6...[ b6 ] or 6...[ g6 ] for a similar reason. But like me after the game I discovered that Stanley is also under a similar time restraint since he also leaves very shortly after noon local time.
 [ N x e7 ]  [ K x e7 ]  [ R c d1 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ R f e1 + ] , [ N e4 ]  Forced.
 [ K g7 ]  [ K c2 ]  [ R c8 ] , [ B h3 ]  setting a trap which black doesn't fall into right now but...
 [ N f6 ] , [ B c4 ]  Definitely NOT the best idea moving the bishop three times.
 [ B g7 ] , [ B e3 ]  good move protecting [ d4 ] and preparing a bayonnet attack toward the fianchetoed bishop (further [ Q d2 ] and Bh6)
 [ a3 ]  [ K e8 ] , [ b4 ]  To get rid of the bishop on the pawn issue and allow my rook freedom to move around.
 [ B f8 ]  [ N g3 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ] , [ B b7 ]  17. ..... [ B b7 ] - rather than trade knights I decided to develop a piece Fou Leblanc to defend my [ c6 ] knight. Chris initiates the trade because he sees that my [ d6 ] isolani is a bit of a weakie.
 [ N e2 ]  [ B b4 ]  [ a3 ]  [ B x c3 + ]  [ N e x c3 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ e4 ]  [ N f4 ]  [ O-O ] , [ Q x h4 ]  Free pawn!
 [ K x f6 ] , [ N d5 + ]  And Black resigned facing the inevitable 30.Nxc7.
 [ Q x g4 ]  [ h x g4 ] , [ N f6 ]  I activate my knight. White resigned.
 [ f4 ] , [ K f5 ]  the final move of the game threatening rxg5+. thus concluded my greatest upset victory.
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ d5 ]  [ d6 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ N b d7 ] , [ B f4 ]  nothing out off the ordinary in this Sicilian: but this move throws it into a totally different opening system; Ben Oni style...
 [ Q f3 ] , [ B b7 ]  Moved light bishop onto [ b7 ] to take control of diagonal pointing to [ h1 ] and in order to make counterattack on white queen. Bishop is protected by black queen so white queen will have to find another route to attack.
 [ b x c3 ]  [ e ] , [ p ]  The first official novelty in the position that I can see. In the game between Ivanov and Morev [ B g4 ] was played but that position white can play [ c5 ] and pick up [ b4 ] pressure [ c6 ] play [ h3 ] to kill the white bishop and break through in the center. This seems equally as bad opening the b file totally and they could never really contest it because white's threats are too strong.
 [ c x d5 ]  [ R e1 ] , [ R f7 ]  To stop [ Q e7 ] ch followed by exchange of Q.
 [ c x b5 ]  [ B x b5 ] , [ Q b3 + ]  45. [ Q [ b3 ] + ] - Glenda puts herself on [ b3 ] but look how aggressive she is now. The black lsb is now hanging but after black puts his king on [ e8 ] Glenda eyes much bigger game ......
 [ B f5 ] , [ N c6 ]  [ N c6 ] Black develops another knight.
 [ a x b4 ]  [ a x b4 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ b5 ]  [ N e5 + ]  [ K d4 ]  [ N x g4 ]  [ K c5 ]  [ R e5 + ] , [ K c6 ]  [It is obvious now that black will have to give back the knight to stop the dangerous passer which would leave him with an extra h-pawn in the R vs. R endgame. Unfortunately this kind of rook endgame has drawish tendencies unless the defender’s king is cut off very far (at least on the d-file).]
 [ e x d3 ]  [ Q x d3 ]  [ R a c8 ]  [ B f3 ]  [ R f d8 ] , [ R f d1 ]  I don't have a specific reason or plan in mind to put this rook over here but it looks more useful here than on f1. I'm thinking that if he pushes [ [ d4 ] ] I'll look at putting my queen or [ [ d4 ] ] and [ e5 ] and trading on [ d5 ] -- with a checkmate threat on the long diagonal pinning his knight. If he doesn't play [ c4 ] and I'm thinking he won't because he gives up control in the center I'll have to decide what to do with the queen. I want to leave the d-file and let the rook have it instead of the queen. I haven't looked at [ Q e2 ] or [ e4 ] yet. [ Q b5 ] doesn't thrill me because I feel my queen is doing more than his is.
 [ B d7 ]  [ N b d2 ]  [ a5 ] , [ N e5 ]  15. [ N e5 ] - after completing my development it is time to prepare a storming of the castled position. This is the first time on gameknot that I have sacrificed a piece when material has been relatively even - only a piece up here. Even if the sac does not work I may still end up a clear pawn or two to the good which should be enough to secure an endgame victory.
 [ R x d4 ] , [ R x d4 ]  ...and with the extra pawn I get the first rook exchange...
 [ R x h6 + ]  [ K g7 ] , [ R e6 ]  Its too late for white to start gobbling up pawns because im going to queen the pawn on the next move.
 [ e6 ]  [ Q x a5 ]  [ N x a5 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ b6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B b7 ] , [ R f c1 ]  Now 15... O-O 16. [ R c7 ] [ R f c8 ] 17. [ R a c1 ] [ R x c7 ] 18. [ R x c7 ] [ R c8 ] 19. [ R d7 ] [ K f8 ] equal.
 [ h6 + ] , [ K g8 ]  Now white needs to achieve a position where the black bishop is on [ B4 ] and white can play [ R c6 ] with an attack on both the b pawn and the Fpawn.
 [ e6 ] , [ N c3 ]  Stockfish 9 still prefers 4. e3.
 [ K d6 ]  [ K d3 ]  [ g6 ] , [ K c4 ]  34. [ K c4 ] - after putting Henry into a very commanding looking position to deter [ N c5 ] I decided to hit the offer draw button and see if Dave thought my Joblock was effective enough. He thought it was and kindly accepted my draw offer. I have a couple of promising looking results in my active games list at the moment. If only I can pull off victories in those two games then I may well regain my Class A 1800+ status. Ah well I hope you all enjoyed the Royal Wedding and this lurvely early summer weather.
 [ K f1 ]  [ N g3 + ]  [ K f2 ]  [ K b4 ]  [ K e1 ]  [ K c3 ]  [ K f2 ]  [ K d3 ]  [ K e1 ]  [ K e3 ]  [ K d1 ]  [ K x f3 ]  [ K c2 ]  [ h3 ]  [ K b2 ]  [ h2 ]  [ K b3 ]  [ h1 = Q ]  [ K b4 ]  [ Q c1 ]  [ K b5 ]  [ Q c3 ]  [ K b6 ]  [ K e4 ]  [ K b7 ]  [ Q c4 ]  [ K b8 ]  [ Q c5 ]  [ K b7 ]  [ K d5 ] , [ K b8 ]  I just resigned here. It wouldn't be too hard to win as black from here. I'm on 2/7 points. The leaders are on 3/7 points.
 [ d x e5 ] , [ B e6 ]  The center is definitely blocked and most of black pieces are aiming at the white king.
 [ N b7 ]  [ R b8 ]  [ N d6 ]  [ B c7 ]  [ N f5 ]  [ g6 ]  [ N h6 ]  [ K g7 ]  [ N g4 ]  [ f5 ]  [ N e3 ]  [ f4 ]  [ N g4 ]  [ h5 ]  [ N f2 ]  [ R h f8 ]  [ N d3 ]  [ R b e8 ]  [ h3 ]  [ g5 ]  [ R h1 ]  [ h4 ]  [ K b2 ]  [ f3 ]  [ g x f3 ]  [ R x f3 ]  [ N e1 ]  [ R f1 ] , [ R x f1 ]  Oh dear. I blundered. Now this interesting endgame will take longer than I thought...
 [ B e7 ] , [ c4 ]  Challanging the pawn which is holding [ e4 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N d f6 ] , [ N d2 ]  fight is all around e4. white can't keep black from posting a N here but can definately exchange to reduce pressure
 [ g x h5 ] , [ Q x h5 ]  This looks bad for black. Try to find his best defense.
 [ K e1 ] , [ Q x e5 + ]  Faced with the loss of the rook as well as four pawns White resigns. It's 2-1 to me phishbone6984...better luck next time...
 [ d4 ] , [ b6 ]  This forces White to trade because if [ b4 ] then I play [ a5 ] and White's pawn structure collapses.
 [ b3 ] , [ N e4 ]  The first foray by either player into the other's territory.
 [ N f4 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ N h5 ]  [ B a5 ] , [ B c6 ]  Black had to stop the threat of Rc7.
 [ c x d4 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ Q g3 ]  [ N b4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N x d3 + ]  [ Q x d3 ] , [ Q x e5 + ]  A pawn was lost but he avoided other problems---for the moment.
 [ K e5 ]  [ R e7 + ] , [ K d4 ]  Well this helps Black ... gets to pull the R's off the board.
 [ N b d7 ] , [ B g2 ]  [ B g2 ] ready for 0-0
 [ Q g5 + ]  [ K f2 ]  [ Q g3 + ] , [ K e2 ]  Obviously the White King seeks shelter on the Queen side but with a combinative attack from Blacks Queen Knight and Bishop it is doomed even there.
 [ R e7 ]  [ N d2 ] , [ B d4 ]  this move prevents [ f3 ] for now
 [ B x e6 + ]  [ R x e6 ]  [ N x e6 ]  [ Q x e6 ] , [ Q b3 ]  I trade down material since I am ahead by a rook minus a knight.
 [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ N f6 ]  The sicilian. seems to be very common I am trying to adopt it as my opening for black still learning but getting there :)
 [ N f6 ] , [ N f3 ]  I play the Budapest but now it is impossible so... what?
 [ R x b2 ]  [ a x b2 ]  [ K d5 ] , [ N c3 + ]  check and queen on the next
 [ N c6 ] , [ B b5 ]  Following my opening play this is the only consistent way to proceed. I want to isolate a pawn on [ c6 ] if possible and dominate the game with ne5.
 [ e6 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ Q d2 ] , [ B e7 ]  Both sides continue to develop perhaps Black needs to take an opportunity to be more adventourous maybe [ Q b3 ] or another pawn move d5? As Black I never know when the 'right' time to strike is.
 [ B d2 ] , [ b4 ]  As is seen here one of the factors that White must contend with after the Queen's Gambit Accepted is Black building up massive control over the queenside wing often pushing pawns far into White's territory.
 [ B g2 ] , [ R a f7 ]  Attractive isn't it? Yet it might not have been Black's best option at this moment. White was (is) actually threatening 27.f4! and the only good way to deal with that threat seems to be to hoik the queen off the f-file: 26...Qd8.
 [ B f8 ]  [ B g2 ]  [ B e7 ] , [ Q h5 ]  White's queen reaches an active square and [ e4 ] is threatened.
 [ e4 ]  [ c6 ] , [ B x h6 ]  This seems like a good move to me though I usually would not like to trade off a bishop so soon but it takes away a knight and opens up his castled position. In this aspect I see it as a trade with a bit of gain for me.
 [ B b4 ] , [ R g7 ]  ?? loses big material [ B x e8 ] is devastating to bad I missed it :(.
 [ N h5 ] , [ f5 ]  His white bishop is completely boxed in. If he captures the pawn with [ g x f5 ] then he will lose his knight to Qxh5. If he takes the pawn with [ B f5 ] then I am tempted to trade my rook with 17. [ R x f5 ] [ g x f5 ] 18. Qxh5. An alternative for him here might be to play for time by running around with the knight eg Ng3.
 [ N f3 ] , [ B c5 ]  redfoxrising: 7. [ Q e2 ] need to combat the threats to the [ f2 ] square 7. [ Q e2 ] is my suggested vote. supersparksky: 7.[ Q e2 ] 7.[ Q e2 ] is our only move redfoxrising: I agree We should discuss our next moves... [ Q e2 ] and then what ifs moves she makes. looking at future moves... 7.[ Q e2 ] [ B f5 ] 8.[ B e3 ] or another move... O-O She could castle Not so sure that we should Castle 0-0-0. We might be able to castle 0-0. if we get our LSB out. archduke_piccolo: 7.[ Q e2 ] [ B f5 ] I suggest build up against [ e4 ] by 8.Nfd2. Why the king's knight instead of the queen's? We want the other knight to go to [ c3 ] when (if?) Black plays 8...Qxd4. To be sure Black will want to play ...Bf2ch but that's fine. Off to [ d1 ] our king goes. The line in summary: 7.[ Q e2 ] [ B f5 ] 8.[ N f d2 ] Bf2ch 9.K[ d1 ] [ Q x d5 ] 10.N[ c3 ] thewrongreason: If I had this position and were white I'd answer with 7.[ B d3 ] and when the N would retreat I'd then castle. But I agree with the others for a completely different reason. So my vote is 7.[ Q e2 ] simply because it pins her N[ e4 ] with a not so easy way out.
 [ B f4 ]  [ Q b4 ] , [ O-O-O ]  protecting the [ b2 ]  [ g4 ]  [ N e7 ]  [ B h6 ] , [ N d5 ]  note that this knight is there to dearrange my kings position a defensive move will be 14.[ N x d5 ] [ Q x d2 ] 15. [ B x d2 ] [ c x d5 ] this sequence will lead to a very constricted game for black with a lead in development for white. I did not find it exciting enough.
 [ f4 ]  [ f6 + ]  [ K g4 ]  [ B d7 + ]  [ K f3 ] , [ B d6 ]  You resigned. Though I don't see an immediate mate threat there was no way to defend your e-pawn. ******************************************************************** Good game Ananya! Glad to play you!
 [ B f6 ] , [ N x e4 ]  Now if black threatens the white queen with [ e5 ] white moves her and trades a knight.
 [ e x f7 ] , [ R d f8 ]  ?? At first I thought that he used the other R. For some reason this is the one that Carl used. But it loses as I'm about to promote and even when Carl recaptures I'm about to wind up a R+P. Be it note that this is the long term sequence that I had visualized since 17.[ Q h5 ] Even if the short term worked it was more likely that the long term wouldn't. In fact had Carl prevented me from capturing recaptured or used the other R it would not have been possible for me to promote and win significant material the way that it happened.
 [ B c5 ]  [ c3 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ h3 ]  [ B h5 ] , [ g4 ]  I hesitated long before playing this move because it makes short castle almost impossible and the black d pawn makes long castle risky as well but I thought that the double pawn on e would give white a strong center and that I would anyway been on attack which suits me better but if strong counterattack the defense will be doubtless.
 [ O-O ] , [ N f3 ]  Best. White cannot play 10.[ e x d6 ] because Black can continue ..[ [ a6 ] ] and ..[ N b6 ] (a popular if temporary square for a knight in the Benoni hitting [ d5 ] and c4) when White's newly doubled and isolated d-pawns will both drop and his king is still in the center 2 moves from castling! The materialistic shall not prosper in the Benoni. Alternative variation: 10. exd6? [ [ a6 ] ] 11. [ B e2 ] [ N b6 ]  [ a6 ]  [ B e2 ] , [ b5 ]  The typical Benoni queenside counterplay except without the [ d5 ] pawn Black's [ c5 ] pawn is particularly weak.
 [ K f1 ]  [ Q g2 + ]  [ K e1 ]  [ Q g1 + ]  [ K d2 ] , [ Q x f2 + ]  Yes black could have taken the rook on [ a1 ] but that is a distraction from the business at hand to checkmate the king and besides the rook on [ e3 ] is hanging too (well it will be as soon as the king is chased away). However [ R d8 + ] would have been a more accurate move.
 [ R b2 ]  [ R d5 ]  [ B d2 ]  [ R d3 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ K g7 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ K f6 ]  [ B g3 ]  [ K g5 ]  [ R f2 ]  [ f5 ]  [ B c7 ]  [ h4 ]  [ B f4 + ]  [ K h5 ]  [ R b2 ] , [ g5 ]  Things would get difficult if I allowed White to play [ R b8 ] whilst my pawn was still on g6.
 [ B x e2 ] , [ Q x e2 ]  So Bishops are exchanged
 [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ Q a4 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ d5 ]  [ B d7 ] , [ Q d1 ]  White's queen spends a lot of time dancing back and forth between [ d1 ] & [ a4 ] while black develops his position.
 [ O-O ] , [ c3 ]  Freeing his queen but blocking the square for the knight.
 [ R d2 + ] , [ K e1 ]  Offering him a pawn back but virtually the only move for instance 32. Kg3? Bd6! and wins or 32. Kg1? Re2! and wins
 [ R g4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ g6 ]  [ Q f6 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ Q x e5 ]  [ R x f4 ]  [ N e3 ]  [ R d4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ R d2 ] , [ R x h4 ]  Taking the unprotected pawn
 [ K e7 ] , [ d6 + ]  He's welcome to the knight. It simplifies matters. If ...[ K x f6 ] then d7. Either I queen or he loses a rook for my knight and pawn or...
 [ Q f5 ] , [ O-O ]  21. 0-0 - at last! Bob responds with [ c6 ] - I expect you wonder - why did Bob not take the [ f4 ] pawn? Well it is poisonous because if Qxf4?? then the Witch will be pinned to her other half right on the h2-[ b8 ] diagonal by Fou Lenoir. Yup watch those pins! It will save you or net you big rating points!
 [ Q c2 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B d3 ] , [ g6 ]  this is not very meaningful actually. detoriating blacks pawn position. [ N b d7 ] could be a more common option.
 [ B g5 + ] , [ B e7 ]  only move again since [ K e8 ] is met by [ Q f7 # ]  [ B x e7 + ] , [ K x e7 ]  Again only move.
 [ N a6 ] , [ b4 ]  not allowing Nc5.
 [ c6 ]  [ N g5 ] , [ N h6 ]  Necessary.
 [ R d1 ] , [ R g2 ]  Black has one plan push that f pawn note that it can't be taken 35.[ Q x f3 ] Qc2#.
 [ Q x e3 + ]  [ Q x e3 ]  [ R x e3 ] , [ K x e3 ]  black resigns here. The inequality in material being too big - a fine game very open with plenty of complex posibilities for both sides and therefore a buch of mistakes - thanks to facecrumbs for the game.
 [ Q c2 ] , [ Q e3 ]  however I spot my error and now white has a good position
 [ K f3 ] , [ Q a4 ]  I think that Sue was worried about the b pawn. But Dun is going to promote again. I think I would've been able to mate already since [ Q d7 ] would've been played earlier with the same variations that I noted.
 [ f5 ] , [ a4 ]  Now if white plays 23. bxa4? black replies with 23. ... [ R x a4 ] and then moves like [ Q a5 ] and r[ f a1 ] line up a powerful attack against white's king - an attack that I don't think white could survive.
 [ N x d4 ]  [ Q x d4 ]  [ B g7 ] , [ e4 ]  White's only hope is to develop quickly.
 [ a5 ] , [ h4 ]  White missed his chance to take the pawn
 [ e5 ] , [ N c3 ]  If my opponent responds [ e5 ] I generally go to the Vienna Game because I always get very interesting and fun games with it.
 [ a4 ] , [ B c6 ]  In just a few moves the position has changed. Now I'm the one with all the active mobil pieces and Black is the one with the cramped position. And material advantages are less useful in cramped positions so I'm not really "totally" losing. Just losing.
 [ B g5 ] , [ e4 ]  The idea behind this is to open up my bishop's diagonal and win the exchange by tactical means. Little did I know that winning the exchange would cost me the exchange as I will explain later. ...[ d5 ] was probably the superior choice but I was afraid that I would not be able to hold the e pawn
 [ h3 ]  [ B h5 ]  [ d3 ]  [ c x d3 ] , [ c x d3 ]  I like this position. My bishop has a clean line to operate.
 [ a4 ]  [ R h d8 ]  [ c4 ]  [ b6 ] , [ b4 ]  21. [ b4 ] - three little white pawnies all in a row! Dave finds a way to puncture this arrangement however.
 [ K f2 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ B b2 ]  [ N a4 ]  [ B x b5 ] , [ N x b2 ]  [ R x b5 ] is better. It leave white with a passive bishop under attack by the knight and rook as well as "lift" black's rook and allow his 2nd one to link on the b file.
 [ N c4 ]  [ d x c6 + ]  [ b x c6 ] , [ N x c4 + ]  Forced mate in 1 : 22. ... [ K c8 ] 23. [ Q x c6 ] Black quit the plane opening the parachute before the crash. Thanks to Stalhandske for this lesson : one must know when to change the plan and defend .
 [ B d6 ] , [ Q x g7 ]  This was the best move for this position because it put pressure on his rook and it prevented from exchanging my bishop with Nxf1.
 [ N x d4 ] , [ e6 ]  Black transposes into the Taimanov line but most probably his main reason for this move is to free his bishop for an attack. On gameknot the line is still called Sicilian (B32) Flohr variation.
 [ d x e5 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ B c5 + ]  [ K h1 ] , [ N g4 ]  Suddenly it is white who is underdeveloped! What on earth happened? Last I checked black was the one who needed development!
 [ B h3 ]  [ N h4 ]  [ Q g5 ] , [ K h1 ]  I thought this was best. I end up down a pawn and there's a clear breach in my king's wall of pawns but at least I'm only down a pawn.
 [ N x f2 ] , [ e5 ]  only one safe place for Black's knight to go...
 [ Q x c6 ]  [ R c4 + ]  [ Q x c4 ]  [ Q x c4 + ]  [ R c2 ]  [ B x f4 + ]  [ K b1 ] , [ Q e4 ]  0-1 Here White resigns. Within the Pirc Defense lies many tactical ideas and sac's. If White is not prepared he can be crushed. annotated by D. Bissing
 [ d3 ]  [ e x d3 ] , [ e x d3 ]  12. [ e x d3 ] - Dave solidifies his pawn structure on the queenside.
 [ B d5 + ]  [ K h8 ]  [ N g6 + ]  [ N x g6 ]  [ Q x g6 ]  [ Q e8 ] , [ R x h6 + ]  --!!-- Ouch! Black resigns.
 [ d5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ B g5 ]  Torre attack I guess? I like it - it's solid and aggressive at the same time
 [ Q d8 + ]  [ Q x d8 ]  [ N x d8 + ]  [ K x d8 ]  [ K x h2 ]  [ B e6 ] , [ c3 ]  Julen Arizmendi's suggestion after Arizmendi - García Román Cullera op 2005. 15. [ B e3 ] f5; 16. [ N c3 ] Ke7; 17. [ g4 ] was played at Capablanca - Lasker New York 1915.
 [ d x e5 ] , [ N x e5 ]  ...his center has dissipated and I'm up a Pawn as well.
 [ B e2 ] , [ Q g6 ]  This is the extent of opening theory that I know of this opening. From here I'm on my own.
 [ N d5 ] , [ d4 ]  Even though I decided to give chase center presence seemed more important...
 [ B d5 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ B x e3 ]  [ f x e3 ] , [ N g4 ]  The way to guard against that is to keep a knight controlling h4.
 [ K e7 ]  [ B x d5 ]  [ B x d5 ]  [ N c7 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N x a8 ]  [ R x a8 ]  [ c4 ]  [ B x c4 ] , [ d x c4 ]  Let's just pretend that never happened. 12. [ N f3 ] but I had to be aggressive. (I'm trying to teach myself a lesson here don't mind me.)
 [ Q a5 ] , [ f5 ]  White threats to win material: f5[ x e6 ] Alternative variation: 19. [ a3 ] $14
 [ B x f3 ]  [ B x f3 ]  [ Q b6 ] , [ N e2 ]  I move the knight to protect [ d4 ] and to free up the pawn on c3.
 [ N c7 ]  [ R x f7 ]  [ N x a8 ] , [ N x g5 ]  Get rid of the annoying f pawn and the bishop. The knight is somewhat out of play. White has two options: take back or save his it's own knight.
 [ a3 ] , [ B e6 ]  Freeing up my queen to attack the [ d4 ] pawn.
 [ R f b8 ] , [ f5 ]  23. [ f5 ] - I now try and bust open the BK's position but alas this proves to be premature according to Gameknot Analysis which suggested 23. Ne6. Please refer to the link for further detail.
 [ N f4 ]  [ Q e8 ] , [ N c d5 ]  it's action time
 [ B e7 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ N e1 ]  [ c5 ] , [ B e3 ]  9. [ B e3 ] - Further development and additional defense of [ d4 ] pawn.
 [ N b3 + ]  [ K c3 ] , [ Q d4 # ]  A rather pretty mate if you ask me!
 [ R d5 ]  [ K g2 ]  [ c6 ]  [ b4 ] , [ N e6 ]  "Dad! He is blockading me again and with the best blockader his knight." "Don't worry Paula it is all under control."
 [ b3 ]  [ a x b3 ] , [ N x b3 ]  23. ...... Nxb3!! - a stunning knight sacrifice. I decided to ignore the attack on the rook by playing [ f5 ] because if Nxc1?? then [ f6 ] may well cook Ion's goose for him.
 [ O-O ] , [ B d3 ]  Alternative variation: 9. [ B g5 ] [is met by ] 9... [ R e8 ] 10. [ B d3 ] [ c4 ] Alternative variation: 9. [ B e2 ] [ R e8 ] 10. [ N d2 ] [ N a6 ] 11. O-O [ N c7 ] 12. [ a4 ] [ R b8 ] [⩲]
 [ N d5 ]  [ N x b5 + ]  [ K b6 ]  [ N a3 ]  [ R h3 + ] , [ K g2 ]  43. ... [ N d5 ] is a nice forcing also; white has to follow... All is pretty much forced for both sides... 46. [ K g4 ] works also... This is a very tense position. 46. ... Nxc3/[ N e3 + ] 47. Nxc4+/[ K x g2 ] doesn't work... In fact 46. ... [ R h5 ] 47. [ R d4 ] neither...
 [ N c5 ]  [ B x c5 ] , [ R x c5 ]  18. ........... [ R x c5 ] - a black rook takes a dominant stance in the place of the black knight maintaining pressure on the queenside.
 [ e x f6 ]  [ B x f6 ] , [ N g5 ]  forcing the h file open for my rooks
 [ B g5 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ O-O ] , [ c6 ]  The [ [ d5 ] ] pawn was weak. Without the advance at [ c6 ] white could play 10. [ B x f6 ] [ B x f6 ] 11. [ B b5 ] and now if black blocks with [ B d7 ] the pawn at [ [ d5 ] ] would have no defender so black would have to play [ K f8 ] ruining his castling and imiting the scope of the rook at h8.
 [ O-O ] , [ N d2 ]  After 11. [ Q x c4 ] Qb6! (threatens Ba6) 12. [ b4 ] [ B d6 ] 13. [ a4 ] [ h6 ] 14. [ N f3 ] Bg4...
 [ R e7 ] , [ N g5 ]  Black is approaching zungswang had limited options since [ N e5 ] loses the knight to the pin
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ f4 ]  [ e x f4 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ g5 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ g4 ]  [ O-O ]  [ g x f3 ] , [ Q x f3 ]  Difficult opening hard to play for white
 [ B d3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ O-O ] , [ e5 ]  Inviting to close off the center with [ d5 ] with a permanent doubled pawn or for the center to be broken up.
 [ N c3 ] , [ N x e4 ]  Now things get interesting this looks like a free pawn but I will 0-0 and then the knight may get in trouble after [ R e1 ]  [ O-O ] , [ N x c3 ]  He took my knight this looks like there is going to be another free pawn but things will not turn out the way black wanted it to be.
 [ K d5 ] , [ N a1 ]  I think my opponent took this a little bit too hard.
 [ R h6 ]  [ b3 ]  [ h4 ]  [ R h e1 ]  [ R g6 ]  [ f3 ]  [ R a6 ] , [ R a c1 ]  23. [ R a c1 ] - doubly protects c3.
 [ N x c3 ] , [ B c5 ]  no good either is [ Q x c3 ] [ R f e8 ] 0-0 [ R x e7 ] [ R d e1 ] [ R a e8 ] [ N e5 ] Be6...
 [ R x g8 ] , [ N f7 # ]  A beautiful smothered mate.
 [ e5 ] , [ N f3 ]  Pawn in trouble
 [ b5 ]  [ R f1 ]  [ b4 ]  [ K d2 ]  [ b3 ]  [ R b1 ]  [ B b4 + ]  [ K d3 ] , [ B e1 ]  White resigns. Please rate and comment I can use the insights.
 [ h5 ] , [ N g f3 ]  Black wants to expand I have to stop it.
 [ R x a7 ] , [ R x a7 ]  ...followed by the rooks.
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ d5 ]  [ d6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ g6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ e4 ] , [ B g4 ]  White has more space here but black has further development 4 vs 2.
 [ e x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ c6 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ O-O ] , [ N c5 ]  All standard moves to here but then black started to apply the pressure building up a small but definite advantage
 [ R a d1 ] , [ K e8 ]  Getting off the dangerous d-file (though this actually allows the WQ to penetrate and set up a mating net there was really nothing Black could have done at this point).
 [ Q x h6 ]  [ Q d4 + ]  [ B e3 ]  [ Q d1 + ] , [ R f1 ]  thank goodness for that rook. I was dead without it.
 [ N x b1 ]  [ Q b6 ]  [ N b d2 ]  [ N a6 ]  [ h3 ]  [ N c5 ]  [ B d4 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ N e1 ] , [ R b8 ]  Again using the b-file.
 [ B x f6 ]  [ B e4 ]  [ B x b2 ]  [ R b1 ] , [ B a3 ]  I thought about [ B f6 ] also. [ B a3 ] seems like it puts the B out of play but it also prevents [ a4 ] and protects d6.
 [ B c1 ]  [ R e3 e7 ]  [ B d5 ] , [ Q x a4 ]  Alas ! One pawn loss.
 [ Q x c8 + ]  [ Q d8 ]  [ Q x b7 ] , [ B a3 ]  This forces a bishop trade.
 [ N b6 ] , [ Q c7 ]  My queen comes in to seek more material.
 [ B g7 ]  [ O-O ] , [ c5 ]  Black needs to keep active in this line. 8. ... 0-0 9. [ B e3 ] can cause him some problems.
 [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ e5 ] , [ d x e5 ]  I think that my opponent was not extremely familiar with the Budapest as he spent a lot of time in almost all subsequent moves.
 [ c4 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N c3 ] , [ a6 ]  As a clockwork.
 [ h6 ] , [ N e6 ]  Black *could* choose here to exchange Queens [26... BxQ 27 NxQ] but elects not to.
 [ N f3 ] , [ Q d6 ]  ?
 [ K e6 ]  [ g4 ] , [ N e4 ]  There are few choices for the Black knight. It can only wait. Any foray it makes into White's Queen-side leaves the Black king with no defense.
 [ B e6 ]  [ e4 ] , [ N a6 ]  12. .......... [ N a6 ] - out comes the wood!
 [ N e4 ]  [ R c1 ] , [ b5 ]  This doesn't really stop [ c4 ] so I'm not sure of Black's intention here.
 [ N c6 ] , [ N f3 ]  It block my queen to [ g4 ] but it's a natural defensive move.
 [ B c5 + ]  [ K h1 ] , [ b4 ]  An attempt to complicate. However my threats are superior.
 [ B f4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ Q f3 ]  [ R g8 ]  [ K h1 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ R f g1 ]  [ c5 ]  [ a4 ]  [ Q d7 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ N e8 ]  [ e5 ]  [ B x g5 ]  [ R x g5 ]  [ Q d5 ]  [ Q x d5 ]  [ R x d5 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ f6 ]  [ R h5 ] , [ R h8 ]  ? Now black losses. g5! can resist some more time.
 [ R x d7 ]  [ R x d7 ]  [ f4 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ K e2 ] , [ B e7 ]  26. .......... [ B e7 ] - to avoid Frere Lenoir being pinned to my rook.
 [ B x g4 ]  [ Q e8 ] , [ N e6 + ]  10. [ N e6 + ] - still following on from Master Freddy's self-annotation and also my game against Master Freddy that I lost.
 [ N f3 ] , [ c5 ]  4...OK this makes sense
 [ c4 ] , [ N f6 ]  The most flexible reply to white's initial move. With this move black invites white to repent from his evil ways and transpose to a [ d4 ] Indian opening. Many white players may comply if black presents them with enough evidence that the Indian opening black has in mind is neither the Gruenfeld or the Benoni/Benko.
 [ N f3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ g3 ]  [ c5 ]  [ B g2 ] , [ B f5 ]  Already something of a departure from 'normal lines' by Black. A knight development or ...[ [ e6 ] ] seems more 'likely'. I figured that Black wanted to have his bishop outside the pawn chain with ...[ [ e6 ] ] to follow shortly. I was right about that...
 [ f3 ]  [ R e3 ] , [ N b5 ]  Here I thought I had a good line going and its not bad. I challenge whites control of the center though white will get a good grip.
 [ R e6 ] , [ R x d5 ]  Renewing the pin - only now it's a double pin as the knight is pinned against the rook AND h6. But White can survive this at least
 [ R x a6 ]  [ N f8 ]  [ R x d6 ]  [ K e7 ]  [ R b6 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ R x b5 ]  [ K d6 ]  [ e5 + ]  [ K c7 ] , [ e6 ]  The knight is lost: 42...[ N b6 ] or 42...[ N b8 ] 49. RxN KxN [ [ e7 ] ] when the pawn promotes or 42...[ N f8 ] 43.[ [ e7 ] ] and the e-pawn promotes.
 [ d5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ e3 ]  [ c5 ]  [ c4 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ d x c5 ]  Tartakower: Less consistent than 6.[ a3 ] or 6.[ B d3 ] maintaining as long as possible the tension in the center.
 [ Q x d4 ] , [ Q x d4 ]  I played this partly because this was a timed game and I couldn't think of any great squares to move my Queen to on the spot. Besides I figured the prospects I already had should serve me well enough.
 [ R f e8 ] , [ B x f7 + ]  Now [ f7 ] falls. The B on [ g6 ] cannot recapture because of the pin by the Q. Te K can't capture because of the Rf1. All White's pieces except his QR are involved in the attack and mate is inevitable: 23....[ K h8 ] 24. [ B g7 + + ]  [ R x e3 ]  [ R x e3 ]  [ f x g7 ] , [ R a e8 ]  Things have settled and Black has good reasons to be happy with his position. His Rook pair is in complete control of the e-file his King is safer than mine and he still has a menacing Q-side pawn majority. But I still have a few tricks up my sleeve.
 [ N d2 ] , [ e5 ]  Opening the center.
 [ N b d2 ] , [ R g7 ]  Nothing comes from [ B d3 ] even if evil-looking...
 [ R a e8 ] , [ B e3 ]  white entrenches. His biggest advantage is the queen and it's still not in play. Plus [ N x e3 ] is going to be a darn good move.
 [ f4 ]  [ c x b5 ]  [ f x e5 ]  [ d x e5 ] , [ N x c3 ]  12. [ N x [ c3 ] ] - after an exchange of white's lsb for my knight white finally collects my [ c3 ] pawn. I now gain a vital developmental tempo for Frere Lenoir with [ B c5 ]  [ B c5 + ]  [ K h1 ]  [ O-O ] , [ N x b5 ]  14. [ N x b5 ] - I decided to let the b pawn go in order to tuck Henry away on the kingside and to bring another defender to the weak pawn on [ f7 ] which is pinned against Henry. Somehow I must drive the Wicked Witch of the West off the a2-[ g8 ] diagonal.
 [ g x h4 ] , [ R x h5 ]  yes mate in one maybe 2 if the queen blocks
 [ N f1 ] , [ c6 ]  strengthen this side 2
 [ f4 ] , [ B b3 + ]  he should resign
 [ Q a7 ]  [ N x f6 ]  [ e x f6 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ R g7 + ]  [ K h6 ] , [ B x d5 ]  Theorically a bishop has a 3-points value and a pawn has only 1 point....Well in this case that pawn has a higher value than my bishop.
 [ d x c4 ]  [ Q d7 ] , [ f5 ]  locking down the kingside I see the coming queenside castle and I'm resisting the opening against my king.
 [ B d6 ] , [ N d4 ]  Wanting to play [ B b5 ] to kick the DSB or jump into c6.
 [ R x c1 ] , [ d4 ]  I need the d file.
 [ R c1 ]  [ B e7 ] , [ Q c2 ]  (In case of the immediate 12. [ N x c4 ] black has strong resourse 12... [ a6 ] for example 13. [ Q x d8 ] [ B x d8 ] 14. [ N d6 ] [ a x b5 ] 15. [ R x c8 ] [ R x c8 ] 16. [ N x c8 ] [ f5 ] 17. [ b3 ] [ B f6 ] 18. [ N d6 ] [ b4 ] with equality)
 [ N f6 ] , [ c4 ]  This common second move stakes further claim to the center. I do sometimes play 2. [ N f3 ] especially against a particular opponent outside of GK who has destroyed me multiple times with the double-edged Budapest Gambit (1. [ d4 ] [ N f6 ] 2. [ c4 ] e5).
 [ Q x a3 ]  [ b x a3 ]  [ B x a3 ]  [ h3 ] , [ B e7 ]  I can't figure out any way of getting at the King with the pieces I have. I've got to free up my other rook and that means trading off the black square Bishop. It removes my bishop pair advantage but I have a passed pawn to make up for that and perhaps soon I'll have two.
 [ R x e7 ]  [ f x g3 ] , [ R x c7 ]  First idea was that I'm going to exchange the pieces and loose because of a few pawns. Very disappointed about my pawn move. Running after pawns did not look like a strategy for me so I had to find something else. After some thinking I came with a plan (the only plan I could see for this game) while he was cleaning the place.
 [ B h4 ]  [ g5 ] , [ Q h5 ]  Trying to get some form of sompensation for the piece that will be lost although it is really clutching at straws.
 [ a6 ]  [ R f e1 ] , [ f6 ]  Pawn chain of doom
 [ N x f4 + ]  [ K g3 ] , [ R g1 # ]  and i fluke a vital win... not the best of games in terms of errors... we both played badly at times and well at other times... but an enjoyable game nonetheless... and this win most certainly restored my faith in the dutch opening... ok it can leave you wide open if you make the smallest of mistakes but there are always dangerous attacking options...
 [ c x b3 ] , [ c x b3 ]  And this was also anticipated. Sure the pin is gone and can't tempo for now but part of the plan behind this was not directly (since I don't take over a week) but it's indirectly stalling a lost game. In this context stalling does not mean taking more time but simply delaying it. My take is to do just the one move attacks. When he breaks the real plan I'm still going and haven't been defeated. It's not about being "Mr. Know it all" as some might think. But it's still boils down to how much longer I'll last. So far I'm doing better then expected. Initially I thought I'd only survive 25 moves but mate is not in sight yet. In fact I also keep in mind that it'll take much longer for white to have a mate.
 [ N e5 ]  [ B x e5 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ N e d5 ] , [ B c3 ]  Black can't play [ N x c3 ] immediately because of Rxd8.
 [ R h3 ]  [ N d5 ] , [ K e6 ]  ?? I was trying to get my king involved but I think this was a pretty bad blunder as it allows him to win my knight.
 [ a6 ]  [ Q e4 ]  [ R a7 ] , [ d5 ]  Now Whites centre-pawns comes rolling and Blacks pieces are totally un-coordinated. Here already I had the feeling it would be a short game ...
 [ B c5 + ]  [ K g2 ]  [ N h5 ] , [ e6 ]  Losing the pushed pawn by a simple fork
 [ Q d7 ]  [ d x e5 ] , [ b5 ]  Moving Queen away attack the Bishop with a pawn rather taking the pawn at e5.
 [ c7 ] , [ K h6 ]  
 [ N x c4 ] , [ Q e7 ]  Removing the Queen from the line of fire but the best move was 12...Rd8.
 [ B c4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N g4 ] , [ O-O ]  The immediate [ d4 ] is perhaps more popular.
 [ R a c1 ] , [ g6 ]  21. ..... [ g6 ] - alas I find myself without a plan here and so I end up playing a move which is not a disaster at this stage but it will be a step towards perdition.
 [ N c3 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ B g5 ]  The pin on the knight can get annoying but black has a variety of ways to respond.
 [ K e8 ] , [ B c4 ]  ...two bishops attacking...
 [ c x d4 ] , [ R e8 ]  Clearly the point of Black's previous move: Black contests the e-file with this rook and probably plans to redevelop his DSB on g7.
 [ c3 ]  [ O-O-O ] , [ N b d2 ]  10. [ N b d2 ] - Glenda looks particularly innocuous on [ d1 ] wouldn't you agree? Looking at her you would never believe that she is capable of creating mayhem in the opposition camp would you now?
 [ f x e6 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ N d5 ] , [ Q c5 ]  Both sides have chances. 19 N-[ B5 ] QxR 20 N(B5)xB BxP 21 NxR BxP leads to wild complications.
 [ B x c3 ]  [ b x c3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ c4 ]  [ B c6 ]  [ c3 ]  [ B x f3 ] , [ Q x f3 ]  Black seems to have equalised so my queen-chasing hasn't done me much good but now I develop a simple and strong plan and Black panics like a rabbit in the headlights.
 [ Q g3 ] , [ N g6 ]  Ah yes protect the g pawn...
 [ R x h6 ]  [ K g7 ]  [ R h3 ]  [ B f7 ]  [ d4 ]  [ Q a3 ] , [ g4 ]  This move gives White's king a place to go if it gets checked by Black's queen.
 [ K e1 ]  [ R x a1 ] , [ K d1 ]  guards the bishop
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ f4 ] , [ e x f4 ]  Conway's first mistake. Morphy absolutely thrives on open positions.
