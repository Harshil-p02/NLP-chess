 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ B b5 ]  The Ruy Lopez also known as the Spanish Game. Or the Spanish Torture.
 [ B h6 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ B c4 + ]  [ e6 ]  [ B f4 ] , [ Q e7 ]  My position is very tight but surprisingly allows for a decent counter-attack.
 [ d x e5 ]  [ d x e5 ] , [ Q x d8 + ]  Unpinning the Knight.
 [ c x d4 ] , [ e x d4 ]  Not interested in exchanging pieces so soon I'm not going for a draw. My pawns are solid and they will keep so.
 [ K e7 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ] , [ B x f2 + ]  A blunder by black leading to 8.[ K x f2 ] [ N x d5 ] 9.[ R f1 ] [ h6 ] 10.[ N f3 ] [ B e6 ] 11.[ d3 ] [ Q d6 ] 12.[ K g1 ] [ R a f8 ] 13.[ Q e1 ] [ K d8 ] 14.[ N c3 ] [ N x c3 ] 15.[ B x e6 ] [ Q x e6 ] 16.[ Q x c3 ] [ K c8 ] Where white is winning outright.
 [ B h7 ]  [ f4 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ f5 ] , [ O-O-O ]  So far Nimzowitsch hasn't paid off... Back to the books... So I needed a miracle... The threat [ B x h2 + ] is probably strong enough for now...
 [ d3 ]  [ R a b8 ] , [ B b2 ]  Defensive now Black gets a clear edge.
 [ R b8 ] , [ B c6 ]  Continuing to press.
 [ e5 ]  [ B g3 ] , [ B e7 ]  This impressive center is a lot less potent without a Queen to provide attacking chances. White is clearly better and Black is fighting to draw.
 [ R e2 ] , [ d5 ]  Cutting off any thoughts of [ B x e6 ] which could have been an attractive sacrifice if White could have got more pieces out before Black castled.
 [ h6 ]  [ N x d6 ]  [ Q x d6 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ Q e6 ]  [ R a c1 ]  [ N b6 ]  [ R f e1 ]  [ R e8 ] , [ B e5 ]  practically forced: after Nc3? [ Q x e1 + ] [ R x e1 ] [ R x e1 + ] [ B f1 ] [ B h3 ] all is over...
 [ K e3 ] , [ B x e5 ]  Bishop now takes pawn freely
 [ g5 ] , [ B x g5 ]  At least I get a pawn in return. It's true that I'm being overoptimistic but with no way out I think positive as opposed to negative. It's also important to note that being this way has helped me to improve as well.
 [ K x f7 ] , [ K h3 ]  ?
 [ d x e5 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ N h5 ]  [ Q e4 ]  [ N x f4 ] , [ Q x f4 ]  I'm liking the idea of the B on [ c4 ] with the queen aiming down at that [ f7 ] square Notice how the rook is trapped in by his own pawn because I didn't let him push on [ e5 ]  [ Q c7 ] , [ R f e1 ]  Bringing my rook to what is soon to be an open file. This is the first interesting position of the game. If black takes the pawn he is pinning his piece (13 ... [ B x e5 ] 14 [ N x e5 ] [ N x e5 ] or 13 ... Nxe5)
 [ R x h2 + ]  [ K g3 ] , [ R b2 ]  Nothing black could do.
 [ R b8 ]  [ R a2 ]  [ R x d4 ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ Q x f4 + ]  [ g3 ] , [ Q x d4 ]  Already a pawn and the exchange up Black has swapped the R for a B and 2 pawns so is still material up: 3 pawns.
 [ d3 ]  [ Q x h1 ]  [ B b5 + ]  [ N c6 ]  [ K f1 ]  [ B h3 + ]  [ K e2 ]  [ B g4 + ]  [ K f1 ]  [ R c8 ]  [ B x c6 + ]  [ Q x c6 ]  [ Q x c6 + ] , [ R x c6 ]  the swap.. the almighty swap!!
 [ R d6 ]  [ R a8 ] , [ R d8 ]  Black cannot prevent promotion.
 [ N c3 ]  [ c6 ] , [ R f d1 ]  ! if PxB RxB and Black got double pawns.
 [ b x c4 ] , [ Q e1 ]  Bringing my Q back towards the center of the board.
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ] , [ N x d4 ]  This is the infamous Maroczy bind. White makes sure that black will never be able to play ...d5. The downside is potentially weak central dark squares which the "dragon bishop" on [ g7 ] may be able to exploit.
 [ N f3 ]  [ f6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ K f7 ]  [ N b d2 ] , [ B d6 ]  12. .......... [ B d6 ] - but I still have work to do.
 [ K g7 ] , [ K c3 ]  ...so I move my king back one rank. I was thinking of [ N g4 ] then [ R g5 ] to allow my kingside pawns to advance to the 6th rank...
 [ B g5 ] , [ B e6 ]  Countering the pin with a developing move that guards the QP.
 [ B x c3 ] , [ N x c3 ]  thought about [ b x c3 ] but then he plays [ d5 ] so decided to play [ N x c3 ] instead
 [ O-O ] , [ B d6 ]  Continuing with his development. But I was asking myself if Tom had a weakness and I realized that it was the same B since I can now pin it which I'll do.
 [ R x h2 ]  [ K x h2 ] , [ Q h4 + ]  I don't need the lock when I can get a crushing material advantage. White resigned here about to lose the P[ g4 ] and I'll leave it to you to spot all the forks that pick up all of White's pieces. I hope you all enjoyed this annotation.
 [ K d7 ]  [ h5 ]  [ R b2 ] , [ R h4 ]  43. [ R h4 ] - dreaming of a kingside counter-attack ....
 [ a5 ]  [ N d3 ]  [ B a6 ]  [ h5 ] , [ B x c4 ]  There was no way to defend that pawn except moving [ N c1 ] which was not worth it. Sacking the pawn was better.
 [ B d6 ]  [ B b2 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ B x e5 ] , [ R c1 ]  The bishops are poised for attack once [ c4 ] is played
 [ c5 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ O-O ]  At first sight this looks solid for white. However If I can brake up the center the black squares might become available for my dark bisschop. I believe we got an equal position here.
 [ K h1 ] , [ N g4 ]  Remembering the Budapest.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ a6 ]  [ B a4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B e7 ]  [ R e1 ] , [ d6 ]  And we here folks have a closed Ruy-Lopez: steinitz-like variation!
 [ d5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ e4 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ N g5 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ B x f7 + ]  [ K d7 ]  [ Q x g4 + ]  [ N x g4 ]  [ B e6 + ]  [ K e8 ]  [ B x g4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ O-O ]  [ e x f4 ]  [ N x e4 ] , [ Q d4 + ]  This check seems strong.
 [ Q e6 ] , [ Q d1 ]  I would have preferred to develop by 20.[ B b2 ] which also protects the vital points against invasion. But the text is OK: White has a winning plus.
 [ Q e2 ] , [ B a6 ]  The fourth move of this bishop.
 [ a3 ] , [ N d4 ]  Putting some pressure on Raz's pinned knight. Also aiming to disrupt his kingside pawns.
 [ K g1 ] , [ B e3 + ]  30. .... [ B e3 + ] - in comes black's dsb to join in the attack? Can Henry survive? If he does then I do have a 4 point material advantage to play with which could be decisive.
 [ B x e7 ]  [ Q x e7 ] , [ B x b5 ]  ???
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ g3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ B g2 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ d3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ h3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ N g e2 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B e3 ] , [ R b8 ]  All book so far. [ R b8 ] can be a testing line but if Black plays [ b5 ] he needs to be wary of threats of [ e5 ] after [ f4 ] potentially hitting both knights
 [ e x d4 ] , [ Q x d4 ]  I took with my queen partly to try to surprise my opponent.
 [ N c6 ]  [ a3 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ N b d2 ]  [ O-O ] , [ O-O ]  This is often the tabiya White has to work with. There are several options for the middle game.
 [ K f6 ] , [ a5 ]  Never have 4 little steps looked so far. The pawn takes the first step.
 [ B e2 ] , [ O-O-O ]  Still focusing on the QP.
 [ N f5 ]  [ Q f6 ] , [ g4 ]  White's steadily building up pressure on the kingside...
 [ R h8 + ]  [ Q h3 ]  [ R x h3 + ]  [ K x h3 ] , [ Q x g3 # ]  
 [ N e5 ] , [ B b3 ]  Now I have a shadow of a grimp on d3. I'll try to exploit this.
 [ f3 ] , [ N e8 ]  Ah now I see his plan. Pretty good. Now I will lose my bishop pair since I must take the knight with my beloved [ g3 ] bishop or I would have had problems pushing my a pawn with so many black pieces around there. I analyzed some variants leaving his knight in [ d6 ] and I didn't see a victory so I came back to the previous "exchange" plan. But again with a "detour".
 [ B d3 ] , [ R g8 ]  3)
 [ Q g4 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ Q h4 ] , [ Q x d4 ]  Now it's safe to take the pawn.
 [ e4 ] , [ c6 ]  Playing into my beloved caro-kann. It was at this point the Jkarp told me that he had very little experience with this move. So right from the first move I would say that I had the advantage because now white is on his own and he has very little idea of the ins and outs of the caro-kann.
 [ Q e6 ]  [ Q d5 ]  [ Q c8 ] , [ a5 ]  31. ...... [ a5 ] - I get this move in at last but that's how far as it gets. The Witch now annoys me with her checks!
 [ f3 ]  [ R h e8 ]  [ h4 ] , [ B x c3 ]  Not the best move here. I can't really remember why I played it... His knight wasn't causing me any trouble. Just making some room on the board maybe :)
 [ B x e7 + ]  [ B x e7 ] , [ B x h7 ]  More punishment... black is not happy here.
 [ h5 ]  [ K g2 ] , [ h4 ]  Black advances the KRP a maneuver which does little to free his game.
 [ R f6 ] , [ B x a2 ]  [!] Some interesting tactics appear hereabouts. Has Black blundered a piece?
 [ R d8 + ] , [ K h7 ]  At this point I lose track of exactly what happened but it's clear that white will win (though still up only a pawn) and win he did.
 [ e x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ] , [ c5 ]  This is not the most accurate move [ N x e4 ] or castling could be played
 [ N c3 ]  [ R x b7 ] , [ N e2 + ]  ?! Not best but it does not really matter at this point. Perhaps [ N e4 ] was worth a shot.
 [ d4 ]  [ Q a5 ]  [ B b5 ] , [ N e8 ]  My knight is headed into action...
 [ N b6 ] , [ Q c1 ]  23. [ R b1 ] a5... Pawn [ a4 ] is lost after all my warnings...
 [ B c5 + ] , [ K h1 ]  Only move. Were Black's queen not on the long diagonal those Black bishops would be a considerable constraint upon White's K-side ambitions. But the queen is handily placed on [ c6 ] as will be seen.
 [ Q g4 ] , [ f6 ]  Supporting the advanced g pawn.
 [ Q x e5 ] , [ R f e1 ]  I actually started to feel good about my prospects. John offered a draw again. "Fancy an early bath?" "If you're offering a draw no thanks let's play on a bit it's just getting interesting." I think I was somewhat over-optimistic!
 [ O-O ] , [ N g x e5 ]  A no brainer. Go up one. I fantasize about exchanges ... 11. [ N x e5 ] [ N x e5 ] 12. [ B x e5 ] [ B x e5 ] 13. [ c3 ] [ b6 ] 14. [ B d5 ] [ R b8 ] ... but he recognizes the situation.
 [ a4 ] , [ R b2 + ]  My original idea here was to snap up the f-pawn after king moves to back rank
 [ K g2 ]  [ R f2 + ] , [ K h3 ]  Got the opposition's King trapped and fixed. With assistance from The IN (LIGHT)...
 [ Q x c7 ] , [ R x b2 ]  In his eagerness to snatch back the Pawn Black leaves his first rank undefended.
 [ b5 ] , [ B d5 ]  ...and attack one of my opponent's...
 [ K x e2 ] , [ Q g4 + ]  This time the inattention is mine. I would take the N ing the K but I didn't see B
 [ e x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ] , [ c5 ]  Although it fends off the knight on [ d4 ] this move creates a backwards pawn on [ d6 ] that white will look to attack and an outpost for a white piece on d5.
 [ N f5 ] , [ R d3 ]  white can't move his rook off the 3rd rank without losing his bishop he could have played [ R f3 ] however this fails to 21...[ N c d4 ] 22.[ R d3 ] [ B c6 ] 23. [ R h d1 ] [ d5 ] 24. [ B f2 ] [ d x c4 ]  [ N b4 ]  [ R f3 ] , [ B c6 ]  And I remove the last available square for the rook. White must now lose a rook for the bishop but does have some tricks available using my undefended knight
 [ h x g6 ]  [ e ]  [ p ]  [ h5 ] , [ g7 ]  The g pawn cannot be stopped and will promote next move. There is no way for Black to avoid a quick checkmate.
 [ N g8 ] , [ Q e2 ]  And now it's more then just castling as Sandre has brought his Queen out before that or completing his development which would be bringing his [ B c1 ] into play.
 [ Q x b3 ]  [ N c4 ]  [ R a2 ] , [ R a1 ]  My only move to save me!
 [ d4 ] , [ B b6 ]  Now White seizes the initiative...
 [ a5 ]  [ g3 ]  [ h x g3 ]  [ h x g3 ]  [ f x g3 ]  [ R x g3 ] , [ a6 ]  And this seems to actually help black; I'm closing things up and the bishop at [ a8 ] will defend happily and maybe hope to get a look along the long diagonal at some later stage. Meanwhile my king is getting quite open.
 [ B a4 ]  [ R c4 ]  [ b5 ]  [ R c8 + ]  [ K g7 ]  [ h4 ]  [ R d1 ]  [ f4 ]  [ c1 = Q ]  [ R e8 ]  [ Q x f4 + ]  [ K h3 ] , [ R h1 # ]  Many thanks for reading. Please leave a comment or two and rate my annotation on the star system. Until next time dear reader!
 [ c5 ]  [ N b5 ] , [ N e6 ]  [ d6 ] pawn appears to be free
 [ g x f6 ] , [ R a f1 ]  I do not want to waste a move taking a free pawn when I'm still down a knight. Black can try to complicate things with [ f5 ] but I have [ R g3 ] [ N g6 ] QxQ RxQ ex[ f5 ] totally winning for White.
 [ N f6 ] , [ b4 ]  This move is a complete mystery to me at the moment it seems to serve no purpose other than perhaps to give the white dsb even more room to manoeuvre
 [ R x c5 ] , [ R x c5 ]  Now it's just a matter of not blundering away my advantage.
 [ e4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ] , [ N f6 ]  Exploring the Icelandic.
 [ B x f3 ] , [ g x f3 ]  this gave me the excellent approach on g-column
 [ N g3 ] , [ R x d3 ]  with no major pieces available and defeat certain i resigned.. again when i reviewed my game i found that i did not properly develop my pieces in the middle game..suggestions welcome
 [ N c4 ] , [ N f d2 ]  This Knight wasn't very active on [ f3 ] so White exchanges it off.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ B c4 ]  Aiming for an italian opening. I am not familiar with playing this with black I must say but I guess is all about flipping sides. But since I am better aware with the three knight defence I will try that.
 [ B g4 ]  [ f3 ]  [ B e6 ] , [ B f4 ]  At this point white's idea is to keep his knight it could be white knight versus black bishop.
 [ K d5 ]  [ h5 ]  [ K e5 ]  [ h4 ]  [ K f5 ]  [ h3 ]  [ K g5 ] , [ h2 ]  White resigned at this point nothing can be done to stop the h- pawn from promoting. I would like to thank Japaneseb[ e e f1 ] for this very good game that we played!
 [ N e5 + ] , [ K e8 ]  I had different feasibility's. But for several reasons this is the best move for black. As noted earlier however he is about to get something back.
 [ N x c4 ] , [ B b4 ]  Try to castle with best developing moves.
 [ O-O ]  [ B g7 ]  [ d3 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ c3 ]  White has to try to break the centre I suppose although I can see that 10. [ c4 ] and playing for a reversed Benoni/Benko type position is interesting.
 [ N f6 + ]  [ K h8 ]  [ N x e8 + ]  [ K g8 ] , [ Q g7 # ]  Great finish for a good game.
 [ B d3 ] , [ f5 ]  Well just 5 moves and no pieces developed. Fine.
 [ R e1 ] , [ N e8 ]  with the idea of ...[ N c7 ] to support b7-[ b5 ]  [ e4 ] , [ N c7 ]  Alternative variation: 14... [ N e5 ] 15. [ N x e5 ] [ B x e5 ] 16. [ B x e5 ] [ Q x e5 ] [∞]
 [ O-O ]  [ O-O-O ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ B d7 ] , [ N g e2 ]  White's spatial advantage is obvious. Black must find a way to free his game.
 [ d5 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ c6 ]  But this is where we start to get into unfamiliar territory as far as I'm concerned. I would've played 4...[ d x c4 ] as I've seen in other games. So this is where as Ken put it the "more educational approach" appears for me. As there's something to be learned for a move that one hasn't seen before. In fact I learned plenty when I first saw and played against the Caro Kann Defense with elyhim.
 [ Q x g4 ] , [ N c2 + ]  It's a trap!
 [ K e7 ] , [ B c5 # ]  ...and the bishop can move in for the kill.
 [ N e7 + ]  [ K b6 ] , [ N x g6 ]  And black resigned. A fun game against a Sicilian albeit probably a little boring unlike most Sicilians. The push [ d5 ] by black would have been a much more interesting game I'm thinking! Thanks for getting this far. Any comments are appreciated.
 [ B x g7 ] , [ K x g7 ]  Black has the option to grab the rook on [ h1 ] which should leave him in a stronger position than the [ K x g7 ] option. (13. ... Nx[ h1 ] 14. [ N f6 ] [ K x g7 ] 15. [ N x e8 ] [ Q x e8 ] 16. [ B d3 ] [ N f2 ] which creates another fork of White's remaining rook and the WSB. )
 [ Q g8 ] , [ R x f6 + ]  [?] Instead White could have tried again with 43.[ Q h4 ] and probably have had enough to secure the draw. After this the advantage changes hands once more...
 [ K f7 ] , [ N x a7 ]  Finally whites plan is done. He is now ahead in material the difference of a rook vs. knight.
 [ R c2 ] , [ g3 ]  ? Ironically the best move a move ago GK considers this weak because it gives Black too much play. If I was going to proceed with my plan I needed to be bold and play consistently with 40. [ a5 ] [ R x g2 ] 41. [ a x b6 ] [ R g8 ] 42. [ b5 ] [ R b8 ] 43. [ K e3 ] [ R x b6 ] 44. [ R b4 ] [ K d6 ] 45. [ K d4 ] [ R b7 ] 46. [ R b3 ] [ R b6 ] 47. [ f4 ] [ h5 ] with some advantage.
 [ c4 ] , [ b6 ]  I've been experimenting with this defense as it can be played against anything. That's the plus side. The downside is that sometimes the positions are too passive for my taste.
 [ e x d4 ] , [ c x d4 ]  Now I can put my dsb safely on [ b4 ] with little that white can do to attack it.
 [ K g1 ]  [ R b1 ] , [ N c3 ]  Think I will have that knight
 [ c5 ]  [ B e5 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ R b1 ]  [ Q x a2 ]  [ B x c7 ] , [ b5 ]  Breaking the line of Analysis of 15. [ B d4 ] [ c5 ] 16. Beg [ N d7 ] 17. [ R b1 ] [ Q x a2 ] 18. Bxc7.
 [ R h e8 ]  [ R e1 ] , [ R d7 ]  Ok I have to admit I wasn't on a clear plan here but I would have doubled the rookd depending on his move. Dont' do that at home :-)
 [ d x c8 = Q + ]  [ Q x c8 ] , [ N c4 ]  After the promotion he attacks my pawn which I defend with my next move. I also considered 30...[ Q e6 ] but 30...[ f5 ] was played to get a pawn chain. What I didn't realize is that this chain is ineffective since it does not include passed pawns. From experience I've learned that passed pawns are in general only effective when one of them is a passer.
 [ B x a6 ] , [ b x a6 ]  Best moves for both sides.
 [ R x b4 ]  [ R x b4 ]  [ c x b4 ] , [ R x c6 ]  White is preparing dangerous attack on black king...
 [ d3 ]  [ B d6 ] , [ N c4 ]  The knight moves again. I am two steps from finishing my development. White only has the knight and queen out.
 [ h6 ] , [ N h4 ]  N on the edge is not effective - were you thinking [ N g6 ] coming ?
 [ K f8 ]  [ e x f6 ]  [ B x f6 ] , [ B h5 ]  12. [ B h5 ] - making room for Glenda to invade on g6. After black naturally responds with 12.......... [ Q e7 ] I force some exchanges which will open up the black castled position a little further.
 [ B x f6 ]  [ R a c1 ]  [ R g5 + ] , [ K f1 ]  Best to move towards the center. No reason to have my King trapped on the KR file.
 [ K g3 ]  [ R g7 + ]  [ K h3 ]  [ R e7 ]  [ K g3 ]  [ R g7 + ] , [ K h2 ]  No perpetual check or threefold repetition...
 [ B b4 ]  [ c3 ]  [ f6 ]  [ Q g3 ]  [ B e7 ] , [ N d2 ]  Just jockeying around for position and developing pieces.
 [ N d4 ] , [ c5 ]  18. ..... [ c5 ] - pawn stab part 2!
 [ N f3 ]  [ c5 ]  [ O-O ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ d x c4 ] , [ B x c4 ]  now he has a isolated [ d4 ] pawn.
 [ b x c3 ]  [ Q a5 ] , [ Q b3 ]  A bit unecessary. The queen would have been better placed on [ c2 ] or d3. I wanted to avoid [ B d2 ] as there are many other tempting squares for him.
 [ Q e8 ]  [ B x b6 ] , [ c x b6 ]  14. ....... [ c x b6 ] - bishop trade.
 [ a4 ] , [ b6 ]  Forward a and h pawns bode ill in an even endgame - this is my feeling and i invite judgement on this because i just don't know.
 [ K g4 ]  [ g7 ] , [ K x f4 ]  ...and although I lose my other pawn...
 [ B x f4 ]  [ Q x f4 ]  [ c3 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ B b6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ d5 ] , [ N g3 ]  I didn't see the tactics here. [ N d2 ] would have been better. A second pawn is fatal in this position.
 [ N c3 ]  [ R a b8 ]  [ R a b1 ] , [ B f7 ]  18. ......... [ B f7 ] to make way for Henry to come to [ e6 ] but white decides to expand on the kingside.
 [ d5 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ] , [ N e4 ]  [ f5 ] is tempting but I "smell" some danger associated with the WQ's coming in so better to be conservative...
 [ N x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ R x d4 ]  [ B x b5 ] , [ Q c8 ]  White's bishops are the obvious asset of this position. However Topalov pointed out that after 24.[ B d6 ] [ R e4 ] 25.[ Q d2 ] [ R x e1 + ] and 26...[ Q x c2 ] that Black can regain composure with [ Q e4 ] or Kd8.
 [ Q x b3 ] , [ Q g5 + ]  Black goes on the attack with the thought of possible mate with white's king trapped on the side.
 [ K x f7 ]  [ R f1 + ]  [ K e7 ]  [ g4 ]  [ K e6 ]  [ g5 ]  [ K e5 ]  [ g6 ] , [ K d4 ]  Nows he's throwing his last attack. Do or Die.
 [ B e3 ]  [ B b7 ] , [ Q c2 ]  supports the [ e4 ] pawn
 [ Q d3 ] , [ R e6 e5 ]  Here it seems to me that Black is playing for a draw.
 [ N b3 ] , [ R e8 ]  Useless move that makes my victory much easier.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B b4 ]  [ N x c6 ]  [ b x c6 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ B x c3 ]  [ b x c3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ h3 ]  [ Q e7 ]  [ Q f3 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ Q g3 ]  [ N g6 ]  [ B e3 ] , [ c5 ]  Preventing Bd4. Black's play is horrible leaving the initiative to white
 [ d5 ]  [ c4 ]  [ d x c4 ] , [ e4 ]  My usual 3rd move - to occupy the centre with a view to playing [ N c3 ] & pawn to d5.
 [ Q c2 ] , [ Q e7 ]  Possibly heading for [ e5 ] which will be vacated by the Knight betimes. Possibly 13...[ Q d7 ] came into consideration as well.
 [ N d7 ] , [ B d3 ]  Trying to remove blacks active bishop
 [ Q x f6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ a6 ]  Encouraging the exchange.
 [ c4 ] , [ N c6 ]  2. [ c3 ] is the Alapin Variation but I am not sure about 2. c4. Wikipedia says it occasionally leads to positions that resemble the English Opening (for obvious reasons) but doesn't offer the move any name or analysis. So I'm dubiously dubbing it the English-Alapin Variation for lack of a better name (no even though it's the title of the game this name is just me clowning around I don't think this is or should be the real name of this opening) at least until some commenter offers me a real name. Black responds with a natural developing move. Also the knight on [ c6 ] covers [ e5 ] so it allows black to play [ N f6 ] without worrying about white responding with e5.
 [ f5 ] , [ R g1 ]  Not sure why not [ R e1 ] instead.
 [ Q d8 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ f5 ]  [ Q e6 + ]  [ K f8 ] , [ g3 ]  The bishop is looking for g2.
 [ Q c7 ] , [ Q e2 ]  I wanted to throw a curve ball at white now so move.
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N x f6 + ] , [ g x f6 ]  I learned the Caro-Kann back in the 80s because of this variation. But other variations gained favor and I never got to use this in tournaments. Fortunately I've had a couple of opportunities with GK.
 [ B h6 ]  [ d3 ]  [ c5 ]  [ R a b1 ]  [ h4 ] , [ R b7 ]  Bring my rook out and outpost it in my opponents territory
 [ K g2 ]  [ B e5 ]  [ N e7 ]  [ Q d8 ] , [ N g6 + ]  Here with 90 seconds plus 10 second increments remaining and slightly more for my opponent I decided to offer a draw. As my position was better here he accepted.
 [ B g6 ]  [ R e1 ] , [ O-O ]  White's c3-knight is pinned again but a dangerous rook on the e-file threatens me greatly. The key is to double pawns on the c-file then try to dominate the b-file with a rook.
 [ b4 ]  [ R e5 ] , [ R d8 ]  34. [ R d8 ] - pinning my knight and forcing Kg7.
 [ R c8 ] , [ R c c2 ]  Probably to set the rook on a light square because black has only the DSB left
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B c4 ] , [ B c5 ]  An original response by black.
 [ B d4 ]  [ R c1 ]  [ N f4 ] , [ N d1 ]  [ N d1 ] ?? the following black move forces resignation. can you find it ?
 [ e x f2 + ]  [ K f1 ] , [ R c8 ]  In this moment I think 22...R:[ [ c1 ] ] 23.R:[ [ c1 ] ] [ N e3 ] and I take the Q.
 [ Q x d6 ]  [ Q x h7 + ]  [ K f8 ]  [ Q h8 + ]  [ K e7 ]  [ R e1 + ] , [ N e5 ]  Black gives back the material. If worse comes to worse I will have two bishops for a rook (meaning I gained a pawn back and am left with two bishops rather than a bishop and knight) - a VERY playable middlegame and endgame. This move is the only one available to Black that doesn't spell total disaster - materially but still doesn't remove my tempo.
 [ f6 ]  [ e x f6 ] , [ N d x f6 ]  i think that [ R x f6 ] is better...
 [ N c4 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ N b6 ]  [ R b8 ]  [ f4 ]  [ e x f3 ]  [ e ]  [ p ] , [ B x f3 ]  The biggest problem for Carlsen is he is really the underdog. He is not only playing against Caruana alone. He is also playing against Caruana's team of seconds Stockfish and Super Computers. From the time on the clock it seems that Caruana is still in his element. While Black is objectively OK here in reality Carlsen is in real pressure. He has no idea what else Caruana had cooked up at home. So he is trying to figure things out over the board knowing one mistake can cost him the World Championship title. Carlsen's struggle is real! One thing that really surprises me is why so many players insisting on repeating the same opening choice over & over again in World Championship matches. We saw how that worked out with Kasparov versus Kramnik as well as other matches. This plays into opponents' preparation advantage. Why not mix things up?
 [ K f7 ] , [ a4 ]  wondering if I could hope up some room for my rooks to roam
 [ N x c4 + ]  [ K d3 ] , [ Q f5 + ]  Another blunder. King takes knight. And shortly thereafter pawn will take bishop. Remember all the way back at 16 when I said Black should have withdrawn that the game was lost but at least they could make a last stand? That's really what Black should have done.
 [ b4 ] , [ K f3 ]  I try and get my king into the action
 [ g3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ K h2 ]  [ K h8 ] , [ K g2 ]  Should have moved there before
 [ B e5 ]  [ f6 ]  [ Q x e4 ] , [ g x h4 ]  The point of black's play.
 [ f6 ] , [ B e3 ]  pulling back. Lots of pawns developed on black's side but I feel pretty good about my center control.
 [ K e8 ] , [ N g5 ]  threatening [ e6 ] and offers the exchange of bishop by knight
 [ K d5 ] , [ K d3 ]  This is another story.
 [ f2 ]  [ K f4 ]  [ f1 = Q + ]  [ K g4 ]  [ K x c6 ] , [ K g3 ]  Now there is a forced mate in 3.
 [ f6 ]  [ f5 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ N e3 ]  [ B c6 ]  [ d4 ] , [ B b4 ]  You've played well but like I said on move 19 I think black had a basically winning advantage. Now it seems like black has the center under control and is ready to start pressing his advantage. The next couple moves are pretty big tactical mistakes but I couldn't see a good way for you to press on. Note how the 2 bishops are starting to look better to than the Ns. Especially the [ b4 ] one. It keeps your Rook on [ a1 ] tied to the a-pawn and stops you from putting a R on c1. After a few more moves I think they would have been even better.
 [ Q e8 ] , [ R x d1 ]  Ok now he has a quality but I have a much better position (than before!) and my [ d6 ] pawn begins to "play"!
 [ Q a3 + ]  [ K c2 ]  [ Q a2 + ]  [ B b2 ]  [ R g8 ]  [ Q d4 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ K h5 ]  [ c7 ]  [ Q b3 + ]  [ K c1 ]  [ K g4 ] , [ b6 ]  white has nothing in trying to push the mate. Instead I go for the sure win which is promoting the pawn
 [ R c a5 ]  [ R x a6 ]  [ R x a6 ] , [ B a2 ]  Now he loses [ c6 ] but there was no defence anyway. White will just capture on [ a7 ] with the bishop maintain his grip and gradually advance the a-pawn.
 [ B x b7 ]  [ R x b7 ]  [ g3 ]  [ f x g3 ]  [ R x g3 ]  [ R b b8 ]  [ N g5 ]  [ B x g5 ]  [ h x g5 ]  [ h4 ]  [ R g4 ]  [ Q b5 ]  [ R x h4 ]  [ Q f1 + ]  [ K a2 ]  [ Q g2 ]  [ f4 ] , [ Q x e4 ]  and the white resign ! why ? this game was interesting so why resign so quick ?
 [ B b5 + ]  [ B d7 ]  [ B x d7 + ]  [ Q x d7 ]  [ d x c5 ]  [ b x c5 ]  [ e x f6 ] , [ N x f6 ]  9. ….. [ N x f6 ] - black's position has improved after this plethora of exchanges. He does have a strong pawn centre.
 [ R x e6 ]  [ Q a4 ]  [ Q b5 ]  [ Q f4 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ b4 ]  [ Q b6 ]  [ a3 ]  [ R e2 ]  [ h4 ]  [ Q b5 ] , [ R x d6 ]  Another bad trade. This time White doesn't even get even material on his investment. White wanted an opportunity for a back rank mate but Black controls the [ e8 ] square twice and has time to advance the h or g pawn.
 [ a x b5 ] , [ B e6 ]  Trying desperately to save something.
 [ B b7 ]  [ c4 ]  [ Q c6 ] , [ d5 ]  Again the Black Queen is being harassed by supported pawns
 [ c x b5 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N d3 ]  [ c x b5 ]  [ Q x b5 ] , [ Q c2 ]  Black was to lose either the queen or the bishop.
 [ c4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ g3 ]  [ e5 ]  [ B g2 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ R e8 ]  [ d3 ]  [ h6 ]  [ a3 ]  [ a5 ]  [ e3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ b3 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ h3 ]  [ B h5 ]  [ B b2 ]  [ e4 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ R x e4 ]  [ Q d5 ]  [ B x f3 ]  [ B x f3 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ Q d1 ] , [ Q g5 ]  Inaccuracy. Best move according to engine was 17... [ N e5 ] 18. [ B x b7 ] [ R b8 ] 19. [ B d5 ] [ Q d7 ] 20. [ B c3 ] [ Q x h3 ] 21. [ B g2 ] [ Q g4 ] 22. [ B x a5 ] [ Q x d1 ] 23. R[ f x d1 ] [ R x b3 ] 24. [ B x c7 ] according to lichess.org
 [ N f3 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ O-O ]  [ h4 ]  [ h3 ]  [ B x f3 ]  [ Q x f3 ]  [ e6 ] , [ B c2 ]  ?! -- Al is perhaps already feeling a little uncomfortable: this sort of rough-and-tumble semi-open position is much more to my liking than his. Still in my opinion the text is the correct move.
 [ Q b6 ]  [ c5 ]  [ Q c6 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ B x e4 ]  [ B x e4 ]  [ Q e6 ]  [ Q b3 ]  [ Q x b3 ]  [ a x b3 ] , [ f5 ]  That was not that good for black. Or was it?
 [ R g f1 ]  [ K g8 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ B x e5 ] , [ d x e5 ]  24. [ d x [ [ e5 ] ] ] - the pawn push to [ [ e5 ] ] was scuppered by Ion playing his rook to f1. I would have lost a pawn if I had played [ [ e5 ] ] due to the rook pinning Fou Lenoir against Henry once his knight moved. However Ion gives himself a doubleton isolani on the same file as my own isolani so at least I have given him a bit of a concession. However there is a danger that Ion could make use of the f and d files for his rooks and so I must now prevent a rook incursion on my second rank by playing my rook to [ e7 ] on the next turn.
 [ Q e7 ] , [ B d3 ]  10. [ B d3 ] - for now though I continue to develop and watch where black puts his king.
 [ R a d1 ]  [ B a5 ]  [ N e3 ]  [ Q b5 ] , [ d4 ]  It's a forced move; otherwise I have to play Rf1. But I'm really unhappy with my pawn structure. I've never had a structure that looks like this in this opening.
 [ d5 ] , [ Q d6 ]  Mistake it seems to be a logical move but wrong the idea is to offer white to capture the knight on [ c6 ] and get very power full attack on the king and expose totally whites king side for example 21.dxc-Qg3+.22.Kh1-Qxh3+23.Nh2-[ N d3 ] with very Strong attack however the best move was 20...Na5!.21.Ne5-Qd6.22.Rxa5-Bxa5.23.Be7-Qxe7.24.Nxg6-Qxe1+.25.Qxe1-hxg...or 21.Ba4-[ Q d6 ] and black have big contra chances .
 [ R f c8 ]  [ Q c2 ]  [ b5 ]  [ f3 ]  [ e x f3 ]  [ R x f3 ] , [ Q c6 ]  Now we reached our position. Try take your moment in analyzing White choices. Do you see [ e7 ] ? Waw ! what an ideal position for our [ N c3 ] if it manages to go there through d5. How can we travel that distance if we are not going to do that at the cost of time ! So we need to gain time. How's that ? Material. Let us gain time by losing material then invest time to get to that space. Nevertheless it is still not obvious : 20. [ R x [ [ f6 ] ] ] [ g x [ [ f6 ] ] ] 21. [ Q f5 ] threatening Nxd5. If [ N x [ d5 ] ] then [ [ f6 ] ] will be won with a check. [ h6 ] also is in hand. White is unable to go to [ d7 ] lacking a defending piece and if B retreats to [ f8 ] then White mates with [ N x [ f6 ] + ] followed by Qxh6#. Unfortunately [ N b6 ] changes all this since it protects [ d5 ] and d7. But another way to go to [ [ f6 ] ] by the Knight is through [ e4 ] which is protected by d5. However this can be possible if N[ e4 ] discovers [ R c1 ] attacking the queen. So let's prepare it.
 [ c4 ] , [ g6 ]  A mini-tournament game. I am playing black and faced with the English Opening I choose 1. ... [ g6 ] because this often leads to the Kings Indian Defense which is one of my favorites because it tends to be more active than positional.
 [ R b1 ] , [ N x e2 + ]  I do not like that type of situation the only goal of the following moves is to open the game without giving any advantage to white
 [ Q x d3 ]  [ B g7 + ]  [ K h7 ]  [ B x f8 + ]  [ K h8 ]  [ B g7 + ]  [ K h7 ] , [ B x f6 + ]  Two Black peaces nearest to King leaved board!
 [ B x c3 ]  [ Q x c3 + ] , [ K f1 ]  ..white has no choice.....and now black gets material back...
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ d x e6 ]  [ e ]  [ p ] , [ B x e6 ]  I preferred to let this e-column opened as my rook was already there.
 [ B g5 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ N e5 ] , [ f6 ]  Gotta watch out for those forks.
 [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ N c6 ]  Two knights game.
 [ R e c1 ] , [ R f8 ]  now [ R x c5 ] is still valid
 [ B x e4 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ Q x e4 ] , [ B f5 ]  This move is a mistake. It just gives away yet another pawn. Better was simply fxe.
 [ B e3 ]  [ B c8 ]  [ B g2 ] , [ B e6 ]  At least I've redeveloped my B where it is no longer biting on granite.
 [ h6 ] , [ e x f6 ]  I didn't want to retreat the bishop as [ g5 ] might follow if I did and that would give black advanced pawns on the kings side where I was looking to castle in future
 [ g6 ]  [ B d5 + ]  [ K g7 ] , [ Q e4 ]  Now I can withdraw the knight.
 [ h5 ] , [ N g5 ]  A good outpost for white here as he aims for the [ h7 ] square.
 [ Q e2 ] , [ g6 ]  To prevent [ N f5 ] or Qh5. It looks weird but hey he has not a dsb.
 [ K c7 ]  [ K e5 ] , [ g5 ]  34. ....... [ g5 ] - a desperate try to make the most of my kingside pawn majority. The plan I had was to advance the kingside pawns to divert the WK away from the [ [ e6 ] ] pawn. Note that without the a passer then provided I could get Henry safely to [ [ h8 ] ] then I could sac Fou Leblanc for the [ [ e6 ] ] pawn and then the game would have been drawn because white has a lsb and does not command the [ [ h8 ] ] square. White would have had nothing better than to give me the wrong kind of mate. However the a pawn is there and that makes all the difference.
 [ e x d5 ]  [ Q x d5 ] , [ N c3 ]  similar to the center counter I develop with tempo
 [ f x g6 ] , [ B g5 ]  ! I love this move. All of black's pawns are stymied and black's king has exactly 8 squares to play with. He cannot reach my bishop nor can he reach any of my pawns. He gets a lonely little 8-square prison cell to call home until I am ready to finish him off.
 [ B g5 ]  [ N x g5 ]  [ Q x g5 ]  [ Q e2 ]  [ b4 ]  [ N a4 ]  [ B a6 ]  [ B d3 ] , [ N h4 ]  threatening 20. ... [ B x d3 ] 21 [ Q x d3 ] [ Q x g2 ] mate
 [ R x f7 ]  [ Q x h6 ] , [ N x d4 ]  Now I'm in big trouble 25. Nxd4? [ Q x d4 + ] 26. [ K h1 ] Rxf1! 27. [ B x f1 ] [ Q f2 ] 28. [ Q b1 ] now black has up a few tempos to play around with while I try to figure out how to not lose a whole piece. So I chose a different option.
 [ N f3 ]  [ a6 ] , [ O-O ]  i like the way it started: i am well protected and i can concentrate on attack.
 [ B d5 + ]  [ K h2 ]  [ R d2 ] , [ N e3 ]  Black cannot take the f pawn due to the response [ K g1 ] with an attack on both black pieces that cannot both be saved. (Note not Kg3?? as [ R f3 + ] saves both pieces and loses the knight).
 [ R g8 ] , [ R h7 ]  If [ K x h5 ] then [ R g3 ] and suddenly black's game has life.
 [ e3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ e6 ] , [ d5 ]  white is weak but is trying to demolish my pawn/knight structure
 [ d4 ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ B b4 + ]  [ N c3 ] , [ B x c3 + ]  This move surprises me. There is no need to let a bishop go in this position; better to keep some pressure on. But hey I'll accept this trade gladly.
 [ B x e7 + ] , [ K c8 ]  40. ....... [ K c8 ] - Henry decides to stay on the queenside. Glenda will cover the kingside.
 [ Q h4 ]  [ Q e6 ] , [ B c4 ]  X-raying the queen
 [ B x c3 ] , [ b x c3 ]  And in fact I get it. Quite happy with this; two Bishops on what will soon be a fairly open board.
 [ R f8 ]  [ f x g7 ]  [ R x f1 + ]  [ K x f1 ] , [ K x g7 ]  26. ..... [ K x g7 ] - Matthew has simplified into an endgame a pawn up. That should really be enough to win although Matthew's extra pawn on [ e6 ] is backward so it may make things rather difficult there.
 [ b3 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ Q e2 ] , [ N c5 ]  Now knight go to action!
 [ Q x g6 + ]  [ K f8 ] , [ Q f7 # ]  
 [ Q a5 ]  [ N e6 ]  [ R c1 ] , [ g5 ]  The waste of time the bishop is not going to retreat. Of course [ N x f4 ] is bad - Qxc7#. The game could last a little longer after 28... [ K d7 ] 29. [ R x c6 ] [ K e7 ] (not 29... [ K x c6 ] 30. [ Q a4 + ] [ K b6 ] or [ K c5 ] and mate in a couple of moves) and for example 30.[ e5 ] fx[ e5 ] 31. [ B g5 + ] [ N x g5 ] 32. R[ a x c7 + ] and white must win soon.
 [ h3 ]  [ B h5 ]  [ d3 ]  [ h6 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ c5 ] , [ N c3 ]  I think [ N b d2 ] was better so I can move my queen out of the pin without having a ruined kingside
 [ e6 ]  [ f4 ] , [ B e7 ]  The Poisoned Pawn variation goes 7...Qb6. According to chessgames.com black actually wins more often than white in that variation. Maybe that would be a reason to start studying the English Attack.
 [ R d8 ] , [ c4 ]  I wait to take seeing something even more magneficent. Queen/rook diagonal is in need of some help HAHA
 [ B g7 ]  [ O-O ] , [ c6 ]  In addition to taking away the queen's knight's most natural developing square Black's move seems rather slow. White's rapid development gives him sufficient compensation for the pawn. Shredder recommends either 5...[ N c6 ] or 5...g4.
 [ B g7 ]  [ N g5 ] , [ R f d8 ]  Technically the fastest path to mate is 24. [ N x f7 ] [ N e5 ] 25. [ N x e5 + ] [ K f8 ] (25... [ K h8 ] 26. [ Q h5 + ] [ B h6 ] 27.[ Q x h6 + ] [ Q h7 ] 28. Ng6#) 26. [ Q f5 + ] [ K e8 ] (26... [ K e7 ] 27. [ N g6 + ] [ K d6 ] 28. Qd5#) (26... [ B f6 ] 27. [ Q x f6 + ] [ K e8 ] 28. [ B f7 + ] [ K f8 ] 29. Ng6#) 27. [ N d7 + ] [ B e5 ] 28. [ Q f7 # ]  [ Q x f7 + ]  [ K h8 ]  [ Q h5 + ]  [ K g8 ]  [ Q h7 + ]  [ K f8 ] , [ N e6 + ]  Black resigned. Suppose play were to continue ...
 [ Q x d5 ] , [ B e2 ]  Momentarily responding to the threat on my Knight. No sense in allowing Black to mess up my kingside pawns by trading on f3. Of course the immediate 5.c2-[ c4 ] was playable here.
 [ N e5 ] , [ N f5 ]  White places his knight on [ f5 ] and attacks the black biship on g7.
 [ g6 ] , [ R b7 ]  At this point I was thinking of exchanging my rook for that pawn -- anything to stop it.
 [ b5 ] , [ N x c6 ]  The first deviation from the main line. This knight exchange benefits black because it gives more time and space for queen side development.
 [ B d3 ] , [ N c5 ]  Moving the Knight to a further-advanced position.
 [ Q h4 ] , [ R g e1 ]  35. [ R g e1 ] - will make no difference to the result. I decided to delay the mate but somehow the most aggressive token move would have been d6. That would have allowed mate in 1. But now it gets really gruesome.
 [ h4 ] , [ Q d7 ]  29 [ Q d7 ] Trying to prevent [ h3 ] as well as promoting some counter play on QUeen side
 [ Q x d2 ]  [ Q x e4 + ] , [ K h2 ]  Where's the mate? Ejem...
 [ Q d5 ] , [ K e7 ]  38....... [ K e7 ] - Henry does his best to avoid being checked.
 [ B d2 ] , [ R d7 ]  There are two points to this. Black is planning to treble the heavy pieces on the d-file; and this rook also protects the bishop. Black is planning soon to unmask the b7-bishop's battery against the White Queen and that of the heavy pieces against the bishop at d2. Throughout this game so far Black has been playing a solid more or less risk-free positional style in the face of the active White pieces.
 [ R x h8 ]  [ g6 ]  [ R h7 + ]  [ K c6 ]  [ R c1 + ]  [ K b5 ] , [ R d7 ]  [ R d7 ] skewers the B and N gaining more material.
 [ N g6 ]  [ Q f6 ]  [ h3 ]  [ Q x g6 ]  [ Q e2 ]  [ Q h5 ] , [ Q d3 ]  Aronian played his Queen to [ d3 ] to protect his pawn on h3. (The [ g2 ] pawn is pinned by the Black bishop on b7)
 [ Q x b6 ] , [ N x d1 ]  Notice the position. Black has 5 pieces working collectively while white has a a lonely queen attacking nothing of value a knight tied down protecting [ e1 ] and a rook who has put a "Do not disturb" sign on his door......
 [ N x c4 ]  [ B x b7 ]  [ B x b7 ]  [ R x b7 ]  [ N b6 ] , [ Q f5 ]  The queen can't defend the rook directly: 16 [ Q e4 ] [ Q d7 ] (threatening 17 ... [ f5 ] and 18 ... Qc6) 17[ d x e5 ] [ R x e5 ] 18 [ Q f3 ] [ Q c8 ] 19 [ c4 ] [ d5 ] 20 [ B b2 ] [ R g5 ] 21 [ h4 ] [ R g6 ] 22 [ R x b6 ] [ a x b6 ] - . So White's only alternative is to keep the Black queen from reaching [ c6 ] or c8.
 [ d3 ] , [ e5 ]  3. [ [ d3 ] ] is not as aggressive - and not as good for that matter - as the standard 3. e5. I was tempted to play [ [ [ d5 ] ] ] and expected in reply either 4. [ N d2 ] or 4. [ [ e5 ] ] Nf6-[ d7 ] and after a later [ [ d4 ] ] by white we will go into a position similar to a variation of the Tarrasch Variation of the French Defence(1. [ e4 ] [ e6 ] 2. [ [ d4 ] ] [ [ [ d5 ] ] ] 3. [ N d2 ] [ N f6 ] 4. [ [ e5 ] ] Nfd7) where Black has an extra tempo because White has wasted a move by playing [ [ d3 ] ] and then d4. I thought at the time that Black would struggle to make the extra tempo count in a blocked position. I went for something more ambition. But wrongly! After the game a glance at the Gameknot World Database shows [ [ [ d5 ] ] ] was the better move.
 [ d x e5 ]  [ Q x g4 ]  [ N g6 ] , [ Q f5 ]  I was thinking about another pawn-winning line: 11. [ B x f7 + ] [ K x f7 ] 12. [ Q f5 + ] [ Q f6 ] 13. [ Q d7 + ] and then 14. [ Q d5 + ] to nab the knight on a5. But after 13. [ Q d7 + ] then [ N e7 ] blocks my queen from forking on d5. So instead I figured I'd play a "safer" threatening move by ganging up on f7.
 [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ N c6 ]  !? Of course Anatoly Karpov plays the best move in this position: 5...[ e6 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ B x e7 ]  [ Q x e7 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ O-O ] , [ N x c3 ]  Other moves are possible here.
 [ Q x e5 + ]  [ K f7 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ Q e7 ]  [ O-O ]  [ Q x e5 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ f3 ]  [ N e6 ]  [ N d6 + ]  [ B x d6 ]  [ e x d6 ] , [ B x c2 ]  perhaps this is the losing move. a point is a point but the king is still exposed and there is still that passed pawn to deal with.
 [ N x g4 ]  [ B x f7 + ]  [ K d7 ]  [ B e6 + ]  [ K c7 ] , [ B x g4 ]  9. [ B x g4 ] - I now have two pieces for Glenda and I have exposed the BK. Over the next few moves I tie down black and attack!
 [ N x e4 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ d x e3 ] , [ f x e3 ]  A terrible oversight that loses a piece. the bishop is hanging / loose on b2.
 [ c x b5 ]  [ B x a1 ]  [ R x a1 ] , [ R a5 ]  now [ b6 ] would face Rxa4.
 [ O-O ] , [ O-O-O ]  I want a race and castling on the oppoaite side is the way to do it.
 [ B g7 ]  [ Q f3 ]  [ R b8 ]  [ R d e1 ]  [ Q a5 ]  [ B e4 ]  [ b5 ] , [ B d5 ]  This bishop now the strongest piece on the board - not so was 3-4 moves ago :-)
 [ g x f4 ]  [ R x f4 + ]  [ K e3 ] , [ Q f2 # ]  I hope you enjoyed this crazy game and you should think twice before overextending your kingside since I got into deep trouble around move 25
 [ Q b3 ] , [ Q c8 ]  Lasker played absolutely awful in this game. The right move was 4...Qb6.
 [ K x f5 ]  [ R d3 ] , [ R h7 ]  i don't know why he is doing such a weird move.
 [ B d6 ] , [ g3 ]  forcing knight to retreat
 [ N d4 ]  [ R c5 ]  [ B d2 ]  [ B x d3 ]  [ N e6 ]  [ R c8 ]  [ B x b4 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N c5 + ] , [ K d6 ]  ({14:+6.02} 26. ... [ K d6 ] 27. [ R [ e6 ] + ] [ K c7 ] 28. [ N x d3 ] [ K d7 ] 29. [ N c5 + ] [ K e8 ] 30. [ B a3 ] [ N [ d4 ] ] 31. [ R e5 ] [ N c6 ] 32. [ R g5 ] [ N [ d4 ] ] 33. [ K h1 ] [ N c2 ] 34. [ R c1 ] [ N x a3 ] 35. [ b x a3 ] +-) ({17:+3.59} 26. ... [ K e8 ] 27. [ N x d3 ] [ N x e5 ] 28. [ N x e5 ] [ e6 ] 29. [ B x f8 ] [ K x f8 ] 30. [ N h f7 ] [ N d7 ] 31. [ f4 ] [ R c2 ] 32. [ b4 ] [ K e7 ] 33. [ a4 ] [ d4 ] 34. [ R d1 ] [ N x e5 ] 35. [ N x e5 ] +-)
 [ g5 ] , [ N h5 ]  19. Here I began to calculate and realized there were some problems because after [ N d5 ] there is a Nxc7/[ Q d8 ] threat that wins the house
 [ Q c7 ]  [ R f2 ]  [ K g7 ]  [ R c f1 ] , [ N h6 ]  I have to admit I didn't see it coming right
 [ B e5 + ] , [ K b1 ]  Too late. White allowed black to play 28. ... Be5+! uncontested by the white bishop. Much badness follows.
 [ Q e8 ]  [ Q e4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ R f5 x f6 ]  [ g x f6 ]  [ R x f6 ]  [ K g8 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ K h8 ] , [ Q f4 ]  
 [ Q x e4 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ R x f6 ]  Sacrificing material when you're ahead is much easier but it's still pretty.
 [ Q x b1 ]  [ R x b1 ] , [ B e6 ]  its still a tough game ge is down a piece and a pwn and the queens are gone i relize that he is about to retake the pawn but still.
 [ N c x e5 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ Q d4 ]  [ f6 ]  [ f4 ] , [ N c6 ]  As I already indicated Black was playing in accordance with a fixed plan and made all those moves quickly. However even after 16...[ N d7 ] 17.[ f5 ] White has a considerable advantage - taking the c5-pawn is not playable because of the pin on the a3-[ f8 ] diagonal.
 [ B x e3 + ]  [ B x e3 ]  [ R x e3 ] , [ N x f7 ]  [?!] Strong enough for a winning advantage and in fact the game is about to come to an abrupt premature end. But stronger in fact was 13.Bxf7ch [ K f8 ] (13...[ K h8 ] 14.Rxf6!) 14.Bg6!! ... (not an easy move to find it's true but the easier 14.Nxh7ch or even 14.[ R x f6 ] were also both good enough to win).
 [ B g7 ]  [ N e6 ]  [ Q g8 ]  [ d4 ]  [ e x d3 ]  [ e ]  [ p ]  [ O-O ]  [ d x c2 ]  [ R f2 ]  [ c x b1 = Q ] , [ R x b1 ]  White has sacrificed more material for an attack....
 [ Q c3 ]  [ Q f7 + ]  [ K h6 ]  [ Q f8 + ]  [ K g5 ]  [ Q e7 + ]  [ K g4 ] , [ Q e6 + ]  There the chance goes! The White must confine the king to the side to have chances of draw: 49. [ Q f6 ] [ Q d4 ] 50. [ K g2 ] [ K h5 ] 51. [ f3 ] [ Q b2 + ] 52. [ K h3 ] [ Q d4 ] 53. [ K g2 ] and now if the Black does not draw loses after 54. [ g4 + ]  [ K f3 ]  [ Q d5 + ]  [ K e2 ]  [ Q e4 + ] , [ K d1 ]  The black king joined his queen in the West and now all is lost.
 [ N d7 ] , [ N e4 ]  Looks like white is tossing P[ d5 ] to the dogs and r[ e8 ] will put pressure on Ne4.
 [ R e8 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ B e4 ]  [ f3 ] , [ B b7 ]  So now i'm off that diagonal anyway but this is an excellent place for the Bishop as well. The Bishop pair is serving me well in this game.
 [ B e3 ] , [ O-O-O ]  I have 4 attackers on that pawn and white can only muster 3 defenders so that pawn will drop.
 [ c6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e5 ] , [ c5 ]  Probably the best response to the Advance though it's counter-intuitive moving the pawn a second time.
 [ f5 ] , [ R e8 ]  Waiting and creating extra space for his bishop. He sees his coverage of [ f6 ] as safe. His knight queen and bishop all eye the square. White sees the point too and intends [ g4 ] for this and because [ g3 ] is a good spot for his knight. 15...[ a5 ] threatens an opening in the queenside.
 [ R x e6 ] , [ K h3 ]  White cannot take: 29 [ R x c4 ] because of 29 .. [ N e4 ] ! 30 [ K h3 ] Rxc4.
 [ K d5 ] , [ Q d2 + ]  26
 [ B d7 ]  [ Q x d7 + ]  [ K f8 ] , [ Q x b7 ]  ! White is interested in displacing Black's rook on [ a8 ] (this isn't a pawn grab) the only piece preventing a back row mate. Beware of ..[ R b8 ] too -- White will happily sacrifice his Queen or else face perpetual check but then is still guarranteed mate in two.
 [ R e1 ] , [ R b1 ]  I am now happy with my positin but I was down really low on time
 [ K d2 ]  [ R f8 ]  [ a3 ]  [ a4 ] , [ B c6 ]  attacking [ a4 ] is not bad cause the rook as we know can´t get away from his h.
 [ K h1 ]  [ N x c1 ] , [ R f x c1 ]  I honestly thought that he would retake with 16.[ Q x c1 ] but I understand why he played this instead. Bringing his back to the first rank would undo some of his development so this was the right decision. Not only that but this move puts pressure on the c file.
 [ B x d4 ] , [ c x d4 ]  The right recapture. Instead 29...[ e x d4 ] was simply unplayable owing to 30.[ R e6 ] [ Q f5 ] 31.[ f4 ] [ R f6 ] 32.[ B d5 ] ... and a winning advantage for White.
 [ R g h8 ] , [ Q e3 ]  and the queen now entertains ideas of [ Q c5 ] a pretty good outpost for the queen [the knight cannot capture the queen because of the pin on the king. However there's a catch...
 [ R h1 ] , [ N d4 ]  Try to avoid moving the same piece twice in the opening.
 [ d x e5 ] , [ B g4 ]  If 5. ... [ d x e5 ] 6. [ Q x d8 + ] [ K x d8 ] 7. Nxe5. The loss of a pawn is unavoidable.
 [ N e3 + ] , [ K h5 ]  Yes - White is slowly cutting off retreats for my King
 [ K d4 ] , [ e1 = Q ]  if 41... RxRP? 42 K-[ Q3 ] Black is lost.
 [ Q x e7 ] , [ N x e7 ]  retake with the knight not the rook as it leaves the back rank unprotected.
 [ B x c4 ]  [ Q g5 ]  [ N f7 ]  [ Q c1 + ]  [ R f1 ]  [ Q x c3 ] , [ R b3 ]  At this point I thought I had Black's R on [ f3 ] for my B. I was feeling pretty good--I failed to notice by poor N all alone on [ f7 ] :tears:
 [ Q x e2 ]  [ B x e5 ] , [ d x e5 ]  the game is somewhat simplified now but I'm not too happy with my position after these exchanges.
 [ N f6 ] , [ B f1 ]  Freeing up the Rook to move out of its own pin...
 [ B c1 ]  [ B h6 ]  [ g3 ] , [ d x e5 ]  Setting a trap: 15 BPxP? B-K6ch!
 [ g4 ]  [ R g8 ]  [ K f3 ]  [ R g5 ]  [ f4 ]  [ R h5 ]  [ g3 ]  [ R h1 ]  [ R e3 + ]  [ K d2 ] , [ K f2 ]  I now control both Queening squares for the pawns.
 [ K e4 ]  [ R a5 ]  [ R b2 ]  [ K h6 ]  [ R b6 + ]  [ g6 ] , [ R b8 ]  All white can try to do now is prevent the king from becoming active.
 [ B x h4 ] , [ N x h4 ]  ?? I call this my losing move - I should have pressured [ d7 ] with Nf5...
 [ Q e2 ]  [ N x e3 + ]  [ Q x e3 ] , [ B x d4 ]  another pawn ... I could safely resign but Freddy likes to play to the end. It's good for his opponents' souls!
 [ N b5 ] , [ R x e2 + ]  Two minors for the elder...
 [ N d5 ]  [ N x d5 ] , [ c x d5 ]  9. ...... [ c x d5 ] - knight trade.
 [ d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ f3 ]  [ c6 ]  [ a4 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ e5 ]  [ O-O-O ]  [ Q a5 ] , [ h4 ]  I love white's suicidal pawn! Wonderful attacks to black's king-side begin with this move.
 [ N x e3 ] , [ Q e2 ]  17. [ Q c3 ] is just slightly better because black would like to be able to play [ c x d4 ] followed by Bc5.
 [ N x e5 ] , [ d5 ]  The other option for Black here is 4...[ Q g5 ] 5.[ d4 ] [ Q x g2 ] 6.[ Q g5 + ] [ g3 ] 7.[ B f7 + ] [ K d8 ] 8.[ B x g6 ] [ Q x h1 + ] 9.[ K e2 ] [ Q x c1 ] or ...[ c6 ] but I think the text is stronger for Black's position. The whole point of the Latvian is that White has a hard time developing his pieces--going around killing them on their home squares is less useful for Black than good old-fashioned development.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ B d3 ]  an odd move for a weaker player [ B c4 ] being the main line this move weakens his position and eventually leads to terrible consequences
 [ B d6 ] , [ N b5 ]  OK?
 [ a4 + ]  [ K b4 ]  [ N b6 ]  [ g3 ]  [ R b8 ] , [ B x b6 ]  Trading my bad bishop for good knight however this isn't going to help me much.
 [ O-O ]  [ Q x d8 ]  [ R f x d8 ] , [ N x e4 ]  two pawns ahead...
 [ O-O ]  [ R e1 ] , [ Q c7 ]  [ e5 ] is a real threat as it will rip apart my pawn structure
 [ f6 ]  [ R c5 ]  [ R e7 ]  [ h3 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ R f1 ]  [ b6 ]  [ R c6 ] , [ K b7 ]  C6 is now trapped so
 [ Q c1 ] , [ N x h1 ]  and he resigned. This game is a [ f2 ] sac and a double check and a fork. extremely instructional.
 [ Q b5 ]  [ N a c3 ]  [ B x c3 ] , [ N x c3 ]  Alternative variation: 15. [ B x c3 ] [ Q x e2 ] 16. [ R e1 ] [ Q x d1 ]  [ Q x f1 + ]  [ Q x f1 ]  [ B x f1 ]  [ R x f1 ] , [ c x d4 ]  Alternative variation: [Or] 17... [ N x d4 ] [in any case Black is an exchange up and has excellent pawn structure with an extra passed pawn.]
 [ Q d2 + ] , [ R c3 ]  He effectively protects his Rook but his [ d5 ] pawn is now gone and this game is virtually over.
 [ B e7 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ B x f6 ] , [ N d6 + ]  Temporarily wins a pawn.
 [ R g1 ]  [ B x c3 + ]  [ b x c3 ] , [ B d5 ]  protecting the check..
 [ R b6 ]  [ R c8 ] , [ B b5 ]  Optins: [ N e7 ] RxQ RxQ [ N e7 ] QxR+ NxQ RxQ NxR
 [ B c7 ] , [ R b7 ]  ? Black looked like she wanted RxPb2. While only a pawn [ N f4 ] is lost. Black ought to take something if she cannot counterattack a stronger piece.
 [ Q x c7 ] , [ Q x f7 ]  ??
 [ B b4 ] , [ B x e8 ]  I finally see that I can win the Exchange.
 [ B b2 ] , [ c x b5 ]  I capture to both undouble my pawns & progress my backward c pawn as well make a spot for my knight on c6.
 [ K e3 ]  [ N f5 + ]  [ K f3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ h5 ] , [ R c3 + ]  43. ...... [ R c3 + ] - I am beginning to see a way of moving in for the kill. The enemy king will now be driven right back as follows.
 [ N d x e4 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ R f4 ] , [ Q d4 + ]  (brulla) I think 10.[ R f4 ] was a very good move! It might prove 7....[ B x f2 ] as over-zealous. (brulla) On second thought 10.[ R f4 ] was just the best of all bad moves but white really has no big choice anymore.
 [ d3 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ Q e1 ] , [ B d7 ]  preparing castling...
 [ B x c5 ] , [ N b d2 ]  ...but white is again more passive than that. True is that the white N in [ b3 ] is very well placed.
 [ B c4 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ c3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ Q b3 ]  [ e6 ] , [ d4 ]  A mistake by White. The pawn push needed to be prepared
 [ B h2 ] , [ N e8 ]  Hey if white can retreat his pieces so can black... Actually I was thining this knight woudl be betterplaced on [ d6 ] and the bishop on [ g7 ] would want as few black pieces on the a1-[ h8 ] diagonal as possible.
 [ c6 ] , [ N e4 ]  An excellent way to mobilize my knight. I am under 1 here.
 [ N x f6 ] , [ R x d1 ]  Taking the unprotected rook
 [ B x f3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ B x h6 ]  I was expecting 10. [ d5 ] followed by 10...Ne5. However it didn't work out that way.
 [ B h4 ] , [ R d6 ]  forced rook off of backline
 [ R f d1 ] , [ R f d8 ]  Black goes for massive exchange. I can't avoid it.
 [ e4 ]  [ Q e2 ] , [ f5 ]  an idea: 14.... 0-0-0 15.... [ B e7 ] 16.... [ R d g8 ] 17.... g5.
 [ R d2 ]  [ b5 ] , [ B e2 ]  developping quietly and intelligently
 [ e6 ]  [ f6 ]  [ R h e1 ] , [ c4 ]  18. ...... [ [ [ c4 ] ] ] - gameknot flagged it as another mistake. I see Graham's intention he intends to try and open up the c column and pound Henry with his rooks. Here is what gameknot had to say. Mistake: +9.82 » … [ [ [ c4 ] ] ] 18. [ Q c7 ] [ c3 ] 19.

[ N h4 ] a4. Just note that white's winning advantage is increasing even with the Best reply.
 [ N c3 ] , [ N c6 ]  Open the bishop as well....
 [ B x h6 ]  [ g x h6 ] , [ Q x h6 ]  I feel things move into my favor a bit with this reckless play.
 [ R e5 ] , [ f6 ]  The [ B f8 ] remains safe for similar reasons as before. White gets himself into a bit of a pickle here because of the threat of Bxc5. 24. [ N e4 ] [ f5 ] looks pretty good for Black so maybe the move played is best no matter how ugly the position gets.
 [ N e3 ]  [ B d7 ] , [ Q c2 ]  Looking to force some concession in black's kingside defences though Black can probably meet this fairly comfortably with 13. ... [ h6 ] followed by 14. ... [ R c8 ] harassing my queen.
 [ a3 ] , [ B d6 ]  Initially 10.[ [ a3 ] ] moves Black's Bishop to a very threatening position. Which is not particularly strong as White easily parries the mating threat. Most likely the Black Bishop is going to eventually need to re-position so maybe 10.[ g3 ] to counter the expected ...[ B d6 ] is convincing? A different plan with [ R e1 ] and [ e4 ] is in order too. I suspect 10. [ [ a3 ] ] is to help implement e3-e4.
 [ R e1 ]  [ c6 ]  [ B b3 ]  [ B g4 ] , [ h3 ]  Here I totally forgot about my previous analysis and instantly played this inaccurate move. The move I had planned to make was 11.[ B f4 ] to me clearly the best move. For some reason the Gameknot analysis engine suggested the rather odd line starting with 11.Qxd4(looks impossible to be the best move). Although the computer says it is best I just can't bring myself to believe it at all. Black can ruin the kingside pawns(although that is the least of matters) and with [ N d f5 ] can untangle his position on the queenside at least. White still has a clear advantage in this line and I can see why the computer likes it but my line is probably better. With the game comtinuation now black should just take the [ f3 ] knnight ...[ Q a5 ] then castle long with a holdable position although white has more than enough compensation.
 [ R h e8 ] , [ f5 ]  Black's pinned Knight is a sitting duck.
 [ d5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ c6 ]  [ e4 ] , [ f5 ]  great pawn development by black
 [ d4 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ B c4 ] , [ h6 ]  all kinds of novelties...
 [ R f5 + ]  [ K c6 ] , [ R f6 + ]  Maybe he's going for perpetual check?
 [ g4 ] , [ N h5 ]  Computer thinks both [ g4 ] and 76. [ N h5 ] are mistakes. Computer prefers 76. [ K d6 ] [ K g7 ] 77. [ K e7 ] [ B d1 ] 78. [ K e6 ] [ B b3 + ] 79. [ K d7 ] [ B a4 ] 80. [ K e7 ] [ B c2 ] 81. [ K d7 ] [ K h6 ] 82. [ K x c6 ] [ K g5 ] 83. [ b5 ] [ K h4 ] 84. [ N e2 ] [ B x f5 ] 85. [ b6 ] [ B e4 + ] 86. [ K d6 ] and Black is only +0.84 and thinks that Black is up 1.45 in the game. I am not convinced.
 [ B e7 ]  [ Q b3 ] , [ Q b6 ]  I think black is pretty solid here; but white has more space and is putting pressure on black in a couple ways. So here I am acknowledging this by offering a queen trade with the disruption of my queenside pawns as a result in order to alleviate that pressure which I don't like. [ c5 ] is not likely because of the weak pawn it would create on [ d4 ] but I still don't like the queenside.
 [ R a c1 ] , [ g5 ]  I go for a pawn storm I know it's a bad idea to make your king vulnerable but since I'm lost anyhow I want to go out with a bang.
 [ N f3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ B b4 + ]  [ N c3 ] , [ N d7 ]  This is all standard play - white aims for a space advantage while black aims for activity.
 [ h3 ] , [ e5 ]  White copies the mistake and Black at last plays a sensible move although it leaves the [ d5 ] square weak
 [ B x g5 ]  [ h x g5 ]  [ Q d3 ] , [ R g7 ]  The hammer blow is about to fall.
 [ N d5 + ]  [ K c5 ]  [ b4 + ]  [ K c4 ] , [ N e3 # ]  Overall black started out well but perhaps did not see the value of the exchange. The big mistake was moving the pawn to d5. With proper play the best response forward would have been 6. [ N d b5 ] [ d5 ] 7. ex[ d5 ] [ a6 ] 8. [ d x c6 ] [ Q x d1 + ] 9. [ N x d1 ] [ a x b5 ] 10. [ c x b7 ] [ B x b7 ] 11. [ B x b5 + ] and now black is down 2 pawns cannot castle and has a very exposed king. Still not good but better than the alternative I think.
 [ B d3 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ R a3 ] , [ R b e8 ]  Trying to trade
 [ B e7 ] , [ R f d1 ]  Due to the course of the game it would have been better for the A-flank rook to take this spot but the basic idea is F-rook to D and A-rook to C
 [ b5 ]  [ a x b5 ] , [ a x b5 ]  The QR becomes an active piece without having budged from its home square.
 [ e4 ]  [ c6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ g6 ]  an uncommon third move
 [ N x e5 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ N x d7 ]  [ Q x d7 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ d3 ]  [ b5 ]  [ B b3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ a4 ]  [ B h4 ]  [ a x b5 ]  [ a x b5 ]  [ R x a8 ]  [ R x a8 ] , [ Q f3 ]  On the attack.
 [ g x f4 ] , [ g4 ]  Keeping the pawns connected which is stronger than two isolated files of pawns.
 [ K c5 ]  [ K d3 ] , [ b4 ]  57 ... [ N e5 + ] 58 [ K c3 ] would not get anywhere; now 57 ... [ N e5 + ] is a real threat.
 [ Q x b2 ] , [ B x c3 ]  The point: I'm winning back the rook on a1.
 [ e x d5 ]  [ Q f6 + ] , [ K c5 ]  Ok I can't see the mate. Can you?
 [ Q f7 ] , [ f6 + ]  Where should the king go?
 [ e5 ] , [ Q f5 ]  game over for white
 [ N a4 ] , [ Q f2 ]  This feels wrong or at least dangerous to hunt pawns on the kingside while black is forming a powerful queenside attack. White's king may find himself in jeopardy risking the loss of the game while black is risking only the loss of pawns - quite an imbalance of risks.
 [ f4 ]  [ R a3 ] , [ e4 ]  This may look like a blunder but it is a calculated advance. White seems to gain back a pawn with check and then go up a pawn but this plays into black's hand because black actually wants the king to advance. The computer disagrees: Mistake: +1.15 » … [ [ e4 ] ] 49. [ R x a6 + ] [ K d7 ] 50. [ R a7 + ] [ K c8 ] 51. [ R a8 + ] [ K b7 ] 52. [ R e8 ] [ R f1 ] 53. Rx[ [ e4 ] ] [ R x f2 + ] 54.

 [ R c2 ]  [ N x d4 ] , [ R x a2 ]  He's only got two pawns left. I'm feeling like I can hope for a draw. I've got a rook on the 7th rank trapping his king. His bishop is under attack. If I can trade the rooks and my two kingside pawns for his pawn there and my two queenside pawns or his queenside pawn then he won't be able to mate me. I don't know why he hasn't played [ R f7 ] yet unless he's waiting for me to move my king out so he can go there with check.
 [ K e4 ]  [ K e6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ K d6 ]  [ d5 ]  [ K e7 ]  [ K e5 ]  [ K d7 ]  [ d6 ]  [ K e8 ]  [ K e6 ]  [ K d8 ]  [ d7 ]  [ K c7 ] , [ K e7 ]  Black resigned. It was close for sometime blackbaron. Thanks for the game mate.
 [ K f7 ]  [ K b3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ K x a3 ]  [ g7 ]  [ K x b4 ]  [ g8 = Q ]  [ a5 ]  [ K e6 ]  [ a4 ]  [ K d6 ]  [ a3 ]  [ K x c6 ]  [ K c3 ]  [ K x b5 ]  [ K b2 ]  [ c6 ]  [ a2 ]  [ c7 ]  [ a1 = Q ] , [ Q h8 + ]  Black now resigns-A very interesting game.
 [ d7 ]  [ N e6 ]  [ N d6 ]  [ K g2 ] , [ N e4 ]  White resigned here without waiting for my reply. I still have to tread carefully as after 67. ... h5; 68. [ N g5 ] f2; 69. [ N x e6 ] f1(Q); 70. d8(Q) Qe1+; 71. any Qxe6; I'm in a difficult Queen ending with my King far from my pawns. True I have an outright win if I can exchange Queens soon as the White King can't possibly stop both my remaining pawns but I don't get much practice at Queen endings! However after 67. ... [ N d8 ] I think I'm pretty much bulletproof - it's only a matter of time before the Knight has to go to [ f2 ] (or [ f1 ] depending) to hold the f- and h-pawns and then White's got nothing left to stop the b-pawn. A hard fight!
 [ K e2 ] , [ b5 ]  white cant take because black would win a pawn with 21. cxb axb. 22. ... n[ x d5 ]  [ b3 ]  [ Q b8 ]  [ g4 ]  [ b x c4 ]  [ b x c4 ] , [ h6 ]  i guess here i could have played n[ g6 ] kicking the queen but i didn't and decided to go for an insufficient way to kick the queen.
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ] , [ e5 ]  Ok white chooses for the Advance-variation of the Caro-Kann. By advancing his e-pawn to [ e5 ] he's gaining space and in meanwhile he's countering my development.
 [ N c6 ] , [ Q d5 ]  Threatening checkmate at f7.
 [ N e5 ] , [ N e4 ]  Sacs a pawn. If NxN dxN.
 [ b x a5 ] , [ K x g3 ]  Start of winning combination.
 [ R b5 ] , [ N b3 ]  Must protect [ a1 ] - I would like to move my rook on [ d1 ] forward and prepare to double my rooks on the d-file but would lose immediately if I played 25. Rd2??? [ R a1 # ] or would lose material if I prevent the mate but later I lose my [ h1 ] rook after black puts me in check with R[ a1 ] .
 [ a6 ]  [ b4 ]  [ R a d8 ]  [ Q e2 ] , [ R f e8 ]  Everybody is loading the middle.
 [ K f8 ]  [ R e2 ]  [ f5 ] , [ f4 ]  When I saw what kind of endgame was arising I stopped giving no-brain moves and I decided to create a plan in order to win this game. First of all I noticed that Black cannot create big counterplays so I could have improved my position. His only big source of play could have arisen from [ g5 ] pushes so I played [ g4 ] in order to stop that. My plan then was to block the Kingside (White pawns in f4-g3-[ h4 ] Black ones in f5-g6-h5) and enter in the Queenside with my King via e1-d1-c1-b1-a2-b3-c4-b5. My Rook would have occupied the [ e5 ] square making really hard for Black to push on b5. If Black finally goes for a Rook exchange when I'm in the corner I would accept because Black King has no entrances in my position and I would have had a won pawn endgame. It is clear that this plan has to be prepared and I have to be ready to abandon it if I can get an advantage in another way but [ f4 ] is mandatory to improve the position so I played it immediately.
 [ N f3 ]  [ g5 ] , [ N e5 ]  Even if I open the white diagonal I have to go on attacking. I have only 10 secs max per move about 20 sec on the clock.
 [ N c8 ] , [ B x c8 ]  I now remove the knight and his last good piece has gone: all I need to do is create at least one passed pawn and then queen it then maybe get a second queen to help out...
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ d6 ]  In many lines [ [ [ d6 ] ] ] is not played until White [ e4 ] anticipating White [ [ e5 ] ] but I like an early [ [ [ d6 ] ] ] as it frees the LSB. In case White gets adventurous early on I can develop a piece short or long also if/when [ N f3 ] I can respond with Bg4. This may not alsways suitable or recommended but the option is there. And [ [ [ d6 ] ] ] protects the [ [ e5 ] ] square.
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ N f6 ]  Four Knight Game.What's next - [ B c4 ] [ d4 ] [ B e2 ] or Bb5? Come on!
 [ N f3 ] , [ f5 ]  !? ahhh... the stonewall if i know the stonewall black will attack my king.
 [ N g3 ]  [ d x c3 ] , [ N x c3 ]  although normally a good developing move [ d4 ] is now ripe for the taking
 [ R d8 ]  [ a3 ]  [ R b8 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ R b3 ]  17. ..... [ R b3 ] - another invasion and I never get to drive it off. I try and break free by trading knights but this makes things soooo much worse.
 [ f6 ]  [ g4 ]  [ B g6 ] , [ h4 ]  ...based on [ g4 ] is "defended" by the threat of [ B h3 ] winning the Q. I can't play [ g5 ] though or f5.
 [ K e2 ]  [ K e6 ] , [ K d3 ]  39. [ K d2 ] is probably the better theoretical move keeping the kings an odd number of ranks apart and maintaining the possibility of the opposition but in practice it doesn't affect the result. 39... [ K d5 ] 40. [ K d3 ] [ h5 ] 41. [ h4 ] [ f6 ] 42. [ a3 ] [ K c5 ] 43. [ g3 ] [ K d5 ] 44. [ a4 ] [ K c5 ]  [ K d5 ]  [ a3 ]  [ K c5 ]  [ g3 ]  [ h5 ]  [ h4 ]  [ f6 ]  [ K c2 ]  [ b5 ] , [ K d3 ]  Not that it matters but this loses more quickly than the alternatives.
 [ B x g4 ]  [ B x g4 ]  [ f3 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ B f2 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ e6 ]  [ N x c6 ]  [ B x c6 ] , [ B d4 ]  Black has two bishops so White is attempting to force a trade of minor pieces. But Topalov knew that what was most important here were squares on the d-file. 16...[ e5 ] would weaken the d5-square. This is why he played...
 [ N b d7 ] , [ N b d2 ]  At this point I looked up the GameDB and realised that this is a Colle's system. A quick wikipedia look (did I cheat?) showed that white's plan is to push E5 and attack kingside possibly with a bishop sacrifice to pick h7. My counter play was to deny E5 (wikipedia said that the system is inflexible) - and keep a somewhat symmetrical position to attack [ h2 ] and [ g2 ] with my bishops.
 [ N x e4 ] , [ Q e2 ]  To late here now should of played this move earlier
 [ R c2 + ]  [ K g1 ]  [ R c1 + ]  [ K f2 ]  [ R c2 + ]  [ K e1 ] , [ h4 ]  Now that black has gotten the king out of the corner phase two of the plan begins: shove your buddy in front of the guard and make a run for it.
 [ K x h7 ] , [ Q h5 # ]  
 [ e x d4 ]  [ Q x d4 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ Q d1 ]  [ B c5 ] , [ N h3 ]  Here I like [ d6 ] and then take the knight if it remains on h3.
 [ R x e8 + ] , [ K x e8 ]  Black reigned. A possible continuation could be 28. [ Q e4 + ] and if 28. ...[ N e6 ] then 29. [ d5 ] wins the Knight or 28. ...[ Q e6 ] then simply 29. [ Q x f4 ] also wins the Knight
 [ Q d5 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ B x d5 ]  [ Q x d5 ]  [ c x d5 ] , [ R c2 ]  !! I knew this started the end of my game.
 [ N a6 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ N c5 ]  [ N g e2 ] , [ R e8 ]  Often instead Black plays [ a5 ] to keep the knight at [ c5 ]  [ N c d7 ] , [ a3 ]  And now I want to keep my pawn on b4. If it is forced to advance to [ b5 ] then his knight can return to [ c5 ]  [ a5 ]  [ Q b2 ] , [ N h5 ]  This is a standard move round about here in the King's Indian Defence
 [ N e d5 ]  [ B g3 ] , [ Q e8 ]  The threat is to invade white's space with ...[ Q a4 ] followed by Qc2.
 [ b5 ] , [ R c7 c8 ]  This makes the blunder worse trading down the rook for the pawn.
 [ Q e8 ]  [ Q b3 ]  [ N a6 ]  [ B e3 ] , [ c6 ]  9. ..... [ c6 ] - exploring the possibility of [ d5 ] later on.
 [ O-O ] , [ N b d7 ]  Development but I would've played 9...[ N c6 ] since that N is said to be in an uncomfortable position as it appears crammed.
 [ B f5 ] , [ Q b3 ]  Since [ B f5 ] was not a response to [ Q b3 ] we have not transposed back into my database. The queen double attacks the pawns on [ d5 ] and b7.
 [ R d7 ] , [ R c4 ]  harassing backward pawn
 [ f6 ] , [ N f7 + ]  ...the only move for black is RxN after which I'll play [ Q g6 ] with the terrible threat [ R x h6 + ] and mate on the next. If he plays...
 [ d5 ] , [ d4 ]  In those days I opened virtually only with 1. d2-d4. Against a relatively strong opponent (rated 1928 ELO KBSB when I was still unrated) I did not want to deviate from the familiar path so back to the queen's pawn opening.
 [ Q c2 ]  [ N x c3 ] , [ b x c3 ]  I double pawns but save my Queen from possible attack of black Bishop.
 [ R d1 ]  [ R f d8 ] , [ B e1 ]  I thought he would move [ B g5 ] attacking my rook anyhow he has successfully thwarted my double attack.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ f4 ]  On the principle of "I have nothing to lose so let's at least make this game interesting"...
 [ N a5 ] , [ N e5 ]  Stopping the knight coming into [ c4 ] and taking advantage of [ e5 ] now being available. But again Fritz calls for 16. [ d5 ] - yet as it plays through the analysis it becomes less enamoured with the move. So is it time for the move yet? There don't seem to be any material-winning tactics as yet.
 [ B c3 + ] , [ f6 ]  Here I have two options. Take the rook or the [ f6 ] pawn. If you are under 1000 rated think about my next move.
 [ f x e4 ]  [ B a3 ]  [ Q x d1 + ] , [ N x d1 ]  I would be much happier with a knight on [ d4 ] than [ c3 ] so I take with the knight here to start its journey to that square.
 [ N x e7 ] , [ N x e7 ]  Taking with the queen allows 16. [ Q d1 ] (or Qd2) winning the queen for a rook so he has to recapture with the knight.
 [ N g3 ] , [ a6 ]  Something of a temporising move. Having yet to decide on a plan Black puts some constraint upon White's Q-side pawns.
 [ Q x g3 + ]  [ K h1 ]  [ R f2 ] , [ Q g1 ]  by taking the queen i win the bishop.
 [ O-O ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ g4 ]  !? This is a less played move here as white usually plays either [ B c4 ] or O-O-O. However this is a very playable line as it often turns out to be very positional and dare I say drawish. Now I didn't play the Sicilian Dragon variation to look for a draw and seeing as this was a fun game I decided to try out a newish and controversial move in this line
 [ R x f4 ] , [ f6 ]  2 lesser figures are hanging yet I have a tempo and a nice edgy way to use it
 [ N c6 ] , [ N d5 ]  A very weak move. There is one opening principle that is almost always true : one should never move the same piece in the opening twice in a row. It would be better 2.[ g3 ] the Closed Sicilian ( in wich White can consider fianchettoing his Bishop in g2) or 3. [ N f3 ] wich transposes to the Open Sicilian.
 [ N x e7 + ]  [ Q x e7 ]  [ N x h4 ] , [ Q x h4 ]  15. ..... [ Q x h4 ] - as a result of a double piece trade the Wicked Witch of the West plonks herself on h4. I am looking at that [ f8 ] rook where there is a rook there is back up where there is the Witch there is Old Matey and that Grim Reaper's beady eye is on the [ h2 ] square!
 [ N d4 ] , [ R g8 ]  side steping the pin by [ B b2 ] and protecting the g pawn
 [ c6 ]  [ B a4 ] , [ B e7 ]  now starts to buidl; minor pieces
 [ N b6 ]  [ B a5 ] , [ N c4 ]  Had to put the Knight on its outpost.
 [ Q c2 ]  [ R g8 ] , [ R h6 ]  That g pawn is what kept me from winning this game.
 [ f7 ] , [ B g6 ]  too late.
 [ d5 ]  [ B x g7 ] , [ K x g7 ]  14. ...... [ K x g7 ] - the trade takes place as planned.
 [ N x d5 ] , [ B x e7 ]  With the bishop under threat I choose to deal with that first rather then BxK.
 [ B x e5 ] , [ N f3 ]  Black uses DSB to capture hanging pawn and protect the [ c3 ] pawn/square. White develops and threatens.
 [ B b4 ] , [ c3 ]  the idea is close the [ e1 ] square for the black queen if the bishop [ b4 ] move again the black queen will be trap
 [ N d2 ] , [ B x b2 ]  again .. :) 4 times already .. if [ Q x b2 ] then [ N d3 ] and fork ..
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ b4 ] , [ B x b4 ]  Lange never afraid accepts the gambit.
 [ B c1 ]  [ O-O-O ]  [ a4 ]  [ a5 ] , [ f4 ]  Continuing his Kingside pawn march.
 [ N x d2 ] , [ R a d8 ]  Not 15... BxP immediately because of 16 QR-N1.
 [ N x d6 ] , [ f6 ]  The pawns cannot be stopped.
 [ g5 ] , [ B x d6 ]  Black gives up another free knight
 [ N c3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ d4 ]  [ f5 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ c6 ]  [ e3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ B e5 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N b d7 ]  [ N g5 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ d x e5 ] , [ N g4 ]  That e pawn needs to go
 [ d6 ]  [ N x c5 ] , [ d x c5 ]  So now we have an interesting pawn formation. Both sides have doubled pawns. I was rather hoping for an end game where my queen side pawn majority may be an advantage. But first there is the middle game and the problem of how to complete my development.
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ c4 ] , [ d x c4 ]  But since I didn't tried that for a long time I accepted this time to see how it went.
 [ R f6 ] , [ f3 ]  White builds up their defenses with what they still have.
 [ c x d5 ] , [ N x d5 ]  If he's not careful [ K d b4 ] is coming..
 [ N x f5 ]  [ B x f5 ]  [ R x f5 ] , [ Q x d4 + ]  I could trade Queens right now but why...I see CHECKMATE DO YOU SEE IT.
 [ R b8 + ]  [ K f7 ] , [ N g5 + ]  Nice combination but it's going nowhere.
 [ B x g5 ] , [ B x g2 ]  [20 min left] This is stronger than 20... Bxb3. After [ B x b3 ] white gains nothing after 21. [ Q g4 ] f5! 22. [ Q g3 ] [ B x c2 ] 23. [ B [ h6 ] ] [ Q d7 ] where Black is winning. However after 21. [ B e7 ] [ R f e8 ] 22. [ c x b3 ] [ R x c1 ] 23. [ R x c1 ] [ R x e7 ] 24. Qe5! [ Q d7 ] 25. [ R c4 ] [ h6 ] 26. [ R x d4 ] [ Q c7 ] black has only slight advantage as white's pawns are poorly placed.
 [ B a5 ]  [ b4 ]  [ B b6 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ B x e3 ]  [ Q x e3 ]  [ f6 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ f x e5 ]  [ B x e4 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ Q x e4 ]  [ Q d5 ] , [ Q h4 ]  White wisely declines the exchange.
 [ K b7 ]  [ R x e6 ]  [ R x a7 ]  [ K x d5 ]  [ K c8 ]  [ R x e4 ]  [ R c7 ]  [ K d4 ]  [ K d7 ]  [ R e5 ]  [ R b7 ]  [ K c5 ]  [ R c7 + ]  [ K b4 ]  [ R c4 + ]  [ K b3 ]  [ K c6 ] , [ R e7 ]  
 [ h2 ] , [ d5 ]  embarks on an unwinable race
 [ B f3 ]  [ R a7 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N b4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ b3 ] , [ B x b4 ]  Here is where things started to go bad for me. I didn't notice the discovered attack on my knight so now I'm behind in material and have left my pawn unprotected.
 [ B d6 ] , [ N c3 ]  now i was controling the centre a lot more
 [ Q d2 + ] , [ K b1 ]  Alternative variation: 27. [ K a1 ] [ doesn't get the bull off the ice] 27... [ Q c2 ] 28. [ Q x f7 ] [ K x f7 ] 29. [ B e1 ] [ R a8 ] 30. [ B a5 ] [ R x a5 # ]  [ Q c2 + ]  [ K a1 ] , [ R a8 # ]  
 [ B d3 ]  [ N a3 ] , [ K f3 ]  Now for what I think white can't win or draw the game; I believe that black should checkmate white in 15 or 20 moves...But I try to do the crafty offering a draw 'cause maybe the opponent believes it's gonna be a draw....And he accepted. I didn't wanna to be unfair believe me I was waiting for a chance...That's it. Let me know what your opinions are.
 [ g x h5 ]  [ g6 ]  [ K e6 ]  [ g7 ]  [ K f7 ]  [ g8 = Q + ] , [ K x g8 ]  Black has no troubles now
 [ N x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ] , [ K f8 ]  The [ e7 ] pawn was hanging. The King now supports the pawn.
 [ K g4 ] , [ h5 + ]  if he would have taken i would have went to [ g6 ] and then taken his pawn on [ f3 ] and setup on f2. He didn't fall though good job on him.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ B b3 ]  This move is a little out of place. It gives black the initiative.
 [ Q h7 + ]  [ B g7 ] , [ B x e4 ]  And here I basically demolish all the king's remaining defenses.
 [ Q f4 ] , [ N e7 ]  White has to save his queen.
 [ N c5 ]  [ R b6 ]  [ B x b6 ]  [ c x b6 ]  [ N b3 ]  [ f4 ]  [ a4 ]  [ g4 ]  [ a5 ]  [ b5 ]  [ N c5 ]  [ h4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ K f6 ]  [ R e2 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ R f2 ]  [ K g5 ]  [ R e2 ]  [ g3 ]  [ R e5 + ]  [ K f6 ]  [ h3 ]  [ R f8 ]  [ e7 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ K e2 ]  [ K f7 ] , [ K f3 ]  
 [ b6 ]  [ B f3 ]  [ R a7 ]  [ Q b3 ] , [ a5 ]  22. ..... [ a5 ] - however I do have a passer on the queenside and passed pawns must be pushed!
 [ a6 ] , [ B f1 ]  7. [ B f1 ] - I suppose I was following the db here but I wonder whether [ B a4 ] might have been worth considering here transposing into a genuine Ruy Lopez.
 [ Q c5 ] , [ N c1 ]  25. [ N c1 ] - counterattack! I see that I cannot adequately defend my d pawn so I decide to attack the black b pawn and threaten a knight fork. But Chrisobee decides to LEND me a rook on his own terms with Rxc3.
 [ e6 ]  [ N g1 f3 ] , [ h6 ]  The most reliable move is 7... B-Q3. After 8 Q-[ K2 ] then Black can safely play ... P-KR3.
 [ a6 ]  [ B x c6 ]  [ d x c6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ h3 ] , [ B x f3 ]  I capture hoping to reduce pieces and thus variables.
 [ g6 ] , [ Q x g6 + ]  [ R x g6 ] is faster mate but it doesn't matter.
 [ N c5 ] , [ d6 ]  ! Black cannot accept the queen on [ d3 ] or white forces a win after 24...Nxd3? 25. [ d x c7 ] Rd8!
 [ f7 ] , [ R f8 ]  White will move P[ g6 ] to protect the pawn then threaten the rook with Pg7. Black is in a shambles.
 [ c4 ] , [ c5 ]  symmetrical
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ O-O ] , [ h5 ]  The trap is almost set
 [ c6 ]  [ B a4 ] , [ d6 ]  So Black can recover the gambited pawn but it is going to lose tempo in doing so. This is part of why I no longer favour gambits.
 [ R f1 ]  [ Q e3 ] , [ Q x h7 ]  the last resort...
 [ b3 ] , [ N d f6 ]  Backing up his fellow comrade
 [ d3 ] , [ N c6 ]  This is new!
 [ h x g5 ]  [ Q x g5 ] , [ R g3 ]  !
 [ R e f1 + ]  [ K g8 ] , [ Q f3 ]  I threaten mate on f7.
 [ f5 ] , [ O-O ]  Again the computer says I should have captured the R here. It was my next move. I have seen this before where swapping my moves leaves me with a bigger advantage. So far I have trouble fully seeing the situations that will follow suit.
 [ a x b5 ] , [ B x b5 ]  White side got a Pawn up.
 [ B d6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ N e7 ]  So I play for space rather than time letting him have the tempo but forcing him to do the work.
 [ B f5 ]  [ Q x f8 + ]  [ K x f8 ] , [ R d2 ]  Its not easy for white to defend and black has to be cautious too. This is intresting situation.
 [ Q c8 ] , [ Q h4 ]  It defends [ h3 ] and at the same time helps me making a decision. Now that I see it maybe [ Q g3 ] was more effective for the plan would be then [ K f2 ] and then Rh1. In case of black trying [ [ h5 ] ] I was thinking about [ N g3 ] and then sac in [ [ h5 ] ] to enter then with the queen.
 [ R b1 ] , [ a6 ]  Again black goes beyond the natural Bxc3+... and all this is theory....
 [ d x e3 ]  [ e ]  [ p ]  [ f x e3 ]  [ B x d3 ] , [ R f2 ]  Here it is not easy for me to say which is the best. I choosed...
 [ B c6 ]  [ N x c6 ]  [ N x c6 ]  [ Q x b7 ]  [ Q c8 ]  [ Q x c8 + ]  [ R x c8 ] , [ e4 ]  This move is simply wrong. White tries too hard to press the advantage thinking that after [ c x d4 ] he could play a combination of [ B a6 ] and [ B f4 ] forgetting that [ B f4 ] black can meet with e5. Instead 13. [ e3 ] is simple and winning.
 [ h x g3 ] , [ b5 ]  Black thinks in attacking but I think [ Q a5 ] was more accurate.
 [ N x d4 ] , [ B e3 ]  (?) Loses the pawn on [ b2 ]  [ R x f3 ]  [ Q x b2 ]  [ R c1 ]  [ R c8 ]  [ B d4 ] , [ Q b4 ]  The discovered attack (Bishop on d4) just traded the rooks and queens.I think that [ Q b4 ] was a waste of time.
 [ B a4 ]  [ R a1 ] , [ b5 ]  29. ....... b5. Here Les hit the resign button - he resigned on the grounds of ruinous loss of material. He is already two pawns down and the white pawns on the second rank are likely to drop off in very short order. A valiant performance from Les - keep trying. Kind regards - Joanne
 [ Q f1 + ]  [ K b6 ]  [ Q f2 + ] , [ K b7 ]  Not [ K c7 ] Qa7+... not really dangerous but annoying.
 [ Q x c3 ]  [ b6 ]  [ g3 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ B x f3 ]  Two knights against two bishops and white moves the quenn again
 [ g3 ] , [ O-O ]  [ g3 ] blocks my Bishop but the real threat is all Queenside. Black loses momentum with castling there is a tenet of ensuring the King is safe before attacking – but there was no current threat to the black King! Again [ N b4 ] would have been the best option.
 [ Q a4 ] , [ B e2 ]  I played [ B e2 ] for both rook and then queen.
 [ c5 ]  [ d3 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ N b d2 ]  [ N e7 ]  [ N f1 ] , [ Q b6 ]  12. ........ [ Q b6 ] - black appears to have a better spatial advantage that white but sometimes things are not always what they seem.
 [ R h3 + ] , [ K g8 ]  No choice and ennoying.
 [ B x f6 ] , [ B x g4 ]  The N doesn't "hangs" anymore thanks to [ R g1 ] since after BxN BxB+ and we are on even terms (any move to shield the check and my B retires).
 [ R b h1 + ]  [ K g3 ] , [ R a3 + ]  Not a great plan. I lost my chance to play the R's on the second rank and now with [ f3 ] I have nothing.
 [ N x a5 ] , [ N c5 + ]  And the knight swoops in for a check.
 [ a6 ] , [ d4 ]  white's taken the center for now.
 [ K d2 ]  [ R x g2 + ]  [ K c1 ]  [ R g1 ]  [ N d4 ] , [ R x f1 # ]  As a 1200 you can beat me on blitzs. I play riskyfully and carelessly. But if you miss your chance... chess is cruel!
 [ K d7 ] , [ e x f5 ]  The two joined pawns are a powerful force but it is hard to see how to exploit it.
 [ N c2 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B d2 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ a3 ]  we can already see the effects of never having got in [ e4 ] by white because black controls more territory and whites pieces are getting in the way of each other it becomes very difficult for white to make useful moves it seems like white has been trying to get in a [ b4 ] break however this would be a mistake because it would leave [ a3 ] as weak and would give black a protected passed pawn
 [ B x f3 ]  [ B x f3 ] , [ O-O ]  Finally castles.
 [ N x b5 ] , [ d6 ]  Black moves a central pawn but why this one? And why only to d6? The answer is relatively straight-forward. Black will play ...[ g6 ] [ B g7 ] and 0-0 where White cannot easily challenge the [ B g7 ] the [ B c8 ] can come to [ d7 ] [ e6 ] or [ g4 ] he can expand on the Q-side with [ c6 ] [ b5 ] etc and [ B f4 ] ceases to cause any problems on c7.
 [ g5 ]  [ K e8 ] , [ K b2 ]  Now I am finally able to advance my king and force his Bishop to retreat.
 [ N c6 ]  [ B c4 ] , [ h6 ]  [ h6 ] has been played against this opening often in my own experience. to defend the [ f7 ] pawn and a rook Q fork as well as hindering the knights forward movement
 [ K x e4 ] , [ K x c5 ]  Eliminating white's queenside threat. Black must now play to lock up enemy pawns with his bishop being supported by his king. The second race of the game now begins!
 [ N e6 ]  [ b4 ] , [ N g5 ]  Caruana is still trying but unless there is some divine intervention he will not win this game. Caruana overpushed and Carlsen is winning this game too. Will Caruana offer a draw or will he go down in flame in all 3 games?
 [ B a6 ]  [ a3 ] , [ b5 ]  Going to try and relieve some pressure in my position.
 [ K x g1 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ N x b6 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ B x e2 ]  [ f5 ]  [ N f4 ]  [ h6 ]  [ B c4 + ]  [ K h7 ]  [ N e6 ]  [ K g6 ]  [ N x f8 + ]  [ K g5 ]  [ R x g7 + ]  [ K f4 ]  [ d3 + ]  [ K f3 ]  [ N e6 ]  [ K e2 ]  [ d4 + ]  [ K f3 ] , [ R g3 # ]  
 [ e x d4 ]  [ N g6 ] , [ N f4 ]  The knight on [ d5 ] is very strong certainly stronger than Black's knight on g6. I see no reason for White to initiate this trade.
 [ R h6 ]  [ Q d3 ]  [ e x d4 ] , [ N f5 ]  21. [ N f5 ] - closing in on Henry and attacking my rook on h6. I dare not play a move like [ R [ g6 ] ] because of [ B a3 + ] followed by a discovered attack winning the rook on [ g6 ] so I decided to move the rook to the safety of [ h8 ] only for Freddy to have suggested [ N e5 ] as an improvement.
 [ N e2 ] , [ c6 ]  I don't like this because it impedes the black development. Black may have had a setup [ B e6 ] [ N d7 ] [ R c8 ] [ c5 ] but I don't see what [ c6 ] really does as it denies the black knight a good square and the d pawn can be well protected
 [ f x g6 ]  [ h x g6 ]  [ Q g2 ] , [ Q x e3 ]  I now have an advantage but one must be very cautious when playing queen endgames.
 [ a5 ]  [ R d c1 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ R c7 c8 + ]  [ R x c8 ] , [ R x c8 + ]  30. [ R x c8 + ] - I force a trade of Bob's remaining rook.
 [ Q c2 ]  [ Q b4 ] , [ B b2 ]  A safe move and I am a little worried about e5.
 [ N e6 ]  [ R e1 ] , [ R e d8 ]  Driving the Queen back.
 [ R x e7 ] , [ Q x e7 ]  Much better. It looks like the black Queen got the power of cruising along the e file.
 [ B x d6 ] , [ Q x d6 ]  He chooses to re-take with his queen. It is here that I realize that the [ c5 ] square is potentially very weak as he can play [ N d7 ] followed by a very strong c5!
 [ Q g2 ]  [ R a b8 ] , [ N b1 ]  White realizes the tide has risen along the Queenside and he will soon be covered.
 [ N c x e4 ]  [ B d2 ] , [ N x d2 ]  removing the defender of the knight.
 [ R f d5 ] , [ K e2 ]  Another possibility would be [ R x d5 ] [ R x d5 ] 37 Re1. If black tries ...[ R x d1 ] 37 [ R x d1 ] [ R x d1 ] 38[ K x d1 ] [ h5 ] 39[ K e2 ] [ K g6 ] etc then the white f pawn will queen one move before the black h pawn. Then white can force a swap of queens and (with his king on e5) win the resulting endgame.
 [ R x g7 ]  [ R x b2 ]  [ R h7 ]  [ R b3 ]  [ R x h6 ]  [ c3 ]  [ R c6 ]  [ R b1 + ]  [ K f2 ]  [ R b2 + ]  [ K e3 ] , [ c2 ]  ....[ R x g2 ] was the only chance to reduce the material deficit slightly.
 [ R x d8 ]  [ N c x b6 ]  [ a x b6 ] , [ c4 ]  Pawn structure damage as planned now to rescue the beleagured knight.
 [ R f1 ]  [ a5 ] , [ R a1 ]  Black has been content to quietly advance his pawns as White's rook runs all over the first rank. That cannot continue; it's action time.
 [ N x g4 ]  [ N x g4 ]  [ B x e7 ] , [ Q x e7 ]  A couple of exchanges sets the stage for...
 [ K g7 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ N b d5 ]  [ R a c1 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ N g8 ]  [ B x e7 ]  [ Q x e7 ] , [ B e4 ]  good move white hurries to trade his bishop with the better blacks knight that placed well on the center on the board .
 [ K g8 ]  [ R g2 ]  [ R h7 ] , [ Q x c5 ]  Never pawn-snatch when your kingside is in trouble. Besides the white queen is too late to help out the overwhelmed and crushed army.
 [ R x f3 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ B f4 + ]  [ K e1 ]  [ R e3 ]  [ N b5 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ b3 ]  [ B g3 + ]  [ K d2 ] , [ R f8 ]  moving all my force to there
 [ R x e4 ]  [ d x e4 ] , [ B c3 ]  And then as I was thinking about what else to do I realized that this threatens mate again. Not only that but it'll be difficult for Tom to drive off.
 [ B a5 ]  [ R d5 ]  [ B x b6 ] , [ a x b6 ]  My plan of attack from here was to put as much pressure on Black's weak [ f7 ] square and to try to eliminate Black's knight.
 [ R d3 ] , [ Q x a2 ]  Deflecting the Queen to a2. I guess winning two pawns is just too tempting in a tournament game!
 [ R d2 ]  [ R c5 + ] , [ R d5 ]  31. ....... Rd5?? - scuicide but black was already miles down on material.
 [ Q c4 ] , [ K h8 ]  27. [ Q c4 ] pins the rook on [ f7 ] and so threatens the knight on [ f8 ] which is why Black moves his king into the corner. Yes White can also win by exchanging everything but you should be looking for a quciker win! What now?
 [ N c2 ]  [ h6 ]  [ B e3 ] , [ B x e3 ]  I'd rather just get rid of you than worry about keeping that diagonal.
 [ N h5 ] , [ N d5 ]  I see lots of possibilities here.
 [ B d3 ] , [ N x g4 ]  Black wants to do something to break up the attack
 [ R d3 ] , [ N c4 ]  But where else to move the knight? [ f5 ] allows him to exchange his dreadful bishop
 [ R f2 ]  [ Q d3 ]  [ R d1 ] , [ Q a6 ]  Now white has a beautiful control of the situation. it is to be exploited for the win but how to proceed? Opening files andgetting the best of his rooks I´d say.
 [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ] , [ Q x d5 ]  Rather than having the knight flee black brings his queen into play very early in the game. This is rarely a good move.
 [ K g6 ]  [ Q e2 ]  [ h5 ] , [ e5 ]  Charge!
 [ b4 ]  [ N e4 ] , [ B x f3 ]  A strange (and a weak) move. This just gives the initiative to White.
 [ K f2 ]  [ R x e7 ]  [ R x e7 + ]  [ K x e7 ] , [ R x g2 ]  At least I get rid of that pawn.
 [ B c5 ] , [ O-O ]  King safety? Think brave get a rook in play.
 [ R x d8 + ]  [ K x d8 ]  [ Q d6 + ]  [ K c8 ]  [ R x e7 ]  [ N x h2 ] , [ Q c7 # ]  Checkmate! This game shows the effectiveness of gambits especiaklly in Blitz games where Black often seems to get disorientated in the wild position and goes pawn grabbing. The answer to my question 'Do Pesky Pawngrabbers Prosper?' Answer: 'No!!!!!!!!!!' I hope you liked this game. I'm happy for positive and negative feedback aslong as its constructive criticism! and feel free to leave comments. Thanks to the player i played this game i couldn't of done it without you! One thing I would like you to do is before you rate this game please think honestly and think how I can improve on it and leave comments and PM me with them. Don't just give one and a half stars and not tell me why. Thanks Tom
 [ e5 ] , [ d x e5 ]  Only move
 [ Q b2 + ]  [ K f3 ] , [ Q f6 + ]  looking for perpetual check
 [ N f7 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ K g7 ] , [ f4 ]  25. [ f4 ] - the weakie advances.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ c3 ]  [ d6 ] , [ d3 ]  Pretty simple stuff so far. I respond according to the development that my opponent makes. But [ [ d3 ] ] is a waste of tempo for white. [ c3 ] was played to open the opportunity of [ d4 ] but by playing [ [ d3 ] ] my opponent wasted the last move.
 [ g x f5 ] , [ g x f4 + ]  And that's me being in check. But I don't have a problem with that.
 [ g6 ]  [ B b2 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ e4 ]  Supposedly the game is equal here although black has a very slight advantage according to Fritz.
 [ b5 ] , [ N c3 ]  Black pushes b file pawn attacking my pawn at [ c4 ] leaving rook unprotected. But I did not see this and stupidly move knight to [ c3 ] which I thought may give more protection to my light bishop which is an important piece. Must have thought it may be important in checking king.
 [ R c8 + ]  [ K d3 ] , [ K f7 ]  30. ...... [ K f7 ] - and now Henry comes out towards the centre.
 [ O-O ] , [ O-O-O ]  We castle opposite sides so it'll be a race for the pawn storms. Although he has a slight disadvantage due to the doubled pawns.
 [ O-O ]  [ N d7 ] , [ a3 ]  Beware [ [ b4 ] ] (not now as there's 14. [ [ b4 ] ] Bx[ [ b4 ] ] 15. ax[ [ b4 ] ] Qxa1) but it's a possible future threat.
 [ N x c6 ]  [ Q x c6 ] , [ Q f2 ]  Threatening the knight on [ b6 ] but the real target is Blacks King!
 [ K c5 ]  [ b6 + ]  [ K b5 ] , [ N a3 + ]  forces checkmate if white plays [ K c6 ] black plays [ Q d6 ] forcing [ K b7 ] followed by Rf8-[ b8 ]  [ K a4 ] , [ b5 # ]  pawn mate!
 [ K x h7 ] , [ d4 ]  Black king takes my light bishop. I push d pawn threatening [ c5 ] pawn.
 [ h4 ]  [ R b6 ]  [ R c2 ] , [ R a6 ]  And now I actually started to have time trouble. I saw that the pressure on [ a2 ] does cramp white so that I could pick a pawn but I felt strongly that is was a wrong way to proceed - but I simply couldn't come up with a better plan. So I crossed my fingers and went for the pawn.
 [ N c6 ]  [ N x c6 ]  [ R x c6 ] , [ R c8 ]  I don't want White to get the c-File or the 7-Rank.
 [ d6 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ Q g6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B g4 ] , [ B e2 ]  Mm here the queen was already defending Nf3. Black wants this knight because it is the only piece defending Bg5. B[ x N f3 ] Bn[ B f3 ] Q[ x B g5 ] for free. Always a shame to drop 3 points before the tenth move.
 [ Q x e7 ]  [ R d e8 ]  [ Q c5 ] , [ B f3 ]  More optimism from my opponent nearly worked actually. I was looking at [ g4 ] until I suddenly realised summat....
 [ B a5 ] , [ c4 ]  Well so I have [ b6 ] for the knight. What a wonderful spot for it isn't it? And I precluded myself the [ N d4 ] move in addition. Wonderful! :-/.
 [ Q x d4 ] , [ d x e5 ]  might as well carry on
 [ c x d4 ] , [ B x d4 + ]  what a chess ! so what [ g1 ] [ h1 ] and that all !
 [ Q c7 ]  [ h3 ]  [ Q c6 ] , [ R e1 ]  Alternative variation: 34. [ Q x c6 ] [ b x c6 ] 35. [ R f3 ] [ h5 ] $19
 [ g x f3 ] , [ Q x f3 ]  29. [ Q x f3 ] - Glenda must recapture as the g pawn is pinned - she also comes closer to Henry.
 [ N x b6 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ N d5 ] , [ f3 ]  decided to threaten the G2 Pawn
 [ K d8 ]  [ Q a5 + ]  [ K e8 ] , [ B x g4 ]  the Black is totally paralysed of course the Bishop can not be taken
 [ R a2 ]  [ Q f6 ]  [ R d2 ] , [ h5 ]  Begining a plan to open up the Kingside by force.
 [ O-O ]  [ K d2 ]  [ Q f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ Q e1 ]  [ d x c3 + ]  [ b x c3 ]  [ Q h6 ]  [ Q x e3 ] , [ R f2 + ]  good place to resign as it appears to be mate in 4.
 [ R e7 + ]  [ K f8 ]  [ B f7 ] , [ K g7 ]  the only place the King can move...
 [ Q x d7 ]  [ N x d7 ] , [ B x a8 ]  !
 [ N b6 ] , [ a4 ]  again the purpose was to prevent her knight from crossing the lines.
 [ a3 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ g3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ B g2 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ b4 ]  [ B d4 ]  [ B b2 ]  [ O-O ] , [ Q c2 ]  Beaming down on my [ h7 ] pawn possibly knight coming down for the check mate
 [ N x c5 ] , [ Q e3 ]  Time to throw caution into the wind
 [ c x d4 ]  [ e x d4 ] , [ B x d4 ]  My opponent has successfully removed my central pawn blockade and has now posed a reasonable threat (Bxf2+) if I should ever move my knight.
 [ c4 ]  [ d x c4 ] , [ d5 ]  7. [ d5 ] - an attack on the pinned knight on [ c6 ] but black can get out of it.
 [ B f5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ Q d7 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ Q c8 ]  [ c3 ]  [ g6 ] , [ N x c6 ]  This exchange is advantageous for Black. White's [ e5 ] knight was better than Black's [ c6 ] knight.
 [ N b4 ]  [ a3 ] , [ N x d3 + ]  That bishop was just too powerful on that diagonal to ignore. Besides retreating the knight would have lost valuable tempo
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B b4 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ O-O ]  [ e3 ]  [ h6 ] , [ B x f6 ]  I think it's better to keep the tension by playing [ B h4 ] especially when you cant take [ d5 ] yet...
 [ d x e4 ]  [ N x e4 ] , [ b6 ]  Black looks to fianchethis bishop attacking knight on e4.
 [ B x c6 ]  [ B x c6 + ]  [ b x c6 ]  [ Q f3 ] , [ B e7 ]  Now he realizes he needs to get those king side pieces moving.
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ B b4 ]  The everpopular Nimzo-Indian
 [ K g7 ] , [ K g2 ]  white doesnt pay attention to his important c file he shuold be more aggressive 25.Rc1!was much better !
 [ R f7 + ] , [ K g8 ]  Not.23...[ K d8 ] 24. [ Q x d7 ] .
 [ Q g6 ] , [ N g3 ]  Therefore I should have just left my N on this square.
 [ c x d5 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ Q x d7 ]  [ N x d7 ] , [ e x d5 ]  White wins another pawn but ruins his pawn structure in the process. 16.[ N x e5 ] was much better.
 [ Q x g4 ] , [ N b4 ]  (?!) A piece down Black judges 2 tempi a reasonable price to induce White to recall the queen. It's hard to say he's wrong in the circumstances but ...[ d6 ] was probably a better choice.
 [ K d2 ]  [ K g1 ] , [ K x d3 ]  No way to promote black pawn...... if black leaves h columns white get a queen!
 [ N d4 ] , [ N b4 ]  avoiding the issue...
 [ e5 ] , [ f x e5 ]  ?? At this point due to a small correction for now I'm paraphrasing what he said as opposed to quoting. With that being said this is where Andrew really starts to go wrong as we will see below.
 [ h6 ]  [ R c1 ]  [ R d8 d7 ] , [ b4 ]  White misses the loose pawn here on f5. 33. [ R f4 ] is better.
 [ d4 ] , [ N d3 ]  such a tempting square forking the Q and B
 [ R a8 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ Q d7 ] , [ N x e7 + ]  The breaking point.Black loses a pawn thanks to weak squares!
 [ N x e5 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ B c2 ]  [ N f6 + ] , [ R x f6 ]  ? I'm not sure what was wrong with Kh8. PxR BxR BxN or RxB I guess black presses an advantage.
 [ b6 ]  [ a4 ] , [ B b7 ]  My only goal here was to link the rooks
 [ e6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ a6 ] , [ b3 ]  I normally don't open backside like this but since he's yet to place any threat in the middle I figure why not.
 [ R x f5 ] , [ R e e7 ]  ... the mighty seventh rank can be fully possessed by two rooks. I claim that even without the won piece (and pawn) the game is dead lost for Black in such a position.
 [ B f4 ] , [ B x d6 ]  He blocked but forgot the bishop was pinned
 [ N d7 ] , [ h4 ]  !
 [ Q x e6 ] , [ g5 ]  The real scope of this manouver is to allow my own lsb into the game.
 [ d x e5 ] , [ d6 ]  !!
 [ Q x b2 ] , [ B c3 ]  ok that was my idea on move 9 and finally i played it. Only after the game i found that i can play 11.[ R b1 ] and black can't take on [ a2 ] because his queen get trapped after the simple Ra1. In the game i feared to loose another pawn. Ghosts hunting!!!
 [ Q x g3 ] , [ h x g3 ]  It's ok. I'm still better. The open column can be useful later.
 [ R x e6 ] , [ R x f8 ]  White is still +4 but I COULDN'T FIND A FORCED MATE ANYWHERE! But look: don't we have a forced mate with Re5-r3? No because of fxg4. I can avoid this by [ g5 ] and it is probably the best move. But I tried...
 [ Q d8 ] , [ Q h6 ]  Was really surprised by this move. I think 16. [ N x f6 ] [ e x f6 ] would have been better and then you could follow up with 17. [ Q h6 ] but leaving the bishop there makes it very easy for me to drive the queen out. To me this was a pivotal move in the game. If you'd taken the bishop I would have felt that I was losing. I realize your knight had a great position but [ e6 ] would easily drive it away so saddling me with double pawns and allowing your queen to stay near my queen would have been scarier.
 [ B e3 ] , [ a6 ]  The late defense of the Ruy Lopez opening may have opened black up a bit more than he wished.
 [ f x e4 ]  [ R e2 ]  [ R x h4 ]  [ K a4 ]  [ e3 + ]  [ K x a5 ]  [ d4 ] , [ K b6 ]  At this point my opponent assumed that it would now become a pawn race I suppose that it might have been if he had played it right or I had played it wrong or both.
 [ B x e4 ]  [ Q x e4 ]  [ R b8 ]  [ R d2 ]  [ N c5 ]  [ Q e2 ]  [ N a4 ]  [ B b4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ B c3 ]  [ N x c3 ] , [ b x c3 ]  Now White is saddled with a slight pawn weakness.
 [ Q g8 + ]  [ K f6 ]  [ g x f5 ]  [ K x f5 ]  [ Q h7 + ]  [ K f4 ]  [ Q x h6 ]  [ e5 ]  [ Q f6 + ]  [ K e4 ]  [ Q x g5 ]  [ K d4 ]  [ K g1 ] , [ e4 ]  At this point with my opponent on about 6 minutes left I pointed out that he needed to write up his last 20 moves in his own time and an arbiter agreed. He did that and then didn't have to record any more...
 [ R e7 ] , [ R a5 ]  Attacking the a-pawn and forcing [ c6 ] from Black.
 [ g4 ] , [ h6 ]  The losing moment where black does not play the correct 10...[ [ g5 ] ] move. Fritz:: 10... [ [ g5 ] ] 11. Bx[ [ g5 ] ] [ B g6 ]  [ B h2 ] , [ N d7 ]  It looks like the knight is headed to [ d5 ] or perhaps it is just there for support?
 [ d4 ]  [ g6 ]  [ e4 ] , [ B g7 ]  In the first game vs. bvarkonyi mentioned above I played 3.[ c4 ] and Black answered 3.../c5. I continued with 4.Be3(?) and after 4.../[ Q b6 ] I was already losing a pawn. Black also has positional advantage and so I lost the game quite soon. Thats why I played the opening different this time.
 [ d5 ] , [ e x d5 ]  This is not white's best move as he does have better moves to fight for an advantage. The best move is the main line move 3. Nc3. The other common move 3. E5 posses no problems for black. Now The problem with game move is that black gets great use of the c-file and strong centre pawns and active bishops. Plus white exchanges a centre pawn for a flank pawn which is not advisable. The drawback for black is the weakness on the light squares.
 [ Q x e7 ]  [ R a d1 ]  [ N c5 ] , [ f3 ]  Preventing ...[ N g4 ] with potential disruption of the King's defenses.
 [ O-O ]  [ B g5 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ R d1 ]  [ Q c7 ] , [ B x e7 ]  ! It looks like the N on E7 is protected by two pieces but it really isn't protected at all. If [ Q x e7 ] then [ Q x c6 ] or worse if Nxe7?? then Qxc7. White was putting pressure on both knights and one was pinned. The right way to save them both was 12. ... Qe8.
 [ R c7 ] , [ f4 ]  Mistake: -1.32 » 24.[ [ f4 ] ] [ Q h4 + ] 25.[ g3 ] [ Q h3 ] 26.[ Q e2 ] [ B c3 + ] 27.[ K f2 ] [ d4 ] 28.[ B c1 ] [ g5 ] 29.[ Q f1 ] [ Q f5 ] 30.[ Q d3 ] gx[ [ f4 ] ] 31.Bx[ [ f4 ] ] [ R g7 ] 32.[ Q x f5 ] [ R x f5 ] Best: -0.01 » 24.O-O [ N e5 ] 25.B[ g5 ] [ Q e8 ] 26.[ R f e1 ] [ R f5 ] 27.[ [ f4 ] ] [ h6 ] 28.[ N x d5 ] [ e x d5 ] 29.Bx[ h6 ] Bx[ h6 ] 30.[ Q x d5 + ] [ R c f7 ] 31.[ R x e5 ] [ R x e5 ] 32.[ f x e5 ] And you know what I did waste time chasing his Q after my move.
 [ O-O-O ] , [ c6 ]  Opens up channels for the queen and stops [ [ e5 ] ] due to [ [ e5 ] ] d5. This makes things more difficult for the knight on [ b8 ] but I'm going to have to expand on the queenside so maybe it'll be ok.
 [ d x c3 ]  [ N x c3 ]  [ Q d7 ] , [ R a c1 ]  Everything was telegraphed at this stage so the bishop had to move
 [ N x b7 ] , [ R x d7 ]  forced
 [ N d5 ]  [ Q e6 ]  [ N c7 ]  [ Q g4 ]  [ N x a8 ] , [ R x a8 ]  White wins the exchange.
 [ K c5 ]  [ Q c2 ]  [ R c6 ]  [ Q x c3 + ]  [ K d6 ]  [ Q x d4 ] , [ R e7 ]  Fatal move on his part.
 [ B d2 ]  [ O-O ]  [ h3 ] , [ N g e5 ]  Now Stockfish 9 gives 10. [ N d5 ] [ B x d2 + ] 11. [ Q x d2 ] [ Q d8 ] 12. [ N x e5 ] [ N x e5 ] 13. [ e3 ] [ c6 ] 14. [ N f4 ] with a much better position.
 [ d6 ] , [ B c4 ]  White decides to put the white squared bishop on [ c4 ] giving me time to further execute my plan. The intention was perhaps to attack [ f7 ] and to prepare castling.
 [ N c3 ]  [ h6 ] , [ d5 ]  I played this in an attempt to be aggressive and to not be too predictable though with hindsight I am not sure it was the best
 [ Q h6 ] , [ N h5 ]  Good defense. A not so smart move like [ f5 ] would end in [ N g5 ] and black is in a world of hurt if not mated...
 [ R b8 + ]  [ K c3 ]  [ Q c4 + ]  [ K d2 ]  [ R b2 + ] , [ K e1 ]  Lot's of dancing. And now the fatal blow.
 [ N e4 ] , [ R g6 ]  that is not accurate.
 [ B d2 ]  [ B x d2 + ] , [ K x d2 ]  White still has the advantage because of his extra pawn. In addition Black's remaining queenside pawns are isolated and therefore weak.
 [ d4 ]  [ g6 ] , [ B f4 ]  My London system doesn't work so well against the fianchetto but I like to play it anyway.
 [ B x e6 ]  [ f x e6 ]  [ Q x b7 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ Q b3 ] , [ R b8 ]  Nah white eyes QxPe6+. [ N c5 ] is better blocking that and developing while pushing the queen.
 [ R f a1 ]  [ R b3 ]  [ B f2 ] , [ R a6 ]  A serious blunder. This rook is intended to occupy the [ a5 ] square. For unknown reason maybe my mouse slip without knowing it. I submit 31.....[ R a6 ] but in my mind it was on a5! The fruit of my hardwork slip away.
 [ b5 ] , [ B b3 ]  There is a lot of debate in Roy Lopez circles as to the usefulness of black's b5. Some contest that ...[ [ [ b5 ] ] ] only serves to drive the LSB to where it really wants to go and exposes black to light square attacks from the queen side. Then there those who contest that ...[ [ [ b5 ] ] ] is a must if black does not want to be crushed in the centre. Also if propertly used [ [ [ b5 ] ] ] can be a powerful wedge into white's position. It also give black the powerful [ c5 ] square for either his knight or bishop.
 [ K e6 ] , [ N d5 ]  trying a repetition of moves I guess.
 [ a4 ]  [ R c8 ] , [ Q g4 ]  Leeving the opportunity to occupy the seventh rank
 [ B x b3 ]  [ a x b3 ] , [ g5 ]  With the plan to fork N and P so that if ...PXP white's K becomes wide open which is known to put you at a disadvantage. With the N here however the K is no longer open as we have an extra defender around it.
 [ Q e7 ] , [ N f5 ]  The knight was under attack this move saves it with a tempo unless black wants to exchange pieces while he's a pawn down.
 [ B d4 ] , [ b5 ]  Alternative variation: 32... [ N e7 ] [!?] 33. [ B c5 ] [ b6 ] 34. Bx[ b6 ] [ N x d5 ] 35. [ B e3 ] [ N x e3 ] 36. [ K x e3 ] [ g5 ] is also good for black
 [ N f3 ]  [ N x f3 ]  [ g x f3 ] , [ Q f2 # ]  After 15. ... [ B g3 + ] the mate was eminent. I really enjoyed this game. This really showed me the strength of a early pressure on the opposing king. White gained piece advantage but loose development which was crucial in the end game.
 [ B e4 ]  [ K b8 ] , [ R a c1 ]  White consolidates the position
 [ R b7 b8 ] , [ R g8 ]  
 [ K e8 ]  [ K f2 ]  [ B g6 ] , [ K g3 ]  The right posting for the King. He can protect the g-pawn indefinitely.
 [ g4 ]  [ h5 ]  [ R g1 ]  [ Q e3 + ]  [ R g3 ]  [ h x g4 + ]  [ K x g4 ]  [ Q x d4 + ]  [ K h3 ] , [ Q x b2 ]  The pawns start to drop.
 [ N c e2 ] , [ O-O ]  Getting the king to safety before an attack
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ] , [ d4 ]  We both enjoyed a good over the board battle so fighting varations were the norm for our games.
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ g6 ]  [B76] Reflections on a game from a dragon thematic tournament
 [ Q x d1 + ]  [ K x d1 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ h3 ] , [ O-O-O + ]  Notice that after 12 moves neither of your knights have been developed. Neither have moved. Your Calvary is stuck in the stockade when they are most needed. Your planes are destroyed on the ground. And your king is trapped in the center. Would be nice to have those three moves with the queen back right now. By now move 12 your knights should be at [ f3 ] and [ c6 ] and your king should be castled.
 [ Q a6 ]  [ Q c7 ] , [ R d1 ]  harassing the knight. [ c4 ] was playable earlier instead of Qc7.
 [ d4 ]  [ h5 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ f6 ] , [ B h4 ]  You know what would be really cool here? Really really cool? Bd3. Let black take the black bishop (not that he would). But if he did Bg6#. Kapow!
 [ K g4 ] , [ f3 # ]  and there it is! a nice game against a worthy opponent! Believe me...he thrashed me the previous game:) so this was a game that would not easily be repeated:) thx maddie:))))
 [ N g5 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ] , [ N a5 ]  an often recommended sideline which is as good as refuted...
 [ K d6 ]  [ B a7 ]  [ B a6 ]  [ B b8 + ] , [ K c6 ]  Sometime around now I realised it wasn't going to be easy to shift that Bishop...
 [ N g8 ] , [ d4 ]  Allowing the bishop to move and makes the center stronger however the Bishop can only go to [ d3 ] which is a defense role (For the time being) and that removes the defender of the d-pawn. However the Bishop really needs to move as it has no prospects on [ g2 ] where it is blocked by black's center and cuts of the half-open g file
 [ R b5 ]  [ d x e4 ] , [ R x e5 + ]  I missed the double attack on e5.
 [ N e2 ] , [ e x d4 ]  I finally develop my last knight to [ e2 ] and black captures my [ d4 ] pawn.
 [ O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ d5 ] , [ e x d5 ]  locking the bishop in for the time. [ N x d5 ] is met with caution. 8. [ N x d5 ] c6!?
 [ R x e5 ]  [ Q x b3 + ]  [ K c1 ] , [ Q b2 # ]  
 [ Q b1 ] , [ R d4 d3 ]  31. ..... [ R d3 ] - piling up on the knight so the knight takes Fou Lenoir. As I am a rook up I am more than happy to simplify.
 [ g x h6 ] , [ Q g6 + ]  Another good move
 [ B x g6 + ] , [ R x g6 ]  17....Rxg6?? The second miscalculation. I should have taken with the Queen or pawn.
 [ B x d3 ] , [ c x d3 ]  I capture the knight on [ d3 ] with my LB and black recaptures with [ e4 ] pawn.
 [ a5 ]  [ N b5 ]  [ Q f7 ]  [ N d6 ]  [ Q c7 ] , [ N f5 ]  Dancing of the knight for a potential mate.
 [ B g5 ] , [ B b7 ]  Pin and counter-pin and fianchetto. The bishops are having all the fun and the knights are so full of pins they look like voodoo dolls. Nimzo-Queen's Indian anyone?
 [ N d4 ]  [ K d5 ] , [ N f5 ]  His first chance to sacrifice his knight for the pawns. But doing so means that his king is still condemned to that corner until the final pawn is picked off and the black king will be feasting on all of his remaining pawns on the queen-side.
 [ N f4 ]  [ h x g2 + ]  [ K x g2 ]  [ R x c3 ] , [ R f1 ]  Can't see an obvious way forward so I revert to my bad habit of pawn snaffling at any given chance.
 [ Q f6 ]  [ R b1 ] , [ B x b1 ]  Oops. Might not have mattered much but still a mistake.
 [ R x d8 ]  [ N x e7 + ]  [ K f7 ]  [ N x c8 ] , [ R d x c8 ]  And white has a nice material advantage and a solid game. Black should resign but the rest of the game is still enjoyable. I'm going to skip over the next few moves.
 [ a5 ] , [ O-O-O ]  I decided to castle queenside because all my pieces are pointed kingside.
 [ b3 ]  [ Q x g2 ]  [ R f1 ] , [ g5 ]  Trying to create another passed pawn
 [ d6 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ c5 ]  Here Black seeks to begin undermining White's center.
 [ O-O ]  [ B e7 ]  [ c4 ] , [ O-O ]  At this stage Black's development is slightly better than White's: one more minor piece out but there's little in it.
 [ N d6 ]  [ N x d6 ] , [ Q x d6 ]  28. ……. [ Q x d6 ] - knight trade.
 [ N c6 ] , [ N b5 ]  Your next move could be Bd6. Blocks the take and frees you to castle as well. This bishop block comes up often.
 [ B g4 + ] , [ e6 ]  block check
 [ B x a8 ] , [ R x a8 ]  Now I have a significant material advantage. Strategy is trade down and avoid complications. if I can get the Queens off the board my life would be good.
 [ B x e5 ] , [ d x e5 ]  ...and second piece exchanges.
 [ N c4 ] , [ d x c4 ]  A final blunder from White [ R d c1 ] would have defend against this threat but at the cost of their Rook ( [ R d c1 ] [ B x c1 ] 19. Rxc1). White resigns.
 [ R d1 ] , [ R c e8 ]  I now have total control of the e-file which I used as a penetration point.
 [ N e2 ] , [ Q b6 ]  The threat of ...B-[ Q B4 ] winning the Q forces the following exchange.
 [ N f4 ] , [ N d3 ]  and fork for simplification!
 [ c x d5 ] , [ N d2 + ]  Push blacks king further up the board away form the undeveloped pieces.
 [ c x d4 ] , [ e x d4 ]  Pawn exchange. I take with the e pawn so that 9...[ N b4 ] is not an option for black.
 [ R b3 ]  [ Q c8 ]  [ Q f3 ]  [ R a4 ]  [ a3 ]  [ Q c5 ]  [ R d5 ] , [ Q c4 ]  On second thought this was a mistake. 24. Rd5? Rxa3! 25. [ R x a3 ] [ Q x a3 ] {25. Rxc5?? [ R a1 + ] 26. [ R b1 ] [ R x b1 + ] 27. [ Q d1 ] Rxd1#} was much better for me.
 [ R c8 ]  [ R x c8 + ]  [ B x c8 ] , [ e5 ]  ! threatening [ g4 ] trapping the black knight.
 [ d x e5 ]  [ d x e4 ] , [ Q x d8 + ]  A good move by White. Note that Black's king cannot castle after 5. ... Kxd8.
 [ N d b5 ]  [ d6 ] , [ N d5 ]  The 7.[ B g5 ] line is most popular but this is interesting with significant theory behind it
 [ f x e5 ]  [ R a7 ]  [ e6 ]  [ R e7 ]  [ B g5 ] , [ R g7 ]  The pawn can't be blockaded since the Bishops can easily drive away the Rook or the King and the only question is whether Black gets to sacrifice the Rook for the pawn. But then Rook and two Bishops are quite enough to mate the Black King anyway.
 [ B g5 ]  [ B g7 ] , [ c3 ]  Another surprise: rather a timid looking move when I'd been expecting aggression though it looks more logical from White's viewpoint than it did from where I sat.
 [ O-O ] , [ O-O ]  I don't like this move [ f2 ] pawn is blocked. Even if he needs a rook now.
 [ K g2 ] , [ N g5 ]  Suddenly there are multiple threats on the board. White's queen is doing a fine job of defending though.
 [ R c1 ] , [ N d7 ]  Time to move some pieces forward!
 [ N g5 ] , [ g6 ]  ......
 [ h4 ] , [ N d5 ]  Knight will draw a pawn out of position
 [ B e7 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ d6 ] , [ d4 ]  An aggressive move to put more and more pressure on Black. 6.[ c3 ] might have been better or equally good but definitely a lot slower.
 [ Q f2 ] , [ R e6 ]  Preparing to double up.
 [ N x c3 ]  [ Q x c3 ] , [ Q d5 ]  This is avoiding the fork 17. ?? [ N d4 ] and also opening the white kings long way home. Moving the king back to baseline would still sacrifice two rooks. I feel comfortable.
 [ d4 ]  [ N c4 + ]  [ K a2 ]  [ K e6 ]  [ d x e5 ] , [ N x e5 ]  wins another pawn
 [ Q f7 + ] , [ B e7 ]  this or [ N e7 ] to save the bishop.
 [ R f e1 ]  [ R a d8 ]  [ N b3 ] , [ N b4 ]  15. ..... [ N b4 ] - trying to make something out of this position.
 [ B e6 ]  [ Q a4 ]  [ a6 ] , [ c4 ]  Here white prevents the [ b5 ] move which will again force white to move the queen.
 [ b3 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ R e b7 ]  [ N b5 ]  [ Q d7 ]  [ R c3 ]  [ R b6 x b5 ]  [ a x b5 ]  [ R x b5 ] , [ R d1 ]  Make a pin otherwise getting back the Knight into the game is too long.
 [ B x e2 ]  [ f x g5 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ g6 ]  [ B f3 ]  [ B c3 ]  [ Q b5 ] , [ Q f1 ]  Suddenly it is Black who appears to be on the ropes! His kingside has been cracked open like an egg and White's kingside pawns are menacing his position...
 [ R f6 + ] , [ K g7 ]  [ K g5 ] may have bought a little more time. Now it is just a matter of technique.
 [ Q g6 ]  [ f5 ] , [ Q g5 ]  Hei falls back I push and he insists on the [ g5 ] square probably looking to [ d2 ] (?)
 [ Q x b5 ]  [ c x b5 ] , [ N a2 + ]  Meh. After capturing the bishop I will no longer have doubled pawns on the b-file because I will win take the knight with my pawn on b2.
 [ N e5 ] , [ a4 ]  That's 10 pawn moves by White.
 [ N c6 e5 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ O-O ]  [ b3 ]  [ N x e3 ]  [ R x e3 ]  [ R f c8 ]  [ N a4 ]  [ R a b8 ]  [ R c3 ]  [ R x c3 ]  [ N x c3 ]  [ R b4 ]  [ R d2 ]  [ R b6 ] , [ N a4 ]  And here in an absolute equal position my opponent timed out. I think he had computer problems as he timed out in several games.
 [ R x e3 ]  [ f x e3 ]  [ K c4 ]  [ h4 ]  [ K c3 ]  [ K f2 ] , [ R f8 + ]  Getting the king out of the way as far as possible.
 [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ N e1 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ R a8 ] , [ d7 ]  Now I just need to guard Q8...
 [ N c3 ]  [ e5 ] , [ d x e5 ]  white immediately converts his development and central control advantages into a material advantage
 [ K g4 ]  [ R g8 + ]  [ K h3 ] , [ N x f5 ]  The f5-pawn goes and now White struggles (successfully) to save his other pawns.
 [ Q b6 ] , [ B e2 ]  A typical French Defense set up. White plays the advance variation (3.e5). Playing a slow game such as in correspondance it gave me a chance to play Nh6. Tough variation since the French is already so dense but interesting and fun nonetheless. White can also play [ B e3 ] because of the well-known tactic in case Black gets pawn greedy: 6...[ c x d4 ] 7. [ c x d4 ] [ N x d4 ] 8.[ N x d4 ] [ Q x d4 ] 9.Bb5! and the discovered attack on Black's queen is fatal.
 [ R f d1 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ b3 ] , [ Q e7 ]  I try to threat the pawn in [ a3 ] after the exchage in b3.
 [ B a6 ]  [ Q c4 ]  [ B x b5 ]  [ Q x b5 ] , [ Q c8 ]  Black is not ready for trading Queens...
 [ K f6 ] , [ B h3 ]  ...and it moves into that square to blockade it.
 [ N d5 ]  [ f x g5 ]  [ h x g5 ]  [ e4 ]  [ N f4 ]  [ K g3 ]  [ R x g2 + ]  [ K f3 ]  [ R g1 ]  [ h4 ]  [ R f1 + ]  [ K g4 ]  [ g x h4 ]  [ K x h4 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ K g4 ]  [ R x e4 ]  [ K f3 ] , [ f5 ]  
 [ N g3 ] , [ a4 ]  I moved my E knight to [ g3 ] and black pushed his a pawn again to a4.
 [ e5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B c4 ] , [ B c5 ]  3. [ N x [ e4 ] ] seems to be better there (like 1. [ e4 ] [ e5 ] 2. [ N f3 ] [ N c6 ] 3. [ N c3 ] [ B c5 ] 4. Nx[ e5 ] but by black)
 [ Q b8 ] , [ R x e6 ]  A Rook sacrifice that seems a little bit strange for me when I look back at this game.
 [ B e7 ] , [ c x d5 ]  opening the c-file for myself
 [ R h g1 ] , [ B c5 ]  The black bishop was in the way so he needed to move with tempo. Striking out at the white rook buys black the time he needs.
 [ N c5 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ B x g7 ]  [ K x g7 ]  [ b4 ]  [ N x c5 ] , [ b x c5 ]  The center has closed more making a wing attack even more likely. Which wing to attack?
 [ K g5 ] , [ N c3 ]  60. ..... [ N c3 ] - this knight will cut off the WK from approaching b1.
 [ N x c4 ]  [ e5 ] , [ Q c7 ]  The pressure on the white queenside is now tremendous notice how the knight on [ d4 ] can't move as ...[ b4 ] followed by ...[ N x e3 ] would win a piece due to mate on c2. Black also threatens ...[ N x b2 ] ripping open the kings position.
 [ N c3 ]  [ a6 ] , [ a4 ]  4. [ a4 ] - to interfere with [ [ b5 ] ] - if [ [ b5 ] ] then PxP and my [ a6 ] pawn cannot recapture due to the fact it is pinned against my [ a8 ] rook.
 [ f5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ f x e4 ]  [ N x e4 ] , [ Q e7 ]  The DB recommended ...Nf6? with advantage White but this is far stronger.
 [ g4 ]  [ Q d8 ]  [ Q f1 ] , [ Q h4 + ]  Trying to get my queen behind his line.
 [ B x c6 ] , [ d x c6 ]  I'm not sure if I used the right pawn to take here. My thoughts at the time were that it keeps the pawns grouped together and opens up my bishop. However the weakness is that I have no center pawns and white has two.
 [ R x e6 ]  [ K x e6 ]  [ a3 ] , [ B b1 ]  now the 2 black pawns are blockaded. The safest strategy is to directly march his king to the black pawns and win them. Both of white's pawn are indirectly defended(thanks nuntar).
 [ Q f4 ] , [ d7 ]  ! - I finally advance my pawn. One more step to promotion!
 [ N x b1 ]  [ N x b1 ]  [ R a2 a1 ] , [ R d1 ]  White just blocked off his only escape route giving me mate in 2. However the alternative (Kd1) would have given me a 13 point lead. With those alternatives the best thing is probably just to hope your opponent makes a mistake.
 [ g x f5 ]  [ e x f5 ] , [ B x f5 ]  But my bishop is also activated attacking and pinning the [ c2 ] pawn.
 [ Q f5 ]  [ g6 ] , [ N x c7 + ]  i wanted my Q where i could manuever better and keep the attack constant before making theN move
 [ N f6 ] , [ B e2 ]  There is an opening trap where White plays Nxe4?? and White wins with [ Q a4 ] winning the knight. Another line is [ h3 ] (preventing Bg4) followed by [ B d3 ] where White wants the bishop on [ c2 ] to defend [ e4 ] before playing d4.
 [ B f1 ] , [ N a6 ]  This awkward development is required because [ c6 ] is blocked.
 [ N d7 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ B x d3 ]  [ Q x d3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ Q a5 + ] , [ c3 ]  Apparently [ B f4 ] was slightly inaccurate and here I should have played [ B d2 ] still allowing me an ability to castle Queenside after this move the queenside is too vulnerable to play over and to vulnerable for me to want to castle that way.
 [ N e4 ] , [ N x d4 ]  Regaining the Pawn.
 [ Q f2 ]  [ Q x e8 + ]  [ K c7 ] , [ f8 = B + ]  Discovered check!
 [ N x a5 ]  [ b3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ N c3 ]  With [ N c3 ] white allows black to place his knight on [ b4 ] which will become a major headache. White would have been better with [ a3 ] which protects this square and still allows [ N c3 ] on whites next move.
 [ N x g5 ] , [ Q x c3 + ]  The honour was saved at least! :-D
 [ c4 ]  [ B c2 ]  [ B x d6 ]  [ d3 ]  [ c x d3 ] , [ Q x d3 ]  11. [ Q x f3 ] - the start of a queenside liberation process.
 [ Q e5 ] , [ N f7 ]  17. [ N f7 ] forks Black's Q and R forcing the Queen to move again.
 [ O-O ] , [ N c4 ]  Fritz gives this moves a question mark: I will be able to attack the knight with tempo.
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ] , [ c4 ]  My beloved queen's gambit
 [ N d4 + ]  [ N x d4 ] , [ c x d4 ]  Now I will target the isolated d-pawn!
 [ e x f3 ] , [ N g x f3 ]  At least white has a lead in developtment and unrestricted piece movement (once that knight gets off of d2). And a nice half-open f-file for a rook. I'm starting to like the Utah Gambit.
 [ e5 ] , [ N c3 ]  I then moved the Knight to prevent E4
 [ N c6 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ B b3 ]  [ R c8 ] , [ B x e6 ]  12. Bxe6?? - I think in retrospect it may be here that things start to go a little pear shape. It is very tempting to make this capture and I got suckered into it because it doubled up black's kingside pawns. May have been OK had a pawn been on [ f3 ] and [ c3 ] but they ain't there here! As a result black got a good centre. Two question marks may seem harsh but I think it is a good idea to give this doubling up idea here the skull and crossbones!
 [ K x f7 ]  [ B c4 + ]  [ K e8 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ h6 ]  Feeling a bit confused and defensive. I didn't want any more funny business with Ng5. ...[ d5 ] may have been better.
 [ f x e5 ]  [ f6 ]  [ Q e1 ] , [ f x e5 ]  White's queen has made 4 moves and yet is standing on [ e1 ] only one square away from where she started. Of course white wanted to be able to recapture on [ e5 ] and also wanted to get his queen off the open f-file so black cannot get a discovered attack or pin with his rook on f8.
 [ g6 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ Q x a4 ] , [ B x a6 ]  (!?) Very nasty would have been 34.Be5! with attack on the doubly pinned f6-pawn!
 [ h x g6 ] , [ g x f5 ]  Giving away the idea of [ g5 ] forever. Still not sure it was the right choice. But the closing-in of the dsb can't be played lightly.
 [ Q f1 ] , [ b3 ]  after 59 [ K g1 ] [ Q e3 + ] 60 [ K h1 ] [ [ b2 ] ] wins and 59 [ Q g1 ] [ [ b2 ] ] 60 [ Q h2 + ] [ K h5 ] white has no moves
 [ B d3 + ]  [ K c1 ]  [ R d7 ]  [ R e8 + ]  [ K g7 ]  [ R e3 ] , [ h5 ]  I'm going to try and convert my King-side majority into a passed Pawn.
 [ d5 ] , [ N e5 ]  Continue the fun?
 [ g6 ]  [ d x e6 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ N d2 ]  [ N e7 ]  [ O-O ]  [ f5 ]  [ Q a4 + ]  [ K d8 ]  [ R d1 ]  [ d5 ] , [ c4 ]  trying to open the file where the king at. the end is near...
 [ B b4 ]  [ Q c7 ] , [ B d3 ]  As Jack prepares to exchange.
 [ h x g6 ]  [ Q x g6 + ] , [ K h8 ]  forced. and king is trapped in the corner.
 [ N x d4 ] , [ Q f6 ]  the queen is out! the checkmate is looming!. well im giving him my rook and ill look to develop during his attack
 [ b4 ] , [ R e5 ]  The right square for the rook. All the e-file squares in the opponent's half of the board provide a safe haven for it. Meanwhile I was not going to worry my head over White's b-pawn...
 [ B x c5 ]  [ N e6 + ]  [ K c8 ]  [ Q x d7 + ]  [ K x d7 ] , [ B g5 ]  I Have a Clear Advantage in the End game.
 [ R h e1 ]  [ f4 ] , [ B d2 ]  20. [ B d2 ] - and Fou Lenoir is forced back.
 [ d x e5 ] , [ d x e5 ]  Why wait e4?
 [ e x d4 ] , [ e x d4 ]  I continue to trade down... But i somehow miss [ R b8 ] which wins the queen and effectively ends the game
 [ Q e7 ] , [ e5 ]  Soldifying the material edge and closing out black's queen's options before advancing with an attack
 [ B x e2 + ]  [ R x e2 ]  [ R d4 + ]  [ K e1 ]  [ R h4 ]  [ R e6 ]  [ R x h2 ]  [ R x c6 ]  [ B x f2 + ]  [ K f1 ]  [ a5 ]  [ R c8 + ]  [ K f7 ]  [ a4 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ R c7 + ]  [ K g6 ]  [ R c6 + ]  [ K g5 ]  [ R c7 ]  [ g6 ]  [ R d7 ]  [ h5 ]  [ c3 ] , [ R x b2 ]  black is content to start picking off white's remaining pawns while forcing his own down the board.
 [ R h3 ]  [ Q x e4 ]  [ Q x h7 + ]  [ K f7 ] , [ Q h5 + ]  White fail to see the power in Qg6! This move I would probably resign at but it give me chance to escape with draw.
 [ B f2 ] , [ R f3 ]  I tried to exchange pawns on h column and win by exchanging my rook for his bishop in f3. But it didn't worked.
 [ Q c4 ]  [ R d5 ]  [ d x c5 ] , [ Q x c5 ]  I really started to think at this moment. I was trying to decide whether I wanted to take the Queens off the board or play a little bit longer with them on and see what happens. So I decided to keep the Queens in the game and I'm glad I did which you would see later on.
 [ R a8 + ]  [ K g7 ]  [ R a6 ] , [ R c f4 ]  I'm not really concerned about my c pawn. It will not be a factor in the endgame.
 [ g3 ]  [ B f5 ] , [ c4 ]  Well in a way that's a scary move. I figured that White couldn't make that move because I had the square covered twice. Now I need to look deeper and see what I missed. After I trade on [ c5 ] I'm expecting Rc3. Or maybe he'll let me capture on [ c4 ] and then on [ b3 ] and play Rx[ b3 ] aiming at my pawn on b7. It's not like my king can get out of the center. I gotta think about this. My other choice is to retreat the queen like to [ c6 ] so he can't use the b-file for his attack. I think/hope I'll be playing [ K d7 ] eventually to link my rooks.
 [ f5 ]  [ Q g3 ] , [ Q x g3 ]  Now I get what I wanted to
 [ K h1 ] , [ Q g6 ]  adding more pressure to the bishop on [ g2 ]  [ N b5 ]  [ d6 ]  [ N b1 c3 ]  [ a6 ]  [ N a3 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ B g5 ]  It is thematic for White to play [ b5 ] with the threat of [ b4 ] and so it is necessary to protect the [ e4 ] pawn with this Bishop move
 [ N c4 ]  [ Q d8 ]  [ Q c2 ]  [ N f4 ]  [ Q d2 ] , [ N d5 ]  Trying to keep the knight in the 16 inner squares. I will now work on getting pawns on the a-b-c files up the board.
 [ Q x e4 ]  [ B f2 ]  [ B x d4 ]  [ c x d4 ] , [ N e5 g6 ]  12. ........ Ne5[ g6 ] - after that little skirmish I have won a pawn. However Glenda looks rather vulnerable in the centre.
 [ R e b1 ]  [ R f8 ] , [ h4 ]  Fixing the [ h5 ] pawn and preparing eventually to continue on the kingside via [ f3 ] and g4. The pawns on [ f2 ] [ g3 ] and [ h4 ] remind me of a common motif in the King's Indian Attack...
 [ K h1 ] , [ c5 ]  Both the bishops are useless
 [ b6 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ B b7 ] , [ B d2 ]  With this move we leave the database. I have been told by players much better than me to castle early but in an effort to maintain the flexibility to castle long I usually find myself castling as late as possible.
 [ B c5 + ]  [ K h1 ]  [ N f2 + ] , [ K g1 ]  ? Allows a discovered check that wins a pawn.
 [ R x d4 ]  [ c x b7 + ]  [ K c7 ] , [ B e3 ]  The bishop was attacked so it moves with tempo 22.[ B f4 ] is probably well met by 22... [ R x f4 ] 23.[ g x f4 ] [ R g8 ] with some pressure also remember if white doesn't force something black can make a passed pawn with c3.
 [ d x e5 ]  [ d x e5 ] , [ f5 ]  13. [ f5 ] - recommended in the DB.
 [ R x a5 ] , [ B b6 ]  and again but now trapping me.
 [ B f2 ] , [ K b8 ]  freeing up his rooks which can now finally start demolishing me.
 [ B x h6 ]  [ R g8 + ] , [ B g5 ]  Now that I'm occupying the g column with my Rook I can take the Bishop.
 [ K h3 ]  [ Q x g5 ] , [ B e2 ]  BTW he explained how you think more then one step ahead without miscalculating by saying "It's a common pattern that I saw when you took my knight. I had threats against [ [ h2 ] ] and I knew if you put your queen on [ g5 ] I could safely take on [ [ h2 ] ] and win a free pawn. If you took - as you did - I was going to win more material. So patterns help in thinking ahead. I could have played 15. ... [ N e3 + ] winning your rook for my knight. But instead I'm going to try and bring your king into the centre of the board where I can mate him." Then I thanked him for teaching me where patterns play a role thought process tactics strategies and planning ahead. His response was "I've set up a few conditional moves as you only have one move for the next while!" Those moves were concealed.
 [ Q x c8 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ B c6 ]  [ N x c6 ]  [ N x c6 ]  [ N a1 ]  [ b5 ]  [ Q d1 ]  [ Q a8 ]  [ N b3 ]  [ R c8 ]  [ Q d3 ]  [ N b4 ]  [ Q b1 ]  [ a5 ]  [ R c1 ]  [ R x c1 + ] , [ N x c1 ]  Notice how your Queen is constantly threatened or blocked due to the early Queen exposure and the Bishop file.
 [ d4 ] , [ h5 ]  Again not a developing move.
 [ B x a6 ] , [ Q a4 ]  One dangerous thing about putting the queen and king on the same line is a pin or in this case a fork. White doesn't have a way to pull off a fork here but pushing the king out into the field might open something up.
 [ K c8 ]  [ B d4 ]  [ K d7 ] , [ B e3 ]  ?! [ R b7 + ] was probably best to try and bait white to play 37. Kxd6?? Ke8! and white must continue with [ R x b4 ] or otherwise mate is inevitable. This move gives white a good drawing chance after 37. Rb3! and I could not play [ B x f4 ] because the knight would drop after Rdb1.
 [ N b5 ]  [ N c5 ]  [ R x b2 ]  [ N x e6 ]  [ f x e6 ]  [ B x c4 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ B x d4 ] , [ e x d4 ]  As I said right at the start this type of position is ideal for Rapid chess especially for Carlsen! It is difficult for Black to defend too many weaknesses! Good opening choice for White! If Carlsen wins this 1st Rapid game he will be on a roll! But if somehow he screws up and Caruana manage to hold the momentum will shift BIG time! Self confidence and positive mental attitude are crucial especially in short time control! There is one big trick left! 24. [ R x d4 ] [ K f7 ] 25. [ K h1 ] is a must because of the [ N e5 ] threat! If Carlsen finds it it is over!
 [ Q x e5 ] , [ c5 ]  His pawns keep moving forward which gives me the opportunity to get behind them and cause problems.
 [ c6 ] , [ g4 ]  Waiting move mostly.
 [ c5 ]  [ e4 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ] , [ N f6 ]  5. ........... [ N f6 ] - I choose [ N f6 ] from the database because it is a developing move and bolsters d5.
 [ f6 ] , [ h5 ]  total breakdown.
 [ N x d4 ]  [ B x d4 ] , [ R e2 ]  The idea behind this move is to play 21. [ f3 ] and challenge black's dsb by 22. Bf2.
 [ N b5 ] , [ Q b8 ]  My queen feels okay there she's still eyeing the [ h2 ] square
 [ a x b4 ]  [ N g3 + ]  [ K f2 ] , [ N x h5 ]  YES ! but it will cost me a pawn in queen side
 [ B x c8 ]  [ Q x c8 ]  [ h6 ] , [ N x f2 ]  Blundering Black's only outposted / developed minor piece
 [ e5 ] , [ c5 ]  All commonly known. White lacks of other good options to protect the pawn so he moves it. After [ e5 ] White will normally attack on the kingside while Black tries to break up the pawn chain undermining the pawn on [ d4 ] with the thematic c5.
 [ Q c3 ]  [ Q x g6 + ]  [ K f8 ]  [ Q f5 + ] , [ K e7 ]  If I can force the Q exchange I will win
 [ R g5 ]  [ b4 ] , [ R x g2 + ]  This is becoming a race and I need to gain time for better positioning of my Rook. This isn't easy.
 [ e x f5 ]  [ e x f5 ] , [ N b8 ]  Seeing no future for this knight he plans to redevelop it. But it's a long way and I have some play.
 [ d5 ]  [ B g2 ]  [ B x g4 ]  [ c4 ] , [ B e6 ]  Reinforcing the pawn. A weak move in retrospect. [ c6 ] appears better now. I as a practitioner of the Nimzo Larsen am aware that his goal is to fianchetto the rook on [ a8 ] (at least for now later I forget this) so delaying the attack on [ d5 ] is what I need to do.
 [ c5 ] , [ Q h5 ]  [ B x h6 ] is playable now since if black captures white can check on [ g6 ] followed by Qxh6ch and has at least a perpetual. White would have three pawns for the bishop and might be able to capture the pawn on f5. But black puts an end to that dream.
 [ h3 ] , [ h5 ]  I don't think this is the best move.
 [ Q b4 + ]  [ K c7 ] , [ Q c5 + ]  closing in for the kill
 [ N x e4 ]  [ N d x e4 ]  [ d x e4 ] , [ Q e2 ]  OK not entirely bad. I like [ B x d7 + ] [ Q x d7 ] [ Q x d7 + ] [ K x d7 ] Nxe4.
 [ B b4 ] , [ R c c1 ]  Double up the rooks again was my thoughts here. I was worried about hanging the rook in the centre. Probably would have been better to move the other rook to C1 and strenghten contol on the file.
 [ h3 ] , [ B x f3 ]  Obviously the bishop cannot retreat to [ h5 ] and any other position would have been passive and loss of tempo. In fact elimination of white's strong knight at [ f3 ] is a good idea and perhaps worth the N/B exchange
 [ d3 ] , [ N f6 ]  This move however doesn't surprise me.
 [ O-O ] , [ Q g3 ]  Myevilluck: 12. [ Q [ g3 ] ] is basically a move anticipating 12. Nc5. I can get my LSB on [ f3 ] instead to protect my [ e4 ] pawn rather than tie up my queen. I also like waving at his king on the g-file. (It stops [ b5 ] for now because he has to open his bishop on its line to protect [ f5 ] as a knight could get there as said earlier and with the Q on [ g3 ] that would be devastating.)
 [ h3 ]  [ e5 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ b4 ] , [ N b1 ]  11.[ N a4 ] [ c5 ] leaves the knight in a precarious situation.
 [ b x c6 ]  [ Q x c6 + ] , [ B d7 ]  Again developing with a gain of tempo. No single minor piece of mine is developed so far and my queen is being hunted I have to be careful!
 [ N x e6 ] , [ Q h4 ]  Threatening Qxh2#.
 [ B g6 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ Q e8 ]  only move. the position is scary but there is no direct threat.
 [ N x d4 ] , [ h5 ]  I'll sacrifice a pawn to remove the defender from [ f5 ] to get my knight another square to maneuver
 [ d3 ] , [ B x e3 ]  Ok ok I lost the e3[ x f2 ] check. But I have a concrete material win here.
 [ O-O ] , [ O-O ]  ?? Allows a skewer.
 [ B e3 ]  [ N a5 ]  [ B c2 ] , [ f5 ]  14. ..... [ f5 ] - bolsters my knight.
 [ R b6 + ]  [ K g7 ]  [ K e4 ]  [ R h5 ]  [ c4 ]  [ R x h4 + ]  [ K d5 ]  [ R h5 + ]  [ K d6 ]  [ g5 ]  [ c5 ]  [ g4 ]  [ c6 ]  [ R h6 + ]  [ K d7 ]  [ g3 ]  [ c7 ]  [ R h8 ] , [ c8 = Q ]  ...and my sole survivor creates a diversion for the rook...
 [ R x d6 ]  [ Q c2 ]  [ N f x e4 ]  [ b x c5 ]  [ R d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N x g5 ]  [ N b3 ]  [ e4 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ N f3 + ]  [ B x f3 ]  [ e x f3 ] , [ O-O ]  So I escaped from all danger and stay with a quality... better than I thought.
 [ R e x g2 + ]  [ K h1 ] , [ R c e2 ]  [28...Rce2??] Instead 28...Rxh2ch 29.[ K g1 ] Rg2#. The Knight on [ b4 ] is no more than a scarecrow... But having scared the crows White now wins a reprieve...
 [ K d8 ] , [ d5 ]  Forcing the knight to move the most logical square and the one played is e5.
 [ R g1 ] , [ K g7 ]  Time to activate the King.
 [ R x e5 ] , [ Q f3 + ]  33.[ Q f3 + ] didn't see that but I've got my R and Q lined up for mate.
 [ N x g5 ]  [ Q x g5 ] , [ f6 ]  A crucial mistake. Black's best defense would have been [ N e6 ] protecting the [ g7 ] pawn and attacking my queen simultaneously.
 [ N e3 ]  [ R f d8 ] , [ N x d5 ]  Exchanging material was great to me!
 [ B g5 ] , [ R f8 ]  Would [ f6 ] have been a better option?
 [ b x c5 ] , [ b x c5 ]  black opens a file but it will take a while to use it.
 [ d5 ] , [ B f4 ]  This is a theme tournament using this as the starting position. This is the "Mason Opening " named after Irish chessmaster James Mason who often employed 2. [ B f4 ] in symmetrical queen-pawn games. It usually transposes into what became known later as the London System but there are a few independent curiosities.
 [ R g h1 ] , [ R g2 + ]  I was always taught of the power of a rook on the 7th rank. Whilst the exchange was not to White's liking he should have kept the rook on [ g1 ] as if Black plays Rx[ g1 ] Rx[ g1 ] still gives White some measure of control over the g-file. Now White's king is pushed back and Black has a choice of how to mop up the Q-side pawns.
 [ Q e6 ] , [ Q c3 ]  Noticing the knight fork on [ f6 ]  [ N x f6 + ]  [ K g6 ]  [ N x e8 ]  [ R x e8 ] , [ K d2 ]  A blunder losing the bishop to the pin on Rd8. There is nothing wrong with [ R e7 ] or [ c3 ] to activate the king without losing material. Fortunately I was able to win the endgame without the extra piece.
 [ N f6 ] , [ f3 ]  getting rid of the e pawn. if taken queen develops if [ e3 ] bishops develops. if not [ f x e4 ]  [ e x f3 ]  [ Q x f3 ]  [ N b d7 ] , [ B d3 ]  developing bishops and getting ready to 0-0
 [ B x f3 ]  [ N x f3 ] , [ b5 ]  Continues pawn storm
 [ K b4 ] , [ h5 ]  H pawn makes it's move with the white king now out of reach.
 [ B b4 ]  [ B d2 ]  [ R x e2 + ]  [ N x e2 ]  [ B x d2 + ]  [ K x d2 ] , [ d5 ]  Freeing my White Bishop and attacking his.
 [ d4 ] , [ B e7 ]  7. ......... Be7?! - this move was recommended in the World Database and in fact two strong experts played this move and won. It loses a pawn however. The excalmation mark part of the move is that at least black will have the bishop pair but is it enough? I am now ready to castle but as you will see I never got round to it!
 [ b4 ]  [ N d1 ]  [ c4 ] , [ Q b1 ]  17. Qb1? - this move gives black a very strong initiative - he now adds weight to his strong queenside pawns by putting his knight on c5. I moved Glenda to [ b1 ] in order to remove her from the c file and to maintain protection of [ e4 ] - but as you will see this does not wash. Here it is folks when I am met with an attack like this I do tend to go on the defensive - it is a good habit to break and I am trying to do this but occasionally I may slip up and this is one of them. Michael suggested that I should have moved my knight straight to f2.
 [ d4 ]  [ e6 ] , [ f4 ]  The Colle/Stonewall attack — rare at the pro level but very popular among attack-happy amateurs.
 [ B x c2 ]  [ d3 ]  [ b5 ] , [ R c1 ]  aiming at the B
 [ K h1 ]  [ R x b2 ]  [ R g6 + ]  [ K d7 ]  [ R g7 + ] , [ K c8 ]  I feel like I am in a rap song. Back that king up Back that king up.
 [ K g2 ] , [ B d8 ]  guarding square in front of pawn. It's a draw if king captures h-pawn so I am taking all precautions necessary to stop this
 [ f x g4 ] , [ Q x e4 + ]  A definite gain of ground and material is level again but not quite a breakthough - not yet.
 [ N x e5 ] , [ N x e5 ]  thanks for the queen!
 [ N x c6 ] , [ K c7 ]  I capture black's [ d6 ] knight and king moves to [ c7 ] attacking my [ c6 ] knight.
 [ B x h7 + ]  [ K f8 ]  [ R x f7 + ]  [ K x f7 ] , [ R f1 + ]  If 20 ...K-[ e8 ] 21 [ B g6 ] Mate
 [ Q x f6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ O-O ]  castle due to large forkage
 [ d4 ] , [ N b6 ]  Hoping to chase the knight away or swap it off.
 [ h5 ]  [ K e2 ]  [ K g6 ] , [ h3 ]  Carlsen wants to bring his King to the other side. But the potential problem is the Black King can get in via g4. So [ h3 ] stops it for now. Still equal and still heading toward another draw. A slew of moves to simplify things even further
 [ N x f3 + ]  [ K g2 ]  [ N x e1 + ] , [ R x e1 ]  20. [ K f1 ] had been stronger but Whites' advantage still holds...
 [ Q d7 ] , [ h x g6 ]  The [ [ d6 ] ] pawn is marked for death but not without some hijinx first. Black must deal with the threats created by [ h x g6 ] so that I can capture [ [ d6 ] ] at my leisure. I believe Black has resigned itself to the loss of the pawn but perhaps they'll do something foolish like 17...Ne8?? to protect a pawn....and lose the game. At 1633 rating I wouldn't expect that. Still fun to try and in the meantime Black's fortress is opened up. I do love chess! :D
 [ N d4 ] , [ O-O ]  Tucking his King away before engaging in complications.
 [ N x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ Q x d5 ] , [ B f3 ]  After a bit of exchanges White relocates his bishop with tempo.
 [ c4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ e3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ d x c5 ]  [ B x c5 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ b3 ]  [ a6 ]  [ N a4 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ B b2 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ R c1 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N x c3 ]  [ B x c3 ]  [ B c7 ]  [ Q d3 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ R f d1 ]  [ R c8 ]  [ Q b1 ]  [ Q e7 ]  [ Q a1 ]  [ f6 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ B x d4 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ B f3 ]  [ R c6 ]  [ B b2 ]  [ R e c8 ]  [ g3 ]  [ B a3 ]  [ R x c6 ]  [ b x c6 ]  [ B x a3 ]  [ Q x a3 ]  [ R d4 ]  [ Q a5 ]  [ R a4 ]  [ Q b6 ]  [ Q f1 ]  [ R a8 ]  [ Q d3 ]  [ B f7 ]  [ b4 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ Q d4 ]  [ Q x d4 ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ K f8 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ B c8 ]  [ f3 ]  [ K e7 ]  [ K f2 ]  [ K d6 ]  [ R a5 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ K e3 ]  [ K c7 ]  [ K d2 ]  [ K b6 ]  [ a3 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ R c5 ]  [ B c8 ]  [ a4 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ h6 ]  [ a5 + ]  [ K b7 ]  [ R c1 ]  [ B c8 ]  [ B g6 ]  [ R e7 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ R x e1 ]  [ K x e1 ] , [ K c7 ]  In almost any endgame it is a significant advantage to have the more active king and this is a perfect illustration of that rule applying in a bishop endgame. Black has two weak pawns on [ a6 ] and [ c6 ] to the defence of which his bishop will be tied down. Meanwhile White will penetrate with his king on the weakened light squares on the kingside (two weaknesses!}. It seems unlikely that he should be able to do so but with the aid of zugzwang his king makes it all the way to h8. Finally we see another typical device in minor piece endings - the sacrifice of a piece to net a winning collection of pawns. Averbakh's handling of the endgame is technically flawless.
 [ R e a1 ]  [ R c7 ]  [ c4 ]  [ f5 ]  [ K b1 ]  [ d x c4 ]  [ N x c4 ]  [ a4 ]  [ N b6 ]  [ R a6 ]  [ N x a4 ]  [ R a c6 ]  [ K a2 ]  [ R c6 c2 + ]  [ K b1 ]  [ R c2 c1 + ]  [ R x c1 ]  [ R x c1 + ]  [ K a2 ]  [ R c2 + ]  [ K b1 ]  [ R h2 ]  [ R a2 ]  [ R x h3 ]  [ R e2 ]  [ R x h5 ] , [ N b2 ]  Up two points black should trade.
 [ K f7 ] , [ f6 ]  I'll just move it into the safe zone.
 [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N c5 ]  [ f3 ]  [ a5 ] , [ b3 ]  This move seems very passive to me I'm still not entirely sure why i made it.
 [ f4 ]  [ d x e3 + ]  [ K f3 ]  [ B e4 + ] , [ N x e4 ]  Well white resigned because of [ d x e4 ] 22.[ K x e3 ] Qg3+23.[ K e2 ] [ Q x g2 ]  [ d x e4 + ]  [ K x e3 ] , [ Q g3 + ]  White resigned.
 [ B f6 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ B x b2 ]  [ R b1 ]  [ B x a3 ]  [ R x b7 ] , [ R e8 ]  So the smoke has cleared. I have a rook on the powerful 7th rank I still have an extra pawn but the pawn on [ e6 ] is going to fall at any moment and Black has an outside passed pawn that could prove very difficult to stop especially in an endgame where the rook on [ a8 ] protects it. I thought for awhile here and decided that my top priority needed to be stopping the [ d3 ] pawn.
 [ B x c2 ]  [ N x b7 ]  [ c x d5 ] , [ R h3 ]  Black loses at least a pawn and still is behind in development. Resignation was in order.
 [ B x f5 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N g5 ]  [ N d8 ]  [ g3 ]  [ e6 ] , [ B f4 ]  blatant attack on she-woman.
 [ h5 ] , [ h4 ]  Now this side is locked. Black king cannot unlock it. Black don't have any good move. [ d5 ] loses because of [ K c5 ] zugzwang. [ a5 ] loses as we will see. Any king move loses (for example [ K d7 ] K[ d5 ] and white either make a passed pawn on the a or b files or black stops the pawn in a or b rank and loses the [ d6 ] and [ f5 ] pawns...)
 [ B x f3 ]  [ Q x f3 ]  [ N d4 ] , [ Q d1 ]  15. [ Q d1 ] - black decided to exchange on [ f3 ] - I was pleased with that because as I am a piece up I will need to exchange pieces to simplify to a won ending. This queen retreat drives back the black knight.
 [ N x e6 ] , [ d3 ]  Blocking queen... For now!
 [ e5 ] , [ N f d7 ]  well this helps now i can catch up on developement.
 [ R x h7 + ]  [ K g8 ]  [ R g7 + ] , [ K h8 ]  Steinitz's checks haven't been without purpose surprisingly!Now that Von Bardeleben h-pawn has been eliminated Steinitz can bring the queen into the attack with check. White must not allow black to play [ R x c1 ] which mates quickly so keepingthe black king in check is crucial. By replacing the harrasing rook with a marauding queen white increases his attacking force by a decisive amount.
 [ d6 ] , [ N c3 ]  bring out my other knight
 [ K h2 ] , [ N g4 + ]  !!Step #2 - Keep up the pressure. If 20. hxN then 20...Qxg. 21. [ R g1 ] would fail to 21...[ b d6 ] 22. [ K h1 ] [ Q h3 # ] or 22. [ f4 ] Bxf 23. [ K h1 ] Qh3#. If 20. [ K g1 ] then 20...[ N e3 ] 21. [ K h1 ] [ Q g2 # ] [21. [ K h2 ] Qg2#]. If 20. [ K g2 ] then 20...[ N e3 ] 21. [ K h1 ] [ Q g2 # ] [21. [ K h2 ] Qg2#]. So black makes his only other legal play........
 [ Q b5 ] , [ N c7 # ]  checkmate with two Knights Freddy.. in 17 moves !!! Thanks to all tourney players
 [ d x e4 ] , [ f3 ]  [ Q x f3 ] then [ B c4 ] treat [ f7 ]  [ e x f3 ]  [ Q x f3 ] , [ B d7 ]  this was wrong black move ignoring the treat coming on [ f7 ]  [ B c4 ] , [ e6 ]  yes but i will castle soon and treat again [ f7 ]  [ N e2 ] , [ B c6 ]  was not expected good move !
 [ B x f2 + ] , [ K f1 ]  He doesn't capture the bishop because 6.[ K x f2 ] A[ x e4 ] black gains tempo and with 7...[ d5 ] he gets a strong attack.
 [ h x g4 ]  [ B x e5 ]  [ f x e5 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ N x e4 ] , [ d x e4 ]  Okay. This is the set up I (and most likely he) saw coming after all the trading. I don't feel too bad but I do something stupid. Not in terms of moves (well that too) but I allow one more move...
 [ R x e8 + ]  [ Q x e8 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ R g8 ] , [ N d5 ]  blunder but what else can white play - [ g4 ] !?
 [ R h h6 ] , [ R e7 ]  Ha! Yes we could have wiped out all the rooks but this is quicker. Black's move is forced:
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ e3 ]  [ c6 ]  [ c4 ] , [ e6 ]  A slow opening...
 [ Q c2 ]  [ Q a5 + ]  [ K c1 ]  [ Q e1 + ]  [ K b2 ]  [ Q b4 + ]  [ K a2 ]  [ Q a5 + ]  [ K b3 ]  [ Q b5 + ]  [ K c3 ]  [ Q c5 + ]  [ K d3 ] , [ Q a3 + ]  he's trying to get a perpetual check stalemate so I work on a plan to hide behind the isolated pawn
 [ Q a5 ] , [ R e3 ]  Black threatens the white rook on e1. It's defended but I've been known to move the wrong rook in other games... My goal here is to get my rooks in front of my king and block the attacks on the half-open files maybe trade some rooks while I'm at it and maybe even triple my attack down the d-file hoping for a back-rank mate.
 [ R d7 ]  [ R x c3 ]  [ Q x f7 + ]  [ K h8 ] , [ Q g7 # ]  
 [ Q d6 ] , [ N e4 ]  Driving the Q back.
 [ Q c4 ] , [ Q x c4 ]  exchange is in my advantage considering the white situation
 [ Q x d4 ]  [ d5 ] , [ B e3 ]  Defending against the skewer and developing actively
 [ R x g5 ]  [ R h1 + ]  [ R g1 ] , [ R x g1 # ]  Closing the book on this one.
 [ N e4 ] , [ Q f4 ]  blacks best move of the game probably
 [ N c6 ]  [ B b5 ] , [ N d7 ]  Black is trying to entice the vulnerable Queen forward. Technically better is 6... Ng8.
 [ b5 ] , [ B b3 ]  It's more logical to drop the bishop all the way back to [ a2 ] now that you made a "loophole"
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ B b5 ]  I'm anotating this little minature because I was shocked by the way that black missed my obvious threats. Instead focusing on getting one peice to retreat ignoring the real attack that was being built up. It opens as a Sicilian Defence.
 [ R f1 ] , [ Q x h2 ]  Black has won a pawn but this opens lines against the black king. White can really get started now with 26. [ B x d5 ] and 27. Nxf3.
 [ g4 ]  [ g6 ]  [ g x f5 ] , [ g x f5 ]  Now a new avenue of attack opens for Janowski.
 [ R e2 ] , [ R f8 ]  This move is more active than [ N f8 ] which is also playable.
 [ Q x g7 ] , [ B x g7 ]  White is an exchange under but with a lot of pawns to compensate it. The rest of the game is a lesson about how NOT to play an endgame and my shame is to get a drawn position in which my opponent lost by time. Kudos to him it was a memorabe blitz against a much stronger opponent he almost won.
 [ Q e1 + ]  [ K h3 ]  [ B e6 + ]  [ g4 ]  [ Q x f1 + ]  [ K g3 ] , [ B d6 + ]  [ B f2 + ] looked wonderful but I didn't want the king to escape in f5. I was not sure of the mate yet but it was obviously somewhere ahead. With this move white has [ f4 ] but this just blocks the square all the same.
 [ c2 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ c1 = Q ]  [ B x c1 ]  [ R x c1 ] , [ R d3 ]  true to his style his last move is an attacking move!!
 [ Q b1 ] , [ R c6 ]  The rook takes the lead on attacking white's other weakness on c3.
 [ B x f7 ] , [ R x c8 + ]  Less pieces easier the victory
 [ B d7 ] , [ B d3 ]  For reasons that aren't clear to me Stockfish 9 thinks that 7. [ c x d5 ] [ e x d5 ] 8. [ B d3 ] is much better.
 [ d x c3 ]  [ b x c3 ] , [ O-O ]  Black's position is OK here although if I'd thought about White's next move I might have been tempted to shore up the [ c5 ] pawn somehow - perhaps I should be looking to play [ B g4 ] or [ B d7 ] at this stage. 11. ... [ B g4 ] 12. [ B a3 ] [ b6 ] 13. [ N f d4 ] [ N x d4 ] is interesting. By contrast with the game line Black can develop his Q-side but will his king get stuck in the centre?
 [ R x e3 + ]  [ N x e3 ]  [ K f4 ]  [ N d5 + ] , [ K e4 ]  Fortunately the knight can give a few checks and at the same time maneuver to a better spot.
 [ O-O ] , [ N d2 ]  to get rid of that annoying knight on [ e4 ]  [ N d6 ] , [ c5 ]  and now a pawn break not the previously intended one (d5) but a [ c5 ] pawn break and black has nothing better than the sequence bx[ c5 ] [ d x c5 ]  [ b x c5 ]  [ d x c5 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ f x e4 ] , [ B c3 ]  and now the bishop is aimed at [ g6 ]  [ a5 ] , [ f3 ]  now another pawn break to open the f column while getting rid of the [ e4 ] pawn
 [ b x a3 ]  [ R x a3 ] , [ N b5 ]  positional weakness.
 [ g x f5 ]  [ R x f5 ]  [ R e4 ] , [ N d5 ]  This position I analysed for quite a while I know all too well when things get a tad tight if I make a mistake it could all but cost me the game
 [ R x h7 ]  [ R x e3 ]  [ K f2 ] , [ R x c3 ]  38…[ R x [ c3 ] ] post game play through and I don’t see much value in my [ c3 ] pawn so he should have considered …[ R h3 ] …Kg8.
 [ N c3 ]  [ N b4 ]  [ B b3 ] , [ g5 ]  I was expecting [ B f5 ] here; I can't remember what I had prepared against it but had given it a lot of thought. However black opts not to pursue the attack on c2. The move he plays is a bit risky given the open centre.
 [ B x c6 + ]  [ N x c6 ]  [ d x c5 ]  [ O-O ]  [ c x d6 ] , [ c x d6 ]  10. ........... [ c x [ d6 ] ] - I then exchange pawns on [ d6 ] ensuring that I will be a clear piece up.
 [ R d1 ] , [ R x d1 # ]  
 [ R a e8 ] , [ R b1 ]  ? This is the turning point in the game. White apparently underestimates the gravity of his situation and thinks he has a move to spare here but in games this sharp every tempo is precious. Trying for counterplay is good but [ b7 ] is entirely safe even if Black plays inaccurately with 15...[ Q x a3 ] (16.Rxb7? [ Q x c3 + ] and White is in trouble). White desperately needed to get his King off the e-file but now it is too late and there's no way out without significant material loss.
 [ B x f1 + ]  [ R h x f1 ]  [ Q x e3 ]  [ K g1 ]  [ Q x g3 + ]  [ R g2 ]  [ Q e3 + ] , [ R g f2 ]  A useful pin that allows me to swing the rook into action without threats of r[ f8 # ]  [ R d6 ]  [ K g2 ] , [ R g6 + ]  It's going to be curtains for white...
 [ R x a5 ]  [ h4 ]  [ g x h4 ]  [ R x h4 ] , [ K d7 ]  And here I thought that I had the win in the bag.
 [ O-O ]  [ Q d6 ] , [ R c2 ]  Ganging up on the c-file. Very crude play but effective in the given position.
 [ K x f3 ]  [ K x c3 ]  [ e4 ]  [ K d2 ] , [ K f2 ]  Here White resigns as it is not possible for white to prevent Queening of [ e4 ] pawn as the important squares [ e1 ] [ e2 ] [ e3 ] are blocked by Black's Queen. The White King cannot occupy any of these squares and cannot stop Queen promotion.
 [ Q f3 ] , [ B e6 ]  -
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ] , [ c4 ]  This move has been played against me a couple of times recently and though at first I was a bit taken aback I rather like playing against it now. Symmetrical English positions aren't usually my happiest hunting ground but with [ e4 ] systems I really quite enjoy them
 [ c x d5 ] , [ d4 ]  a must. white has to free his queenside pieces...
 [ Q g5 ]  [ g3 ]  [ Q c1 + ]  [ B d1 ]  [ b5 ]  [ B x g7 ] , [ f6 ]  Black traps whites bishop In order to do the same to white.
 [ R x b2 ]  [ R x b2 ]  [ Q x e5 ]  [ Q a3 ]  [ Q x h8 + ]  [ K e7 ] , [ R d1 ]  With a horrible mating threat. Thanks for reading this please rate my annotation and leave some comments!
 [ N b4 ]  [ a x b4 ] , [ a x b4 ]  this is better than en passant: this opens up lines...
 [ c x b5 ]  [ a x b5 ] , [ B x b5 ]  here we are whith a problematic attack to my poor rook i will take the opotunity to move this rook to the h colon
 [ Q h5 ] , [ O-O ]  Again with the f7? White is single-minded in her assault on f7. But now castling is safe and the pawn at [ f7 ] is snug as a rug with that rook backing him up.
 [ R x b1 + ]  [ K g2 ]  [ N e3 + ]  [ K g3 ] , [ B e5 + ]  the plot thickens...
 [ e x f7 + ]  [ K x f7 ] , [ N e5 + ]  either the c pawn or Blacks B leave the board so the extra R will win quickly. Black resigned.
 [ e5 ]  [ N f d7 ]  [ f4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ f6 ]  [ g3 ]  [ a6 ]  [ B h3 ]  [ Q e7 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ b5 ]  [ Q f2 ]  [ b4 ]  [ N e2 ]  [ c4 ]  [ O-O ]  [ R g8 ]  [ K h1 ]  [ h6 ]  [ c3 ]  [ g5 ]  [ Q g2 ]  [ g4 ]  [ N h4 ]  [ g x h3 ]  [ Q x h3 ]  [ f5 ]  [ a4 ]  [ b x a3 ]  [ e ]  [ p ]  [ R x a3 ]  [ R b8 ]  [ B c1 ] , [ Q g7 ]  Here I moved Queen to g7. White is down material so I thought I would go here to try to trade Queens. But also of the Bishop on [ f8 ] attacking his Rook on a3.
 [ d x e5 ]  [ Q x e5 ]  [ B x d5 ]  [ Q x d5 ] , [ Q c1 ]  protecting [ c5 ] pawn
 [ R x f4 ]  [ K g1 ]  [ R c4 ]  [ R b2 ] , [ R c x c2 ]  He should trade here.
 [ N g f6 ]  [ R h e1 ]  [ O-O-O ]  [ g5 ]  [ N h5 ]  [ B d4 ]  [ N x f4 ]  [ B x g7 ]  [ R x h3 ]  [ N e2 ]  [ N g2 ]  [ R e h1 ]  [ R e3 ]  [ K d2 ]  [ N c5 ]  [ N f4 ]  [ N e4 + ]  [ K c1 ]  [ N x f4 ]  [ R h8 ]  [ c6 ]  [ R x d8 + ]  [ K x d8 ]  [ d x c6 ]  [ b x c6 ]  [ B f6 + ]  [ N x f6 ]  [ g x f6 ]  [ R e4 ]  [ R x d6 + ]  [ K c7 ]  [ R d1 ]  [ R a4 ]  [ a3 ]  [ N e2 + ]  [ K b1 ]  [ R f4 ]  [ K a2 ]  [ R x f6 ]  [ c3 ]  [ N g3 ]  [ R g1 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ N c5 ]  [ R e7 + ]  [ K d8 ]  [ R e3 ]  [ R f2 ]  [ R h3 ]  [ N a4 ]  [ K b3 ]  [ N c5 + ]  [ K a2 ]  [ K c7 ]  [ R h7 ]  [ g5 ]  [ R h3 ]  [ g4 ]  [ R g3 ]  [ f5 ]  [ R e3 ]  [ f4 ]  [ R e5 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ R a5 ]  [ g3 ]  [ R x a6 ]  [ g2 ]  [ R a8 ]  [ g1 = Q ]  [ R e8 ]  [ Q c1 ]  [ K b3 ]  [ Q x b2 + ]  [ K c4 ]  [ N b6 + ]  [ K d3 ]  [ Q d2 + ]  [ K e4 ]  [ Q e2 + ]  [ K f5 ]  [ Q x e8 ]  [ c4 ]  [ Q f7 + ]  [ K e4 ]  [ Q x c4 + ]  [ K f5 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ a4 ]  [ R a2 ]  [ K g5 ]  [ f3 ]  [ a5 ] , [ R x a5 + ]  Now that I am 19 points down it is time to resign. With a rook and a queen in play he should force mate within a few moves. But watch carefully and learn what NOT to do when you have a big advantage.
 [ R e1 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ B x e4 ]  [ f x e4 ]  [ R x e4 ] , [ O-O-O ]  White is behind in development for now but his Rook and Queen are far better than any of Black's forces.
 [ B x d5 + ]  [ N x d5 ] , [ Q x d5 + ]  Black resigned...
 [ g5 ]  [ h x g5 ]  [ d5 ]  [ Q c2 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ Q x e4 ]  [ B c5 ] , [ Q e5 ]  ooh! I think he's going to regret that move!
 [ B e3 ] , [ h5 ]  Thank god for his sense of wasting turns.
 [ e x d4 ] , [ Q b6 ]  Black launches a queen attack but overlooks a tactic by white. Rate as ?? and +\- because black will lose a piece from this move.
 [ d x e4 ]  [ e5 ] , [ b3 ]  12.[ b3 ] so he'll fianchetto. His DSB is pretty strong but I can shut it down. Kinda thinking of ...Nd4...[ N c6 ] (maybe ...Ne6). Would be nice to tempt his c-pawn to c4. Also gotta load up the d-file.
 [ B d2 ] , [ N d5 ]  This gives my b-Pawn another defender and also allows me to play [ f6 ] at some point relieving my Rook from the need to defend it.
 [ K x e8 ] , [ c4 ]  ?? I guess he didn't see the mate in two.
 [ c3 ] , [ N d3 ]  simply loses a knight for free...
 [ N g5 ]  [ N h5 ]  [ g4 ] , [ N g3 ]  Safe and logical
 [ N f3 ]  [ Q x g2 ] , [ R g1 ]  Trying to keep his crosshairs on the queen but this will lead to some losses.
 [ Q f6 ]  [ b5 ] , [ N a5 ]  after [ a x b5 ] [ a x b5 ] also Na5; [ N e7 ] is looking bad after [ N e5 ] threatening Nd7...
 [ d4 ] , [ B b4 ]  Now! I'm prepared to exchange this B is needed.
 [ K b8 ]  [ B x e4 ] , [ B f6 ]  Hindering my pawn advance and protecting the e pawn from [ B d8 ] but giving my king some breathing room.
 [ R c1 ]  [ N x a2 ] , [ N e5 ]  I wanted to introduce some tactics into the position...
 [ B x d5 ]  [ c x d5 ] , [ d4 ]  I would not be surprised if this is a main line of the 12.[ B x d5 ] [ c x d5 ] variation arrived at via transposition.
 [ R b8 ] , [ B c4 ]  better is surely [ B a4 ]  [ a5 ]  [ B f6 ] , [ a4 ]  Computer calls this a blunder preferring [ h5 ] and we will see why
 [ R f c1 ]  [ B x c4 ]  [ R x c4 ]  [ B x d6 ]  [ B x d6 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ R x d4 ]  [ N x d6 ]  [ R x d6 ] , [ R b7 ]  Relax. My advantage stand still if I can take the c pawn I win.
 [ K g4 ]  [ b4 ]  [ h5 ] , [ b x a5 ]  And Black resigns as the Pawn cannot be stopped.
 [ g6 ]  [ e6 ]  [ f x e6 ]  [ B x e6 + ]  [ K h8 ] , [ f7 ]  the pawn on [ f7 ] creates some tactical possilities and prevents black from playing ... Re8.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ N f6 ]  Entering the Petrov Defence.
 [ Q f7 ]  [ Q e5 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ K g7 ] , [ Q x b7 ]  Trying to capture his rook.
 [ K h8 ] , [ B f4 ]  here I go attacking the bishop
 [ K g7 ]  [ R h7 + ]  [ K f6 ]  [ Q f3 + ] , [ K e7 ]  Note that white still has yet to regain the material lost in the sacrifice of the bishop earlier. Nonetheless white's victory is all but assured...
 [ N x g5 ]  [ N f5 ] , [ h x g6 ]  31. hxg6. Now that the Rook is gone from the g-file this move clears out another file and prepares the next big blow.
 [ B c4 ]  [ c6 ]  [ d6 ]  [ e x d6 ] , [ d4 ]  I started to figure this would be a battle of tempo.
 [ N e3 ] , [ N c4 ]  Let the punishment commense. 14. Ne3? loses a pawn. White is forked. He won't enjoy 15. ... [ N x e3 ] doubling his pawns in a bad way nor will he enjoy 15. ... [ N x b2 ] so his reply is essentially forced.
 [ g x f4 ]  [ N x c2 + ]  [ K d2 ]  [ N x a1 ]  [ R x a1 ] , [ b5 ]  All those exchanges left material even mathematically but instead of being ahead by two pieces black is now ahead by a rook+pawn. In my opinion that is a much easier endgame to win and more likely to produce additional advantages before we reach that endgame. Further the white pawns are much more disrupted with the isolated h pawn and the doubled f-pawns and the backward d and b pawns all of which amount to structural/positional flaws that black should be able to exploit given his material advantage.
 [ N d2 ] , [ R a3 ]  Inducing Harrwitz to jettison the backward KP in hopes of counterplay.
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ c4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ c6 ]  [ e3 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ B d3 ] , [ B e6 ]  In the QGD exchange black usually goes for ...[ B e7 ] and ...[ N b d7 ] first.
 [ N b2 ]  [ Q c2 ]  [ N x d3 + ]  [ Q x d3 ] , [ c5 ]  I don't mind [ c4 ] but I don't want to play nothing like [ d x c5 ] allowing him to open the diag specially now that my lsb is gone.
 [ B b2 ] , [ e5 ]  Korchnoi maintains the initiative and strives to further punish white's backward c pawn by trying to make it isolated via an exchange on e5.
 [ e6 ] , [ f6 ]  Not 17...[ N x e6 ] 18.[ Q c2 ] 0-0 19.[ Q x f5 ] [ g6 ] 20.[ Q x d5 ] [ N x f4 ] 21.[ R x e7 ] [ N x d5 ] 22.Rxef7+_
 [ B f2 ]  [ R g4 ]  [ Q h3 ]  [ N d2 ]  [ h5 ] , [ R g5 ]  White resigns. 43..q[ h4 ] wins. Here is a sample variation.
 [ N x h3 + ] , [ K h2 ]  I get out by playing this. That's because he has told me that bringing your monarch to the corner is an important part of King safety. However my King is not safe no matter how you slice it.
 [ R f g8 ] , [ R e4 ]  He tries to eradicate the danger but
 [ O-O ]  [ O-O ] , [ B e6 ]  black tries to hold on to [ d5 ] with this move now all of his minor pieces are developed.
 [ f4 ] , [ g4 ]  black is going all in ..I am expecting [ N h6 ] with [ Q h5 ] to follow...[ K g7 ] & [ R h8 ] gives an attack...
 [ O-O ]  [ O-O ] , [ Q e1 ]  Perhaps White is looking to acquire the pawn on d3? A better play would be to get the DSB in action by moving the b pawn. Once you castle your development isn't complete until you connect your rooks.
 [ e4 ]  [ B x e4 ] , [ B f5 ]  Alternative variation: 28... [ Q f7 ] 29. [ Q x g5 + ] Alternative variation: 28... [ Q e8 ] 29. [ Q x g5 + ] Alternative variation: 28... [ Q x e4 ] 29. [ Q x g5 + ]  [ B x f5 ]  [ Q x f5 ] , [ N h6 + ]  With mate coming up.
 [ R g6 ] , [ e6 ]  ? Better to just take the pawn.
 [ g4 ]  [ K e6 ]  [ K f1 ]  [ K e5 ] , [ a4 ]  I doubt DV will let me promote but I have to try...
 [ B d6 ] , [ N e5 ]  The thematic... threatening NxB for one side...
 [ R g7 ]  [ Q x h6 + ]  [ R h7 ]  [ Q f6 + ]  [ R g7 ] , [ R a7 ]  This is getting worrying now i need to be real careful...
 [ R a2 ] , [ e6 + ]  A decisive move that came from nowhere! I'm still not sure I myself saw it! I bait the King with the central pawns to remove the c-pawn and the powerful Rook behind it. With a Rook positioned on the 8th rank I can better fight the b-pawn and its escort.
 [ N f6 ] , [ B g5 ]  I believe this is the first time I've played this opening the Trompowski attack.
 [ Q x g4 ] , [ B x g4 ]  White captured the queen as expected and black recaptured with the LB.
 [ Q c4 + ]  [ K g6 ] , [ Q g4 + ]  Same story here except now even though this is a mistake I am going to work around Black's active Queen and Rook (this is a successful plan).
 [ f5 ] , [ f4 ]  Inviting black to break up his pawns and preventing black from playing 17. [ f5 ] and forking the white queen and bishop.
 [ c5 ] , [ Q d3 ]  Doesn't appear to be any immediate threat to the queen on [ d3 ] it keeps the DSB diagonal open and it is more actively placed than d1. The rooks will also connect once that bishop moves...
 [ f3 ]  [ N h6 ]  [ B f6 ] , [ R h7 ]  The BQ is dued to the defence of g6. If black moves [ N b6 ] RxB can be considered.
 [ B x f5 ]  [ B h6 ] , [ B f8 ]  I lose a minor piece if I retreat the rook. I decided to keep the game complicated.
 [ N f6 ] , [ O-O ]  business as usual; White could also consider the ancient Steinitz favorite [ d3 ] which is a bit slow but very playable for White; which again Fischer showed us on several occasions in tournament play... we will try this on a next occasion...
 [ K e7 ]  [ N c7 ]  [ Q b6 ] , [ Q x c4 ]  Winning a pawn back and preparing to play [ a5 ] when black is mated or loses the queen.
 [ g4 ] , [ h x g4 ]  i decided to exchange pawns although it will open a file for the black rook as i was afraid black may play 17....gxh3.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ O-O ] , [ h5 ]  a very interesting variant
 [ N d2 ] , [ N f6 ]  Black is free anytime he wants to play d5. Traditional logic is that [ [ d5 ] ] expands the black center with a gain of tempo but is it really? After [ [ d5 ] ] white moves the bishop (either to [ b3 ] or to b5) but didn't he want to anyway? By white making a move he wanted to make the effect of the so called gain is negligible.
 [ h x g4 ] , [ N x f7 ]  ?? [ B x d6 ] was the right move. If [ f x e6 ] [ N x e6 ] forking Q and R and threatening to take with check. I just blundered here!
 [ Q b3 ] , [ O-O-O ]  Defending [ b7 ] and getting the last Rook into play.
 [ d x e5 ] , [ d x e5 ]  11. .... [ d x e5 ] - after that pawn trade my position looks a little less cramped but white still has a lotta play here!
 [ R x e6 ]  [ Q g4 ]  [ R h e8 ] , [ f4 ]  Aiming for f5-f6. While black can rather easily prevent this threat it also creates a fast lane for my king and allows my knight to develop behind the f-pawn rather than blocking it.
 [ d5 ]  [ B b3 ]  [ N x b3 ] , [ a x b3 ]  got a double up on pawns for the future
 [ R d3 ]  [ Q c5 + ]  [ K h1 ]  [ c x d6 ]  [ b4 ]  [ Q b6 ]  [ R d4 ]  [ N g4 ]  [ R f1 ]  [ R a e8 ]  [ f5 ] , [ R e1 ]  ! One blow after another. I was sure when he made this excellent move I was lost. [ R x e1 ] nf2+.
 [ B x h3 ]  [ g3 ]  [ B g4 ] , [ K g2 ]  21. [ K g2 ] - I decided to move Henry to this square because I had a BxRP sac idea of my own. I also had big ideas of piling up with my major pieces on the h file. Unfortunately Dave unleashes his own deadly plan.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B c5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ d6 ] , [ h3 ]  White had better continue with his development. This achieves nothing except for weaking the pprotectetion of of kings side .
 [ N f x d5 ] , [ g3 ]  Maybe my pawns can stir things up.
 [ Q x b2 ]  [ R b1 ] , [ Q x a2 ]  Black has reached the end of this attack: Whites' turn...
 [ O-O ] , [ Q f8 ]  this is a very important move from me...[ N f3 ] to [ N h2 ] thereby giving more defence
 [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ e6 ] , [ N f3 ]  3. [ N f3 ] - transposing this opening into a Reti.
 [ N f6 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ B g4 ]  Developing with a pin.
 [ g3 ] , [ R e8 ]  The rook does not seem to have many present opportunities to exert influence even on the a file so zigzagging to e8-e7-[ d7 ] seems to be its best choice.
 [ N x g6 ]  [ B x g6 ] , [ Q x g6 + ]  so ? did you appreciate this game ?
 [ N f3 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ O-O ] , [ Q g6 ]  ???? a huge mistake. black leaves the [ e5 ] pawn and loses the [ f7 ] pawn afterwards. 4... [ d6 ] with [ B g4 ] later on was inquired.
 [ R x b1 ]  [ R x b1 ] , [ a5 ]  Trying to save the pawn
 [ Q x a4 ]  [ Q x c3 ] , [ Q e8 ]  38. [ Q e8 ] - Glenda gets behind the majority pawn which could become passed. Here is the maxim when in a rook or queen ending always get your heavy piece behind the passed enemy pawn. Also there is the possibility here that if Maria advances her pawns at an innopportune moment then Glenda can check her king to kingdom come!
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ d4 ]  The Scotch Game a rather old-fashioned opening.
 [ N a6 ] , [ N d6 ]  Smacking the Queen once more. The d6-square is a fine piece of real estate for the knight. Black is in something of a bind now.
 [ N g5 ]  [ B x g5 ] , [ f4 ]  ...earlier white had to get the [ N f3 ] to [ d2 ] to avoid this trap...
 [ Q h5 + ] , [ Q h2 ]  White would be thrilled with a Queen trade at this point. Black only played 31...[ Q h5 + ] to draw the WQ off the h1-[ e4 ] diagonal but by now White simply has too many resources.
 [ N d7 ] , [ B c3 ]  This position should tell the strategic story. Comparative coordination of the pieces is the key to the position.
 [ N c3 ]  [ c6 ] , [ d4 ]  Now I have central pressure.
 [ R f2 ] , [ R a5 ]  Back to the 4th rank guard post.
 [ B x a3 ] , [ K f2 ]  There's not much else white can do now. His disadvantage continues to grow and they're about to grow more.
 [ Q f8 + ]  [ K d5 ]  [ Q a8 + ]  [ K c5 ] , [ B g1 ]  Still unable to find a clear winning line White draws his bishop back out of trouble. Perfectly safe: he is still pretty much winning. But if he had been prepared to give up something he might have been able to find quicker tactical roads to the win. For instance he could have given up the bishop here: 69.Qxe4! [ d x e3 ] 70.[ Q x e3 + ] ... 71.[ Q x d3 ] and obtained a simple win.
 [ Q x b3 ]  [ B c5 + ]  [ d4 ]  [ e x d4 ] , [ N x h8 ]  I'm behind a rook and with no opportunity to make material equal I would normally give up but my bishops-queen force looks dangerous enough to play on for a while.
 [ d x c5 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ N e3 ]  [ Q x d1 + ]  [ N x d1 ]  [ B x c5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B b6 ]  [ B d2 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ O-O-O ] , [ N g4 ]  A bold sortie by me! There is no possible defence for my opponent!
 [ N x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ B x d5 ]  [ Q x d5 ] , [ B x c7 ]  Pawn!! What counterplay can I get now?
 [ e4 ] , [ c5 ]  This started as a Sicilian. White to play.
 [ N g4 ] , [ N f2 ]  Just trade happy I guess - again no gain for me.
 [ O-O ]  [ B e3 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N f5 ]  [ B x f5 ]  [ e x f5 ] , [ Q d7 ]  hard to follow: Black had several better moves...
 [ N x d2 ] , [ R x g2 + ]  As you can see it worked
 [ R b1 ]  [ R c1 ] , [ c4 ]  so black gets his piece back.
 [ B x c3 ] , [ Q f4 ]  Here I was sensing a bit of danger towards my king. I needed to make a good move here to prevent my f and h pawns from being forked with 22... [ N g4 ]  [ Q f3 ]  [ Q x f3 ] , [ g x f3 ]  I doubled my pawns on purpose maybe this wasn't the right move but I wanted to keep my knight on it's active square on e5.
 [ Q g7 ]  [ R x h6 ]  [ R x h6 ]  [ g x h6 ] , [ Q f6 ]  As stated before if 18. ... [ Q x f6 ] 19. [ N x f5 ] wins the queen. Guess he realized it at the last moment.
 [ K x f8 ] , [ Q f5 + ]  ! Excellent move avoiding a nasty threat. After 21.Rxe2?? Bxh2ch would have been winning for Black.
 [ N x d6 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ N f5 ]  [ Q f6 ]  [ f3 ]  [ R a c8 ]  [ Q b3 ] , [ b6 ]  Black is down now.. giving away another pawn
 [ N x c8 ]  [ K x c8 ]  [ R b8 + ]  [ K d7 ] , [ R f b1 ]  he now has no escape but [ R e1 ] check which he doesnt see
 [ e5 ]  [ N d7 ] , [ Q f2 ]  Otherwise the isolated knight is able to come back into the game extremely effectively after Nb3-c5! Now Black has to take his opponent's threats more seriously - the white knight is heading for [ f5 ] and [ d6 ] and the advancing f-pawn could be a battering ram that will crack open the black castle. But Capablanca cannot be frightened by these shadows on the horizon. The stubborn proponent of economy was famous for an astonishing ability to defend his king with a minimum of resources while his main army was gaining advantage elsewhere.
 [ B h3 ]  [ R e1 ] , [ Q f5 ]  To protect black's e-pawn
 [ K c2 ]  [ b5 ]  [ N a3 ]  [ b4 ]  [ c x b4 ]  [ N x b4 + ]  [ K b3 ] , [ c5 ]  Entrenching my knight...
 [ K e7 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ O-O-O ]  preparing to move rook in line with black king
 [ R h1 + ] , [ K g2 ]  If now 47. ... [ R x h7 ] white wins the rook with 48. [ Q a7 + ] K-any 49. Qxh7.
 [ R x a2 ] , [ R d7 ]  I need immediate threats for counter-play.
 [ Q b3 ] , [ b6 ]  [ N b d7 ] looks interesting to trap (but not capture) white queen e.g. 7...[ N b d7 ] 8 [ Q x b7 ] [ N b6 ] it fails to 9 [ a4 ] ... 10 [ a5 ] though
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ f3 ]  [ O-O ] , [ B c4 ]  This variation is the Sicilian Dragon Yugoslav attack one of the most popular variations of the Sicilian Dragon so as the Classic variation (6.Be2) Levenfish attack (6.f4) and 6.f3...
 [ B e3 ]  [ R g2 ]  [ b4 ] , [ R e2 ]  43. [ R e2 ] - thought I would annoy the black bishop before trading queenside pawns.
 [ f4 ]  [ e x f4 ] , [ B c4 ]  More common is 3.[ N f3 ] as that's the mainline. But similar to what Ken emphasized Joe will deviate from the mainlines in part to make his opponent feel that he has gotten advantage. It often leads to letting your guard down and making mistakes that would cost you the game as it did here.
 [ d5 ]  [ Q a5 + ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N x c3 ]  [ b x c3 ]  [ N e5 ] , [ O-O ]  As far as I could tell book/database lines stop around here.
 [ N e2 ] , [ Q d2 ]  Nearly finished! White can do nothing to escape his impending doom! :)
 [ Q e2 ] , [ Q h7 ]  Now queen moved along to [ h7 ] in order to support rook in attack.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ e x d4 ] , [ B c4 ]  Going into the Scotch Gambit. This is my first time playing this opening. Haven't really had much preparation with it as you can tell shortly.
 [ K e6 ] , [ N g6 ]  He didn't fall into the obvious trap of moving his king to [ f8 ] but I still needed to move my knight and this is the best move I could think of as it still puts him on the defensive.
 [ B b3 ] , [ N a5 ]  There's no way getting offa this train we're on now.
 [ g x f5 ]  [ N d x f5 ]  [ Q c1 ] , [ K h8 ]  sidesteping any pins on the g-file.
 [ N e5 ]  [ N b d7 ] , [ N x d7 ]  I think this exchange helps Black. [ e5 ] is a strong square for White's Knight.
 [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ] , [ e6 ]  ...not to pushed into given open names and theory but white now typically decides between [ N c3 ] or Nf3..I've seen some recent games of Kramnik and liked the Catalan set up...so was thinking to head for this.
 [ a5 ]  [ K g2 ]  [ b4 ] , [ R h1 ]  Threat is [ B e8 ] followed by Rh8. [ R d c7 ] leads to mate after [ B h7 ] so
 [ e5 ] , [ N b5 ]  An excellent move! If only I had seen it the previous move! This wins a pawn and isolates the e-pawn - had I played 36...Nb5! I suspect that I would have at least drawn. Unfortunately this was too late although it was pleasing to surprise both my opponent and an observer who had moved away thinking that was the knight "trapped" I was lost. Of course I lost anyway.
 [ Q h5 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ R f1 ] , [ Q e7 ]  Really bad. At least looses the Queen.
 [ d3 ] , [ N f6 ]  bringing out the knights
 [ N f6 ]  [ Q f3 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ b4 ] , [ B b6 ]  5. ...... [ B b6 ] - the first sign of passivitis Fou Lenoir is driven from c5. I am however ready to castle and I do so next move.
 [ N h4 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ N x g6 ]  [ B x g2 ]  [ K x g2 ]  [ Q c6 + ] , [ K h3 ]  the King is safe here
 [ c4 ] , [ R a e8 ]  Now I double up on the e-file...
 [ N f3 ]  [ Q e6 ]  [ N x d5 ] , [ Q x e4 + ]  Forced...
 [ N a4 ]  [ R b7 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ N c5 ]  [ R b6 ]  [ N x e6 ] , [ R x e6 ]  At this point I'm quite happy level on material and with (imho) slightly better development.
 [ R c4 ] , [ c3 ]  Attempting to make more difficult to take b5. Of course Rh1-[ b1 ] would have been answered with the a pawn's advance and was also good for black.
 [ B d2 ] , [ e4 ]  Now I fork the queen and a pawn...
 [ Q x f4 ] , [ Q f7 # ]  Simple ending. Comments welcome!
 [ Q x d2 ]  [ O-O ]  [ a3 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ N f4 ]  [ d6 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ B b7 ] , [ O-O ]  White had more central control and better development for the two bishops. Chances are even.
 [ g4 ] , [ c5 ]  A nice move hacking away at whites center and opening up the bishop line to make it more effective which lends some concern to white for the [ [ f3 ] ] knight. This move guarantees white a positionally isolated e pawn while a knight resides at [ [ f3 ] ] after (14...cxd4)
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ g6 ] , [ N e2 ]  already I was raising my eyebrows: what was he building in there?
 [ d x e4 ]  [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ e6 ]  Opening a line for one bishop and closing a line for another.
 [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ B e2 ]  Pins and needles everywhere! It is wise the King(s) seek shelter before the pending melee.
 [ R h5 + ]  [ K d6 ]  [ R h6 + ]  [ K e5 ]  [ R h5 + ] , [ K d6 ]  Down a Pawn Keres tries to lure Fischer into drawing by threefold repetition.
 [ N d2 ]  [ e6 ] , [ N f4 ]  Trying to get his knight off the wall.
 [ Q x e6 ]  [ Q x c5 ]  [ Q g4 + ]  [ K f1 ]  [ B x h5 ] , [ R a2 ]  Annoying. Covers his second rank. However this leaves his rooks unguarded and I can potentially use this to my advantage.
 [ B x f3 ]  [ B x f3 ]  [ Q x f3 ] , [ Q x c7 ]  -2 : (
 [ N f6 ] , [ O-O ]  I'm not sure what to do here does anyone have a possible plan?
 [ e3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ h6 ]  [ B h4 ]  [ a6 ]  [ a3 ]  [ e5 ] , [ d x e5 ]  White's goal is to open the D file and play along that but also to expand on the queenside.
 [ K x g4 ]  [ R x f1 ]  [ K h3 ]  [ R f x c1 ]  [ R x c1 ]  [ N x c1 ]  [ b4 ]  [ B g1 ]  [ K g4 ]  [ R x h2 ]  [ K f5 ]  [ B d4 ]  [ K e6 ] , [ N x d3 ]  
 [ N e7 + ]  [ K g7 ]  [ f3 ] , [ R e6 ]  my knight is lost here... with this move plus Black's queenside pawns (which could easily be advanced to a pawn promotion) I resign.
 [ d4 ] , [ c5 ]  Sean C likes queens opening whilst normally a [ d5 ] or n[ f6 ] man thought i'd have a bash at [ c5 ]  [ e3 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ e x d4 ] , [ d5 ]  We have managed to get to the Caro-Kann/Exchange variation
 [ Q c7 ] , [ d5 ]  Not sound. This frees [ c5 ] for Black's knight.
 [ g3 ] , [ B e4 ]  Even more accurate was Bg6-[ B h5 ] but I feared white could have found something in the midwhile.
 [ g3 ] , [ Q h5 ]  attacks the rook
 [ N d4 ] , [ R d2 ]  ? If the previous move was non-fatal this one surely is. The only way I can see to hold was to give up the Rook with 32.[ Q h7 ] [ N x c2 ] 33.[ Q x c2 ] and my kingside pawns may give me enough counterplay to stay in the game. The text refusing to give up my material edge loses by force.
 [ N c4 ]  [ a4 ]  [ R d g8 ]  [ N h5 ]  [ R g6 ] , [ N g3 ]  Hesitate playing Be5. It would have prevent the Bishop on [ h2 ] to be blocked.
 [ B x b2 ] , [ R f d8 ]  
 [ Q x d4 ]  [ B e5 ] , [ Q e4 ]  Sets a trap if White tries Qg5.
 [ R e8 ]  [ K f2 ] , [ R e4 ]  It was going to be hard to defend the [ c4 ] pawn after Black gained control of the e-file. Obviously contesting that control is important to White's survival. At this point it is too late and White needs to conjure up a dynamic reply.
 [ a5 ]  [ B b6 ]  [ Q g5 ]  [ B x a5 ]  [ R c5 ] , [ B c3 ]  20. [ B c3 ] - black makes a further error on move 17 by playing his pawn up to [ a5 ] - this allowed me to win this pawn by a bishop fork on b6. Black could have the beginnings of a mating attack on my kingside position so I cannot afford to be complacent here.
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ c4 ] , [ e5 ]  1.[ d4 ] [ d5 ] 2.[ c4 ] [ e5 ] Black declines the Queen's Gambit and offer's the Albin Counter-Gambit with d4.
 [ K e1 ]  [ K h7 ]  [ K f1 ]  [ K g6 ]  [ K g1 ] , [ K f5 ]  The black king wants to be there for the finale.
 [ f3 ] , [ B f5 ]  His bishop is pinned so he can't take my bishop.
 [ R e1 ]  [ R e2 x e1 + ] , [ N x e1 ]  He makes my game a lot simpler
 [ N x g3 ]  [ h x g3 ] , [ N c6 ]  Defends his [ e5 ] pawn and attacks the [ d4 ] pawn.
 [ R a5 ] , [ R d1 ]  31. [ R d1 ] - Jo The Beginner (my OTB rating is 1200!) has a tendency to suffer greatly from the afliction passivitis. Here she tries to erase that word right out of her vocabulary with more counter-attack! This gets my KR right into the fray. Notice the weak [ d5 ] pawn behind the [ d3 ] knight?!
 [ B x b2 ]  [ R x b2 ] , [ N x c5 ]  Here white resigned. If I had been playing white I think I would have played 44. [ e x d6 ] [ B x d6 ] and then white might be able to work a draw but with good play from black black should still get a win. Thanks for reading and I appreciate all comments!
 [ c5 ] , [ c3 ]  Solidifying the structure and preventing any future problems from ...Nb4. If Black tries ...[ c x d4 ] White replies [ e x d4 ] and opens up the centre for his dark-squared bishop.
 [ B e2 ]  [ c6 ]  [ Q c2 ] , [ h6 ]  8. ..... [ h6 ] - putting the question to white's dsb.
 [ K d7 ] , [ R b2 ]  (!!) a truly exccelent move which deflects Ammira's queen from [ Q e6 ] mate amd threataning [ B b5 ] mate. Back is lost
 [ R x c7 ]  [ Q x c7 + ]  [ K g6 ] , [ f x e4 ]  With the fall of the Knight Black could easily resign here. However he plays it out to the end.
 [ g4 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ h5 ] , [ R c7 ]  Threatens to win the Queen with 41. [ R c8 ]  [ e4 ] , [ e6 ]  Ah this was my fourth game with White but he wasthe first opponent who didn't choose the Sicilian.
 [ N x f8 ]  [ Q x f8 ] , [ f3 ]  Whew! Better to control the knight the rest is routine.
 [ f5 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ Q h3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ R g1 ]  [ K h8 ]  [ g5 ] , [ R g8 ]  I saw a chance of an exchange sac here I don't know if my opponent did. 16. [ g x f6 ] [ R x g1 ] 17. [ f x e7 ] Qxe718. [ N c e2 ] [ R g8 ] 19. [ f x e6 ] [ f x e6 ] 20. Nf4[ B b7 ] 21. N[ d x e6 ] [ B x e4 ] its not very good but it was an idea
 [ e5 ]  [ a3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ B b2 ]  [ d4 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ h3 ]  [ a6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ b6 ]  [ d3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N b d2 ]  [ O-O ]  [ e3 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ c5 ]  [ b5 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ e4 ]  [ B g6 ]  [ N h4 ]  [ N b d7 ]  [ N x g6 ]  [ f x g6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ Q e7 ]  [ a4 ]  [ a x b5 ]  [ c x b5 ]  [ B c7 ]  [ N c4 ]  [ R a7 ]  [ Q b3 ]  [ K h8 ]  [ B c1 ]  [ R e a8 ]  [ f4 ]  [ R f8 ]  [ f x e5 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ Q x e5 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ Q e7 ]  [ B x c7 ]  [ Q x c7 ]  [ R f3 ]  [ R a a8 ]  [ Q c2 ]  [ Q d7 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ R x f8 + ]  [ R x f8 ]  [ B g4 ] , [ N e3 ]  That move I played was very bad. If he took the Queen it was a forces endgame for white
 [ Q d7 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ Q f5 ]  [ N x f6 + ]  [ Q x f6 ] , [ B x d4 ]  This is what i ment. The bisschop cant move and is having problems now.
 [ B b7 ] , [ N e4 ]  It is time to send the queen home
 [ B e8 ]  [ R x d8 + ]  [ Q x d8 ] , [ R d1 ]  Owning the open d-file.
 [ c x d4 ] , [ B b4 ]  Moves out of the way of the d-pawn finally with tempo.
 [ N h2 ]  [ f5 ]  [ f3 ] , [ f4 ]  23. ....... [ f4 ] - blocks off white's dsb.
 [ Q c7 ] , [ N e6 ]  Finally.
 [ f x g4 ]  [ h x g4 ] , [ N c6 ]  now the g-file will stay closed but the black play is more and more limited.... He has only his knight to play with.
 [ e4 ] , [ b6 ]  Joe: I like this since it's something different. Without knowing the best response I'm thinking of 2.[ [ [ d4 ] ] ] only because they say that after 1.[ e4 ] if black only advances a pawn one square it's generally best to play 2.[ [ [ d4 ] ] ] A perfect example would be in the Caro Kann where 1...[ c7 ] is played and white answers with that move. Ken: 2.[ [ [ d4 ] ] ] is the most common move here and quire playable
 [ N c4 ]  [ B b8 ] , [ b3 ]  A strong move bringing the Bishop out to attack along the diagonal.
 [ f6 ] , [ B g3 ]  go back home...
 [ N x e5 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ a3 ]  I wanted to eventually go for a [ [ b4 ] ] pawn push. This also protects [ [ b4 ] ] from a knight outpost.
 [ b x c5 ]  [ b5 ] , [ a4 ]  Mistake: the line given here is: 19. [ [ a4 ] ] bx[ [ a4 ] ] 20. [ N a5 ] [ N g6 ] 21. [ N [ c4 ] ] [ B c6 ] 22. [ N d6 ] [ R c7 ] 23. [ R a3 ] [ R d8 ] 24. [ R b1 ] [ N e5 ] 25. [ B d4 ] [ R e7 ] or: 19. [ [ a4 ] ] bx[ [ a4 ] ] 20. [ N a5 ] [ N g6 ] 21. [ R e b1 ] [ B b5 ] 22. [ c4 ] [ B c6 ] 23. [ N x c6 + ] [ R x c6 ] 24. Rx[ [ a4 ] ] [ R d8 ] 25. [ f4 ] [ K a8 ] 26. [ K f2 ] [ R c7 ] 27. [ R a2 ] [ R c d7 ] What I should have done is already described after black's 17th move.
 [ N d6 ]  [ f6 ]  [ K e2 ] , [ B d7 ]  Here I had a dilemna between the moves 24.[ b4 ] and 24.Ke3. If you do a calculation of these certainly you may be leaning towards the move 24.b4. However it would be close and the right idea would be hard. According to the strategy of chess we should just do the piece move. Unfortunately I fell into the trap of caring about less important ideas- like my pawn majority and not allowing ...c5. As you see even one single move in which you think too much about useless things can hurt your decisions. Fortunately for me the move was enough to keep my big advantage at that level and I don't make mistakes of this nature too much. I was not really in a time trouble here at all.
 [ B c5 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ B x f8 ]  [ K x f8 ] , [ R a b1 ]  Just following principle.
 [ Q e8 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N c6 ]  [ Q a4 ]  [ h6 ]  [ N c5 ] , [ a5 ]  cramping an eventual ...[ b4 ] advance.
 [ K f8 ]  [ R a7 ]  [ R b5 ]  [ R a8 + ]  [ K g7 ] , [ R e8 ]  [An interesting try was 42.Ra6!? hoping for 42…[ R x g5 ] (However black can just play 42…Rc5! followed by [ N c6 ] etc.) 43.[ h6 + ] [ K h8 ] and then (43…Kf8?? 44.Ra8+) 44.[ K c2 ] and white will eventually win the a-pawn with good drawing chances.]
 [ N x c4 ] , [ N x c4 ]  One knight down one more to go ...
 [ K h2 ] , [ R g2 + ]  Winning as 58.[ K h1 ] is met by 58...Rg7+.
 [ B b3 ]  [ R b2 ] , [ B e6 ]  !! White's pieces appear poised for a counter attack.
 [ N c3 ] , [ N f6 ]  The [ e4 ] pawn is attacked twice and defended twice and after ...dx[ e4 ] dx[ e4 ] Nx[ e4 ] Nx[ e4 ] and white would win. So [ N f6 ] might not have been the best move to play.
 [ R x h7 ]  [ B x h7 ] , [ R h8 ]  Now look at this. If I move my bishop its [ R h1 ] mate.
 [ h5 ] , [ a5 ]  Now I see it: White wants to launch the pawn storm on the Q-side but there is not much he can do there.
 [ Q b1 + ] , [ K d2 ]  this must be the best options....cause a computer miss nothing!
 [ B f4 ] , [ f6 ]  !? I decided to play this move rather than [ Q f6 ] because I wanted to keep pressure on e4.
 [ e4 ]  [ B b4 ]  [ d3 ]  [ c x d3 ]  [ e x d3 ]  [ B d2 ] , [ N d4 ]  new issues...
 [ N f6 ]  [ B b2 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N c3 ]  [ a6 ] , [ R e1 ]  [ a4 ] first. avoid black next move.
 [ N c3 ] , [ Q d7 ]  Not [ Q c7 ] because of Nb5. But a bishop sac on [ h3 ] is worth considering.
 [ e x f3 ]  [ e ] , [ p ]  A Castle cracker!
 [ B b2 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d5 ] , [ e3 ]  At this point White accepts a position which is nearly a reversed Dutch putting him somewhat behind.
 [ N f7 ]  [ a4 ]  [ N g8 ] , [ B f1 ]  I thought to give my Bishop some movement on the Queen side.
 [ K x c1 ]  [ K f4 ]  [ K d1 ]  [ g5 ]  [ K e1 ]  [ K f3 ]  [ K f1 ]  [ g4 ]  [ K g1 ]  [ g3 ]  [ K f1 ]  [ g2 + ]  [ K g1 ]  [ f5 ]  [ K h2 ]  [ K f2 ]  [ K h3 ]  [ g1 = Q ]  [ K h4 ] , [ Q g4 # ]  
 [ a6 ] , [ B e2 ]  4. [ B e2 ] - an unusual retreat normal is Ba4.
 [ R h5 ] , [ R f h1 ]  I made this move so that I could force an exchange with her with [ R x h7 ] but this does not happen.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ] , [ N c3 ]  Basic Rule: Getting my Knights out before my bishops
 [ B c2 ]  [ R c8 ] , [ N g f3 ]  plan to go to [ e5 ] and attack the light Bishop
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ f6 ]  The Damiano defense is always going to be an EPIC FAIL.
 [ B e3 ]  [ b6 ] , [ Q b3 ]  And now the natural [ B b7 ] is met by Bxc5! winning a pawn so I had to come up with something else.
 [ Q x f6 ] , [ N x f6 ]  
 [ d4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ e3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N d2 ]  [ c5 ]  [ c3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ f4 ]  [ c4 ]  [ B c2 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ N g f3 ] , [ O-O ]  Here the position of the Stone Wall Project has been reached only this time Black has his bishop on [ d6 ] rather than e7.
 [ R e8 ] , [ Q g5 ]  Backing up that Bishop and also prepping for a mate.
 [ B b2 ] , [ N f6 ]  In case black tries to gain the [ b4 ] pawn he will be facing problems unless knowing the opening which as Is aid is not my case. But maybe d6-[ e5 ] was the wise defence here. At any rate that can still be achieved after 2.Nf6.
 [ h5 ]  [ K e3 ]  [ K g2 ]  [ K f4 ] , [ h4 ]  Black will get a new Queen so White resigned. *THAT* was a fun game boys and girls!
 [ g4 ] , [ d5 ]  Maybe 4. ... [ g5 ] would have been safer to keep white from chasing away my knight at f6. But I figured if I could dominate the center white's bishop won't be able to support his queen's attack on my [ f7 ] pawn.
 [ a4 ] , [ e5 ]  Shall I forget my rook? I could take [ e5 ] but would lose a8... Bad idea of course.
 [ N b d7 ]  [ B d3 ] , [ h6 ]  [ c5 ] sounds weaker.
 [ K g8 ]  [ Q x e6 + ]  [ K f8 ]  [ Q c8 + ] , [ Q d8 ]  this was an honest mistake on his part and it ate up 30 seconds on my clock trying to figure out his devious scheme. I found none so i took the queen.
 [ R c6 ]  [ R e d1 ]  [ R x d1 + ] , [ R x d1 ]  Rooks are exchanged.
 [ R b7 + ]  [ K e8 ]  [ K f6 ] , [ B c8 ]  38. ...... [ B c8 ] - this move does not cut the mustard as although it prevents a [ R b8 + ] skewer it does not prevent a [ R e7 + ] followed by either mate or loss of Fou Leblanc for starters by the Windmill. I chose the more painless option .......
 [ B f8 + ] , [ K h5 ]  forced.
 [ B x d6 + ]  [ K d8 ] , [ B c5 + ]  And then I can pull a nasty trick like that on my unfortunate opponent.
 [ R x c1 ]  [ B x d2 ]  [ R c5 ]  [ a6 ]  [ g4 ] , [ R c8 ]  I resigned in this position because he is going to win with extra piece and pawn. Well played Vullivux.
 [ R x f8 + ]  [ N x f8 ] , [ Q f3 ]  18. Qf3?! - I think now would have been the time for Bg3. I could not resist ganging up on that [ b7 ] pawn.
 [ N f6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B e7 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ b5 ]  [ B b3 ] , [ O-O ]  Castling instead of the customary P-[ Q3 ] enables the Marshall attack if White plays 8 P-B3. Black sacrifices a Pawn with 8... P-[ Q4 ] 9 PxP NxP 10 NxP NxN 11 RxN P-B3. When I played O-O I was really only bluffing and had made up my mind to play the Tarrasch defense should Emanuel Lasker call my bluff with 8 P-B3.
 [ O-O ]  [ O-O ] , [ N a4 ]  Targeting the pawn. Either way that pawn cannot be protected since both are doubled. This is significant because in the course with Susan she explained that doubled pawns become a problem in a situation like this. That is where they're doubled and you can't undouble as it later allows an attack which would be unavoidable. After that one of those pawns is gone and you're left with problems which is happening here.
 [ B g5 ] , [ e6 ]  5. [ B g5 ] is out of my book. I decide to preserve my pawn structure with [ e6 ] although Toga proposes Nc6. I like [ B g5 ] as it gives the possibility to exchange a bad bishop for an active knight and mess with the black pawn structure.
 [ N b d2 ]  [ Q x b2 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ B g4 ] , [ O-O ]  Now WT is completely ready to play. Whereas BL is behind in development & has used more time on the [ Q x b2 ] pawn grab. With WT's lead in development overall and his regional superiority of mobile pieces aimed at the center & K-side he is ready to sac vs any opportunity. And will certainly do so if it will put the BL king on the run vs the fully mobilized WT army.
 [ K g7 ] , [ K f4 ]  The king is now quite active and the open g-file could give some nice attacking ideas as well.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ N b d7 ]  [ O-O ] , [ O-O ]  Now lets finally talk black has his bishop blockaded by his knight.
 [ e6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ c5 ] , [ d3 ]  So far White develops almost without regard to anything Black's doing.
 [ Q x b5 ] , [ Q c7 # ]  And gameover. I hope you enjoyed watching this game. I can tell you I certainly enjoyed playing it.
 [ B x f8 ]  [ R e x f8 ] , [ Q h6 ]  Black's doomed. [ N h5 ] is coming. If ... [ g x h5 ] then [ Q x h7 ] mate.
 [ N e1 ]  [ b6 ]  [ B h3 ]  [ R d d8 ]  [ B f1 ]  [ R a b8 ]  [ N c2 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ B d2 ]  [ K f7 ]  [ B e1 ]  [ g5 ]  [ R b c1 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ B h3 ] , [ h5 ]  Here I noticed I could force [ R d1 ] out but I couldn't get more than swapping black bishops. Whenever I played this out I'd drop a pawn. I feel like I should be able to promote one of the right side pawns but I never got anywhere--too easy for white to foil any advance it seemed.
 [ B f4 ] , [ g5 ]  I am still trying to shoe his bishop away but he pointed out the same thing about pushing pawns.
 [ f5 ] , [ B e6 ]  BxB NxB is a fork of Queen and Rook
 [ K e7 ] , [ B f7 ]  the bishop and pawn protect each other with the knight giving additional defence to the bishop
 [ N d3 + ] , [ K e2 ]  This series of moves has served me well in previous games. Now hoping the knight for bishop exchange will prove too tempting as black may feel that exchanges are good for his material advantage.
 [ B x c6 ]  [ d x c6 ] , [ h3 ]  Stopping the pin
 [ B d7 ]  [ f4 ] , [ N h5 ]  Gives white a free move
 [ g x h5 ]  [ B x h5 ] , [ B h6 ]  I'm desperate here and this just ends up keeping my B and R both occupied for no good reason. He's got me boxed out from getting my Q to g7.
 [ Q b2 ] , [ R f g1 ]  Threatening with 22.Qxh6.
 [ a x b5 ]  [ B x b5 ] , [ R e1 + ]  Now my second rook can jump to the 7th rank and from there it'll be easy
 [ R d e1 ]  [ K f4 ]  [ R e3 e4 + ]  [ K f5 ] , [ R e4 x e5 + ]  not much left for black's fight
 [ B h5 ]  [ B c6 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ Q e8 ]  [ N h5 ]  [ Q e7 ]  [ b3 ]  [ B e8 ]  [ N g3 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ R f2 ]  [ R f g8 ]  [ B h5 ]  [ g5 ]  [ f x g6 ]  [ e ]  [ p ]  [ h x g6 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ K g7 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ R g h8 ] , [ R a f1 ]  A little threat! Doubling the Rooks on the f-file.
 [ B b4 + ]  [ N c3 ] , [ N f6 ]  a couple of good developing moves from black
 [ e6 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ] , [ Q b3 ]  Threatening the knight pawn
 [ Q x f1 + ] , [ R x f1 ]  Black removes one of White's Rooks.
 [ e5 ] , [ e3 ]  (obviously defending [ d4 ] with [ N f3 ] is less effective as it allows e4! forcing the knight back to d2. - leaving a few problems to follow on the queenside)
 [ N x e3 ]  [ Q x e3 ] , [ Q b6 ]  ! this was the initial idea behind 11.[ B x b5 ] (bad idea)
 [ B d5 ] , [ B a3 ]  "The best defense is 26.[ R f1 ] but Black should be winning after [ R g1 ] "
 [ N x b4 ]  [ Q b3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ Q x b7 ]  A blunder? I think yes.
 [ N d4 ]  [ R f e8 ]  [ N b3 ]  [ K h8 ]  [ N c5 ] , [ R e7 ]  Black has placed all his major pieces on black squares so that they cannot be attacked by White's bishop.
 [ B d7 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ N x d7 ]  [ N x d7 ]  [ b3 ]  [ a6 ] , [ B b2 ]  Continuing the dark square theme.
 [ R a e1 ]  [ g6 ]  [ K g2 ]  [ g5 ] , [ f5 ]  25. [ f5 ] - euge! Just what I would lurve there is bound to be some exchanges on the e column after this move!
 [ e x d5 ] , [ c x d5 ]  Creates a gap in his left side and also locks in his knight.
 [ Q c5 ] , [ N g3 ]  gaining terrain on the king side
 [ N f2 ]  [ c5 ]  [ g3 ]  [ h5 ] , [ N d1 ]  Here if my calculations are right I will get a free pawn somewhere or a king's passport to [ f4 ] and to the white pawns.
 [ N e5 ] , [ N g5 ]  aiming to control [ [ f4 ] ] so that way I have created a barrier [ [ f4 ] ] [ g4 ] h4. I call this "Major Simulation" when minor pieces create a solid barrier that resembles squares controlled by a major piece.
 [ c x d6 ]  [ e ]  [ p ]  [ + ]  [ c x d6 ]  [ f4 ]  [ R b c8 ] , [ f5 ]  maybe? it was better to play .22. Rac1-Na5.23.Nc3-[ N c4 ] and blacks chances are in favor to win .
 [ B g5 ]  [ h4 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ R a2 ]  [ Q g6 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ Q d6 ] , [ N g2 ]  The knight cannot move from here except back to [ e1 ] though at least [ R f1 ] is released.
 [ B g7 ] , [ N c3 ]  I did this to see how badly he wanted to control that h8-[ a1 ] file. I delay moving the d pawn just to see what his intentions are in the middle because of how he opened. Perhaps this is a bit too passive as white but I want an indication of whether black really intends to fight for the middle from afar or if he has another plan altogether. Remember I am not thinking I am going to win this game; his rating is by far the highest I've ever played against. As such I have no clue as to what he could possibly be thinking and I want a clue. Badly. ;)
 [ K f4 ]  [ B h4 ]  [ g5 ]  [ B e1 ]  [ K g4 ]  [ B d2 ]  [ h4 ]  [ B c3 ]  [ h5 ]  [ g x h5 + ] , [ K x h5 ]  One pair of pawns is gone.
 [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ f3 ]  My opposant does not want to play 5. [ N c3 ] because he plans 6. c4. This came as a surprise for me and I was immediately out of the book.
 [ Q f2 + ] , [ K b3 ]  wonder if k[ d1 ] was better. forces a queen exchange but prolongs the checkmate. i much prefered this king [ b3 ] though it allows for the most satisfying checkmates
 [ Q x e6 + ]  [ K b8 ]  [ b x c5 ] , [ Q x c5 ]  A piece is lost. Nevertheless black has some compensation and now it is his turn to attack.
 [ R c1 ] , [ R c5 ]  Blocks off my Queenside pawn advance now I need to get the Kingside rolling
 [ N c3 ] , [ N g e7 ]  This N can't develop to f6... too bad it was on his way to [ e7 ] anyway.
 [ c x d4 ] , [ N d5 ]  Trying to minimize Tom bring the N down now. As noted this was more effective earlier. And with that being said this move helps because I would've grabbed something first but I'll first exchange N's to turn it into liquidation.
 [ Q b7 ] , [ R b8 ]  It may be that black is almost too focussed on attacking white's Queen to notice that White has a strategy of his own...
 [ c6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ N d7 ] , [ c3 ]  Nothing special.
 [ B x d7 + ] , [ Q x d7 ]  Well this worked out OK black has regained ground with developing and even has a weak attack on the white rook on a4.
 [ d5 ]  [ B g2 ] , [ N f6 ]  This move seems natural as I wish to avoid ...e6.
 [ f4 ] , [ g x f4 ]  Another oversight by white. His bishop on [ b5 ] is weak and unsupported and easily attacked. At the moment my knight on [ e4 ] was en prise and I didn't want to trade pieces when I can win one. Fortunately this pawn capture threatens white's queen buying time for my next move. White must play 13. [ Q d2 ] here to save his bishop. 13. f4? deserves a single ? for losing a pawn.
 [ N x d5 ]  [ B x d5 ]  [ B b7 ] , [ Q f3 ]  Rather than exchange bishops on the [ d7 ] square I wanted to maintain development and move toward castling but at this stage not sure which side. I was a bit concerned about the Queenside pawns so will probably castle king side.
 [ O-O ]  [ N c3 ] , [ a6 ]  bizarre move beats me
 [ e4 ] , [ R a e8 ]  Threatening f5.
 [ Q a7 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ d5 ] , [ Q d3 ]  24. [ Q d3 ] - Glenda moves but I think that over the next 4 moves I had the opportunity to put a rook on [ c1 ] to neutralise the power of Freddy's rook on the c column. I could have then moved Henry to [ h2 ] and then used my other rook to try and help Glenda attack the enemy king. But silly me did not do this and I paid the price. Do you the jury agree?
 [ O-O ] , [ d5 ]  Trying to disrupt black cramped position and expanding white's space advantage in the center.
 [ e3 ]  [ e6 ] , [ a3 ]  Aimed at preventing [ B b4 + ] and the possible pins he could put on my pieces.
 [ N x e4 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ Q h5 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ b3 ] , [ N f6 ]  At this position it's not a bad thing to change pieces.
 [ Q f2 + ] , [ N e2 ]  The text move is better than [13.Qe2?] losing knight and possibly bishop.
 [ K d2 ] , [ b3 ]  53. ..... [ b3 ] - my b pawn supports my c pawn. My e pawn is gonna drop but Henry has a plan to take refuge on [ b2 ] and I also plan to plonk my rook on a1. When that happens white cannot stop my pawn from reaching [ c1 ] and inflicting eventual Glendadoom on his king.
 [ R c1 ] , [ R d7 ]  defending my second rank to give my Q time to harrass his.
 [ g4 ]  [ f x g4 ]  [ N x g4 ]  [ K h7 ] , [ f3 ]  Im not sure why he made this move.
 [ B b6 ]  [ R d6 ] , [ B c5 ]  With the white bishop in [ g5 ] I had [ B c7 ] here... but not now.
 [ N x d4 ]  [ e x d4 ] , [ O-O ]  White is well ahead in development already so the soundness of 5...[ N d4 ] must be in question.
 [ Q x d5 ]  [ B e2 ] , [ Q x c5 ]  15. ...... [ Q x c5 ] - as predicted my queenside pawns duly drop off.
 [ N b4 ]  [ a3 ] , [ N a6 ]  Now it is White's move again and the d4-square has been freed by the earlier pawn maneuvre which gives an excellent opportunity to centralize the white Queen while also threatening one of Black's pieces at the same time.
 [ N x e2 ]  [ d x e2 ]  [ R f e1 ] , [ B d4 ]  Off of [ d4 ] onto d4. Black's pieces get in each other's way but each move had its reasons. This one is the first step on the way to 45. ... Bc3! to win the exchange. 44. ... Ba5? would fail to 45. b4.
 [ K f7 ]  [ Q f3 + ]  [ K g7 ]  [ e6 ] , [ R g8 ]  Drops the queen
 [ e x d5 ] , [ B x b5 ]  forced: among other moves [ N a7 ] would have been very bad for Black...
 [ N e6 ]  [ B x h6 ]  [ Q d8 ]  [ Q f3 ]  [ g x h6 ] , [ Q f5 ]  keep the pressure!!!
 [ K g8 ]  [ N d2 ]  [ B g6 ] , [ N b3 ]  30. [ N b3 ] - I hit on plan B!
 [ N d4 ] , [ K h7 ]  
 [ N x d5 ]  [ c x d5 ] , [ N e7 ]  Force Black into a bit of retreat while I continue my develop
 [ N f7 ]  [ Q c2 ] , [ B d8 ]  ...normally the black bishop is looking to get to [ c7 ] for the long diagonal...but he cant play [ c6 ] for the moment...
 [ Q x e8 ]  [ R x e8 ] , [ K d6 ]  Trying to get to the centre of the board where it is harder to checkmate.
 [ R f8 ] , [ B d4 ]  ...covering an escape route for the BK.
 [ N x f6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ b6 ]  [ Q f3 ]  [ R b8 ]  [ R a d1 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ Q h3 ]  [ Q c7 ] , [ f5 ]  Up until here this seemed like a fairly even game. Even amount of material gained/lost. Positions not overly out of balance. Computer analysis even shows the "Score" as -0.00. Unfortunately my next move started the downward (spiral isn't even the right word) crash and burn. Even now looking at this position I'm not sure I would have exchanged pawns even though I do see the merit of it. Keeps the position even doesn't really give away anything.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ] , [ c3 ]  I often play the Scottish gambit but I found that against 2...[ d6 ] 3. [ [ d4 ] ] x[ [ d4 ] ] 4. [ B c4 ] is rather lackluster. I therefroe tried to prepare for [ [ d4 ] ] this time trying to create a strong centre.
 [ g6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ d6 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ B g7 ] , [ B c4 ]  White violates the principle knights before bishops
 [ R a d8 ]  [ N x f7 ]  [ R x f7 ]  [ B x f7 + ]  [ K x f7 ]  [ R c7 + ] , [ R d7 ]  the only way to prevent further damage...
 [ b x a5 ]  [ N x c5 ] , [ N e2 ]  White was a little late in developing his knight
 [ f5 ]  [ Q b2 ]  [ f4 ]  [ e x f4 ] , [ R x f4 ]  Black attacks with their supperiority but Kings has no defense
 [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ c x d4 ] , [ e x d4 ]  Black wins the exchange in material creating doubled up passed pawns on the d-file in the process. White's [ e4 ] pawn is still under threat and Black is already up in material.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ B c5 ] , [ N d5 ]  A slight mistake on white's part here looking for the knight exchange and forgetting about the [ e4 ] pawn.
 [ d5 ]  [ c4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ c5 ]  The defining feature of Tarrasch's Defence.
 [ N f3 ] , [ h5 ]  When in doubt push a pawn.
 [ e4 ] , [ e5 ]  Nothing new.
 [ R e3 ]  [ B d4 ]  [ R d3 ] , [ B x e5 ]  
 [ Q d5 ] , [ R b d8 ]  If not for 20.[ N f1 ] the White Queen would be lost for [ R d1 ] would be mate.
 [ N c6 ]  [ g4 ]  [ h6 ] , [ f5 ]  i wanted to have a back door for the knight
 [ N f1 ] , [ R f8 ]  .
 [ N c6 ] , [ N f3 ]  More fighting over the [ e5 ] square.
 [ Q b6 ] , [ e4 ]  White concluded that it was better to trade the three pawns for a piece with a strong attack on the black King.
 [ Q h6 ]  [ Q x d4 ] , [ O-O-O ]  I have an extra pawn with my Queen expecting a discovery by white at any time
 [ N f x h4 ] , [ g5 ]  Looking for some space but bad.
 [ d5 ] , [ c4 ]  Of course main line is to not capture pawn
 [ Q x d3 ]  [ B e6 ] , [ B h6 ]  Perhaps 18. [ R f b1 ] is more interesting.
 [ Q a4 + ]  [ Q d7 ]  [ Q x b4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ Q d4 ]  [ B g7 ] , [ B b5 ]  Looks dangerous but it takes a few more moves to realize the danger.
 [ f4 ]  [ Q b4 ]  [ c3 ] , [ Q a5 ]  it is difficult to read if this was an oversight by black. an alternative was 20 ... [ Q e7 ] but 21 [ g4 ] has to reckoned with by black.
 [ B g4 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B x f3 ]  [ Q x f3 ] , [ B e7 ]  ?? I am sure you were betting on ...Nd4! Forking the queen and bishop. On a side note after white moves the queen black should not be to hastie in play NxB because the Knight on D4 practical shuts white down. Under these circumstances it would be impossible for white to not crack.
 [ N f6 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ B e7 ] , [ B x f6 ]  White exchanges in order to break with e2-e4. The inherent problem with the Dutch Defense is the early weakening of the kingside with 1...f5. Now a strong kingside defender (the [ f6 ] Knight) has been eliminated making Black's kingside even weaker. The only down side for White is giving up the prized Bishop Pair.
 [ K d2 ] , [ N x f2 ]  i had anticipated his rook coming behind my knight. but felt safe leaving it there for a while and could use my queen to protect it once the rook comes.
 [ Q x h4 + ] , [ K g1 ]  Forced move
 [ e4 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B g4 ] , [ f3 ]  Here is where things get crazy.
 [ d x e4 ]  [ R b8 ]  [ N c7 ] , [ R b7 ]  I want that [ a4 ] pawn!
 [ e3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B d3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ N e4 ]  Strange move here for Black. It was better to develop the other pieces.
 [ d x c5 ]  [ O-O ] , [ a3 ]  Attempting to chase the Bishop away removing the pin
 [ a4 ]  [ c6 ] , [ a x b5 ]  My experience has been that sometimes white has to worry about [ Q a5 + ] so it is better to open the A file first.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ f4 ]  [ e x f4 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ Q h4 + ] , [ K f1 ]  Having lost the right to castle and a pawn White must now develop quickly or lose the game.
 [ B e2 ] , [ O-O-O ]  O-O ! is perhaps stronger but practically O-O-O offers good chances to black in short games.
 [ B x f8 ]  [ B x e1 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ B c3 ]  [ a3 ]  [ f6 ]  [ f4 ] , [ R c8 ]  Black claims the only open file on the board further strengthening their hold on the game. A nice play white probably should have played 22. [ R d c1 ] with the same idea but black is just a step ahead at this point.
 [ Q d2 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ N x d4 ] , [ B x d4 ]  Two more minors vanish.
 [ B x c6 ] , [ B x f6 ]  The black bishop and queen are defending the pawn at d6. If black recaptures on [ f6 ] with his bishop the pawn will fall. If not black's kingside castle is in ruins.
 [ N f6 ]  [ N g5 ] , [ B g7 ]  But what about [ N x e6 ] and doubling your pawns and getting the bishop? I wasn't too concerned - doubled pawns would work to my benefit - opening the f-file and fortifying the center.
 [ Q x c6 ]  [ b x c6 ] , [ e7 ]  The pawn charges forward and Black's knight takes a last stand to stop it from queening.
 [ Q e6 ]  [ Q f4 ] , [ g5 ]  Chasing the Queen around but opening the a1-[ h8 ] diagonal for eventual penetration by the Bishop
 [ N d7 ] , [ c4 ]  Pushing into the center with an eye toward undoubling the c-pawns with the gain of tempo by discovering an attack against the black queen by the white bishop on d2.
 [ f4 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ f x g3 ]  [ h x g3 ] , [ h4 ]  Thanks to white's play I've got my free pawn and this will be important. I'm a threat again.
 [ Q d5 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B x c7 ] , [ Q h5 ]  ?! This simply unnecessarily drops another whole pawn although it threatens ...Nd5.
 [ K d8 ]  [ K e3 ]  [ K c7 ] , [ K d2 ]  35. [ K d2 ] - both our vulnerable pawns are now protected by our kings.
 [ R a d1 ] , [ R x c4 ]  ...at a great cost of course.
 [ g4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ B g2 ]  [ c6 ]  [ g5 ]  [ e5 ]  [ d4 ]  [ e4 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B b4 ]  [ h4 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ B d2 ]  [ Q b6 ]  [ a3 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ e3 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ b4 ]  [ h6 ]  [ N h3 ] , [ f6 ]  Probably not the best move but it will be hard for white to find a good plan
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ a6 ] , [ B e3 ]  White chooses [ B e3 ] instead of Bg5.
 [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ e3 ] , [ c6 ]  This move seemed odd to me as well as it blocks the [ c6 ] square for the Knight although it does allow the Queen escape room
 [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ] , [ e5 ]  The Lowenthal Variation - described in MCO 11 as 'a kind of hyper-accelerated Boleslavski-Pelikan-pawn-push dating back to 1839!' It goes on: 'It has ... retained its feasibility.' These ...[ e5 ] counter-thrusts by Black (a feature also of the Najdorf) herald an aggressive approach to the game by Black. There is a downside however and that is the [ d5 ] and [ d6 ] squares become weak and the Black d-pawn backward. Black 'expects' that his active play will mask or offset this strategic defect.
 [ K x c5 ] , [ B e3 + ]  The opportunity to check enables White to develop his remaining queenside pieces.
 [ R h1 ]  [ d5 ]  [ h x g5 + ]  [ K x g5 ]  [ f4 + ] , [ K x f4 ]  Better would have been to ignore the pawn with [ K g4 ] and push the d-pawn more.
 [ N d7 ]  [ K c2 ]  [ b6 ]  [ R f3 ]  [ K d8 ]  [ a3 ] , [ c5 ]  This is a big concession weakening d5. Black wants to fight for space on the queenside and also to free a square for his rook after ... [ K e7 ] but the price he pays is very high.
 [ B c4 ] , [ d5 ]  This leave a backwards e-pawn but it gives black a chance to get castled.
 [ B x d3 ]  [ B x f4 ]  [ e x f4 ] , [ N f5 ]  I tried to tempt White by this move.
 [ g x f6 ] , [ b3 ]  White could take on [ a6 ] but keeping the pressure on [ e7 ] and focusing the bishop on [ f6 ] is the priority.
 [ N x d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ a6 ]  The Najdorf Variation begins
 [ N h7 ]  [ b4 ]  [ N g5 ]  [ B d5 ]  [ R b8 ]  [ R b7 ]  [ R c8 + ]  [ K b5 ]  [ R c1 ]  [ b3 ]  [ R b1 ]  [ K b4 ] , [ h4 ]  White's only hope is [ f3 ] but e3!
 [ f3 ] , [ R x c2 ]  26...[ R x c2 ] is not a mistake. it is followed by 27.r1xc2[ Q b1 + ] 28. Kf2[ Q x c2 ]  [ Q d3 ]  [ K f2 ]  [ h5 ]  [ K f1 ]  [ f5 ]  [ K f2 ]  [ c3 ] , [ R h f1 ]  ARGH. I just noticed mate move Qd4. that would have been much nicer. stupid knight I thought I had to worry about that i forgot it's pinned! ARGH! learn from my mistakes.
 [ B x f2 + ] , [ K x f2 ]  bit of a bold sacrifice if you ask me quite a lot of effort to prevent me from castling I suppose the exposure is dangerous....
 [ N e4 ]  [ f3 ]  [ N d6 ]  [ R h8 ]  [ N c8 ]  [ K g8 ]  [ N b6 ] , [ Q g2 # ]  And that's checkmate...in just 79 moves. Not even the longest game I've ever played...tho it sure felt like it. Lol. This is one small step for a monkey and one giant leap for apekind. (This is how Planet of the Apes started.)
 [ e x d5 ] , [ R f8 ]  Now he 'develops' a rook along the half-open f-file. True [ g6 ] is a tender point but that can be plastered over...
 [ B g7 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ a6 ]  [ a3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ Q c2 ]  [ d x c4 ]  [ B x c4 ]  [ b5 ]  [ B e2 ] , [ B b7 ]  Black has developed nicely but White may be able to get some pressure on the c file.
 [ f6 ] , [ N d3 ]  9. b3?! and now 10. [ N d3 ] may have been a miscalculation. I decided to gambit the [ d4 ] pawn thinking white would get more than enough of a developmental and attacking compensation for it. Having played out the moves I'm not so sure that I got as much compensation as I had hoped for. 10. Nf3? just loses the pawn on [ g4 ] and there really isn't anywhere else for the knight to go. The real miscalculation might have been 9. b3?! leaving myself in this mess. I briefly considered 10. [ c5 ] to counterattack but I think that just ends up losing a pawn anyway. So of all the pawn-losing options 10. [ N d3 ] seems the best of the bunch. This may turn out to be a dubious gambit indeed.
 [ K d8 ] , [ N f7 + ]  Back to the start
 [ N c3 ]  [ Q a5 ] , [ B d2 ]  [ c7 ] is on the reach. No danger from the discovered threat to the queen. So I can go on developing.
 [ B x c6 ] , [ B a3 ]  Black reveals the point of 8. a4: he wants to get his stuffed Bishop into action. Evidently he's not as sure as I am that playing [ c4 ] will solve his troubles relatively efficiently.
 [ a6 ]  [ B a4 ] , [ b5 ]  11. ..... [ b5 ] - this move drives back white's lsb and prepares a queenside pawn storm.
 [ R a d8 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ B x d4 ]  [ B c6 ] , [ Q e3 ]  Alternative variation: 16. [ Q b2 ] [ Q h5 ] $11
 [ Q c8 ]  [ B b3 ] , [ B f6 ]  Black is trying to re-energize the DSB but I think I would have played ...[ h5 ] here to just sit on my hands is not my style so I would opt to put some pressure on white. When you put pressure on your opponent you never know what can happen.
 [ Q h5 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ Q x f7 + ]  [ K x f7 ] , [ e5 ]  This move was played for tempo gain. Being a Q for pawn down he'll do whatever he can to catch up time. Yes this is one of Joe's strategies. I saw a similar example in a game that fiercequeen annotated. The only thing is that material was level but constant gain of tempo is what allowed white to win the game. So it's very important even here.
 [ Q f4 ] , [ Q x e7 ]  greed before the fall... best was [ Q d3 ] [ B b6 + ] [ K h1 ] [ R d8 ] [ Q f3 ] [ R x d1 + ] and pray... [ Q x b7 ] is met with [ Q e3 + ] [ K h1 ] Qxb3...
 [ c4 ] , [ d4 ]  14 BxP? Q-[ R5 ] ch! wins the B.
 [ Q x f6 ]  [ Q g7 ]  [ Q e6 + ] , [ Q f7 ]  A fatal mistake. Black completely missed White's tactical threats.
 [ h4 ]  [ B x g5 ]  [ h x g5 ]  [ Q x g5 ]  [ Q x g5 ] , [ R x g5 ]  22. …… [ R x g5 ] - after a plethora of exchanges including the queens I am now a pawn down. Sigh!
 [ K g1 ] , [ R g8 + ]  40. ...... [ R g8 + ] - the rook can now move away from [ d8 ] because it is check! I announce mate next move and Bob permits it. Commiserations Bob.
 [ N b5 ] , [ Q c5 ]  [ Q d7 ] was a must to prevent the fork
 [ K g6 ] , [ K b3 ]  This effectively kills both of White's remaining pawns. No matter which one he moves the other one dies and the remaining one would only meet death upon encountering my rank of Black pawns on row 7.
 [ g x f5 ] , [ N e6 ]  a fork
 [ g4 ]  [ h x g3 ]  [ e ]  [ p ]  [ R x g3 ]  [ c5 ]  [ h4 ] , [ R b6 ]  Inaccuracy A better move was 23...c4! with the idea cxb .. after Rxb3-[ R x b3 ] axb3- [ R b8 ] Bd1- [ a5 ] and black with winning position or even 24... [ c3 ] 25. Rc1-[ R c8 ] ...
 [ Q x a5 ] , [ N x a5 ]  now it is a rook knight endgame
 [ K d6 ] , [ g5 ]  I have to move the pawn as he has unpinned his bishop.
 [ R d3 ] , [ R x h4 ]  No way would I have taken his rook there.
 [ g x h6 ]  [ Q g3 + ]  [ K h8 ]  [ Q e5 + ]  [ K g8 ]  [ Q x e6 + ]  [ Q x e6 ] , [ R x e6 ]  ...And look it's in a rook endgame with my up a rook for three pawns. Not going to be easy but I should still be able to win.
 [ N e7 ] , [ f6 ]  And again. This is like the mouse chasing the cat three consecutive moves by the same pawn driving away the same knight.
 [ N x g5 ]  [ R d g1 ]  [ N x f3 ] , [ Q x f3 ]  22. [ Q x f3 ] - after the N for B trade I am a pawn up. Can I get away with this pawn grabbing though?
 [ R d d8 ] , [ b5 ]  If RxR Rxr [ B x a3 ] then [ b6 ] wins quickly.
 [ N e8 ]  [ Q g3 ]  [ f6 ] , [ Q g4 ]  27. [ Q g4 ] - Glenda is thinking of entrenching herself on [ d6 ] with check.
 [ R a e1 ] , [ K x h5 ]  Again ...[ R b8 ] and ...[ f5 ] were worth considering. But White can't really stop them anyhow so Black can afford to tie off a few loose strings before beginning his main attack
 [ N x a7 ] , [ N f x e4 ]  Black manages to get back a pawn...
 [ Q x d4 ] , [ R b3 + ]  setup for nice pin a few moves along.
 [ K d6 ] , [ K e3 ]  And now back - but the wrong side!
 [ B x b5 ] , [ B x b5 ]  ...and we trade my knight for his bishop leaving my bishop reasonably placed...
 [ R b1 ]  [ B b7 ] , [ R e1 ]  Realising my position is on a downward slope I prepare to make a bid for active play. I think it's an important quality to realise sometimes that your position will only lead to trouble if you sit around doing nothing and so at times like these it does one well to think of ways to suddenly change the nature of the position.
 [ R x d8 ] , [ B d2 ]  ? The Bishop finally comes out to a square where it loses White a pawn and has no more influence on the board than it did on c1. I believe 21.[ B b2 ] or 21.[ B f4 ] would have been considerably better.
 [ R g5 ]  [ R x g5 ]  [ K x g5 ]  [ K b5 ]  [ K f4 ]  [ K c4 ]  [ K x f3 ] , [ K d3 ]  at this move i'm expecting him to offer me a draw which naturally I will accept.
 [ B x f6 ] , [ g x f6 ]  Not [ N x f6 ] because white gets a better position and [ B x f6 ] falls to [ B x b5 ] [ a x b5 ] N[ d x b5 ] followed by [ N x d6 + ] and [ e5 ] looks good for white
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ B c4 ]  This move attempts to exploit the vulnerability at f7.
 [ f4 ]  [ g x f4 ] , [ K x f4 ]  45. ...... [ K x f4 ] - the trade now takes place.
 [ N e2 ]  [ c5 ]  [ c3 ] , [ c4 ]  Closing the position only makes White's defensive chores easier.
 [ N x e4 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ Q f2 ]  [ O-O ] , [ Q f5 ]  [ e4 ] is my best positioned pawn and i need it so [ Q e7 ] is my best option
 [ N c3 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B d3 ] , [ b6 ]  !? Weakens [ a6 ] [ c6 ] [ d5 ] especially since black never plays Bb7.
 [ N x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ e x d4 ] , [ Q x d4 ]  Now material is cleared and there is only a single black knight which I consider to reduce good counterplay by black. But the computer does try to generate some threats over the next few moves but it is not considering the position that deeply.
 [ a6 ] , [ f4 ]  ... a chance to win back my piece ...
 [ K x f2 ]  [ a5 ]  [ K x g2 ]  [ a6 ] , [ f5 ]  38. ..... [ f5 ] - but he doesn't take the h pawn at once. He is sending down his frontal f passer. Thankfully the Wicked Witch of the West will not have time to make an appearance on the board but it is a close run thing.
 [ N x d5 ]  [ Q e2 + ]  [ B e6 ] , [ Q b5 + ]  My advantage was massive but I was about to make it even bigger!
 [ g6 ]  [ Q x g6 + ]  [ K e7 ] , [ Q f7 # ]  I'm pretty sure that almost all the people who have read through this annotation has experienced something like this.. you think you have a big advantage you think you have a winning advantage then your opponent pulls the rug away from you! (though fair play to White for getting the mate) I have quite a few 'skeletons in the closet' like this so I figured that I'd get this one off my chest :)
 [ d6 ]  [ R e8 ] , [ N c7 ]  Black gave up there. Well done rednif_tap !
 [ N a4 ]  [ R b8 ]  [ R c7 ]  [ B x e2 ] , [ K x e2 ]  27. [ K x e2 ] - not sure this was a good way to go from Bob - that bishop pair did offer some counterplay.
 [ N h4 ] , [ N c4 ]  See got the knight attack but I'm far ahead now and I'm also attacking.
 [ Q f5 ] , [ N e4 ]  Punishment for not trading the Bisshop for the Knight. Of course [ N d6 ] is threatening.
 [ c4 ] , [ R g3 ]  Still going to do [ d3 ] looks good or q[ x a5 ] maybe next
 [ K h1 ] , [ Q x f3 + ]  Taking the f pawn and forking the king and rook. I couldn't have taken the rook with 31. ... Qxf3. He would have been able to move out of the way.
 [ B b4 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ Q c2 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ O-O ] , [ B x c3 ]  Black must take here when the pin is broken by castling--the Bishop can be trapped otherwise.
 [ K f5 ] , [ b3 ]  It does not matter how many pawn moves white can make compared to black the black king can keep on moving between [ f5 ] and [ g4 ] until white runs out of moves and has to move his king.
 [ K b1 ]  [ B x d2 ]  [ R x d2 ] , [ e5 ]  Taking control of the center with tempo
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ d6 ]  the dreaded Philidor again...
 [ Q e7 ]  [ B d4 ]  [ f5 ]  [ e x f6 ]  [ e ]  [ p ] , [ N x f6 ]  Now Black will also have to deal with an isolated e pawn.
 [ B c6 ]  [ h4 ] , [ R h8 + ]  Does not win the h-pawn due to
 [ c6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ f3 ]  [ e x f3 ] , [ N x f3 ]  5. Back into the gambit line.
 [ e3 ]  [ e5 ] , [ e x d4 ]  ?! Probably 5.[ B e2 ] is better as White's development is going to have some problems now.
 [ B g3 ] , [ Q a5 ]  Better late than never the queen moves to [ a5 ]  [ Q e3 ]  [ K x h7 ]  [ B x b8 ]  [ B x f1 ] , [ K x f1 ]  Better was 26. [ h3 ] giving the king space to escape the back rank away from the middle
 [ a4 ]  [ a5 ]  [ b x a5 ] , [ b x a5 ]  And with our minions closing in on each other it is time! THE MOST NOBLE OF ALL WARRIORS WILL SOON TAKE FLIGHT!
 [ N b d7 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ Q b6 ]  Good! If White is allowed to castle he will have the advantage.
 [ N f6 ] , [ N d4 ]  I wasn't sure about this move because my queen is less mobile but I really wanted to get more control of the center. Analysis indicates this is a mistake. In general I think sometimes I play a bit too aggressive without considering the repercussions.
 [ d x e5 ] , [ R x e5 ]  Now Black's knight on [ f6 ] and bishop on [ e6 ] are both pinned.
 [ B c1 ] , [ R a d8 ]  White relinquishes some control of the center and deliberately disconnects his rooks and it's pretty clear what his next move is going to be. It seems about time for black to place a rook on the half-open d-file.
 [ B d3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B d7 ]  [ Q g4 ] , [ a5 ]  This pawn thrust by Black is 7 moves late!!
 [ Q d6 ] , [ Q d2 ]  to be closer for help
 [ K e6 ]  [ B g6 ]  [ g x f3 ]  [ g x f3 ]  [ N b5 ]  [ B x h5 ]  [ K d5 ]  [ B e8 ]  [ e4 ]  [ f x e4 + ]  [ K x e4 ]  [ N c3 + ]  [ N x c3 + ]  [ B x c3 ]  [ f3 ]  [ h4 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ B a5 ]  [ K e3 ]  [ K e1 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ h5 ]  [ B g3 + ]  [ K f1 ]  [ K d4 ]  [ h6 ]  [ B e5 ]  [ h7 ]  [ K c5 ] , [ B x c7 ]  Offering this same Bishop again...
 [ O-O-O ] , [ B x h3 ]  I finally take the knight...
 [ R x f3 ] , [ Q h5 ]  here I continuing covering my bishop and attacking the witched rook. there is a mate on the air if black made a wrong move! But still the pc give -2 58!! and I guess it' right! Feeling very uncomfortable but still hoping ^__^
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ] , [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ] seems obligatory but it is a speed game. A pawn may be worth taking someone out of their repertoire.
 [ R d4 ] , [ R d7 ]  well he is going to win this pawn....
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ] , [ f4 ]  King's gambit one of the most exciting openings in chess.
 [ N e4 ]  [ N c2 ] , [ N c5 ]  12. ....... [ N c5 ] - for one moment it looks as though I am hanging my knight. But look further that [ d4 ] pawn is pinned! I will leave you the Inquest Jury to spot the unit that that pawn is pinned to.
 [ R e g2 + ]  [ K h1 ] , [ B d4 ]  It didn't occur to me until this very move which is why I brought my R to [ e1 ] on my next move. I was thinking that if Stanley plays 26...Rg1+?? I have an easy answer for that which would of course be 27.[ R x g1 ] My anticipation was that Stanley would play 27...[ B x g1 ] and after 28.[ K x g1 ] I'd be well into the game. In fact I forgot that if true I'd be the one with more then a small advantage as later on I'd answer with Re8! But I was way too optimistic as I should've been aware of 26...[ R x h2 # ] where he mated me.
 [ Q f6 ]  [ B c4 ] , [ Q d8 ]  26. .... [ Q d8 ] - not NxB BxN making my [ d6 ] pawn an indefensible target.
 [ R e8 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ Q d2 ] , [ Q b6 ]  Here we reach a climax in development. I make a move which I had mixed feeling about seen next move. Whites main ace in the whole is his center but black will have great chances with a queen side attack. Notice that the move called for in the position [ e5 ] loses the [ d5 ] pawn. Best would probably be [ R d1 ] or Bc2.
 [ a2 ]  [ N c1 ] , [ a1 = Q ]  White submits here. Well done Joanne and thanks for an interesting game.
 [ N c d5 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ B x d5 + ] , [ K h8 ]  16. ....... [ K h8 ] - the black king now moves into the corner after a check from Fou Leblanc. Now comes a rook trade.
 [ N x d4 ] , [ a6 ]  ...and not in the GK database.
 [ N e7 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ N d7 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ f x e5 ]  [ f6 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ c6 ] , [ R e3 ]  That move was the preparation of my first mistake but this position is still equal.
 [ b6 ]  [ K c8 ]  [ b7 + ]  [ K d8 ] , [ d5 ]  Black resigned. He fought for what he was worth but the game was practically over around move 10 as he admitted afterwards. Nevertheless he gave me a run for my money and I think he deserves credits for his fighting spirit and stiff resistance in a losing position. thanks to my opponent for the game thanks to you all for reading my annotation and please leave some comments.
 [ e3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ b3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B b2 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ a3 ]  This was played in order to be able to bring the [ B d3 ] without the harassment of Nb4.
 [ e4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ] , [ d6 ]  Black is passive but both sides are relatively solid.
 [ f6 ]  [ B h4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ e3 ] , [ B b4 + ]  normally we wait for Nc3: but this works also...
 [ a3 ] , [ B e7 ]  Black prepares castling.
 [ d5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ e3 ] , [ N h5 ]  So decision time I can put the bishop to [ [ g5 ] ] hoping to draw [ h6 ] and later [ [ g5 ] ] but I opt to develop my knight and live with the double pawns
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ c4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ e4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ N b4 ] , [ Q a4 + ]  This seems to win the knight. However Qa4+!? doesn’t due to N8c6!! and [ d5 ] fails to Nxd5.
 [ N f6 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ B x d5 ] , [ e x d5 ]  5. ..... [ e x d5 ] - an interesting piece exchange here. Black now has doubled pawns.
 [ B c4 ]  [ B x f3 ] , [ g x f3 ]  The downside to this is that my K side pawn structures are destroyed. I usually care about that a lot but not this time. As I'm pretty confident that Jack doesn't have an immediate win here.
 [ K g2 ]  [ R f8 ] , [ c4 ]  Now my king has to do all the hard work. But he can.
 [ e x f4 + ]  [ B e2 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ O-O ] , [ g5 ]  Black wants material compensation for retarded development
 [ N x f6 ]  [ Q x h3 + ] , [ N f g4 ]  My execution from here on out probably wasn't the best but my huge material advantage wins anyway.
 [ e5 ]  [ d6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ e x d6 ] , [ c x d6 ]  Black now has a 2 to 1 pawn advantage in the center.
 [ Q x a6 ]  [ R d1 ]  [ Q b5 ]  [ B d5 ]  [ N x d5 ] , [ R x d5 ]  I sacrifice a minor exchange with the intent of winning a second Pawn [Black's KP].
 [ N c6 ] , [ N c3 ]  I thought about [ [ d5 ] ] because then after 4. [ [ d5 ] ] [ N e5 ] 5. [ N x e5 ] [ B x e5 ] 6. [ f4 ] I would have a lot of board control but in doing so I would weaken my king side and open up the long diagonal for his dark squared bishop. This maily develops protects [ e4 ] for the future and just gain more central space.
 [ R x g5 + ]  [ h x g5 ]  [ Q x g5 + ]  [ K h8 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ R f3 + ] , [ K h4 ]  and Black resigned: not overly soon...
 [ N x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ B d2 ] , [ B f6 ]  Starting to cause some minor threats
 [ N f3 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ N c3 ]  white seems to be devoloping minors over pawn structure which is common and there isn't a problem with it but... well you'll see.
 [ N c d7 ] , [ R e1 ]  ! The play is on the e-file specifically e7.
 [ B x c3 ]  [ b x c3 ]  [ N x d2 ] , [ Q x d2 ]  12. [ Q x d2 ] - this trade has weakened white's queenside pawn structure but can I take advantage of this?
 [ K a4 ] , [ g7 ]  or maybe not yet.
 [ O-O ]  [ h3 ]  [ B x f3 ]  [ g x f3 ]  [ R f4 ]  [ K g2 ] , [ g5 ]  he pushes his pawn
 [ d x e4 ] , [ d x e4 ]  I get myself in a bad position early.
 [ e x f5 ] , [ B c5 ]  This is good because he is developing but I would have played 3...[ N f6 ] instead because it is said that you are supposed to develop your knight before the bishop. However General Opening Principle does not matter that much. Afterall GM tactical-abyss and tigerlilov said that principles are only general guidelines to go by but they do not always help you to win. In some cases you will win if you do not always follow the guidelines. In fact that was one reason that I posted an annotation about "Poor Opening Play" and stated that you sometimes have to play badly in order to play well. Of course some people disagree with that assessment.
 [ a x b5 ]  [ a x b5 ]  [ h4 ]  [ R b a8 ]  [ R a1 ]  [ Q a3 ]  [ Q g5 ]  [ Q x c3 ]  [ h5 ]  [ h6 ] , [ Q g4 ]  [ Q d2 ] is better. Hoping to exchange queens and weather the storm. The problem of [ Q g4 ] is that now white's queen is not out of position.
 [ Q e2 ] , [ N d4 ]  Now I can take the rook
 [ e4 ] , [ d5 ]  I lash out to confront is strong center.
 [ h3 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ Q c2 ]  10.[ d x e5 ] [ d x e5 ] 11.[ Q x d7 ] is more accurate. The text allows 10...[ e x d4 ] 11.[ N x d4 ] [ R e8 ] where I think Black has a very slight advantage.
 [ B c2 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ B x d3 ]  [ c x d3 ]  [ N e1 ]  [ Q x a2 ]  [ N x d3 ]  [ B b6 ]  [ R h g1 ] , [ K e7 ]  Shocked I can do some damage along there
 [ b6 ]  [ a4 ]  [ R a e8 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ K h7 ] , [ K h2 ]  20. [ K h2 ] - total symmetry on the kingside.
 [ d x c7 + ]  [ Q x c7 ]  [ Q x e8 + ]  [ Q c8 ]  [ R d8 ]  [ K c7 ]  [ Q e7 + ]  [ K b8 ] , [ Q d6 # ]  the end!
 [ B e6 ] , [ B e3 ]  16. [ B e3 ] - I cannot avoid my pawns being busted on the other side though.
 [ N g5 ]  [ O-O ] , [ b3 ]  I wasn't sure how to go about and didn't want to retreat. In addition I didn't want to restrict my d3-[ g1 ] diagonal with 7.[ d3 ] as then it's less active since it covers less squares. So I thought that fianchettoing was the way to go and am ready to retreat when Jack attacks.
 [ R x h2 ] , [ R c1 ]  Attacking [ c6 ] and maybe I can neutralise his [ R h2 ] with Rc2. Computer gives Black 1.27 ahead.
 [ N f3 ]  [ a6 ] , [ c3 ]  Slowly preparing d2-d4.
 [ g3 ]  [ B d4 ]  [ R f1 ] , [ B b2 ]  White's a and b pawns were going to fall and I would then have 3 passed pawns to run to queening squares. Due to all of this my opponent resigned in this position. I hope you enjoyed my commentary please comment with any lines I may have missed or any improvements in general!
 [ K f8 ]  [ Q b8 + ] , [ K e7 ]  Black no doubt longs for White to capture the exposed rook on [ h8 ] as he can then play 34. ... [ Q x b1 + ] or 34. ... [ d1 = Q + ] or even 34. ... d1=R+ since he would threaten so much. However Black has forseen this and decides against taking the rook.
 [ B x b7 ] , [ R x b7 ]  Exchanging the bishops leaves the pawns around white's king weak. The exchange also lifted black's rook enabling black to to easily double pieces on the half-open d file.
 [ B a3 ]  [ R h5 ]  [ R a b1 ]  [ R h6 ] , [ R x b7 ]  ??
 [ K f5 ] , [ R e5 + ]  Now he checks me again If I play [ K f6 ] then white could play [ N h7 ] and it would still be check if he promotes.
 [ Q c7 ]  [ Q x c7 ] , [ d x c7 ]  They are still following exactly what I suggested. First Caruana sacrificed a pawn. Now Carlsen gave back the pawn and sacrificed a pawn. He will have no problem winning the [ c7 ] pawn back. I must have had a crystal ball Position is equal After [ N c6 ] to defend the [ e5 ] pawn Black will recapture the pawn on c7. No problem at all.
 [ g4 ] , [ f6 ]  I think i should won the pawn first but well pressure to the K see what happen
 [ B b2 ]  [ N e7 ]  [ B d3 ] , [ O-O ]  Lange tucks his own King safely away.
 [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B e3 ] , [ a6 ]  Now here's where the twist comes in. So far this game has been very even. Only a strange stupid move could change everything. But of course.....
 [ B d3 ]  [ c5 ]  [ d x c5 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ B x e4 ]  [ Q x d1 + ] , [ K x d1 ]  7. [ K x d1 ] - after a little stouche in the centre the queens are exchanged and white will lose his extra pawn. White has a slight lead in development however could this be decisive?
 [ O-O-O ] , [ d5 ]  ! The best move in this position by black. Keeping any d4-[ d5 ] plans away and trying to delay whites attacking plans.
 [ B e7 ] , [ B e3 ]  Looks forcing but here I move out of a threat whilst leaving a threat of my own on d4.
 [ B b4 ] , [ R e8 ]  The game enters a new phase - the 'presque-endgame' as I like to call it. A game with on both sides 3 pieces still on the board is not an end game in my view. But Black has to find a plan (and so does White for that matter but his plan will be predicated on how Black chooses to proceed). A couple of plans spring to mind. One is to press forward on the K-side hoping to break up the pawns there or at least to commit White to defending on that wing. Another is after 22...[ R a8 ] to advance on the Q-side (...a5) to drive away the bishop followed by ...[ K d6 ] and ...c5. Black's chief aim for now should be to commit White's defences in one place then switch attention elsewhere - like a tennis player forcing his opponent to run back and forth across the court.
 [ K f8 ] , [ f6 ]  Threatening mate and the black queen cannot leave the back-rank due to Ra8ch so:
 [ K f8 ]  [ g5 ] , [ c5 ]  now finally I try to do something over on the Q side but far too late
 [ K a8 ] , [ N e4 ]  Black robbed white of the discovered attack with check and now white must retreat his knight. This also creates a discovered threat against the black rook on h8.
 [ N x e5 ] , [ f x e5 ]  forming a wedge into my enemies territory also a deferred advance if you will.
 [ B x d5 ] , [ Q b4 + ]  Aiming at the pawn [ b2 ] but leaving [ f7 ] *very* weak!
 [ N f3 ] , [ B g4 ]  So far all my moves follow the opening principles while black has broken 2 (never develop queen too and develop knights before bishops)
 [ R x b2 ]  [ K x b2 ]  [ N e4 + ]  [ c3 ] , [ N x g5 ]  Getting a pawn and a strong bishop for a rook that was under a lot of pressure.
 [ B c5 + ] , [ K e8 ]  The computer analysis calls Black's move a blunder preferring d6. It's mate in 5 the analysis says: . . . [ K e8 ] 19. [ e6 ] [ B e5 ] 20. [ e x d7 + ] [ B x d7 ] 21. [ Q x e5 + ] [ K d8 ] 22. [ B b6 + ] [ K c8 ] 23. Qct# The [ [ d6 ] ] continuation goes this way per the computer: … [ [ d6 ] ] 19. [ R f d1 ] [ B h6 ] 20. ex[ [ d6 ] ] [ B d7 ] 21. [ B x d7 ] [ B g5 ] 22. [ B e8 ] [ B d8 ] 23. [ d7 + ] [ N e7 ] 24. [ B x e7 + ] [ B x e7 ] 25. [ R e1 ] [ B d8 ] 26. [ Q b4 + ] [ K g7 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ N c6 ]  Develops a piece and controls the centre.
 [ N f6 + ]  [ K g7 ]  [ N h5 + ]  [ K h8 ] , [ Q f1 ]  white has suceeded in keeping the queens on the board but now it is black who is attacking!
 [ N c3 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ N f3 ]  All book so far.
 [ a3 ]  [ K e2 ] , [ B f7 ]  Now I can push to a2!
 [ Q b4 + ] , [ N c3 ]  ... that.
 [ Q x f3 ]  [ R x e1 + ] , [ K g2 ]  Until I blunder. I don't know why I didn't grab with my rook.
 [ O-O ] , [ N d6 ]  I don't believe this was the best move but it isn't to shabby
 [ e x f3 ] , [ N x c7 ]  back to the battle! the Knight's Travel Path: b1-c3-d5-b6-a8-c7!!!
 [ B x d1 ] , [ Q x c6 + ]  Now Black can't interpose the B.
 [ N e2 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ f3 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ O-O ] , [ e6 ]  Black wants to get the bishop out and castle. But this blocks the bishop from the diagonal.
 [ N d5 ]  [ R d7 ]  [ N f4 ]  [ Q b8 ]  [ Q e6 ]  [ Q d6 ]  [ R a c1 ]  [ B e5 ]  [ Q x d6 ]  [ R x d6 ]  [ N e2 ]  [ R b8 ] , [ R c5 ]  I overlooked this move but I sill have counterplay.
 [ h3 ] , [ R d f4 ]  Still heading for [ f2 ] Black now threatens 27. ... [ B x h3 ] because 28. [ g x h3 ] [ R x h3 ] wins. Helpfully Black's king is already on a dark square away from the White bishop.
 [ N x d5 ] , [ B x g7 ]  Before recapturing the knight White takes exchanges the black bishops. Black King recaptures and he's in a dangerous square.
 [ B c5 ]  [ Q c3 + ]  [ d4 ] , [ Q b3 ]  hmmm...perhaps I helped Black here a bit...Again I missed an opportunity to develop.
 [ K c6 ]  [ K d8 ] , [ K b7 ]  White king gains controlof Queening square
 [ g x f4 + ]  [ K x f4 ]  [ R x d1 ]  [ R x d1 ] , [ R f8 + ]  And this is all i remember of this game though the final positon was black king on [ e6 ] white king on [ c5 ] and white pawn was on a5.
 [ B x c4 ]  [ R x g5 ]  [ K f8 ]  [ R c7 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ B x f4 ] , [ R b4 ]  ???
 [ N x d3 + ]  [ K d2 ]  [ N f2 + ]  [ K e1 ]  [ N x d1 ]  [ N x d1 ]  [ Q d3 ]  [ N f2 ] , [ Q x b1 ]  
 [ d5 ] , [ a3 ]  The fallback of black's [ N b4 ] idea
 [ N x f6 + ] , [ g x f6 ]  And I started playing the Caro-Kann a long long time ago because of this variation that was appealing.
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ] , [ d4 ]  Play [ N f3 ] before this move
 [ K g5 ]  [ b x a4 ]  [ d5 ] , [ h4 + ]  Strange move. White should use every opportunity to push the passed pawn rather than help black move his king to a more active position.
 [ e4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ e6 ]  I have more and more doubts about the Icelandic Gambit.
 [ Q c7 ] , [ R f e1 ]  Strengthening the king pawn and perhaps setting up [ N d5 ] and some exchanges which might win a pawn on e5.
 [ d x e5 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ R d4 ]  [ Q b6 ]  [ Q b3 ]  [ N x c4 ]  [ N x c4 ]  [ Q x b3 ] , [ a x b3 ]  Black is down a pawn but he still has drawing chances.
 [ R f d1 ] , [ R c4 ]  I can also use my rook to advance like the 105 Howitzers in the Army Field Artillery (LIGHT). When a rook can move forward it is the same as a Battery Battalion advancing canons to the forefront to cut deep behind enemy lines. If a Battery Position can move ahead of Infantry (pawns or soldiers) to support Infantry then it is a better decision than sending the pawns forward to be bullet catchers.
 [ B d5 ] , [ R c2 ]  And now black's rooks aren't connected anymore while the black king is still vulnerable. This will lose a rook.
 [ N e4 ]  [ Q e7 ] , [ g4 ]  so this was the good idea ! weakening the castle but wining some very attacking position
 [ e x d5 ]  [ N a5 ]  [ d6 ] , [ Q x d6 ]  Now that I annotate this game I see that I should have played 10 ... [ N x b3 ] 11. [ Q x b3 ] [ B d5 ] and I win the pawn back with approximate equality. But in the game I was only looking for counterplay along the h1-[ a8 ] diagonal.
 [ K h8 ]  [ Q h6 + ]  [ K g8 ]  [ Q g5 + ]  [ K h8 ] , [ Q f6 + ]  Which similar to before would've worked if he had played 44.[ Q h6 + ] So I've reached the conclusion that this player knows what would lead to it. As Carl would've missed it and this would be a draw since I was able to announce it once or twice in hopelessly lost positions. Be it note that this attempt was also me running low on time. I only had about 10 minutes remaining but Tom had about 25 however.
 [ N f8 ]  [ N e4 ] , [ B f5 ]  This seems a good move skewering [ N e5 ] and [ B c2 ] while defending [ f6 ] with the Q.
 [ R x f3 ] , [ B g5 + ]  why that?
 [ K x g2 ]  [ K f8 ]  [ R f5 ]  [ N g4 ]  [ R c5 ]  [ K e7 ] , [ R x c4 ]  hung out the pawn and was very surprised that black took the bait
 [ Q x f3 ] , [ N g4 ]  My opponent plays yet another pointless and only pseudo-aggressive "attack".
 [ K f1 ]  [ K d3 ]  [ K g2 ]  [ K x c3 ]  [ K x g3 ] , [ K d2 ]  With [ K d2 ] Black controls the promotion square for the c pawn. It will sail in for the win.
 [ Q x b7 ] , [ N d7 ]  develops the knight to its only safe square protects the rook and stops the queen from check on [ c6 ]  [ N x d7 ]  [ Q x a7 ] , [ B e4 ]  the queen needs to retreat along the a file
 [ B f6 ] , [ B c4 + ]  this move kind of helped me= i had the intention to move my king to let my rook pass.
 [ h x g5 ]  [ N e7 ]  [ g x h6 ]  [ Q e6 ]  [ h x g7 + ]  [ K x g7 ] , [ R f2 ]  Now I'm up a pawn and am in a clear winning position. This rook move opens the [ f1 ] square for me to create an omnipotent batter on the half-open f-file of a queen and two rooks.
 [ N c6 ] , [ B b5 ]  Saving the white queen with the royal pin.
 [ N c3 ]  [ N x c4 ]  [ N x c4 ]  [ B x c4 + ] , [ K b4 ]  Interestingly the computer "only" puts black 1.67 ahead here. The black bishop is better than the white knight in the open board and black is a whole clear pawn up too. What more could a player want?
 [ K g7 ]  [ Q g5 ] , [ Q f6 ]  Trading now would be as good as resigning for white.
 [ R e1 ] , [ R c c2 ]  Black tightens the noose and there is no escape.
 [ f3 ]  [ g5 ] , [ N c3 ]  Le Chevalier blanc retreat and create a nice combination with a double attack rook/pawn
 [ b6 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ B b7 ]  5. ........ [ B b7 ] - a double fianchetto - this lsb also proves to be very strong and will be a nightmare piece later on!
 [ R f3 ]  [ Q e7 ]  [ K g1 ] , [ c4 ]  Notice he can't play [ B x h7 ] because of my Knight.
 [ Q x a5 + ]  [ N c3 ]  [ Q b4 ]  [ N g e2 ]  [ Q x b2 ]  [ R b1 ]  [ Q a3 ]  [ g4 ]  [ Q a5 ] , [ f4 ]  This move robs P[ g4 ] of an protection. Black is encouraged to play BxPg4.
 [ R c6 ]  [ R e6 ] , [ R c7 ]  A huge blunder. The bishop is almost too far away from the action to be seen.
 [ d6 ]  [ B h5 ]  [ B e7 ] , [ N f4 ]  in case of refusing exchange then [ Q g4 ] ~ putting pressure and possible wining a pawn but most making damage on king side !
 [ N c6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ B g4 ] , [ O-O ]  Now white has 6 pièces out against 3 for black
 [ B c7 ] , [ Q x d8 + ]  Spares me the trouble of immediately protecting the [ e5 ] pawn.
 [ e4 ]  [ f x e4 ] , [ d x e4 ]  I am happy now. I have 2 passed linked pawns and the white queen is pretty much trapped on c2. My queen also has a nice line to [ b3 ] I just need to work out how to make the most of it. I have a number of options. [ e3 ] will force the white dsb to [ g3 ] unlinking the rooks and resigning the h rook to defence of his h pawn.
 [ e4 ]  [ B e2 ] , [ f4 ]  A rather loose looking move but you cannot afford to play passively with Black. Your only chance is active counterplay or else White will slowly push you off the board.
 [ R c a8 ]  [ R b8 ]  [ a4 ]  [ R x a8 ]  [ R x a8 ]  [ R a1 ]  [ a3 ]  [ Q b1 ]  [ Q c4 + ]  [ Q d3 ] , [ Q b5 ]  now the key moment when he decided to accept the Queen exchange determining his helpless end game
 [ B x f3 ]  [ B x f3 ] , [ N f6 ]  I was very annoyed at this she keeps up the pressure on the [ e4 ] pawn with myself running short on resources to defend it.
 [ R d1 + ]  [ K e6 ] , [ f4 ]  I really do not know if he lost his nerves patience ability to calculate or if the soccer injury has some effect but this is NOT the Carlsen of past World Championships! Something is very strange! He is missing a lot of things and playing too cautiously!
 [ K h8 ] , [ B h5 ]  Nice move but unefficient. It's often better to play simply
 [ R c8 ]  [ R c1 ] , [ R a8 ]  34. ...... Ra8?? - the losing move black forgets that his rook walked away from an attack from the WQ just a couple of moves ago alas for him that queen and the threat is still there and now the BQ feels the white heat!
 [ R g8 ] , [ N x f6 ]  This wins the black queen!
 [ B d2 ] , [ b x a4 ]  Now to activate my bishop. Planning 21... [ B b5 ] and 22... [ a6 ] and the bishop is suddenly a big thorn in the side of the white squares in white's territory. Now I need to get generate a kingside attack with the remaining pieces whilst white is stuck in his corner.
 [ R h7 ] , [ g x h5 ]  This is where I decide to take though since my K stops him from taking back. And his other pawns are of no concern to me because I can and will stop them as well.
 [ R h6 + ]  [ K f7 ]  [ R h7 + ]  [ K f8 ]  [ N x h2 ] , [ R h1 ]  white resign
 [ K b7 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ B c6 ]  [ N f4 ] , [ R x c2 + ]  {and after [ K x c2 ] and [ B x h1 ] the h pawn is going to Queen so white resigns.} 0 - 1 Entered the game for the Worcestershire Woodcock Prize and won it for the first time! http://www.raycollett.net/worcs/woodcock.htm Thanks for looking.
 [ B b2 ] , [ N x c3 ]  Seeking simplification through material exchanges as I had a two pawn advantage.
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ e x d5 ]  Spielmann immediately opens up the game. He loves to launch quick attacks.
 [ Q f3 + ] , [ K d4 ]  the only move. now i realised that i could beat him or get his queen here is my masterplan
 [ K e2 ]  [ R b1 ]  [ K f2 ] , [ R x b2 + ]  Material is once again equal but the key issue is White's need to protect the pawns on [ c3 ] and [ h2 ] as well as the Bf1.
 [ K f8 ]  [ K e4 ]  [ K e7 ] , [ d5 ]  42. [ d5 ] - I decided to obtain a passer here but was it the right plan?
 [ N d2 ]  [ b5 ] , [ R c1 ]  This is the only useful diagonal.
 [ a6 ]  [ N f x d4 ]  [ a x b5 ]  [ Q b3 ] , [ e x d4 ]  Note that whites position is very cramped indeed and I am trying to tighten the screw even more
 [ R f8 ]  [ N g3 ]  [ R x f2 + ]  [ K c1 ]  [ B g4 ] , [ B e5 ]  32. [ B e5 ] - I decide to improve Fou Lenoir's position but black's move [ e3 ] kills things off stone dead. I wave the white flag because I will have to give up my knight to stop that e pawn from crowning into the Wicked Witch of the West and getting at Henry. Well played Craig - Joanne
 [ N e2 ] , [ N f d7 ]  Not bad I have a good hold on [ e5 ] now.
 [ K f3 ] , [ R x d3 ]  A piece and an exchange will be lost here and Black resigns. The opening decided this game.
 [ B x e5 ] , [ N x e5 ]  Sacrifying the exchange but NOT to play for the counterfork but...
 [ K h8 ]  [ a4 ]  [ c6 ]  [ Q g4 ]  [ g5 ] , [ a x b5 ]  White has a strong position but at the moment his attack is going nowhere fast. Black may have been better off consolidating with 25. ... [ B g8 ] which defends [ h7 ] and [ g7 ] and opens the f-file for the black rook. Unless I've missed something the move as played seems reckless and doesn't seem to offer black any advantage.
 [ R e8 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ f x g6 ] , [ f x g6 ]  White continues his plan to weaken my king's safety and he is willing to play with an isolated pawn (which of course could be given away later on for strategical benefit). However due to his grabbing of the pawn white lost his advantage in development.
 [ O-O ] , [ N d2 ]  ...and swinging another piece that direction.
 [ B e3 ] , [ f6 ]  Eliminating the risk of a back-rank mate and letting the king move to f7.
 [ B g6 ]  [ N h4 ] , [ B x e4 ]  Another mistake.
 [ O-O-O ]  [ R h d1 ]  [ e5 ]  [ Q d3 ]  [ Q b7 ]  [ a3 ]  [ B a5 ] , [ b4 ]  22. [ b4 ] - driving back black's dsb and keeping the queenside pawns together.
 [ Q x d5 ] , [ Q g4 ]  Protects the g pawn as well as the bishop
 [ Q x c3 + ]  [ K e2 ] , [ d3 + ]  not 16...Qxa1?.17.Rg7+Kf8.18.Qf4+or Qf3+and mate on 2 moves.
 [ f x g4 ]  [ h3 ]  [ g x h3 ]  [ N x h3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B g2 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ B b4 ]  [ e4 ]  [ B x c3 + ] , [ b x c3 ]  I might venture something cliché here like "so far so book " but to tell the truth I'm not sure if there even *is* a "book" for this particular variation of this opening! Every time I play the "Krejcik/Avocet Gambit " I'm doing it mostly "by ear."
 [ N f3 ] , [ c5 ]  1. Black opens with Sicilian Defense..[ c5 ]  [ e4 ] , [ d6 ]  2. instead of [ N c6 ] ..[ d6 ]  [ g3 ] , [ Q c7 ]  5. [ Q c7 ] prepares for Qside castle[0-0-0]; protects b7; protects future [ N c6 ] [move 10]
 [ h6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ B g2 ]  [ Q f6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N x f3 + ]  [ Q x f3 ]  [ Q x b2 ]  [ R f e1 ] , [ Q e5 ]  Black still needs to keep an eye on his weak queenside pawns.
 [ Q d4 ] , [ N f6 ]  My rook was under attack and my knight was in no mans land so I felt this was the best move.
 [ c x b3 ]  [ R c2 ]  [ B g3 ] , [ f6 ]  Recognizing that his queenside pawns are about to be in ruins white tries one final counterattack exposing a double attack against black's pawn on f7. Black shut down that attempt and white seeing no way out resigns. 24. [ R f2 ] RxR followed by 25. ... [ R c8 ] and 26. ... [ R c2 ] puts the screws right back on.
 [ B f5 ]  [ R b d1 ]  [ R x d1 ]  [ R x d1 ]  [ Q x b2 ]  [ R e1 ] , [ B e6 ]  closing the e file
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ] , [ N x d4 ]  An interesting variation of the Sicilian.
 [ f x e5 ] , [ Q h5 + ]  Now this move forces him to do one of two things. Either play [ g6 ] and [ Q x e5 ] claims the rook or he can move his king forward. Personally I would prefer to keep material where possible and I would move ke7.
 [ c5 ]  [ c4 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ N c3 ]  3. [ N c3 ] - out come the cavalry!
 [ Q f2 ] , [ B x h2 ]  taking a pawn back but more importantly threatening to move the bishop to [ g2 ] open a chess from the rook and take the queen
 [ e4 ] , [ c6 ]  I've been playing the Caro-Kann more often these days. It's not uncommon to derive claustrophobic positions from this opening but I enjoy its solidity.
 [ Q d4 ] , [ B x d5 ]  Again Black exchanges pieces but this one was nearly forced since White's beautifully outposted knight controlled so much territory on the board...
 [ N c6 ]  [ a6 ]  [ R c a7 ]  [ e4 ] , [ R a7 x a6 ]  Game note "picks up a pawn"
 [ K b2 ]  [ Q d4 + ]  [ K a2 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ Q e7 ] , [ R h1 ]  Threatening mate after [ R a1 + ]  [ R f1 ]  [ R x f1 ]  [ N x f1 ]  [ Q c4 + ]  [ K b2 ]  [ d4 ]  [ Q b7 ] , [ e3 ]  It's just not possible to stop the pawns. The ending isn't much to analyze and comes quickly
 [ R h4 ] , [ f5 ]  forced or it would be mate on [ h8 ]  [ R h5 ] , [ R e6 ]  again forced or mate on [ g5 ]  [ K f8 ]  [ Q x d8 + ] , [ B e8 ]  only move as [ R e8 ] loses the bishop
 [ R a2 a3 ]  [ R d c2 ]  [ R c8 ] , [ N d1 ]  White's knight takes over defensive duties so the big boys can get to work.
 [ R a3 ] , [ B c2 ]  Now that [ f7 ] is not targeteable my B is free to move around.
 [ c4 ]  [ b3 ] , [ B x a3 ]  I did not see that coming at all. He trapped my queen.
 [ h3 ]  [ B b4 ]  [ N g e2 ]  [ O-O ]  [ a3 ]  [ B x c3 ]  [ N x c3 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ] , [ Q x d5 ]  Black is better in this position. White will have to fight for equality.
 [ B e7 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ] , [ K h1 ]  The immobility of my knight is somewhat troublesome. But I decided any attempts to resolve this problem with say [ R b1 ] would be artificial at this point. So I prepared for sound aggressive moves towards the kingside. And that would need some pawn pushes.
 [ R f2 ] , [ R x f2 ]  And White obliges.
 [ Q x g4 ]  [ Q c2 + ]  [ K e1 ] , [ N f5 ]  [Event "GameKnot Blitz"] [Site "http://gameknot.com/"] [Date "2010.08.24"] [Round "-"] [White "griffter75"] [Black "damien10"] [Result "0-1"] 1. [ a3 ] [ c5 ] 2. [ e4 ] [ N c6 ] 3. [ B b5 ] [ g6 ] 4. [ B x c6 ] [ d x c6 ] 5. [ d3 ] [ B g7 ] 6. [ h3 ] [ f5 ] 7. [ Q e2 ] fx[ e4 ] 8. Qx[ e4 ] [ N f6 ] 9. [ Q e5 ] O-O 10. Qx[ c5 ] [ N d7 ] 11.

[ K e1 ] N[ f5 ] 20. [ h5 ] [ N x e3 ] 21. [ Q e2 ] [ N x g2 + ] 0-1
 [ Q h6 ] , [ R a c1 ]  I believe the idea is adding pressure to the c file.
 [ K f6 ]  [ K g2 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ K f3 ] , [ d4 ]  46. ..... [ d4 ] - protecting Fou Lenoir and blocking off the e file but I am still saddled with vulnerable pawns!
 [ R x e1 ] , [ Q g6 ]  
 [ N f6 ] , [ N g5 ]  I had no good place to move the queen to in order to take away the pin on the e-pawn so this move serves the dual purpose of creating more space for the queen and making the knight more active.
 [ c x d4 ]  [ d5 ] , [ B b3 ]  11. [ B b3 ] - as I mentioned in my intro notes here is a deviation. NN played [ B x d4 ] against Erizo and dropped his queen here he also drops his queen you will soon see how.
 [ K e8 ]  [ R b4 ]  [ K f8 ]  [ K c5 ]  [ R a5 + ] , [ K d6 ]  mistake better would have been k[ b6 ] but I just wanted to quickly end this game
 [ R b3 ]  [ K e7 ]  [ a5 ] , [ a6 ]  I felt I needed to stop the white pawns from advancing.
 [ N f6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ B f4 ] , [ N e4 ]  Black not contesting center
 [ K g8 ] , [ B x e6 + ]  As I said [ K g8 ] opened up another stream of attacks for me.
 [ a6 ] , [ N e5 + ]  It is looking messy for black.
 [ N e5 ]  [ Q e6 ] , [ N d5 ]  White must press his attack.
 [ R d2 x d3 ] , [ R c1 ]  !
 [ a x b5 ]  [ N x b5 ]  [ B e5 ]  [ N d4 + ]  [ K d5 ]  [ b3 ]  [ N d3 ] , [ c4 + ]  ! The Black King is short of squares.
 [ h3 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ N c3 ]  6. [ N c3 ] - protecting the [ e4 ] pawn.
 [ h3 ] , [ B x f3 ]  5. ... [ B f5 ] 6. [ N x e5 ] winning a pawn
 [ R a e1 ]  [ R e8 ] , [ c4 ]  In this why white wants to develop his knight but I don't accept of course!
 [ e4 ] , [ B e7 ]  I moved my pawn to [ e4 ] and black developed his DB to e7.
 [ N c3 ]  [ B b4 ] , [ N d5 ]  N[ x N d5 ] yields the best result for black according to the database.
 [ N c4 ] , [ R f d1 ]  he hands me a pawn... who am I to pass it up?
 [ c6 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ Q d7 ] , [ K f2 ]  13. [ K f2 ] - Henry makes for [ g1 ] I will have at least castled by hand. Maybe I can think about developing my queenside. Freddy has other ideas though!
 [ B e3 ] , [ d5 ]  [ [ e5 ] ] is a probably move because after [ [ e5 ] ] [ N g4 ] [ B f4 ] and [ B g5 ]  [ d4 ]  [ B f4 ] , [ B d6 ]  i wanna exchange the black bishops
 [ K a2 ] , [ h5 ]  There is just one game on the database with this move Bollore Jacques (2184) vs. Rihouay Clement (2116) a black win! So I had to improve on this.
 [ Q d8 + ] , [ K f7 ]  Only place to move I have to do something about that rook.
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ B b4 ]  The Winawer variation.
 [ R f1 ]  [ N e5 ] , [ Q b1 ]  After a series of best moves in a very difficult position White finally slips. Better was 37 [ Q d1 ] [ R h5 ] 38 [ f4 ] [ e x [ f3 ] ] 39 [ R x [ f3 ] ] [ N x [ f3 ] ] 40 [ Q x [ f3 ] ] [ Q x [ f3 ] ] 41 [ g x [ f3 ] ] [ c4 ] 42[ B f8 ] [ R d5 ] 43 [ K g2 ] [ R d3 ] although White will be the exchange and at least one pawn down in a hopeless ending. Grabbing the c pawn with 37 [ B x c5 ] fails after 37 ... [ N [ f3 ] ] 38 [ R g1 ] (38 gxf3?Qxh3#) [ R h5 ] 39 [ Q f1 ] [ N d2 ] 40 [ B d6 ] [ N x f1 ] 41 [ R x f1 ] [ Q e6 ] 42 [ B g3 ] Qxa2. In this line 38 [ Q b1 ] leads to mate after 38 [ R h5 ] 39 [ Q b8 ] [ R x h3 ] 40 [ g x h3 ] [ Q x h3 ] 41 [ Q x e4 ] (41 [ Q b8 ] [ R x h3 ] 42 [ g x h3 ] [ Q x h3 ] 43 [ Q h2 ] Qxh2#; 41 [ B d6 ] [ R x h3 ] and mates) [ Q x e4 ] 42 [ B d6 ] [ Q g4 ] 43 [ B h2 ] [ R x h3 ] 44 [ g x h3 ] [ Q x h3 ] and mates. This mating attack demonstrates how rapidly the weakness on [ f3 ] becomes decisive once Black begins his kingside attack.
 [ K d7 ]  [ B e6 + ] , [ K c7 ]  8...[ K e8 ] offers a draw by repetition - hardly in keeping with the spirit of the tourney though our leader easy19 has used it to befuddle his opponents.
 [ B d3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ a4 ]  [ b4 ]  [ N e2 ]  [ R e8 ] , [ N g3 ]  Uncommon situation in a Benoni. White has most of his forces grouped on the kingside but abandons the queenside. So that black's plan is to attack on the queenside.
 [ R b6 ]  [ h3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ g4 ]  [ h x g4 ] , [ h x g4 ]  27. [ h x g4 ] - these pawn exchanges open up the h file and this will prove lethal to the black king.
 [ d3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ B b4 ]  Black doesnt want [ d5 ] so completely owned by White.
 [ K h2 ] , [ N h4 ]  This is where I mess up.
 [ N b d7 ]  [ B x f6 ] , [ N x f6 ]  Black has gained a lead in development. I think this counts as a "superior position".
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ d5 ]  Highly unusual play. The Queen will be forced out on the next move if material equality is to be maintained.
 [ K d6 ]  [ N x e6 ]  [ f x e6 ]  [ K x d2 ]  [ R e8 ] , [ c5 + ]  never move in a hurry
 [ c x d4 ]  [ Q x d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ Q h4 ]  and now out of theory let us see...
 [ e x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ B a2 ] , [ B d6 ]  Ready to castle. Black has a strong center and 3 pieces developed to white's 1 and I'm not sure that [ a2 ] is an ideal place for a bishop. Maybe white will soon lament his loss of tempi and the fact that so many of his pieces are still on their starting squares.
 [ N d2 ] , [ B x d5 ]  22. Nd2? was a small blunder. That knight was the only piece defending the rook on [ e1 ] and with the knight gone the pawn at [ e4 ] is pinned and is no longer protecting the pawn at d5.
 [ K x d4 ]  [ K g4 ]  [ c4 ]  [ K f5 ] , [ c5 ]  Not anymore. I Queen one way or another.
 [ K h1 ] , [ B e6 ]  Maybe wiser Bf5. Definitely.
 [ R d1 ] , [ Q b2 ]  Further infiltration! White is simply not coordinated enough to scare her off and now she controls some very dangerous squares.
 [ K d8 ] , [ N f3 ]  I was actually a little annoyed that Black resigned here. Even though I will use my superiorly placed pieces and extra rook to tactically crush his underdeveloped position I would've had fun doing it and just being handed a win isn't as fun. It's the thinking required to win the game that's fun not the win itself.
 [ d x c5 ]  [ Q x c5 + ] , [ N d4 ]  The check only facilitates the build-up of my army to their best squares. Now I need a rook and the attack will inevitably crash through.
 [ c3 ]  [ R h1 + ]  [ K x h1 ]  [ Q x f2 ] , [ N f1 ]  The only move that can save him but only for few moves:
 [ g3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ B g2 ] , [ N c6 ]  Both of us are now controlling each others (4th & 5th rank) d-pawn square
 [ R x b7 ]  [ B x b7 ]  [ K x b7 ] , [ c5 ]  And the knight falls though I do get 2 of those irritating pawns for it.
 [ g4 ]  [ a6 ]  [ g3 ] , [ h x g3 ]  Black resigned.
 [ Q b6 ]  [ N d4 ] , [ N c5 + ]  This is the 1st time I put theyank into check.
 [ O-O ] , [ N x b6 ]  (?!) White is starting to neglect his development. There was nio need to be in such a hurry to exchange a well posted knight for a moribund bishop however desirable exchanges usually are when a piece ahead. Here too Black gets a useful file opened for his a-rook. More in keeping were developing moves like 13.[ N f3 ] or 13.[ N e2 ] or 13.Bb2.
 [ R d6 ] , [ R a f1 ]  I think [ B c3 ] or [ B b4 ] would have been better
 [ b x c6 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ Q x c5 + ]  [ b x c5 ] , [ R a7 ]  Stops the mate on [ f7 ] but...
 [ K f7 ]  [ R c7 + ]  [ K g6 ]  [ R x a7 ] , [ R h2 ]  We've just committed a pawn exchange after35.Rxa7?!. White couldn't gain anything with the rook take.
 [ B g6 ]  [ N x e6 ]  [ Q d7 ]  [ N d4 ] , [ b5 ]  Black plays [ [ b5 ] ] safe in the knowledge that 18.[ c x b6 ] leaves the [ d6 ] knight hanging. The drawback of course is that the [ [ b5 ] ] pawn (sitting three squares in front of the black monarch) soon becomes an object of attack.
 [ f x e4 ]  [ N x e4 ] , [ B f5 ]  The pawn is gone but now the knight is pinned. Now Black has a sure material advantage.
 [ g3 ] , [ R b8 ]  I go back to protect the pawn.
 [ e x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ] , [ B b5 ]  This is where this bishop almost always wants to be in the Sicilian but without taking a rest stop on [ c4 ] along the way.
 [ g x h3 ] , [ R f5 ]  ?? Makes a bad situation much worse! now White wins material with 38.Rd7. Black sees this too and resigns - well played by White! :)
 [ K f1 ]  [ Q e7 ]  [ N x h8 ] , [ d5 ]  7. ....... [ d5 ] - another standard move opening up the diagonal of Fou Leblanc.
 [ B e7 ]  [ f3 ] , [ R x g3 ]  i didn't even notice he could do that
 [ Q x f6 + ] , [ K h7 ]  29...[ K g8 ] leads to mate because of 30.[ Q g6 + ] [ K h8 ] (30...[ K f8 ] 31.[ R f1 + ] [ K e7 ] (31...[ B f5 ] 32.[ R x f5 + ] [ K e7 ] 33.[ R f7 + ] [ K d8 ] 34.Qg8#) 32.[ Q f7 + ] [ K e8 ] 33.Qf8#) 31.[ R f1 ] [ Q d8 ] 32.[ R f7 ] 1-0
 [ R a8 ]  [ R a1 ]  [ R a4 ]  [ g4 ]  [ K e7 ] , [ h3 ]  After couple of moves We reached this position and my opponent resigned here. 1-0
 [ c3 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ Q a5 + ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ c5 ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ B x d4 ] , [ B x c5 ]  A lot of theory and tactic involved up to here. I lost with this move because of Bxg7. I could have played [ Q b6 ] but no use. [ Q e2 + ] defending it and I was lost.
 [ B d3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ R f e1 ]  [ d6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ Q b6 ] , [ B h6 ]  Starting the attack.
 [ K h5 ]  [ g3 ]  [ f x g3 ] , [ f x g3 ]  Suddenly it doesn't seem so easy; there's a passed pawn to deal with. heading up the board to capture the pawn on [ a6 ] is not going to be an option; I'm forced to use my King in defence...
 [ K b2 ]  [ B d4 ] , [ Q a4 + ]  wins mat.
 [ B h6 ] , [ Q x e5 ]  Threatening the rook
 [ Q f6 ]  [ Q x f6 ] , [ e x f6 ]  OK then. An exchange suits me fine being ahead on material.
 [ g4 ]  [ b5 ]  [ g5 ]  [ R f d8 ] , [ Q g2 ]  29. [ Q g2 ] - Glenda is relieved of defensive work and moves stealthily towards the kingside. Already she is indirectly bearing down on the black king. I am threatening [ g x h6 ] next move.
 [ R g8 ]  [ Q f3 ]  [ Q e5 ] , [ R d2 ]  ...this is a good enough defence!
 [ K f7 ] , [ B x g7 ]  Now Black's queen is under attack and I have regained my piece. Black is lost after he moves his queen his king will perish from the checks
 [ K g8 ] , [ Q b8 + ]  Check the king then capture the bishop afterwards.
 [ B e5 ] , [ R g2 + ]  The hunt begins.
 [ N c4 ] , [ Q g5 ]  It's time to take advantage of white's problems with a kingside attack. His pieces are uncoordinated not attacking and not around his king. That seems to be all I need to know! I threaten mate in one with [ Q x g2 ]  [ g3 ] , [ N f6 ]  I have plenty of time to attack white's pieces aren't coming into the picture very quickly.
 [ K b2 ] , [ N e4 ]  Threaten it again. White loses the exchange if he plays 21. [ K x a2 ] Nd4xf3. But the knight on [ e4 ] is not just threatening one pawn - he's threatening two.
 [ d x c7 ] , [ Q x c7 ]  No real alternative here that I could see and I would love to get my queen to [ g3 ]  [ e4 ]  [ e5 ] , [ B c4 ]  I know the IM is an expert in this line so I had prepared for this. Last year he also played this against me. However he doesn't always play this: at the board besides mine he played 1.[ b3 ] 2.[ B b2 ] 3.[ g3 ] and 4.Bg2.
 [ R x g7 ] , [ K e7 ]  And besides I blundered another pawn.
 [ K g2 ] , [ R g7 ]  archduke_piccolo: Two possibilities... ... spring to mind. [A] 40.[ R b1 ] [B] 40.[ [ b5 ] ] It is my belief that we are looking at a draw here. We just can't quite make our aggressive posture a really threatening one. Meanwhile Black had strategic threats of her own. I'd probably go for option [B] as it does open a certain tactical possibility that could end the game with a flourish. redfoxrising: how about Rh1? looked at both and [ R h1 ] nambam: i agree with the archduke in that I think a draw will result if we do not make an aggressive move/ the way we have played. i believe we needed ro force an exchange of one of our rooks for the enemy nite to break open the centre to get behind the enemy lines with the other rook and advancee our own freed centre but the best chance of a win the way se played the opening Ithink is go with Rhi see what Janet replies then if possible follow with b5. highly risky but why not a dukelly flourish? archduke_piccolo: @nambam... Yes good. Let's add 40.[ R h1 ] to our range of options. I still prefer 40.[ [ b5 ] ] but there's very little in it and prepared to go along with another option. nambam: the only reason i prefer the Rook first is it gives janet one more chance to make a slight error.
 [ B b7 ]  [ N g f3 ] , [ h6 ]  I was a little confused by this move. [ N f3 ] would have been better to prevent the [ e4 ] push.
 [ R x a6 ]  [ N f4 ] , [ R a8 ]  !!!!!! A lovely finish. Black cannot take with the rook because White can take the queen with the knight. If Black checks then after34...[ N g2 + ] 35.[ R x g2 ] [ R x a8 ] 36.[ N x c1 ] [ h x g2 ] 37.[ K f2 ] [ R a1 ] 38.[ N d b3 ] [ R a8 ] 39.[ K x g2 ] [ R d8 ] 40. [ N d3 ] [ R c8 ] 41.[ N b c5 ] [ K f8 ] 42.[ N e4 ] [ R c7 ] 43.[ B b4 + ] [ K g8 ] 44.[ B e2 ] [ R c8 ] 45.[ K g3 ] [ f6 ] 46.[ B c5 ] White has a decisive advantage. A dazzling game by Ivanchuk. Hoped you enjoyed this.
 [ K b1 ] , [ N f5 ]  exchange with bishop or attack going to [ h4 ]  [ N x h4 ]  [ R h3 ] , [ N x f3 ]  and that all folks !!!! This is not a interesting way of wining BUT : What is interesting in this game is that my challenger go on playing and it was not so easy to win instead of taking his queen he has a very good attack t my castle ...the reason is that taking the pawn on [ h3 ] i have open the h colon. nd was a BIG STUPID BUNDER OF ME !
 [ B d2 ]  [ B g7 ] , [ B c3 ]  Ah forcing my hand I think. Could play [ e5 ] here but that seems to block my bishop for good and makes the fianchetto much less useful to me I think.
 [ B b7 ] , [ N b5 ]  ! Stronger. My weak 13th is punished yet again.
 [ B g7 ]  [ a6 ] , [ B f6 ]  29. [ B f6 ] - it is here that I throw in the sponge as there is no way of avoiding further material loss and my pieces are hopelessly tied up. A sorry tale! Joanne
 [ K g7 ] , [ g4 ]  39. [ g4 ] - now that I have consolidated my position the seed of a kingside attack is starting to germinate but will black be able to deal with what is coming if he sees it? Read on.
 [ b x a4 ]  [ R x a4 ]  [ R b3 ]  [ K d7 ] , [ c5 ]  Clever I cannot exchange the pawn. No problem.
 [ d4 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ N d2 ]  [ B f6 ] , [ R e1 ]  Maybe is better to exchange the rooks (14. Rxe8+) to gain a development move. The spirit of the Marshall is to open the game and play a pawn sacrifice for mobility and development. In this game Black didn't play at 100% and White could regain time remaining with a pawn up. After 14. [ R x [ e8 ] + ] [ Q x [ e8 ] ] the Black queen in [ e8 ] needs a second move to find a better place.
 [ R f3 ] , [ N e5 ]  29. ...... [ N e5 ] - hmm I was expecting Ne3.
 [ N g5 ] , [ O-O ]  7. ......... 0-0 - dealing with the minor piece pile up on my weak [ f7 ] pawn. Here we leave the database behind.
 [ K h3 ]  [ R x f1 ]  [ N x f1 ]  [ N f4 + ]  [ K g3 ]  [ N e2 + ]  [ K f3 ]  [ N c1 ]  [ R a3 ]  [ Q f6 + ]  [ K g2 ]  [ Q x h4 ]  [ N h2 ]  [ Q e1 ]  [ R a1 ]  [ Q d2 + ]  [ K g1 ]  [ Q x b2 ]  [ R x c1 ]  [ Q x c1 + ]  [ N f1 ] , [ Q c3 ]  the end...
 [ K x f7 ]  [ Q f3 + ] , [ K e6 ]  ? Not a good move. Better is [ K e8 ] when white has an advantage but the text move is very bad.
 [ B a6 ]  [ R a1 ]  [ R e5 + ]  [ K b6 ]  [ R x g5 ] , [ R h1 + ]  46. ..... [ R h1 + ] - white's only move is [ K g3 ] which will allow the pawn to crown on [ g1 ] with check. White therefore resigns on the grounds of ruinous loss of material. Black's rating is now 1682 and he will hopefully get to 1700. Well played black.
 [ c4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ d x e6 ] , [ B x e6 ]  Icelandic variation. At this point it is unlikely that black will regain his pawn soon but the head start in development often leads to quick control over the central files so that white will have to deal with a lot of pressure.
 [ O-O ]  [ N e4 ] , [ B e7 ]  He didn't see this move coming and this is completely wrong. Perhaps he never understood the goal of attacking d5?
 [ B g2 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d3 ]  [ N e7 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ h6 ]  [ B e3 ] , [ Q b6 ]  Probably too early to bring out the queen; she just becomes a target.
 [ R h8 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ K f2 ] , [ N g8 ]  Black wants to exchange Ns but...
 [ R a2 ]  [ Q b1 ]  [ R a4 ] , [ Q a2 ]  Seems mostly like a deliberate suicide move.
 [ a1 = Q ] , [ f8 = Q ]  53. f8/Q - both the a and f pawns crown but it is the pawn that crowns first that can do a hell of a lot of damage unless the pawn that crowns second crowns with check. If that is not the case then he who crowns first lands the first check which could be at best annoying at worst tragic.
 [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ a6 ]  This move leads to the Sicilian Najdorf a variation of the Sicilian with seemingly endless possibilities.
 [ K x g7 ] , [ R a7 + ]  Then I break the fork with a Zwischenzug.
 [ a4 ]  [ b4 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N x f6 + ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ Q d3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ R f d1 ] , [ Q e7 ]  I thought "I will lost a pawn but it doesnt matter because that pawn is a burden (i dont know if it´s the correct translation for 'lastre'). I prefer to open the d-column for a counterattack in the queen side (if i could do it)"
 [ R c7 ]  [ K f2 ] , [ K e5 ]  Releasing the pin on the c-pawn and coming across to defend the pawn.... or so I think.
 [ e5 + ]  [ K c6 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ N c7 ]  [ N x c5 ]  [ e6 ]  [ B f3 + ]  [ K b5 ]  [ a4 + ]  [ K c4 ]  [ b3 + ]  [ K b4 ] , [ c3 + ]  [ K x c3 ] would be mate I'm not sure if Freddy made a puzzle on it so I'm not going to show it. [ K a5 ] also leads to mate.
 [ N d4 ]  [ B x d4 ] , [ c x d4 ]  ?! 23. [ e x d4 ] is the right capture. After this move Black has 2 passed pawns and a open c-file.
 [ R d1 ]  [ N a5 ] , [ N d2 ]  [ c5 ] would further disrupt the K-side pawns. [ N d2 ] is too passive
 [ Q h4 ] , [ e5 ]  black shouldn't take as it causes problems but ..
 [ Q e6 ]  [ h3 ]  [ a6 ]  [ R f7 f3 ] , [ g6 ]  Black king in safety the black knight can move freely
 [ d5 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ N d2 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N g f3 ] , [ f6 ]  Black has created a weakness on the kingside [ c4 ] is in order at some point
 [ Q d7 ] , [ N d2 ]  Well I was going to move this now seeing that I'm not in a pin. I also learned that if a stronger players N is near his home square like this you often increase your advantages. I know of someone that increased his edge by doing that. Also although I didn't expect it so soon I anticipated that at some point black would play ...[ c6 ] so this move does overload my B. Another reason from what I studied why stronger players like to bring their N near the homesquare.
 [ N f6 ]  [ B c4 ] , [ N c6 ]  Znosko-Borovsky passes up the opportunity to test Mieses with 3...Nxe4. While it is generally considered harmless for White to take the Knight with 4.[ N x e4 ] Black gets back the piece back with 4...d5!. However white still retains a slight spatial advantage after this fork. However having studied his games I can safely assert that Mieses might well have been unafraid to do something 'different'. He might have essayed the Boden-Kieseritzky Gambit with 4.Nf3!? [ N x c3 ] 5.[ d x c3 ] or the extremely complicated lines beginning with 4.Qh5!? [ N d6 ] 5.[ B b3 ] [ N c6 ] 6.Nb5!? which lead to almost unfathomable tactics.
 [ g5 ] , [ d3 ]  This opens up the remaining bishop...
 [ e4 ] , [ c5 ]  I wanted to try a different opening this time. [ e5 ] is a pretty "classical" response and it leads to a more normal type of chess game. [ c5 ] is called the Sicilian defense and it leads to a different type of game. What happened in our game is pretty typical I traded my c-pawn for your d-pawn which is generally good for me because I potentially have more center control. On the other hand you got a pretty big lead in development and had more space to work with. In general the Sicilian is a "dynamic" opening which means that there are lots of imbalances in the position and different advantages for both sides. It's also pretty double-edged and often leads to complicated positions (like in this game).
 [ B f2 ] , [ K f5 ]  The final King invasion.
 [ Q d7 ]  [ d3 ]  [ a6 ] , [ N c3 ]  12. [ N c3 ] - whew that white steed is driven back by my pawn stab - a6.
 [ Q c6 ]  [ f3 ] , [ Q b6 ]  18. ...... [ Q b6 ] - the Wicked Witch of the West prevents castling because if I play 0-0?? now then Glenda drops to Rxc3+.
 [ R c8 ]  [ N g1 ]  [ c5 ]  [ b3 ]  [ N b6 ]  [ N h3 ]  [ N f5 ]  [ B x f5 ]  [ e x f5 ]  [ Q b2 ]  [ a4 ]  [ d x c5 ]  [ B x c5 ] , [ B h6 ]  Moving back to where it should have stayed all along now [ e5 ] threatens [ Q g7 # ]  [ Q x e5 ]  [ Q x e5 ]  [ R x e5 ]  [ N d3 ]  [ R e2 ]  [ N x c5 ]  [ R x c5 ]  [ b x a4 ]  [ N x a4 ]  [ R a b1 ]  [ R b5 ]  [ R b c1 ]  [ R c5 ]  [ R c b1 ]  [ R b5 ]  [ a3 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ R b3 ]  [ B d5 ] , [ R x b4 ]  Another wasted move on my part this makes my last move a waste of time.
 [ Q e7 ] , [ B x g6 + ]  I gain a piece! were even!
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ c4 ]  [ c6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ d x c4 ]  [ e4 ]  [ g6 ]  [ B x c4 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ h5 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ B e6 ] , [ O-O ]  Bad move of my part????Didnt see at all his bishop....
 [ B x g5 ] , [ Q x g5 ]  Now White has the potential for a quick kingside assault: hardly my intention when I played 21 ... [ N g4 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ N e3 ]  White's N hastens to the attack threatening Nf5+. Compare this steed with Black's hapless nag stuck on the edge at a6.
 [ Q c7 ] , [ Q d2 ]  preparing Bh6: always a dead end...
 [ R f c8 ] , [ c4 ]  Good move the pinned pawn is under pressure.
 [ R x b7 ] , [ B f5 ]  Skewering the queen to the c2-pawn.
 [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ g6 ]  The first time for a while I have faced up to the Yugoslav Attack as I don't have my books with me where I am living in Kazakhstan.
 [ K e6 ]  [ R h6 + ] , [ K x e5 ]  ...and I remove another threat...
 [ Q c8 + ]  [ Q d8 ] , [ Q x b7 ]  The same attentive reader who noticed 9. [ Q h5 + ] has pointed out to me the move [ B f7 + ] which I'm actually rather annoyed with myself for missing. Nethertheless Black's position does pretty much fold here so it's easy to see winning lines and not press in searching for alternatives
 [ f x g5 ]  [ N x g5 ]  [ a6 ] , [ Q f3 ]  That was why he sac'd the bishop howevr he earns a knight back out of it.
 [ B b4 ] , [ Q c2 ]  After having my knight pinned I immediately move my queen to c2. This became a very useful post for her and only later when I move off [ c2 ] does it open up problems for me.
 [ g3 ] , [ e5 ]  He cannot take it.
 [ R e1 ] , [ Q x b4 ]  9
 [ B e3 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ R a d1 ]  [ h5 ]  [ d4 ]  [ g4 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ B x e5 ]  [ f4 ]  [ B x c3 ]  [ b x c3 ] , [ R g8 ]  Taking the pawn would have set my queen and rook up for a fork by the bishop. Though this doesn't bother me as much as not being able to 0-0-0.
 [ R g3 ]  [ K h8 ]  [ N d6 ]  [ R e f8 ]  [ Q f3 ] , [ Q e7 ]  another Mistake:25 … [ Q e7 ] 26. [ Q a3 ] [ B b7 ] 27. [ R x g7 ] [ c5 ] 28. [ Q g3 ] [ R a d8 ] 29. [ Q g6 ] [ f x g6 ] 30. [ R x e7 ] [ B [ c6 ] ] 31. dx[ c5 ] [ K g8 ] 32. [ R x e6 ] [ B e4 ] 33. [ c6 ] Bx[ c6 ] 34. [ R x g6 + ] [ K h7 ] Best move was : 25… [ f6 ] 26. [ Q a3 ] [ Q h5 ] 27. [ f3 ] [ B c8 ] 28. [ N x c8 ] R[ a x c8 ] 29. ex[ f6 ] gx[ f6 ] 30. [ Q x a7 ] [ R g8 ] 31. [ Q x b6 ] [ R x g3 ] 32. [ h x g3 ] [ Q f5 ]  [ Q a3 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ R x g7 ] , [ Q c7 ]  the beauty is if 27...Kxg7.28.Nf5+and the black queen is trapped after 28...exf.29.[ Q x e7 ] and black under heavy attack.
 [ Q a3 ]  [ R f b1 ]  [ O-O ]  [ R b3 ] , [ Q a5 ]  14. .......... [ Q a5 ] - the Wicked Witch is driven back but she can swing over to the kingside.
 [ N g e7 ]  [ g3 ]  [ b6 ]  [ B g2 ]  [ B b7 ] , [ O-O ]  Fianchoto built white's developpement is completed.
 [ N b4 ]  [ O-O-O ] , [ K b8 ]  A one move threat and black is afraid of loosing his pawn on f7. However in my opinion this is a mistake. Nb6!?
 [ e4 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d4 ] , [ N f6 ]  I was trying a new opening out against a lower ranked player. A move to [ e5 ] would end up with my queen at [ d1 ] in a few moves not allowing a castle. I do not like playing the usual double kings pawn or queen pawn opening. Boring. I like the more unconventional opening. JEREMY
 [ N x f6 + ] , [ e x f6 ]  Another variation is [ g x f6 ] with further aggressive plans of attack.
 [ e4 ]  [ Q d1 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ R a1 ] , [ N d6 ]  at last the knight has made its way to a good square
 [ R c1 ]  [ Q a6 ]  [ B e5 ]  [ B x e5 ]  [ Q x e5 ] , [ Q d3 ]  If White's not careful I might get a Back Rank Mate.
 [ K x c4 ]  [ K a6 ] , [ K d4 ]  Freeing the c-pawn's advance
 [ R x d8 ]  [ Q f7 + ]  [ K h8 ] , [ N h5 ]  I threaten mate...
 [ N h5 ]  [ B e5 ] , [ R f3 ]  Looks to be a frightening storm on my king! Eep!
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ a6 ]  The Najdorf opening... very common on gameknot it seems I've had quite a few games with this opening already. Very difficult to understand everything though so I'm following the main line as long as possible.
 [ N f6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ Q x d4 ] , [ c5 ]  A favorite move by beginners threatening the queen with that pawn.
 [ Q f7 ]  [ R f e1 ] , [ Q x a2 ]  ?? Oh God no. 32...Qxa2?? 33.[ R e8 + ] [ R x e8 ] 34.[ R x e8 + ] [ K f7 ] 35.[ Q e1 ] is now virtually unstoppable.
 [ c x d5 ] , [ Q c3 ]  Alternative variation: 36... [ Q x a2 ] 37. [ N x f5 ] [ N x f5 ] 38. R[ g x f5 ] [ g x f5 ] 39. [ R f3 ] $16
 [ B e2 ] , [ B e8 ]  Black tries to activate his least active piece in the French defense.
 [ B x e4 ]  [ O-O ]  [ d5 ]  [ B b5 + ]  [ c6 ]  [ B a4 ]  [ b5 ] , [ B b3 ]  White has now moved the same piece three times in a row allowing black to develop his pawn structure.
 [ Q c7 ] , [ R e8 ]  the e file is the best place for the rook in many instances black gets great inituive based on [ B d4 ] and [ R e2 ]  [ R d1 ]  [ Q x e4 ]  [ Q x d6 ]  [ B d4 ] , [ R d2 ]  this is actually a desicive mistake however I had spent hours annalysisn the various positions and this was actually the one defence for white I had not thought of actually come think of it I think I had actually already dismissed this defence for white because of ...[ Q b1 ] however there had been long waits between the moves and I must have forgotten that by the time I played my next move.
 [ N d c6 ] , [ b4 ]  30. [ b4 ] - I do not wish to allow Na5.
 [ N h6 ] , [ g4 ]  Tempo #2: I advance my g-pawn and threaten to fork black's knights.
 [ K f7 ]  [ K g2 ]  [ f5 ]  [ f4 ] , [ R e8 ]  There were nothing in the c-file I guess.
 [ N e1 ]  [ Q c8 ] , [ N d3 ]  22. [ N d3 ] - Dave mirrors my plan of putting pressure on [ [ e5 ] ] and c5. I think Fou Lenoir and my f pawn could be up to the task of defending [ [ e5 ] ] though. [ c5 ] is already reinforced with a pawn on b6. All very solid.
 [ B b7 ] , [ Q d3 ]  Threatining mate with Nf6+!
 [ K e2 ] , [ N x b2 ]  34. ..... [ N x b2 ] - I can and now the black dsb drops off.
 [ N e3 ] , [ a4 ]  computer considers this as an inaccuracy because of 34 Nd5... that i didn't see...
 [ N x e6 ]  [ B c6 ]  [ N c7 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ B c1 ]  [ N x b5 ]  [ N x b5 ]  [ B x b5 ]  [ B x b2 ]  [ B x c4 ]  [ B x c3 ] , [ f4 ]  Now White can hang on to the extra pawn but it's not clear if anything can be done with it in an ending with opposite color Bishops.
 [ B e3 ]  [ B f8 ]  [ R h b1 ]  [ R a7 ]  [ a5 ]  [ R c a8 ]  [ K d3 ] , [ B x b4 ]  26...B:b4?? it seems i did a huge mystake here. I evalueted everything like a draw but as it happened i was wrong. My idea here was to put you in presure and without any chanses for losing to search and wait for your mystake.
 [ B d2 ] , [ Q d7 ]  .
 [ K c1 ]  [ Q a1 + ]  [ K d2 ]  [ Q x a2 ]  [ K d3 ]  [ Q a3 + ]  [ c3 ]  [ Q d6 + ]  [ K c2 ] , [ K g7 ]  Black doesn't want to give up any of his remaining pawns as it will then be hard to make any progress in the game. Note that material is now equal.
 [ g5 ] , [ g6 ]  ..black is safe and I think has the advantage from here....
 [ b3 ]  [ B c5 + ]  [ K g2 ] , [ a5 ]  The classical theme of 2 pawns controlling 3 - but still: With opposite coulored Bishops the draw is always terribly close.
 [ h5 ]  [ h4 ] , [ K g7 ]  Now it is a 'real zugzwang' as White has run out of pawn moves.
 [ R c8 ] , [ Q d3 ]  ...kind of provoking him so being uncoherent with my previous plan. [ R c1 ] is undefended. Still [ N x d4 ] is not completely bad.
 [ Q x c6 ]  [ Q c5 + ]  [ Q x c5 ]  [ B x c5 + ]  [ K f1 ]  [ a5 ]  [ B d1 ]  [ K f8 ]  [ g4 ] , [ K e7 ]  30 .... [ K e7 ] (With the queens off I now centralise my king)
 [ N c5 ] , [ e5 ]  sacrifices another pawn to open the e column now white has to deal with the threat on white's queen...
 [ K d7 ] , [ N x f6 + ]  Now he said "This is like my head kicking me in the gonads. Blunder after blunder and I still fail to see anything to really build upon. Before losing the queen I still felt like my position was defensible." While the game is now lost I decided to give Kevin some encouragement to prevent him resigning. Why? Because you learn by staying in the game even if it is a lost position. The idea is "Don't give up right away. Study the positions". So I decided that by staying in there was more that I could actually teach me student. In that I said Don't give up hope yet. That's because while it might appear lost sometimes you can pull a swindle which means draw or even win a lost game. And don't get upset with yourself because we're here for you to learn and making these kinds of mistakes is also a good learning experience for you. Another thing is that getting angry can lead to more mistakes so it's best to stay calm and see what else you can learn. That's one of the beauties of chess. I did this with the smiley face.
 [ N x e4 ]  [ f x e4 ]  [ R x e4 ] , [ B f5 ]  It's getting very dangerous. White not only threatens 16.[ R e7 ] but also 16.[ B e7 ] [ R e8 ] (16...[ R g8 ] 17.[ N g5 ] is bad for me) 17.[ N g5 ] threatening smothered mate. I need to disentangle my queenside pieces to get my knight over to [ c7 ] and let the rook [ b8 ] into the game. To be able to do that the queen must move but I cannot allow 16.[ R e7 ] [ Q d8 ] because of the bishop on g5. I thought about 15...[ B d7 ] but then 16.Be7. Now I force 16.[ R e7 ] and then my plan is to play 16...[ Q c8 ] (making space for Na6-c7-[ d5 ] cutting white's queen off and attacking e7).
 [ N b5 ] , [ R a4 ]  I left the other rook guarding the d column.
 [ R b8 ]  [ R x b8 ]  [ Q x b8 ]  [ b x c5 ] , [ Q b4 ]  I cannot recall exactly why I thought this was the better move vice Nxe5. I believe I wanted to pin his N.
 [ g x f3 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ Q a3 ] , [ c6 ]  blocking off my bishops claim in [ e8 ]  [ B a4 ] , [ Q g2 ]  I thought this move was blacks 1st error because hes forcing me to make a move i want to make anyway..
 [ R a1 ] , [ R d8 d7 ]  ?? Loses the rook to 29. [ c4 ] bx[ c4 ] 30. bx[ c4 ] and the rook is trapped. This is the move that lost Black the game. Better obviously was 29...R5d7.
 [ Q b6 ]  [ N c1 ] , [ N x e4 ]  Thats the tactic with black. Sacriface the knight with develop attack dangerously.
 [ B x f8 ] , [ K x f8 ]  And that makes me even on points.
 [ N x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ B x d4 ] , [ Q x g4 ]  Ah who needs Knights anyway? I ended up ahead one Pawn in the scuffle.
 [ N f3 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ] , [ N e7 ]  better [ N c6 ] [ N x c6 ] [ b x c6 ] [ b3 ] [ Q c7 ] [ f4 ] Nh6...
 [ N e3 + ]  [ K c1 ] , [ Q c2 # ]  
 [ R d e1 ] , [ Q x f5 + ]  33. .... [ Q x f5 + ] - so Glenda steals another pawn.
 [ c3 ]  [ B d6 ] , [ B c2 ]  So white can follow up with 10.[ N x e4 ] and 11.[ N d2 ]  [ c5 ]  [ B a4 ]  [ O-O ] , [ B x d7 ]  With this move white loses three tempi (the bishop has moved to [ d3 ] [ c2 ] [ a4 ] and [ d7 ] (four moves) to capture a black knight that has made just one move (to d7). It also gives black the two bishops and gets rid of white's best bishop (the one on [ c1 ] is still hemmed in by a phalanx of pawns on black squares ([ f2 ] [ e3 ] [ d4 ] [ c3 ] and b2) that aren't going anywhere in a hurry).
 [ B b2 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ] , [ d x c4 ]  Black opens the d-file however positional imbalances once recognized must be used. His hesitation in this game allows white to build up a devastating attack. More often seen are moves like ...[ N b d7 ] and ...Re8.
 [ N x f4 ]  [ d6 ] , [ R f1 ]  time to get a work on my open file.
 [ R h2 + ] , [ K c1 ]  He can play for promotion but I just don't think the game will last that long.
 [ Q x f7 ] , [ h6 ]  Black's momentum has finally slowed down enough for him to consider basic defenses such as luft.
 [ g x f3 ] , [ Q d4 ]  Trying to exzhange queens to soften the attack.
 [ R x e8 + ] , [ Q x e8 ]  14...[ Q x e8 ] I prefer taking with the Queen so my Knight stays on f6. This also keeps control of the open file and e5.
 [ N e5 ]  [ N g3 ]  [ N x d3 + ]  [ Q x d3 ] , [ b6 ]  Not wanting to develop my bishop to a position where i will have to retreat it if white starts a pawn advance.
 [ R e1 ] , [ B c4 ]  a very strong move. i think this is called an outpost.
 [ R x d4 ]  [ R x e1 ]  [ R d2 + ]  [ R e2 ]  [ R d4 ] , [ N x h5 ]  From here it is all about converting the advantage. The rest is without comment.
 [ N e5 ] , [ f4 ]  He can't afford to play [ R x c6 ] (yet).
 [ R g8 + ]  [ K e7 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ B g6 ]  [ N b5 ]  [ a6 ]  [ N x c3 ]  [ c6 ]  [ N a4 ]  [ B c7 ]  [ N c5 ]  [ b6 ]  [ N b3 ]  [ R a7 ]  [ h4 ] , [ N d7 ]  Mm I'm leaning towards [ B f4 + ] which lets the rook slide across more of the 7th rank unimpeded.
 [ Q d6 ]  [ a4 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ B x d5 ]  [ Q x d5 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ R e7 ] , [ Q d3 ]  19. [ Q d3 ] - escaping from the pin.
 [ h3 ]  [ B h5 ] , [ g4 ]  Now the computer gives me a whole pawn advantage!... but it doesn't last long :-( This is the start of a sustained attack on Black's kingside which I feel should have been more successful than it ultimately was whether due to Sheridan's defensive skills or my attacking errors remains to be seen.
 [ Q x c6 ]  [ d x c6 ] , [ d5 ]  !! Maybe not a difficult move for such a strong player as vortx but for more casual players this is worth noting: Black's terribly weak bishop must be activated even at the cost of a pawn. This move saves the draw.
 [ N h5 ] , [ N x h5 ]  Better is Nce4. Centralizing the Knight.
 [ R d1 ] , [ R e4 ]  Black counters by attacking White's weak pawn.
 [ N c3 ]  [ R e6 ] , [ f4 ]  25. f4?? - this move loses firstly the [ e3 ] pawn but more importantly Freddy's queen and KR find themselves caught in a knight fork!
 [ R x f1 + ]  [ K c2 ]  [ R x f2 ]  [ N a3 ]  [ B f1 ]  [ K b3 ]  [ R h8 ]  [ R a2 ]  [ R h h2 ]  [ N b1 ]  [ B c4 + ]  [ K a3 ]  [ B x a2 ]  [ K x a2 ]  [ R f x d2 + ]  [ N x d2 ]  [ R x d2 + ]  [ K a3 ]  [ b5 ]  [ c4 ]  [ R d3 + ]  [ K b2 ]  [ d x c4 ]  [ K c2 ] , [ B x b4 ]  
 [ R x e5 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ R x d4 ]  [ R f6 f2 ]  [ R d8 + ]  [ K g7 ]  [ R a5 ]  [ R c2 ] , [ a3 ]  (EL) Naturally since ...R(2)-[ B7 ] would have won the important QR pawn.
 [ B b6 ] , [ N g3 ]  Mieses consistently prepares for an assault on the King. Now 16...0-0? is poor since White has 17.Nf5! and 18.[ Q g4 ] with decisive threats on [ g7 ] and h6.
 [ N e7 ] , [ N a3 ]  Wonder why
 [ d5 ]  [ N e5 ] , [ N d4 ]  !?Deciding my Bishop is worse than my knight I sacrifice the Bishop embarking for the [ e6 ] square.
 [ R x b6 ] , [ Q e5 ]  ...with a nasty [ N e2 + ] threat. Of course it leaves my [ R c8 ] undefended which means I cannot take [ a4 ] for the moment.
 [ K c6 ] , [ R f3 ]  Meanwhile I attempt to target his [ c7 ] or [ h7 ] pawns.
 [ N e4 ] , [ B d3 ]  Developing my bishop and preparing to castle. I was expecting black to play 5. [ d5 ] here.
 [ N x a7 + ]  [ K d7 ] , [ R d1 + ]  White wants to keep the pressure on.
 [ d4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ f5 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ h3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e3 ]  [ c5 ]  [ c3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N b d2 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ O-O ]  [ g4 ]  [ f x g4 ]  [ h x g4 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ Q c2 ] , [ g6 ]  [ B d3 ] threats at once a deadly Bxg6.
 [ B h3 + ] , [ K e5 ]  now I'm in trouble. White has the ability to win the exchange with Re7+!
 [ d4 ] , [ d5 ]  I don't really like Queen Pawn openings but went with it
 [ d x e5 ]  [ N x e5 ] , [ R d g1 ]  Again preparing the pawn storm.
 [ O-O ]  [ N b d7 ]  [ f4 ] , [ h6 ]  Creating an escape square. I might need it for the bishop king or knight.
 [ b5 ] , [ N c5 ]  Back to my favourite square.
 [ d5 ] , [ B x c3 ]  ? This creates a fair few dark-squared weaknesses around black's king-side and all in exchange for a knight that wasn't really going anywhere. This will prove costly later. The doubled pawns are soon cleared. 13...[ e5 ] was maybe better; shutting the DSB in but at least keeping things closed.
 [ e x f5 + ] , [ K x f5 ]  ...and get the exchange freeing up mine and allowing me to pressurise his f-pawn.
 [ N f4 ] , [ Q x c2 ]  It was here that a strong move occurred to me.
 [ B e5 ] , [ a4 ]  White appears ready to push the queenside. [ b5 ] is impending.
 [ B x c3 ]  [ B x c3 ] , [ N e4 ]  =
 [ B e2 ]  [ d5 ] , [ N c3 ]  Developing and attacking the Q.
 [ B g2 ] , [ B d7 ]  My plan was to control the queenside and advance my pawns there but I thought 5... [ b5 ] was better then developing my bishop to [ b7 ] where it controls the important [ e4 ] square.
 [ R b1 ]  [ a x b5 ]  [ B x b5 ]  [ B x b5 ] , [ R x b5 ]  I'm still up a minor exchange and White's Pawn-storming attack has been neutralized. But now I have a weak pawn on the b-file. Defense will be a priority.
 [ R g7 + ]  [ K b6 ] , [ b x a5 + ]  He must take with the knight since otherwise I will take [ h5 ] after a check.
 [ N f3 ] , [ g6 ]  Black commits to a plan too early in the game. I haven't shown exactly what my plans are so Black shouldn't either.
 [ R x e2 + ]  [ R x e2 ]  [ K x e2 ]  [ a5 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ K c2 ] , [ g5 ]  My turn to throw a hammer on the g file.
 [ K f1 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ d4 ]  I like that pawn where it is thank you
 [ d6 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ O-O ] , [ O-O ]  Now have we both castled kingside and so far followed the theory.
 [ h3 ] , [ e5 ]  This is a mistake. 43...[ h5 ] was indicated. I also considered 43...[ R h1 ] and then: 44. [ K [ f3 ] ] [ R x h3 ] 45. [ K g2 ] R[ h5 ] 46. [ f3 ] [ K g6 ] 47. [ g4 ] [ R h4 ] 48. [ R c2 ] [ f5 ] 49. [ g x f5 + ] ex[ f5 ] 50. [ R c6 + ] K[ h5 ] 51. [ R x a6 ] [ R b4 ] 52. [ R a5 ] [ f4 ] 53. [ R a2 ] [ R b3 ] 54. [ K f2 ] [ K h4 ]  [ g4 + ]  [ K e6 ] , [ K d3 ]  Computer analysis: Inaccuracy: +2.00 » 45. [ K d3 ] [ [ f5 ] ] 46. [ K c4 ] [ R c1 + ] 47. [ K [ b4 ] ] [ R g1 ] 48. [ g x [ f5 ] + ] Kx[ [ f5 ] ] 49. [ K c5 ] [ R c1 + ] 50. [ K [ b6 ] ] [ R h1 ] 51. [ K x a6 ] [ R x h3 ] 52. [ b4 ] [ h5 ] 53. [ b5 ] [ h4 ] 54. [ b6 ] [ R b3 ] Best: +1.31 » 45. [ R c2 ] [ [ f5 ] ] 46. [ R c6 + ] [ K d5 ] 47. [ R x a6 ] [ f4 + ] 48. [ K d3 ] [ R x b2 ] 49. [ R a5 + ] [ K c6 ] 50. [ R a6 + ] [ K b7 ] 51. [ R x h6 ] [ R x f2 ] 52. [ K [ e4 ] ] [ R e2 + ] 53. K[ [ f5 ] ] [ e4 ] 54. [ R e6 ] [ f3 ] 55. [ R e7 + ]  [ K c2 ]  [ R h1 ] , [ R e3 ]  Another mistake by white allowing black to keep four connected pawns. He needed to play 47. gxf5+.
 [ e4 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ N e3 ] , [ e x f3 ]  As this is the consequence of playing 17.Bd2??
 [ R b2 ]  [ c4 ] , [ K f8 ]  I thought a lot about this move the alternative was [ N c5 ] to block the pawn but centralizing the king in the endgame is normally good
 [ Q x e5 ]  [ R g8 ]  [ K h2 ]  [ N d5 ] , [ B x d5 ]  no rocket science involved here...
 [ b6 ]  [ c2 + ]  [ K c1 ]  [ e2 ]  [ K d2 ]  [ e1 = Q + ]  [ K x e1 ]  [ c1 = Q + ]  [ K f2 ]  [ d2 ]  [ b7 ] , [ d1 = Q ]  And white resigned I hope that you liked that last little pawn tactic.
 [ N e5 ]  [ R x g7 ]  [ d7 + ] , [ K d8 ]  i'm slightly confident now.
 [ N c3 ] , [ R x a7 ]  Threatening 30 [ Q x f7 + ]  [ K g2 ]  [ Q d5 + ]  [ Q x d5 ] , [ N x d5 ]  The task is much easier for the black pieces now.
 [ K g8 ]  [ N d6 ]  [ R c3 c1 + ]  [ R x c1 ] , [ R x c1 + ]  31. ...... [ R x c1 + ] - I now force off white's remaining rook things get nastier and nastier for him.
 [ R f e8 ] , [ N f5 ]  With the black rook moving to the e-file I thought the possible opening of the e-file with [ f4 ] was no longer quite as attractive so I went ahead with [ N f5 ] which seemed like a great square for the knight with multiple possibilities that would create kingside weaknesses to dislodge.
 [ R a d1 ] , [ e5 ]  This would seem one of those instances where the saying 'Better a bad plan than no plan at all' is inappropriate. Once Black achieves his aim of getting a pawn center his position surprisingly becomes quite hopeless.
 [ K d8 ]  [ N x d5 ] , [ B f5 ]  Perhaps it might have been better to move the bishop to [ e6 ] and force me to move my knight? Moving the bishop to [ f5 ] invites me to move my knight to the [ e3 ] square protecting the [ c2 ] pawn and attacking the bishop.
 [ Q d2 ] , [ R c6 ]  Now Black's pieces are starting to be uncoordinated.
 [ Q c7 ]  [ N e7 + ]  [ K h8 ] , [ N x b5 ]  He takes another pawn that is now weakened and attacks my queen!
 [ R x f7 + ]  [ K h6 ] , [ R x e7 ]  and it is virtually over. The game was only interesting to show that 7. ... [ N c6 ] is not a good idea.
 [ Q d7 ] , [ e4 ]  I challenge the [ d5 ] pawn further.
 [ N x f7 ] , [ R x e8 + ]  Black has only one move
 [ Q d6 ] , [ Q e5 ]  intending after 31 ... [ Q c6 ] to set up a decisive advance of the pawn with [ e7 ] and [ R f1 ]  [ Q x e5 ] , [ d x e5 ]  now after 32 ... [ R h5 ] 33 Rd1!! [ R x g5 ] 34 [ e7 ] [ R x e5 ] 35 [ R d8 + ] [ K b7 ] 36 [ e8 Q ] wins
 [ B x f6 ] , [ Q h5 ]  The next sign of desperation. The queen switches to the enemy King's side where nearly no pressure is yet applied
 [ K b6 ] , [ N c3 ]  11. [ N c3 ] - I now deviate from my game against Master Freddy. I played [ N a3 ] there and it was suggested that [ N c3 ] was an improvement. Ah well let's try it!
 [ R d7 ] , [ N x f7 ]  I guess ..[ R d7 ] was to defend the [ f7 ] pawn but it doesn't work since once the rook moves off the d-file the bishop gets taken.
 [ K f7 ]  [ f5 ]  [ K f8 ]  [ K g4 ]  [ K f7 ]  [ K f4 ]  [ K f8 ] , [ R e6 ]  This allows my K to get in. White does not really want to play RxR because the position is locked up after gxf6.
 [ B x b6 ] , [ R x b6 ]  The endgame starts but it is not a draw.
 [ b6 ]  [ b4 ]  [ R g8 ]  [ b5 + ]  [ a x b5 ]  [ c x b5 + ]  [ K x b5 ]  [ R x c7 ] , [ R a8 ]  Hoping for a backrank #!
 [ K e7 ]  [ Q x h8 ] , [ Q e5 + ]  For some reason I decide to check him but I feel that it was a "wasted move" because this is just another burden. Therefore he can get out of check easily.
 [ b x a4 ] , [ K d3 ]  This losses fast. The only option was [ K d2 ] followed by [ K f2 ]  [ e4 + ]  [ K c2 ] , [ f4 ]  An error that also white to get back in the game. Black should have played [ K c4 ] forcing white in to a zugwieg.
 [ N x c4 + ]  [ K c2 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ R g7 ]  [ R c g8 ]  [ R e g1 ]  [ R x g7 ]  [ R x g7 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ B e4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ N e x d3 ]  [ R x f7 + ]  [ R e7 ]  [ R x f6 ]  [ h5 ]  [ N x c6 ]  [ R e8 ] , [ N x a7 ]  no rest for the wicked...
 [ Q x f3 + ] , [ K g1 ]  If [ K a2 ] black will play [ Q x a3 ] and after k[ g1 ] play Bc5.
 [ d5 ] , [ e x d5 ]  I might have waited before taking here.
 [ B x h4 ]  [ N x h4 ] , [ R a c1 ]  Just bringing the rook in with the threat of r[ c7 ] while black is fairly immobile.
 [ N x d2 ]  [ Q x d2 ]  [ Q x d2 + ]  [ K x d2 ] , [ B x e5 ]  In order not to lose a pawn on [ c6 ] but it loses one anyway.
 [ N c3 ] , [ N c6 ]  Being the dsb my strongest piece I don't want it to be exchanged or dislodged on [ e7 ] by Nb5. But if he plays it now I plan Bb8.
 [ h x g6 ] , [ N e4 ]  He attacks my DSB
 [ R e6 ]  [ R f1 ] , [ Q d5 ]  Pins the white knight to the King holding it there to give the rooks time to double up.
 [ c x d4 ] , [ R x d4 ]  Wins a Pawn and if the King moves off [ K B2 ] ...RxP winning a second Pawn would be threatened.
 [ g6 ]  [ B e3 ] , [ B g7 ]  will authorize me to castl king side which is not common in Najdorf
 [ B a5 ]  [ R d7 ] , [ R h c1 ]  Black resigns
 [ R c x f2 ] , [ R d7 + ]  white now sees the missed mate opportunity but black has already prepared an escape route
 [ N f6 ]  [ R c7 ] , [ R f8 ]  so here is a good move I'm going to fork him unfortunately it wont be enough I'm to late in the game
 [ N e4 ]  [ B e7 ] , [ B f4 ]  ! More pressure on the already cramped Black position.
 [ O-O ] , [ b3 ]  c4? [ B b2 ] and [ R e1 ] to add pressure? We will see.
 [ a6 ]  [ O-O ] , [ b5 ]  Black is executing his plan of attacking the queenside right away after making the obligatory [ N f6 ] [ B g7 ] 0-0. Although the center is techincally still dynamice in nature it is difficult to open it up since both sides have adequete control over it. Therefore a flank attack is totally acceptable.
 [ d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B e2 ]  [ e5 ] , [ O-O ]  7. 0-0 - an impressive white pawn centre Henry castled what more does a girl called Joanne want?
 [ Q x e5 ]  [ N x e5 ] , [ N a4 ]  when you have a material advantage always try to exchange and simlify into a winning endgame
 [ d x c4 ] , [ d3 ]  30. ..... [ [ d3 ] ] - Jim accepts the sacrifice and Delta pushes his d pawn to [ [ d3 ] ] where it backs up the [ [ b2 ] ] pawn. I think that next up is [ B a3 ] and if [ R x a3 ] then c1/Q+ comes next. The rook on [ [ b2 ] ] will be trapped so Jim resigns on the grounds of ruinous loss of material and Old Matey will not be too far away. This is an absolutely awesome result for Delta because Jim Friar is a very strong player and here are my past game stats against him - past games against therealjimfriar (won/lost/drawn): 0 (0%) / 7 (87%) / 1 (12%). Yup I think the Master Mater will be certainly quaking in his hiking boots if he ever comes across a Delta! Anyhow I hope you have all had a good read. Bye for now - Joanne
 [ K e8 ]  [ R x b7 ] , [ R b6 ]  Black makes this move purely out of frustration. This trade of rooks dooms Black
 [ g6 ] , [ c3 ]  takes away [ d4 ] as a potential square for the knight
 [ c5 ]  [ b x c5 ]  [ B x c5 ]  [ e6 ] , [ b4 ]  Now im looking to promote my pawns here on the queenside
 [ B d6 ] , [ N h5 ]  Oh my... the only defence and it doesn't work. Note black is having a better game ignoring the a pawns. The cost is to immobilize my [ R a8 ] who has to be ready to control [ a7 ] even after [ B f3 ] by white.
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N x e5 ] , [ d x e4 ]  
 [ Q d7 ]  [ Q x f4 ] , [ R d8 ]  Still tricky for white to win. He must play accurately. This is a good position to analyse
 [ K e4 ]  [ h5 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ b4 ] , [ h4 ]  As good a way as any to break up his only advantage the K-side pawn majority.
 [ N c6 ] , [ R b3 ]  I'm hoping to generate a K-side attack with the Q and R in conjunction with my well posted Knight and Bishop.
 [ a x b4 ] , [ a x b4 ]  i knew i could defend the [ b4 ] pawn that's why i let him take....
 [ c x d4 ] , [ N x d4 ]  Or [8.[ Q x d4 ] ?!] was possible but uncertain for advantage after [8...[ c5 ] 9.Qg4].
 [ N c6 ] , [ f4 ]  prevents e7-[ e5 ] and a prop for an eventual N at e5.
 [ R a b1 ] , [ B x h3 ]  White moves his a rook to [ b1 ] and I bring my LB to [ h3 ] to attack the rook at f1. This bishop will find this a good spot to linger a while and may be useful later on.
 [ N h3 ] , [ c4 ]  20. [ c4 ] - opens up a defensive battery on the [ f3 ] knight.
 [ K h2 ] , [ g5 ]  launching an attack against a well defended King.
 [ N g2 ] , [ f3 ]  limiting the white king. light squares are very weak at the white's side.
 [ K x f6 ] , [ R d7 ]  Black resigns at this point in the face of white's advantage. The a file will soon be opened up creating a passed pawn for white.
 [ e x f3 ] , [ Q c7 ]  trying to make something happen and regain a few of those lost points
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ B g5 ] , [ B f5 ]  Developing the problem bishop early.
 [ R e8 ] , [ K f2 ]  no need to hurry. This gets the King involved and covers the 2nd rank
 [ N b d2 ]  [ d5 ] , [ R e1 ]  There's no rush to play 8. [ e5 ] because if Black plays 8. ... de then 9. de emphasises that Black's pawns are on the wrong squares.
 [ d5 ]  [ K f2 ] , [ c4 ]  Again one does not normally cripple ones own majorities in this way and I subjected it to a bit of thought before playing it. Its purpose is to tie down White's Q-side. Right now Black is speculating upon what might be mined out of the [ b3 ] and [ d3 ] squares.
 [ B e3 ] , [ e6 ]  More agression with [ e5 ] seems interesting as well although it does allow white to take a jab at [ a7 ] via 9. x[ e5 ] Nx[ e5 ] 10. Bxa7.
 [ K c4 ] , [ g5 ]  I ignore the pawn.
 [ h3 ]  [ N h6 ]  [ O-O ] , [ O-O ]  Both castled. Inching long.
 [ B x b7 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ a5 ]  [ K c3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ B b5 + ]  [ K e7 ]  [ K b3 ]  [ K d6 ]  [ K a4 ]  [ B c6 ]  [ B x c6 ] , [ K x c6 ]  This game is now effectively over. White played a good game through to move 30 and just made a bad move. Throughout though Beans did a good job of capitalizing on my mistakes and protecting her territory.
 [ K f7 ] , [ Q f3 + ]  As white is down he must continually check otherwise black will establish his own attack.
 [ h4 ] , [ R a d8 ]  the threat is clear: after d7-[ d6 ] cx[ d6 ] Qx[ d6 ] the joke is on White...
 [ Q x d5 ] , [ Q x g6 ]  Mate threat restored since Black opened the position for me. My opponent resigned here as he is down a lot of material after the unfortunate combination but he could have played on for some time after 25...Qg8. White's options then include 26.[ B c4 ] and 26.Bxe5. Black might try 26...[ R c6 ] after the latter. Alternatively 25...[ Q c5 + ] renews the threat to win the [ c3 ] Bishop but after 26.[ K h1 ] Black can not stop the mate in one. Basically averting mate will leave a lost ending of pawns against pawns and two Bishops. An interesting game. White was never really better. Black made a mistake late and White was opportunistic however.
 [ h5 ] , [ B h3 ]  [ B h3 ] is the only safe place for my Bishop. I did not want to exchange Bishops because my Bishop had more attaching potential but if challenged I would have had no choice but to exchange them.
 [ N c3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ a3 ]  [ B x c3 + ] , [ b x c3 ]  So far so good... The English fortress is a mess...
 [ B h6 ] , [ B x h6 ]  Moderately forced as I'm in no mood to give black control of all those squares by retreating my Bishop
 [ B b3 ] , [ R a1 ]  add to the domination of the bishop and forces [ a5 ] as it threatens [ R a3 ] the idea is now to attack the blocked [ c5 ] pawn and then push the connected passed pawns if needed even maybe exchange the quality to assure the promotion of one pawn
 [ Q d4 ] , [ K g7 ]  yes my knight is now pinned but I couldn't come up with any other way to deal with the problems I plan on trying to trade queens in order to release the tension on my position.
 [ K b2 ]  [ B x h5 ]  [ R h8 ] , [ g4 ]  41. [ g4 ] - I start to run my kingside passers up the board now. This move protects Fou Leblanc and this now paves the way for my f pawn to head for Glendadom.
 [ R x f6 ]  [ N x f5 + ] , [ g x f5 ]  i calculated I preferred to pass two pawns though his pawn seems also passed. Actually his pawn is already lost.
 [ N e7 ] , [ B e4 ]  I do not want him to mate me with his queen and LSB so I decide to move my LSB and threaten him with 10.Bxd5.
 [ N e2 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ N c1 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ Q x e4 ]  [ Q x c1 ]  [ Q x e5 ]  [ Q c5 ]  [ B c4 ] , [ K f8 ]  Black is much worse. White's passed pawn should decide the game.
 [ d x e6 ]  [ e ]  [ p ]  [ + ]  [ K x e6 ] , [ R c6 ]  Not the best try for an advantage I think but it's hard to suggest an alternative move.
 [ N c3 ] , [ B d7 ]  Completing the standard Scheveningen formation: a compact and flexible platform for careful counter-attacking manoeuvres on either wing.
 [ Q d4 ]  [ N x c4 ] , [ Q x c4 ]  Now I no longer have the bishopspair so blacks position has improved I still have an advantage though.
 [ R b8 ] , [ Q x c6 ]  White thinks he's just won a piece but he in turn had overlooked...
 [ B x h7 ]  [ N x h7 ]  [ Q h5 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ N e4 ] , [ B b4 + ]  Again not the best move but could not be considered bad. Maybe developing a piece with [ N a6 ] would be okay even if it looks somewhat odd.
 [ K d7 ]  [ N x a6 ]  [ B x f3 ]  [ K x f6 ] , [ K d6 ]  White now has two extra pawns but he cannot stop Black obtaining counterplay by ... Kd5.
 [ b3 ]  [ c5 ]  [ R b1 ]  [ R b8 ]  [ c3 ]  [ b6 ]  [ B b2 ] , [ B b7 ]  10. .......... [ B b7 ] - both sides have now completed their development black has countered in the centre with [ c5 ] - I think the position is roughly equal but a few moves later that will all change and black's position (my own is about to go down south mega fast)
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ e3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ a3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ B g7 ]  His play seems very cautious.
 [ R x d1 ]  [ R f x f2 + ] , [ K g1 ]  I moved down because I was hoping that he would at some point need to get an extra move to get around my rook and he would forget all I needed was one move and I would steal a mate from him. Unfortunately He didn't fall for it. To be honest I didn't think he would But you can't blame me for tryin. lol
 [ R a4 ]  [ b5 ] , [ R a6 ]  White's third mistake. The rook can now be trapped.
 [ h4 ] , [ b6 ]  Gradually taking over more space on the Q-side and aiming to leave nothing for the White Bishop to go at.
 [ d6 + ] , [ K f8 ]  23. .... [ d6 + ] - alas that pawn can move forward. Henry is forced onto f8. If Kd7?? then Glenda falls next turn to a pawn fork (e6+).
 [ f x e3 ]  [ Q x e3 ] , [ b5 ]  A small tactical trick of my own: 34. [ c x b6 ] [ a x b6 ] and if 35. [ R x b6 ] then [ R a1 ] wins a bishop.
 [ R d1 + ] , [ K c8 ]  {If instead of the text move} 19...[ K e8 ] 20.[ Q c8 + ] [ Q d8 ] 21.[ Q x d8 # ] {at best for white or} 19...[ K e8 ] 20.[ Q c8 + ] [ N c8 ] 21.[ Q x c8 + ] [ K e7 ] 22.[ Q x h8 ] {...with big material gains for white. So the move is forced.}
 [ Q c2 ] , [ c5 ]  the anticipated pawn move.
 [ R x e6 ]  [ Q x e6 + ] , [ K h8 ]  Notice how the knight on [ d7 ] also prevents Black from using the Queen on the 7th rank for defense. I had actually planned on 24... [ K h7 ] 25. [ K g2 ] [ N f6 ] 26. [ R h1 + ] [ K g6 ] where Black seems to be able to have more adequate defense like a possible ...[ R [ h8 ] ] or ...Qf7. On [ h8 ] Black is driven to passitivity in the corner.
 [ b6 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ c5 ] , [ c4 ]  With the Pawn position on the K-side locked and Black's Q-side Pawns a mess I just need to invade with my Rooks.
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ d5 ]  [ b5 ]  [ c x b5 ] , [ e6 ]  I normally play the Benko gambit however I've previously employed it a couple of times against this opponent and he seems to do well against my normal sort of set ups so I thought I would do well to deviate. After having someone play this very gambit against me I immediately decided I liked the look of it and knew I would have to give it a shot some time. Its called the Blumenfeld gambit.
 [ B b2 ] , [ B f5 ]  In my opinion the fiancetto is wasted and accomplishes nothing with [ d4 ] blocked. I further build the pressure on e5.
 [ B x d5 ]  [ R x d5 ]  [ R e8 ] , [ f3 ]  I'm not in the business of being caught by those checkmates anymore! And 24... [ R e2 ] is countered by Rc5. I chose [ f3 ] over [ K f1 ] because it gives my king squares to move to (f2-[ g3 ] if need be) and [ R e2 ] isn't a threat with either move.
 [ c3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N b d2 ] , [ B d7 ]  Indecisive. This bishop might want to play on either side so [ d7 ] gives him options.
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ h3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ g4 ]  [ B e4 ]  [ N b d2 ]  [ B d6 ] , [ N x e4 ]  A dangerous move. I expected BxB with advantage by black.
 [ e5 ]  [ f4 ]  [ e x f4 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ d6 ]  Chess opening:vC34; KGA Fischer defence. My really weak part in chess is the opening game but after my first annotated game here at GK pointing out my limitations in the opening a master player kindly tipped me to use the game database(game DB) here at GK. This you will find as a option at bottom in the box of the game you are playing...
 [ R x e7 ] , [ a4 ]  NOW I am going to promote that pawn and the knight is STILL pinned!
 [ N f3 ] , [ B x d3 ]  (?) A third wave of attack! Surely Black can't get away with this? After 22.[ K x d3 ] [ R c8 ] 23.[ B b2 ] Qe4ch 24.[ K d2 ] or 22...Qe4ch 23.[ K d2 ] and Black has no further attack?
 [ K g3 ]  [ Q e5 + ]  [ f4 ]  [ Q e1 + ]  [ K f3 ]  [ Q d1 + ]  [ K g3 ] , [ Q x g4 + ]  he drops the [ g4 ] pawn
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N b5 ]  [ d6 ]  [ N b1 c3 ]  [ a6 ]  [ N a3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B g5 ] , [ B e6 ]  This move is not the usual move played in this variation of the Sicilian defence. Usual is 8...[ B5 ] 9 [ B x f6 ] [ g x f6 ] 10 [ N d5 ] whereby white obtains a small advantage. This is anyway not a bad move tough.
 [ R b6 ]  [ b x c3 ]  [ R x b7 ]  [ c x b2 ]  [ R b1 ] , [ N b c6 ]  a little better was Nec6...
 [ Q c7 ] , [ Q a4 ]  Threatening a2.
 [ R a6 ] , [ K h2 ]  I saw a 'neat tactical trap' so I played a poor move hoping he'd fall for it. I should really stop doing that so often! Now my king is less active and less able to aid in defence.
 [ c x d6 ]  [ b6 ]  [ a x b6 ]  [ a x b6 ]  [ K x h4 ]  [ b7 ]  [ K g5 ]  [ b8 = Q ]  [ K f5 ]  [ Q x d6 ]  [ K g5 ] , [ B e4 ]  Missing Mate in 4 with 52. [ B f3 ] [ K f5 ] (52... [ K h4 ] 53. Qf4+) 53. [ K d4 ] [ K g5 ] 54. [ Q e6 ] [ K f4 ] 55. [ Q g4 # ]  [ K g5 ]  [ K e3 ]  [ K g4 ]  [ Q g6 + ]  [ K h3 ]  [ K f3 ]  [ K h2 ] , [ Q g2 # ]  
 [ N a6 ]  [ d x c6 ] , [ b x c6 ]  This exchange sets the scene for the next passage of play much of which focusses on the b-file and especially control of b5.
 [ N d2 ]  [ R h7 ]  [ R x e5 ]  [ O-O-O ]  [ R c5 ]  [ Q h3 ]  [ K f2 ]  [ R f8 + ]  [ K e2 ]  [ R h f7 ]  [ d5 ] , [ Q h1 ]  Black tries forcing a trade.
 [ B f4 ]  [ R f2 ] , [ K h8 + ]  25. .... [ K h8 + ] - discovered check.
 [ K d7 ]  [ K e5 ]  [ K e7 ]  [ K f4 ] , [ R b5 ]  37. ....... [ R b5 ] - a rook lift I plan to put the rook on [ f5 ] next move to cut off the WK from my arc.
 [ e6 ]  [ B g2 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ O-O ] , [ O-O ]  According to the new - and great! - computer analysis on GK Black is a bit better here. I do not agree. White has a lot of options and the Black Bishop on [ c8 ] looks like dead meat behind his own Pawns.
 [ B x d6 ]  [ c x d6 ]  [ K f6 ]  [ d7 ] , [ K e7 ]  Black incorrectly agreed a draw in this position due to the line 44.d8=Qch [ K x d8 ] 45.[ K g2 ] [ K d7 ] 46.[ K h3 ] [ K d6 ] 47.[ K x h4 ] [ K d5 ] 48.[ K g4 ] -0-75 45......[ b5 ] -8.85 wins easily. Back to some endgame training it's obviously needed.
 [ Q c2 ]  [ B f5 ] , [ N e5 ]  Threatening [ f3 ] winning the bishop
 [ R x f6 ]  [ e x f6 + ] , [ K x f6 ]  Black gets a pawn for the exchange but white's rook has another file to play on and black's king is dragged more into the centre.
 [ h5 ] , [ g6 ]  Just about forced or else 21.g6! could become a real threat! [I don't think it was possible to play it straight away but once White starts getting pressure down the h-file this move would have to have been played anyway]
 [ K d7 ]  [ g4 ] , [ B f4 ]  I had to get my bishop out before I am forced to lose time doing the same thing later when his pawns are dangerously closer.
 [ N d2 ]  [ B x h1 ]  [ R x h1 ] , [ R a d8 ]  White's knight is pinned and black is exploiting this pin with this move as a general rule take advantage of a pin as quickly as possible!
 [ K a4 ] , [ h5 ]  White now has nothing left and ought to resign here. But he doesn't.
 [ c x d4 ]  [ c3 ]  [ d x c3 ]  [ N x c3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ e6 ] , [ B g5 ]  right here I was aiming to trap his [ N f6 ] by advancing my pawn [ e5 ]  [ h6 ]  [ B h4 ] , [ B b4 ]  I succeeded here by advancing the pawn and he countered with [ g5 ] I didn't want him castling
 [ B d2 ] , [ N b2 ]  Threatens 54. ... Nxc4. I don't think white can save the pawn. 54. c5? won't work. 54. Na3? won't work. 54. [ N e3 ] is met by 54. ... f4! and the knight won't be able to stay on e3. Nor does white have a counterattack that manages to save the pawn such as with 54. Bb4. Nothing seems to hold the pawn.
 [ Q g4 + ]  [ K b8 ] , [ e6 + ]  crazy little pawn :)
 [ N f3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ e3 ] , [ e6 ]  Good steady play so far!
 [ Q x f4 ] , [ B g2 ]  Keeps an eye on [ e4 ] but perhaps I should have considered Be2.
 [ e x f5 ]  [ e x f5 ]  [ B x f5 ]  [ g x f5 ] , [ B h4 + ]  what seems the only justification to sac a full piece...
 [ B g6 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ Q d6 ] , [ B d3 ]  Aiming to remover the defender of f7.
 [ a5 + ] , [ K c4 ]  Walking into the pin would have lengthened the game a bit and 14. [ K a4 ] gets ugly also - but just as well. Black now drives the point home.
 [ N f7 ] , [ R d3 ]  White has no hurry to move the knight to f5.
 [ e6 ] , [ e5 ]  ?? 20.[ d x e6 ] was necessary.
 [ N f3 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ h3 ] , [ B x f3 ]  ?! I'm not sure if this is a good move. It trades a bishop for a knight loses his only active piece and allows my queen to develop.
 [ B f4 ]  [ B x c5 ]  [ Q f6 ]  [ R f8 ]  [ Q g7 ]  [ R x f4 ]  [ Q g8 + ]  [ B f8 ]  [ Q x h7 ]  [ R g4 ]  [ g3 ]  [ B h1 ] , [ Q h3 ]  this when the game gets confusing and i start to make mistakes
 [ g x h2 ]  [ a8 = Q + ] , [ K e7 ]  Nor would 38...[ K d7 ] have saved the h-pawns: 38...[ K d7 ] 39.[ Q c8 + ] K-any 40.[ Q x c7 + ] ... 41.Qxh2.
 [ B x h6 ]  [ g x h6 ] , [ a3 ]  I have to chase away the knight before I begin my attack.
 [ a4 ]  [ K c1 ]  [ B c6 ] , [ K b1 ]  30. [ K b1 ] - Henry shuffles around in his castle at least he is safe (as safe as he can be against Freddy) for the moment. I do prolong the game beyond 30 moves which is what Freddy is encouraging us U1900s to do. Boy it is torture!
 [ K e7 ] , [ B e4 ]  I thought I needed to get the front 2 black pawns out of the way so looking to move [ d2 ] to [ d4 ]  [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ c4 ]  [ c6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ a6 ]  The Semi-Slav one of the most popular lines in the QGD. Black threatens to simply win a pawn and thus is forcing White to either play [ e3 ] and close his dark square Bishop in or to weaken [ b4 ] with [ a4 ] or to liquidate the center with cxd5. Old pundits claimed that [ a6 ] was premature and that it weakened the dark squares but recent practice has shown that Black gets a good game.
 [ N b6 ] , [ B f1 ]  Didn't want him to take my bishop so I moved it.
 [ N d5 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ N x e7 + ]  [ Q x e7 ] , [ Q c3 ]  The Queen retreats to the only available square. The queenhunt will position Blacks' pieces for an assault on the White King.
 [ R a d8 ]  [ Q h3 + ]  [ Q h6 ]  [ Q x h6 + ]  [ g x h6 ] , [ e4 ]  Despite being in time pressure the position is straightforward to play for white and all I needed to do was find natural moves for the next bit. (I obviously didn't play perfectly but I'm going to give fewer comments until the next major event).
 [ K h6 ]  [ g5 + ]  [ K h5 ]  [ g x f6 + ]  [ K h6 ]  [ h4 ] , [ g x f6 ]  ? Overlooking another pin on the 3rd rank. It was probably impossible to avoid imminent mate but to overlook the immediate was unforgiveable. If I'd played this knowing I was going to be mated next move I wouldn't mind ... At least he took a couple of minutes to see it himself!
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ] , [ B c4 ]  ? Bowlder Attack. Rather weak but popular among less booked players as it seems good. But it allows Black to take the center with tempo when he plays d5.
 [ e4 ] , [ d x e4 ]  Black gives up the center. With his already-cramped position this development is ominous.
 [ d x e5 ] , [ f x e5 ]  Now comes a moment of decision for Black. There are a few options worth considering getting the knight to safety but the Queen has the best play. White will also now have some burden in attempting to protect the e pawn.
 [ h5 ]  [ g x h5 ]  [ R x h5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N e2 ]  [ N b4 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ R d6 ]  [ a3 ]  [ N x c2 ] , [ N x c2 ]  I sure didn't see that move coming -- I don't see what his plan is yet. But one of the open principles is that the best way to refute a sacrifice is to accept it. (Sometimes)
 [ Q x f3 ]  [ R x e2 ] , [ d x e2 ]  black has forced mate in several lines.
 [ K c8 ]  [ B g3 ] , [ K b7 ]  74. ..... [ K [ b7 ] ] - Henry moves to [ b7 ] to stop a rook incursion.
 [ d5 ]  [ c4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ d4 ]  [ e3 ]  [ B b4 + ]  [ B d2 ] , [ d x e3 ]  All games start here.
 [ N f3 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ a3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ N g5 ] , [ B g7 ]  I set up the Dragon Variation.
 [ R c1 ]  [ R d7 ]  [ b3 ]  [ K g7 ]  [ K f2 ]  [ K f6 ]  [ K f3 ]  [ K e5 ]  [ K e3 ] , [ R e7 ]  Loosing attention and a Knight. Rook takes [ c6 ] with no check
 [ K f2 ]  [ R a3 ]  [ K g2 ]  [ R d3 ]  [ R f7 ]  [ R a3 ] , [ R h7 ]  And a draw is agreed upon. Forcing a rook trade via 45. [ R f3 ] also does not work because of 45...[ R x f3 ] 46. [ K x f3 ] [ K h4 ] 47. [ K g2 ] (47. [ K f4 ] [ K x h3 ] 48. Kg3) [ g5 ] 48. [ K h2 ] stalemate.
 [ R c8 ]  [ R x c8 ]  [ K x c8 ] , [ N h2 ]  He's backed his knight to protect against [ R f1 ] and Rf3. He has no attacks and need to advance pawns. [ N e4 ] attacks [ g3 ] and protect rook if I got to [ f2 ] to attack pawns on the other side. Do I have enough time???
 [ R x a3 ]  [ Q c1 + ]  [ K e4 ] , [ Q x a3 ]  Black is now clear material up but one slip and he'll lose this.
 [ K e2 ]  [ K e5 ]  [ R f4 ]  [ R d6 ] , [ h4 ]  A weak move better would be to use his active rook with either [ R g4 ] (threatening [ R g5 ] ) or [ R h4 ] (threatening the undefended pawn) although neither is particularly billiant
 [ N a6 ]  [ a3 ]  [ Q b8 ] , [ B d2 ]  11. Bd2?! - would [ b3 ] have been a better try here?
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B b4 ]  [ a3 ]  [ B x c3 ]  [ b x c3 ]  [ a6 ]  [ g3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ h3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ B g2 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ N h4 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ N e7 ]  [ d3 ]  [ b5 ]  [ a4 ]  [ b x a4 ]  [ B a3 ]  [ Q d5 ]  [ c4 ]  [ Q c6 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ Q x c4 ]  [ N f5 ]  [ N x f5 ] , [ B x f8 ]  Duh! moved in haste :0(
 [ R c7 ] , [ R x c7 ]  Trade 'im off Trade 'im off Trade 'im off!
 [ N b3 ]  [ b x c3 ]  [ b x c3 ] , [ R b8 ]  Black keeps the pressure on. [ N a5 ] is also interesting.
 [ K f6 ] , [ R f4 + ]  the first check
 [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ c4 ]  Theory says that this move is "bad". It was the first answer the defence was designed against.
 [ N x e1 ] , [ B x c3 ]  a forced sequence and here is the pawn
 [ B c4 ] , [ d6 ]  I feel like there could have been an attack on [ f7 ] looming. Comment please as I do not play [ N f6 ] for quite some time.
 [ N x a1 ] , [ R x a1 ]  [ B d1 ] may have been slightly better.
 [ N e6 + ] , [ K b6 ]  10. ..... [ K b6 ] - Steve's king is drawn into open waters can I take advantage of this?
 [ c3 ]  [ b x c3 ]  [ b x c3 ] , [ R f b8 ]  Black grabs the other open file while we stand off on the a-file neither one of us wishing to capitulate it.
 [ Q x b7 ] , [ h x g5 ]  Trade but now my kingside is blown open.
 [ d4 ] , [ f5 ]  Bird's.
 [ b4 ] , [ Q c7 ]  This move serves a couple of purposes 1 it supports the b c and d pawns and also keeps it's gaze on h2..
 [ R f e8 ]  [ Q b1 ]  [ b4 ]  [ a x b4 ]  [ c x b4 ] , [ N a4 ]  It was here I started to smell blood. My physical chessboard and I spent almost 10 minutes analysing every move from here on in
 [ K e3 ]  [ B e5 ]  [ K f3 ]  [ K g7 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ N f7 ]  [ h4 ]  [ K f6 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ B x f4 ] , [ K x f4 ]  Great! I ended up with BK end game which turns out to be the hardest one. Even BB although still not easy is easier than BK.
 [ B g8 ] , [ R g2 ]  Still giving protection to the pawn. But seeing that he played this as opposed to 48...[ g5 ] I'm not ready to resign yet. If however he had and does decide to advance his pawn a square further that's when I'll resign.
 [ O-O ] , [ B x f6 ]  Another blunder by white trying to earn a pawn totally ignoring the e-file attack.
 [ Q d2 ]  [ B x e6 ] , [ a3 ]  Useful move. Limits the knight on [ c6 ] but also the pawn on [ [ a2 ] ] may need protection. Strange thought? Not at all. Think of c2-[ c4 ] thrust and if black captures I play d4-d5. But I need a rook on [ [ d1 ] ] for that. Take the rook from [ a1 ] and the [ [ a2 ] ] pawn will be defenceless. But also I don't know at this stage where would be the best position for the rook - [ [ d1 ] ] or e1. So it is also a waiting move. Let's see what black has in mind.
 [ N d3 ]  [ K f8 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ K e8 ]  [ N x g6 ]  [ K d8 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ R x g3 ]  [ Q x g3 ]  [ K c8 ]  [ N c4 ]  [ R d7 ]  [ Q f3 ]  [ K b7 ] , [ N e5 ]  Black's idea is to try counter-play on the Queen-side but White's Queen has superior control on the board.
 [ B b5 ] , [ Q x e3 + ]  Black wins a Pawn checking my King.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ f6 ]  Haven't actually played against this opening before but I've heard it's weak. I proceeded with what seemed obvious.
 [ K b2 ]  [ a6 ]  [ a4 ]  [ B f7 ] , [ b5 ]  19. [ b5 ] - Just like Old Man River those queenside pawns just keep on rolling they keep on rolling they keep on rolling along!
 [ N f6 ]  [ d3 ]  [ e5 ]  [ B d2 ] , [ N c6 ]  Peeking at the [ d4 ] square with the Knight where it will eventually arrive for a brief moment resulting in some extremely peculiar pawn structure
 [ K g4 ]  [ Q f6 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ Q g7 + ] , [ K f4 ]  Black resigns. This game is notable for the march of the White King during the final stage. It is an instance of the King becoming a fighting piece even while the Queens are still on the board.
 [ e6 ]  [ O-O ] , [ h6 ]  I won with a pawn storm on the kingside. Trying to remember the moves...
 [ R a1 ] , [ K f2 ]  My King has to defend the K-side squares.
 [ Q x b5 ] , [ a x b5 ]  Exchange. I could not take it with my knight as I would lose a pawn. ...Rxc2. This move doubles my pawns up but also opens up the a file.
 [ e x d4 ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ B x f3 ]  [ B x f3 ] , [ N x d4 ]  After that exchange i am a pawn up!!!
 [ O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ B g5 ]  [ N b d7 ] , [ Q c2 ]  the D row will be very powerful for white.
 [ Q x f3 ] , [ b5 ]  And now this boots the knight giving black his space advantage after all! (It's a nice feeling to set a goal and succeed!)
 [ K d3 ] , [ N e7 ]  With an attack on the Bc6. During this ending I was aware of two key strategic ideas: if Black can trade his knight for either the light or dark sq White Bishops his position will immediately improve. Best of all would be knight for dark sq Bishop (leaving B's of opposite colour). Hence this move hoping against hope that the attack on the undefended light-sq Bishop would provoke 42. Bxe7(?). No such luck.
 [ Q e3 ]  [ B x f1 ] , [ K x f1 ]  IT'S YOUR TURN
 [ a6 ] , [ B e2 ]  ...and I develop my bishop to the second rank to free the rook allow my rook to contest the open file and keep the bishop out of harm's way...
 [ N x e5 ]  [ Q e6 ] , [ f4 ]  Nice place for my knight.
 [ h5 ] , [ B a6 ]  Black is trying to beating me at my own style. This is becoming very fun.
 [ b3 ]  [ N c2 ]  [ R a2 ]  [ N d b4 ] , [ R a4 ]  What about 20. Rb2?
 [ R d4 ] , [ B b3 ]  OOther thoughts at the time were [ b3 ] to protect the bishop but didn't play that as it would allow [ Q x c3 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ B a4 ]  [ R d8 + ]  [ K e2 ]  [ B c4 + ]  [ K e1 ] , [ N d3 + ]  Overall I felt a very weak game by me I don't think I have played the paleface attack before and certainly am not comfortable with the positions that I got myself into. I think if I had played differently at move 3 the game could have been a stronger one by me well played elyhim
 [ g5 ]  [ R a3 ]  [ R x b6 ]  [ R a7 ]  [ R b2 + ]  [ K f1 ]  [ f5 ] , [ R h7 ]  White reduces the material deficit to just one pawn but the time required to take the h-pawn allows Black to roll his pawns forward.
 [ N e4 + ]  [ K g1 ] , [ Q g4 ]  14. ..... [ Q g4 + ] - here comes the Wicked Witch. She wants to go to [ f3 ] and then [ g2 ] delivering mate. I play my knight to [ f4 ] thinking I had covered everything but ......
 [ c4 ]  [ c6 ]  [ c5 ]  [ B c7 ] , [ b4 ]  I dared to close the center now I have to keep some possibility of life for my lsb on b5. I've not compromised my kingside yet so no real reason to keep the Qside static. I'm grabbing space for sure.
 [ Q a6 ]  [ e5 ] , [ R f e8 ]  Thought I play this as last roll of the dice hoping for big mistake by white. If he takes [ d6 ] Bishop with e pawn I win but if he takes with Queen I loose. Since I am about to loose anyway decided to take the gamble. In hindsigth I'd have been better battling on and trying to win a few pawns back.
 [ Q d3 ] , [ B a5 ]  forced
 [ R x b3 ]  [ R a1 + ]  [ K f2 ] , [ d4 ]  i bet my house he is gonna take the pawn!!
 [ N c7 ]  [ b4 ] , [ N f4 ]  Black starts to roll a king side attack. I'd gladly give up my bad light squared bishop for this knight.
 [ O-O ]  [ O-O ] , [ B g5 ]  a minor distraction...
 [ b6 ] , [ Q e1 ]  a beaty!
 [ K h8 ]  [ R e2 ]  [ Q g6 ]  [ R d e1 ]  [ R f4 ]  [ g3 ] , [ R f7 ]  And once again Black retreats to come up with a different plan of attack.
 [ c6 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ Q a5 ] , [ O-O ]  Moving the queen out was foolish when the attack is so easily defended by a castle. I now have a partly open board on the left side and a back rank clear of material[with my king on the outside rather than in. This means i have developed 6 pieces and have them all in play. He only has a knight queen and rook in play and needs to develop them fast lest i can push my material advantage.
 [ Q h5 ] , [ N h6 ]  Oh right...yer one of these guys. Make a note of this. Whenever you are forced with this brutish opening always bring yer queen to e7. I did not and look what happened! ......................................................................................... dmaestro wrote: Qh5?! followed by Nh6?...when simply [ N c6 ] leave Black with an excellent game. 2...[ Q e7 ] is ok but doesn't really do much to explain why white's second move isn't taken seriously. ......................................................................................... Thanks for the suggestion I will use [ N c6 ] in the future I like that. The reason this move cannot be taken seriously is that he brought queen out early and he lost it. There is a reason masters are masters and a reason why they choose not to immediately pull out the bazooka and start blasting before a single pawn has been dropped.
 [ Q x d5 ] , [ N c7 ]  ?? This just leads to a lost game
 [ B b4 + ]  [ N c3 ]  [ Q f6 ] , [ N g e2 ]  Protecting my knight and making room to castle.
 [ Q x d6 ] , [ O-O-O ]  Finally I have finished development I felt a little safer now and felt that it was only a matter of time now due to the weaknesses in black's position (in reality we were still about equal my only advantages being positional)
 [ e4 ] , [ d5 ]  ..Scandavian....looking to not get into a Sicilian for a change and see what happens...
 [ e5 ] , [ c5 ]  transposes to a French defence advance variation if [ e6 ] is ever played
 [ N f3 ]  [ b5 ] , [ B d3 ]  Since [ b4 ] isn't a real threat there is no need to weaken to Q-side with moves like [ a3 ] giving my opponent opportunities to open lines there. Especially since I planed to castle that way in a bit.
 [ Q h4 ] , [ N x f4 + ]  Yet he blocks
 [ B d8 ]  [ h6 ]  [ B x h5 ]  [ g x h5 ] , [ a6 ]  now a new threat: the a-pawn will promote if I don't stop it. I have a choice: swap or advance my b-pawn which would probably be followed by 26. [ R d7 ] (or maybe 26. [ B x f6 ] followed by 27. Rd7)
 [ R x g1 + ] , [ R x g1 ]  Not [ B x g1 ] or it will be pinned with Rh1.
 [ K x h5 ]  [ K f4 ] , [ K g6 ]  Kg6- Just keep the king in front of the pawn and he is home free.
 [ f x g4 ]  [ N x g4 ]  [ K g6 ]  [ N e3 ]  [ K h5 ]  [ g4 + ]  [ K g6 ]  [ f5 + ]  [ K f7 ]  [ f6 ]  [ B f8 ]  [ K c2 ] , [ B h6 ]  ! Preparing to trade down if allowed.
 [ B d5 ]  [ Q b5 ]  [ R b8 ] , [ Q c5 ]  [ Q a5 ] leads to the same continuation
 [ Q h7 + ]  [ K f8 ]  [ N e4 ] , [ N e5 ]  Bringing pieces to my Kside. [ N g6 ] will cause problems to his Q.
 [ N c3 ] , [ Q h4 ]  Not sure what that was for. Like pinning [ f2 ] or something?
 [ Q x c5 ]  [ f3 ]  [ g3 ] , [ Q d7 ]  Trying for [ e5 ] followed by [ Q x h3 ]  [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ] , [ e5 ]  The Budapest my choice for testing.
 [ a4 ]  [ Q d5 ] , [ R a3 ]  My queen blocks the liberatory pawn move [ d5 ] and will come into action when unstoppable. Here begins a nice fight.
 [ N x e5 ]  [ Q e7 ]  [ d4 ]  [ d6 ]  [ N d3 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ Q e2 ]  [ d5 ]  [ f3 ]  [ N d6 ]  [ Q x e7 + ] , [ B x e7 ]  well that was a rather boring opening I ain't playing it again!!
 [ N c3 ] , [ R b e1 ]  Counterattacking the Q in an attempt to regain the initiative.
 [ e4 ] , [ e5 ]  Oh boy! King's pawn! My favorite opening! ......................................................................................... ruachessnut2: Do not comment. This game is in progress! ......................................................................................... Are you a mod or something? Because if not...I don't care.
 [ K x h2 ]  [ g x h5 ]  [ K h1 ]  [ a5 ]  [ b x a5 ]  [ Q e7 ]  [ a6 ]  [ h4 ] , [ K h2 ]  I think black looks somewhat stronger here but they agreed for draw after next move.
 [ B g6 ] , [ h4 ]  White is continuing now with an aggressive pawn storm with zero pieces developed! He hopes to blow black off the board entirely. Black has two responses [ [ [ [ h5 ] ] ] ] or h6. But [ [ h6 ] ] is not nearly as good as [ [ [ [ h5 ] ] ] ] because [ [ h6 ] ] is extremely passive while [ [ [ [ h5 ] ] ] ] allows black to fight back. I saw a video of this position where a grandmaster stated (but not a 'super' grandmaster) that [ [ [ [ h5 ] ] ] ] was good for black. Fritz agrees.
 [ a3 ]  [ N d5 ] , [ Q f3 ]  A good square for the queen in this position hitting [ f7 ] (weak) and the b pawn indirectly. ...[ B c6 ] goes nowhere after [ b5 ] (which drops a minor for black)
 [ O-O ]  [ B e2 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ c x d4 ] , [ Q a5 + ]  The sharpest answer. Black snatches a pawn at the cost of a few tempos. The alternative is playing 9...[ N c6 ] but that leads to a difficult middlegame for Black. I had the opportunity to play that line against ksasidhar and annotate my relatively fast win with the White pieces.
 [ d4 ] , [ c5 ]  The Old Benoni Defence. I have to admit I have never seen this before and use the database as a guide to the opening. Here is the computer analysis. http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=19349318&rnd=0.7766292316901995
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d4 ] , [ B g4 ]  It starts right away. A very aggressive variation of the Philidor.
 [ R e1 ]  [ B x e2 ]  [ Q x e2 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ B d2 ]  [ c5 ] , [ d x c5 ]  Leaves his knight hanging.
 [ N c6 ]  [ O-O-O ]  [ B d7 ] , [ f5 ]  A strong move to undermine the black center. Taking on [ f5 ] will be a positional victory for white as the black center is heavily weakened.
 [ R f5 ]  [ R e3 ] , [ a5 ]  33. ....... [ a5 ] - a move to try and break up my queenside pawn structure.
 [ N c3 ] , [ d5 ]  With this move we're in familiar territory. Although it didn't transpose into the Scandinavian Defense since the N aren't out in that defense until we exchanged I'll treat it like it did since this is my style. This means that we're going to exchange pawns.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ c3 ]  Ponziani's Opening is not seen very often although it isn't bad if white doesn't mind letting black equalize easily.
 [ K f8 ]  [ Q e4 ]  [ Q b5 ]  [ B c6 ]  [ R x d1 ]  [ B x b5 ]  [ R x e1 + ]  [ Q x e1 ]  [ R c1 ]  [ Q x c1 ] , [ B x c1 ]  After much blood shed... only Frederick the third and other 1/2 and his opposing counterpart remain along with the noble king and his soldiers...
 [ B h4 ]  [ R f e8 ]  [ R x e7 ]  [ R x e7 ]  [ Q x e7 ] , [ R e8 ]  19......... [ R e8 ] - It does seem as though I will lose that pawn but the Wicked Witch of the West is trapped! However Bob gets enough material for her worse luck!
 [ B b5 ] , [ Q b2 ]  Black has developed a threat of his own: a double attack on [ b5 ] and g2. What should White play here?
 [ Q d6 ] , [ R x b7 ]  Resigns. If you have suggestions or improvements please comment.
 [ N f3 ]  [ B h3 ]  [ Q f1 ] , [ Q x f1 + ]  being ahead on material I had no major issue with exchanging queens
 [ R a8 ] , [ R b7 ]  It's a pity after [ K x c7 ] I had a surprise axb8=B+!? and black should capture...
 [ N e d4 ]  [ e5 ] , [ B c3 ]  Finally black resigns the Queen is trapped and will soon be lost plus there are threats of [ Q x a8 ] and [ Q c8 + ] and all sorts of stuff. Hope you enjoyed thank you!
 [ B x f6 ]  [ B x h6 ]  [ Q e8 ] , [ Q c2 ]  Black's rook is en prise but he chooses to chase away my queen. I could exchange the royal ladies but as I've noted before black likes early and frequent exchanges so when I play him I like to keep things lively and avoid exchanges even when I'm a pawn up and exchanging would be the smart thing to do.
 [ N x f5 ] , [ K e2 ]  Takes the opportunity to extricate himself from an extremely bad spot.
 [ h3 ] , [ f4 ]  fearless...
 [ O-O ]  [ B d7 ]  [ R e1 ] , [ N f6 ]  By the way we don't need any calculation since it is all theory.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ] , [ N f3 ]  My friend wants to eat my [ e5 ] pawn. He likes Ruy Lopez openings.
 [ N c4 ]  [ R x g5 ]  [ g4 ] , [ Q e6 ]  Threatens the knight and also forking the rooks among all kinds of other threats so white resigned. Actually after the pawn sacrifice on [ b7 ] it was a very easy game to play and you could say that the game played itself out.
 [ K c6 ]  [ Q x a7 ] , [ b6 ]  here I feel quite comfortable though I don't' have to commit any mistake and precipitate my attack. So looking the board I said I need to stop theses pawns advance and consequently his king and if another Forrest make another marathon it will done.
 [ Q e2 ] , [ Q a1 # ]  Checkmate balck wins
 [ Q x d6 + ]  [ K b7 ] , [ h6 ]  Now the passed Pawn becomes the final weapon Swiderski needs for victory.
 [ B x a1 ]  [ e x d5 ] , [ c x d5 ]  This pawn exchange suits me as well as it opens up the a1-[ h8 ] diagonal for my other bishop. Even though I'm the exchange down this attack almost plays itself for white.
 [ e3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ B b5 ]  Is Mr. Kitrich prepared to relinquish his light-squared bishop given the likely weakness of d3?
 [ Q x h8 + ]  [ K b7 ] , [ R f c1 ]  Only square to save the rook and not being ennoyed the next move (if 21. [ R e1 ] Nc2) The other candidate move was 21. [ f x e3 ] [ Q x e3 ] + 22. [ K h1 ] [ Q x e2 ] - white looses one pawn and has a worse position.
 [ c4 ]  [ g6 ]  [ g3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ B g2 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N e7 ]  [ d3 ]  [ c6 ] , [ e4 ]  Blocking the diagonal of the fianchettoed bishop as Keene points out in "Flank Openings" the whole concept of erecting the structure c4-d3-[ e4 ] "is based on one of Nimzowitsch's ideas: White holds the centre under restraint and prepares the flank advances [ f4 ] and b4" However unlike positions with the queen's knight developed on [ c6 ] when the choice of White's central pawn formation would be merely a matter of taste Botvinnik is practically forced to adopt his customary set-up here as Black was threatening to ply ...[ d5 ] under favorable conditions. Kotronias
 [ R c4 ]  [ R e3 ]  [ R c1 + ]  [ K f2 ] , [ N d7 ]  P[ e5 ] was lost indefensible. But this of course is even worse.
 [ h5 ] , [ N a4 ]  King side is defended solidly so I decide to attack his Queenside.
 [ B x e5 ]  [ R f5 ]  [ R b e1 ]  [ R x g5 + ]  [ K h1 ] , [ R d1 ]  ? R and B for a rook? Oh right R[ x B e5 ] makes it a nice bloody exchange ending with black up two pawns of increasing value.
 [ e4 ]  [ g6 ]  [ d4 ] , [ d5 ]  I'm not femiliar with that opening. at first look it seems to be not so good for black (3. [ e x d5 ] [ Q x d5 ] 4. [ N c3 ] and the black queen is chased over the board).
 [ K e5 ]  [ K x c2 ]  [ K f5 ]  [ K x d3 ]  [ K x g5 ]  [ c2 ]  [ K f6 ]  [ c1 = Q ]  [ g5 ]  [ Q c8 ]  [ K g7 ]  [ K e4 ]  [ g6 ]  [ K f5 ]  [ K h7 ]  [ K f6 ] , [ g7 ]  next is my Q on 7th line... it is over...
 [ B x e4 ]  [ N x e4 ] , [ Q x e4 ]  ... but black's cavalry gets routed and completely annihilated in melee
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ a6 ] , [ c4 ]  Alternative variation: 5. [ B d3 ] [ N f6 ] 6. O-O [ Q c7 ] 7. [ Q e2 ] [ d6 ] 8. [ f4 ] [ N b d7 ] 9. [ c4 ] [ B e7 ] 10. [ b3 ] O-O 11. [ B b2 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ N c2 ]  Alternative variation: 7. [ N x c6 ] [ b x c6 ] 8. [ N c3 ] [ d5 ] 9. O-O
 [ d x e5 ] , [ B c5 + ]  I looked at Ng3. White can not take [ h x g3 ] for [ f x g3 ] will lose the Q. But 15. [ K g2 ] works for white still attacking 2 pieces. Not 15. exd6? [ Q x h2 ] 16. [ Q g2 ] [ Q x g2 ] 17. [ K x g2 ] and maybe equal play?
 [ B g7 ]  [ d4 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ g x h5 ]  [ B x f5 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ B x f5 ]  [ N x f5 ]  [ h6 ]  [ B e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ c6 ]  [ Q e2 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ Q e6 ]  [ Q d7 ]  [ Q x g6 + ]  [ K d8 ] , [ B d2 ]  a have my advantage.
 [ e5 ] , [ N g5 ]  This is the strong point. Black cannot play exB because of Bxh7+.
 [ f4 ] , [ f5 ]  Stops White dead in his tracks.
 [ K h8 ] , [ N x e5 ]  Threatening mate 30. N-f7ch Kg8. 31. N-[ [ h6 ] ] dblch! Kh8. 32. Qg7ch [ R x g7 ] 33. N-f7!!! choked mate. Black will also lose his queen because after 29. ... [ [ h6 ] ] 30. Ng6ch forked the king and the queen on h4. Also 29. ... [ R x e6 ] 30. [ R f8 ] mate. Black is in a lot of trouble.
 [ N f6 ] , [ O-O ]  Here I had to watch out for jokes with [ R e1 ] after 8.... [ N x e4 ] but I can defend everything and I don't think 10. [ B f1 ] would do any good.
 [ N c3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ B e3 ]  This set up is recommended by Lev Alburt and Roman Dzindzichashvili in their "White Openings Explained: winning with 1.e4"
 [ Q a3 ] , [ Q b5 ]  Now I am a pawn down but I do have some compensation. My bishop is much better than his knight my pieces are in attacking positions. Of course being a pawn down I don't want to exchange queens. Computer agrees with me but gives advantage to White.
 [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ d x c4 ]  [ B x c4 ]  [ B b4 ]  [ a3 ]  [ B a5 ] , [ b4 ]  I was planning on castling on the king side so I did not hesitate to advance my pawns with tempo.
 [ d4 ]  [ e4 ] , [ N d2 ]  I think better move here would be [ h4 ] temporarily halting a push of my pawns to his king.
 [ N f6 ]  [ d3 ] , [ N c6 ]  3. ..... [ N c6 ] - out come two black steeds.
 [ Q x b7 ]  [ Q e2 ] , [ Q d7 ]  good thinking: now black is on the move... And late I realize my king is not so cool
 [ e6 ] , [ N f3 ]  getting ready to castle and control f file with my rook
 [ g5 ]  [ N d7 ] , [ B e3 ]  F4 is too ambitious for as it leaves serious holes in front of my king. Having just played G5 I bought myself a little sliver of time to devlop and defend.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ c3 ]  [ N x f3 + ]  [ Q x f3 ]  [ Q f6 ]  [ Q d3 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ b4 ]  [ B b6 ]  [ Q c2 ]  [ N e7 ]  [ d3 ]  [ c6 ]  [ N d2 ]  [ O-O ]  [ a4 ]  [ Q g5 ] , [ N f1 ]  Interesting choice. White can't castle king's side ([ B b6 ] puts the king in check) but most folks would have gone with Pg4. Black is kind of compelled to move the queen and cannot simply take the poisoned g pawn (now guarded by the white queen).
 [ Q b8 + ] , [ K g7 ]  relentless: but White does not give up that easly...
 [ R x g7 ] , [ K f8 ]  forcing the rook back on the same path gaining a tempo to pin it latter and defending the [ g8 ] to place my pinning rook
 [ c6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ d x c4 ]  Black accepts the gambit.
 [ B x f6 ] , [ R f3 ]  Heading towards the d-file: 16... [ B g5 ] 17.Rd3. Maybe 16.[ N d5 ] was better: 16... [ Q a7 + ] 17.[ K h1 ] [ Q d4 ] 18.[ N x f6 + ] [ g x f6 ] 19.[ Q g4 + ] [ K h8 ] 20.[ Q h4 ] but I missed it having something else something slower and safer in mind.
 [ B c2 ]  [ N x e6 ] , [ f x e6 ]  The queen is trapped. Now white can potentially go after 3 minor pieces for a queen but... let's see: [ a3 ] BxQ axB BxB bxN BxR KxB QxBc1+! is not a solution. Whew! :-)
 [ f6 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ B d4 ]  [ K f1 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ g3 ]  [ R e5 ] , [ B g4 ]  The bishop is better on [ g2 ] supporting the [ e4 ] pawn.
 [ e4 ]  [ h6 ]  [ B h4 ]  [ g5 ]  [ B g3 ] , [ h5 ]  This threatens 8. ... [ h4 ] but 9. [ B e5 ] is available and a good position for white so I thought this was not only a bad use of tempo but also weakened the black g pawn.
 [ d5 ]  [ c4 ] , [ d x c4 ]  2. .... [ d x c4 ] - after Bob starts with a Q pawn opening I decided to play the QGA as it gives me more open play and I feel a little less vulnerable to passivitis.
 [ K a5 ] , [ R x d6 ]  Achieving so much positionally the only considerations are on the queenside.
 [ Q f3 ]  [ Q d8 ]  [ R a c1 ]  [ R c8 ] , [ a3 ]  Blocking the [ b4 ] square for black's strong knight.
 [ Q f6 ] , [ B d3 ]  development while in creasing pressure on the diagonal
 [ N c5 ]  [ Q b1 ]  [ d4 ]  [ B f3 ]  [ Q f6 ]  [ e x d4 ] , [ Q x d4 ]  This capture is a problem because of the undefended R on d8.
 [ g x f6 ]  [ e ] , [ p ]  Shirov lets the knight come back into the game for the sake of re-opening the diagonal.
 [ R x b2 ]  [ h5 ]  [ B c2 ]  [ e3 ]  [ B a4 ]  [ R h2 ] , [ R b3 ]  swapping the rook will let white fully control the battlefield since white other rook is more active. Jika terjadi tukaran benteng hitam masih kalah mobilitas karena Benteng Putih lebih terbuka.
 [ R x c2 ]  [ N x c2 ]  [ K f2 ] , [ f6 ]  Now the ending is simple enough that I should be able to hold my own. And material is even. I offered a draw somewhere around here but White still thought he had wiinning chances against me and refused it.
 [ N f3 ] , [ e6 ]  Again a less-than-common move with a strong structure on white squares but very weak on black squares a blocked white bishop and with no pieces developed.
 [ d x e4 ]  [ B x e4 ] , [ B d6 ]  Reinforcing the center pawn and preparing to castle.
 [ B c5 ] , [ B g4 ]  If [ Q h1 ] [ Q x f2 ] mates in two.
 [ a4 ] , [ a6 ]  again 14. ...[ N f6 ] followed by [ a6 ] would have been better
 [ K d1 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ Q g4 ] , [ B d8 ]  not 22...[ N f6 ] 23. [ Q x c8 # ]  [ Q g7 ]  [ R f8 ] , [ R x h4 ]  ? Presumably he forgot about the B on d8.
 [ e x f6 ]  [ Q x f6 ] , [ B a3 ]  Now the Bishop moves to [ a3 ] probably what it should have done to start with.
 [ N f3 ] , [ f6 ]  ?! Weakens the diagonal for nothing.
 [ R d7 ]  [ c4 ]  [ R a6 ] , [ b4 ]  ? (maybe not the best idea...)
 [ O-O ] , [ B d3 ]  [ h3 ] would fit better with his plan denying me [ g4 ] and preparing to retreat the bishop to h2.
 [ K h8 ]  [ B x f7 ] , [ B x f7 ]  ...here [ R g1 ] threatens [ R g7 ] winning one of the two bishops. I didn't see it. Moreover I blundered.
 [ d2 ] , [ R e2 ]  Pushing the pawn on will cost my opponent.
 [ e x f5 ]  [ N x d5 ] , [ N b4 ]  Bringing his N to a better and is prepared to exchange white's Nd5. Of course Praggnanandhaa.
 [ e x f6 ]  [ B x f6 ] , [ N x h7 ]  After the exchanges I go for it and make my unsound sack with hopes of a bright game.
 [ K e1 ] , [ Q e2 # ]  I hope you enjoyed this!
 [ R d1 ] , [ N e5 ]  I clear the last pawn the obstructs the view of my bishop.
 [ c3 ] , [ B d6 ]  White: [ [ c3 ] ] Black [ B d6 ] I played [ [ c3 ] ] attacking the Bishop and putting another line of defense up against the Queen on a5. I had two intentions here one was to have the black bishop retreat and two planning to attack with my pawn on b2. I wanted to push it to [ b4 ] furthering development and hoping the queen would either retreat or possibly move to a4. [ a4 ] would be a blunder but I see stuff like that a lot in blitz games.
 [ Q d2 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ O-O-O ] , [ B d7 ]  Black plans to castle on the queen side as his king side castle wall is broken. White's pawn storm on the king side can also be avoided. How shall White play from here?
 [ N d x e4 ] , [ d x e4 ]  But this one wasn't as good to follow it up. You should capture with the bishop here. Note that my knight on [ c3 ] is still pinned by your bishop so I wouldn't be able to take the bishop. By capturing with the pawn you foul up your pawn structure and make it more difficult to establish a stable defensive structure.
 [ g x h7 + ] , [ N x h5 ]  Gleefully seizing the enemy queen but not seeing the danger.
 [ R h5 ] , [ N e5 ]  QD6 IS ALMOST FROCED
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B c4 ] , [ N f6 ]  Easy development of Giuoco Piano. I used this opening cause i knew he lost much games in this way.
 [ O-O ] , [ b3 ]  11. [ b3 ] - to support my pawn on c4.
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ g6 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B g5 ]  [ Q e8 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ Q x e4 ] , [ c3 ]  even exchanges while developing.
 [ N c3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ N b d7 ]  [ e3 ]  [ c6 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ Q a5 ]  Cambridge Springs Defense (or less commonly the Pillsbury Variation) is a variation of the Queen's Gambit Declined. Black breaks the pin on the h4-[ d8 ] diagonal and forms a pin of his own on the [ c3 ] knight (exploiting the absence of the queen's bishop from the queen side). If Black later plays [ d x c4 ] there may be threats against the [ g5 ] bishop. The first recorded instance of this opening was played by Emanuel Lasker in 1892. The name derives from a 1904 tournament in Cambridge Springs Pennsylvania in which the defense was used several times. Practitioners of the opening have included Efim Bogoljubov Vasily Smyslov and Garry Kasparov. The line remains popular among amateurs because there are several traps White must avoid.
 [ R x b6 ]  [ R c3 x c8 ] , [ B c4 ]  Only move to stop the mate threatening the R at the same time. Unfortunately it has plenty of room to go to.
 [ K x f6 ]  [ d7 ]  [ N x d7 ] , [ R x d7 ]  ... I lose the pawn outright but how many squares does his king have available?
 [ R x f6 ] , [ R h5 ]  The quickest way to create threats.
 [ c4 ] , [ c6 ]  Another mistake. Black needs to play [ N c6 ] or [ Q a7 ] to stop the tactical flourish that happens on the next move.
 [ Q d3 ] , [ B d7 ]  Black can do nothing but finish his development and hope for the best. On 18 ... [ f4 ] white can answer 19. gx[ f4 ] gx[ f4 ] 20. [ e4 ] when black king is in more danger than white.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ c3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ B b4 + ]  [ B d2 ]  [ B x d2 + ]  [ N b x d2 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ Q b3 ]  [ N c e7 ] , [ O-O ]  Giuoco Piano as it has been played a million times before; usually follows 0-0 [ R f e1 ] [ c6 ] [ N e5 ] [ N f5 ] [ B x d5 ] [ Q x d5 ] [ Q x d5 ] [ c x d5 ] [ N d f3 ] with easy play for White...
 [ N x g2 + ]  [ K f1 ] , [ d6 ]  White has to choose among the rook or the knight. But if he takes the rook [ B h3 ] should be definitory. Just a bet!
 [ N d5 ]  [ Q d6 ]  [ N g5 ] , [ N b4 ]  offer the knight
 [ e4 ] , [ c6 ]  Caro kann which I play a lot as black. I had studied quite a bit for this opening in order to play it or to play against it.
 [ Q f3 ]  [ B x c2 ] , [ R a c1 ]  Anticipated by black. White retains the tempo and restricts black's bishop but black has snatched a pawn for nothing.
 [ K e6 ] , [ d4 ]  with tempo
 [ Q f5 ]  [ N x c3 ]  [ N g e7 ] , [ B a3 ]  The bishop is now on a very strong diagonal. Black could castle but it would leave their knight pinned to the rook...
 [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ e5 ]  Reversed Sicilian. interesting choices.
 [ d5 ] , [ N f3 ]  White plays the brilliant move 4. Nf3! attacking Black's queen.
 [ N f6 ] , [ c4 ]  3 [ e4 ] would once again transpose to the Grand Prix Attack but with Black's knight already on f6.
 [ B c5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ e4 ]  [ d6 ]  [ h3 ]  [ N a6 ] , [ a3 ]  Usually moving [ h3 ] and [ a3 ] early would be useless but this opening has practically forced him to move them.
 [ R f3 x f6 ]  [ g x f6 ] , [ N d5 ]  Striking out at both the [ e7 ] and [ f6 ] squares with this powerful knight~! WT plays to finish-up this game without allowing any significant counter-play from now on.
 [ K x d1 ]  [ f6 ]  [ B b5 ] , [ B h6 ]  My bishops hone in effectively cutting the board in half.
 [ e x d6 ]  [ e ] , [ p ]  Now it's my turn to think. I've already decided the move before this one.
 [ f4 ] , [ B e8 ]  13. .... [ B e8 ] - I eschew [ e x f3 ] ep as Mike will be left with a powerful unchallenged central pawn wall.
 [ K b8 ] , [ Q h7 ]  At last but better was one move before.
 [ Q c7 ]  [ B x f6 ] , [ g x f6 ]  this is one of the reason why black have difficulties to castle. [ B e7 ] or [ N b d7 ] could have prevented it but it is too late here.
 [ N c3 ]  [ N g e7 ]  [ O-O ]  [ g6 ] , [ b3 ]  Getting ready to fianchetto my bishop.
 [ R b4 ] , [ R f4 ]  ??
 [ N a5 ] , [ N f3 ]  White continues with normal development.
 [ B b5 + ] , [ K e7 ]  you see king can move !
 [ N b4 ] , [ e4 ]  Putting a stop to the threat but it doesn't bother me this time around. As my next move is the first thing that I kept in mind. I normally wouldn't since I don't exchange just because it's possible. But I did it here due to the fact that when all is said and done I'm a pawn up. And with a series of exchanges it's going to become liquidation which is favorable for black here. Of course the first thing that I kept in mind was the masked battery which ION mentioned in my game against nuntar.
 [ Q g3 ]  [ R h4 ] , [ h3 ]  Trying to avoid mate at all costs at this point.
 [ N b6 ] , [ Q c3 ]  Strange election for my rival. But I don't see the next move :). I expected [ Q e2 ]  [ B x e6 ]  [ Q x g7 ]  [ R f8 ]  [ Q x h7 ] , [ Q d4 ]  If 15 ... [ Q d3 ] 16 [ N f6 + ] :). Now I threat the queen with [ R h8 ]  [ Q c6 + ]  [ K b8 ] , [ N b5 ]  A nice threat the rook must retreat and the light square bishop is pinned.
 [ B g2 ] , [ a4 ]  The beauty of the fianchetto is the ability to retreat and attack at/from opposing corners. It's occasionally overlooked as it was 2 moves prior as well. He continues his pawn push on the queen side.
 [ K f8 ]  [ N e6 + ]  [ K g8 ]  [ N x c7 ] , [ N x c7 ]  Two white knighs for a black bishiop pawn and queen. Favorable position for white.
 [ K x f7 ] , [ Q d5 + ]  Wins back the piece.
 [ K g8 ] , [ R x f8 + ]  White exchanges one rook although these 2 were his biggest advantage in this side.
 [ Q f2 ] , [ Q d5 ]  i didnt understand this move
 [ c x d5 ] , [ c x d5 ]  White can attack with [ c4 ] to which I plan to play [ Q c7 ] pinning the pawn on the Q.
 [ N x e4 ] , [ O-O-O ]  If [ N c5 ] [ B f5 ] just to save it.
 [ R d8 ] , [ R e1 ]  This cannot be bad.
 [ B d3 ] , [ R e8 ]  Looking at this move now I am wondering if I didn't miscalculate. 19. ... [ N x d3 ] looks really juicy to me doubling and isolating white's pawns on the d-file. In fact so juicy that looking at it now I am really not sure why I didn't play it. I may have been worried about white building up on my knight at [ f6 ] with 21. [ B c3 ] but it looks like that is manageable.
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ N c3 ]  Seemed to be opting for more of a closed sicilian here.
 [ K f1 ] , [ g2 + ]  A potentially fatal mistake. After 51. [ K x f2 ] [ K f4 ] 52. [ B x f3 ] ensures that Black is unable to Queen either pawn before White can Queen the c pawn. Much better is 50. ... Kf4. Then if 51. [ B x f3 ] [ K x f3 ] 52. [ [ c6 ] ] g2#; or if 51. [ [ c6 ] ] [ e3 ] 52. [ [ c7 ] ] [ g2 # ] (52. [ B x f3 ] [ K f x3 ] 53. [ [ c7 ] ] [ g2 # ] lasts one more move).
 [ e6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B b4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ c5 ]  [ a3 ]  [ B x c3 + ]  [ b x c3 ]  [ N e7 ]  [ Q g4 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B d3 ]  [ N b c6 ]  [ Q h5 ]  [ N g6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ Q c7 ] , [ B e3 ]  I am not sure whether this is book or not. However the [ [ c3 ] ] square for white is weak and I would have considered [ B d2 ] a better move. This would have given white the ability to save a tempo protecting the [ [ c3 ] ] square when attacked by black; and an attack on this square seems almost inevitable because of it's weakness.
 [ R x f8 ]  [ Q f1 ]  [ Q e8 ]  [ Q f2 ] , [ N g8 ]  Heading for [ h6 ] whence he can defend the B again and also threaten [ g4 ] or [ f5 ] if White gets careless.
 [ N x c4 ] , [ d x c4 ]  Now you can see what I mean with the holes. Pawn on [ c4 ] is weak because after [ b3 ] is the diagonal for the bishop on [ g7 ] open to the rook.
 [ N x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ Q x d4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ Q d3 ]  [ Q f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N e7 ]  [ N b5 ] , [ Q c6 ]  A blunder on his part.
 [ B g4 ]  [ Q d2 ] , [ N d7 ]  ? It's probably a blunder. Black knight has cut the black bishop off the camp and now it can be trapped since black knight doesn't have any tempo-winning moves.
 [ g x h5 ] , [ e6 ]  ? Premature. It does take away the [ d7 ] square from the knight. but white should have attained better control of [ e6 ] and [ e7 ] before moving his pawn there.
 [ B d3 ]  [ c5 ] , [ e5 ]  If I did not know how the game ends at this point I would credit baldvin2 with the positional advantage and would foresee baldvin2 winning this match.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ] , [ Q h5 ]  King's pawn game Patzer opening. I don't like this opening as black can develop his pieces while chasing the white queen around the board. It is useful against rank amateurs who might respond with P[ g6 ] thus losing the rook and pawn.
 [ N c6 ] , [ e6 ]  Threatening mate.
 [ e x f6 ]  [ e ] , [ p ]  
 [ Q e5 ]  [ R b e1 ]  [ Q f6 ]  [ Q g3 ] , [ R f7 ]  25. ….. [ R f7 ] - preparing [ R a f8 ] and suddenly I will be faced with a pile-on on the f column.
 [ h5 ] , [ g3 ]  Now he has.
 [ K e7 ]  [ K g3 ]  [ R x d7 ]  [ R x d7 + ]  [ K x d7 ] , [ K f4 ]  47. [ K f4 ] - As I now know the position is drawn and my opponent is now visiting the board daily I now decided to bite the bullet. I now plumb in some conditional moves and at the end of the conditional moves my opponent offered me a draw. I accepted because I knew it would result in me and Tamas having just our bare kings. On the minus side I should have won this game hands down and gained 7 rating points instead of losing 3. If I am to reach Expertdom of which I was only 44 points away from this game shows that there is much room for improvement for Yours Truly. On the plus side no doubt it has had you the Inquest Jury sitting on the edge of your seats in the latter part of this game. Anyhow I hope you have all had a good read and are enjoying your weekend. I now need to beat Tamas in my return game against him to get first place in the MT. I just hope I have the focus and concentration to do it.
 [ a x b6 ] , [ a3 ]  Keeping the bishop's options limited
 [ B e2 ]  [ B c6 ]  [ K e3 ]  [ K d7 ]  [ g4 ]  [ B b2 ]  [ a4 ]  [ K d6 ] , [ B d3 ]  At this point I am hoping just to make my advantage count make Black swap off his bishop and thence resign.
 [ g5 ] , [ N c5 ]  supersparksky: Move 31 our next move should be 31.[ [ [ f6 ] ] ] thewrongreason: I concur with 31.[ [ [ f6 ] ] ] Dave. And I would likely want to follow up with 32.[ R e7 + ] as you noted above. redfoxrising: 31. [ [ [ f6 ] ] ] is my vote
 [ B x c5 ] , [ R x c5 ]  My R must be free. Now no much danger derives from N and B on my semiopened K.
 [ b4 ] , [ e5 ]  9. ..... [ e5 ] - so I try and liven things up a little with a pawn break.
 [ d x e5 ] , [ N x e5 ]  i was trying to force a knight exchange that knight on [ f3 ] is bothersome for DSB dives. but i also have to be careful of the blind check from the rook
 [ d4 ] , [ d5 ]  Turns out like a normal queen's pawn opening...
 [ R d1 ]  [ b4 ]  [ a x b4 ] , [ R x b4 ]  ...and create more space by swapping pawns.
 [ K f2 ]  [ c4 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ R d8 ] , [ R e1 + ]  His situation is not good.
 [ Q d2 ]  [ R f7 ]  [ N e1 ] , [ R g7 ]  Finally targeting g3.
 [ a x b4 ] , [ a x b4 ]  13. [ a x b4 ] - pawn trade.
 [ B c4 ]  [ c6 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ h6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ Q a5 ]  [ B d2 ]  [ Q b4 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ Q x b3 ]  [ N c7 + ]  [ K d8 ] , [ a x b3 ]  Hoping to use the a-file. Was thinking [ B a5 + ] [ b6 ] Bx[ b6 ] using the pin on the a-pawn but for the moment black has Kxb6.
 [ N c x e4 ]  [ B x a1 ]  [ N e6 ]  [ Q h4 ] , [ Q x a1 ]  one step to mate...
 [ N f3 ]  [ g6 ] , [ d3 ]  Cuts off the bishop: the full 5. [ d5 ] may be a bit too adventurous but it does force the exchange to White's at least temporary advantage if the fiancetto is delayed on 5. cx[ d5 ] 6. Nx[ d5 ] Nx[ d5 ] 7. Qx[ d5 ] Nf3. Problem would be on 6. ... [ B g2 ] but 7. [ B e3 ] seems satisfactory as does 7. Nxc3.
 [ B b5 ]  [ R c7 ] , [ B e8 ]  White is looking at the rear of my "west side" Pawns and it strikes fear in Black.
 [ Q f3 ]  [ R e1 e4 ]  [ Q h5 ]  [ K h7 ]  [ Q h3 ] , [ R g6 + ]  37. ..... [ R g6 + ] - at last here is the swinger - now guys and dolls just take a look at that h1-[ a8 ] diagonal and what is lined up on that a BR and a BQ so if Kh1?? here then Freddy will drop his queen to a move such as [ R e3 ] disc ch.
 [ b3 ] , [ Q f3 ]  I expected White to decline the Queen trade since I'm ahead in material.
 [ O-O-O + ]  [ K c3 ] , [ R d1 ]  hoping for a bishop
 [ N f6 ] , [ R a d1 ]  The rook on the same file as an opponents queen again.
 [ B d5 ] , [ B a6 ]  !! This side of the field is completly unprotected and the b line is freed. I don't think there's a way for black to escape the mate at this point. If [ b x a6 ] then [ Q x a6 + ] followed by [ R b1 # ]  [ B x f3 ]  [ B x b7 + ] , [ K x b7 ]  If [ K b8 ] then [ Q a6 ] then Qa8#.
 [ Q e4 + ]  [ Q e2 ] , [ Q x h1 ]  Finally black has scored some trophy to compensate for his underdeveloped position.....but now the game is over. The queen is trapped and white has plenty of time to get her cooked and fried before its time to snack.....
 [ R b d8 ] , [ R f3 ]  I'll get one tempo and push my pawn in the next move
 [ B x c7 ] , [ B x f3 ]  ...*and* a pair of minor pieces.
 [ B x e2 ] , [ K x e2 ]  Baby steps
 [ Q x g2 ]  [ B x g2 ]  [ K x g2 ] , [ K b4 ]  41. ..... [ K b4 ] - Henry now makes way for my a pawn to proceed to Glendadom.
 [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N d b5 ]  [ a6 ]  [ N a3 ] , [ B e6 ]  Not a superb move but I wanted to develop and this is really the only post for the bishop currently. Perhaps 7... [ N c6 ] would have been better. However the hot water I get into later is saved by the bishop pair.
 [ b x c6 ]  [ b4 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ B d2 ]  [ O-O ]  [ Q a4 ] , [ Q c7 ]  a move that both defends the pawn and prepares an attack on [ h2 ]  [ B x h2 + ]  [ K f2 ]  [ Q g3 + ]  [ K e2 ]  [ Q x g2 + ]  [ K e1 ] , [ B g3 + ]  the rook is captured with tempo
 [ g5 ] , [ Q c6 ]  Clever move to drag the Rook out of position however leaving the defensive [ h4 ] Knight open for the taking could be a problem? Or the key to spring the trap?
 [ Q x a8 ]  [ Q x c7 ] , [ R c1 ]  Only way to save my queen. He just disconnected. After ...[ Q a5 ] [ Q c6 ] I have an overwhelming advantage.
 [ Q c7 ] , [ Q e3 ]  Black is not in the hurry to take the pawn because they have it gurenteed to win it.
 [ Q e3 ] , [ R d1 ]  good move white attacking the weak pawn [ d6 ] and controls the center butt the white king stays in the center with out castling and it could be big problem for whites
 [ B d6 ] , [ N f3 ]  3 moves for that knight
 [ B x g6 ]  [ c6 ] , [ R f d1 ]  The black rook could escape to d7. Or trade.
 [ b x c3 ]  [ c x d4 ] , [ c x d4 ]  And the position has now simplified itself a bit. I was starting to feel a bit uneasy about winning the game because of the positioning of my two passed pawns. Passed pawns that aren't too far advanced and have two files in between them are able to be picked off by a lone enemy king. I won't go into too much detail but king-and-pawn endgame theory shows that two connected passed pawns are self-supported since if the king takes the back one it will be unable to catch the other. Likewise passed pawns with one file between them are also self-supported due to a "wall" that they create. Ironically passed pawns with two files in between are no longer self-supported and can be picked off safely by the enemy king if the pawns are not advanced too far. Although this was a bit far-fetched of an analysis of the position that thought started to weigh down on my mind.
 [ N f6 ]  [ f3 ] , [ a5 ]  11....a5??? That will lead to the dangerous 12.Nb5.
 [ e6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ B e7 ] , [ O-O ]  5. 0-0 after clearing the kingside decks I tuck Henry away. Now for the queenside.
 [ R h g8 ]  [ Q e2 ]  [ R x g2 + ] , [ Q x g2 ]  Now Caruana's biggest task is to make time control without any additional inaccuracies.
 [ g3 ]  [ N x g6 ]  [ R x e6 ] , [ R f6 ]  White has the most active pieces and he surely is able to get an advantage of that !
 [ Q e7 ] , [ B x a7 ]  9. [ B x [ a7 ] ] - it begins to dawn on me ouch that [ a7 ] pawn was only defended once and attacked twice! I got that real horrid sinking feeling once before about 11 or 12 years ago when helping out at a kiddies chess club I blundered my queen to a six year old beginner. My gut feeling told me to play on and I eventually won but boy did it not take me about what seemed an eternity to compose myself! Thankfully I lost only a pawn so I transformed myself from Jo Pessimist to Jo Optimist!
 [ Q e3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N c e2 ]  [ Q b6 ]  [ c3 ] , [ a5 ]  Black is ready to push its pawn towards a threatening position and will prove vital toward the final mating sequence.
 [ b4 ]  [ R b2 ]  [ K g7 ] , [ d3 ]  Avoided [ d4 ] because the prospect of trading a Knight for a Bishop in a game with locked Pawns was not in my favor. I also expected ...[ d5 ] eventually and wanted the opportunity to open up the e-file for my Rook in a Pawn exchange if [ d x c4 ] or dxe4.
 [ e5 ]  [ B x g3 ]  [ h x g3 ]  [ O-O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ f6 ]  [ f4 ]  [ h5 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ R h e8 ] , [ B f3 ]  hereabouts we enter a phase of careful maneuvering by white.
 [ B d4 ]  [ Q g4 ] , [ g6 ]  Notice the pawn on [ g6 ] is pinned by the white queen.
 [ R g8 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ R g1 + ]  Needed was Rh8.
 [ Q b2 + ]  [ Q d2 ] , [ Q b5 + ]  Therefore I check in hopes that he'll block with his [ c4 ] pawn. Once again that hope is based on the glaucoma as then I'd pick up a pawn that way. But as anticipated Jack doesn't give it up.
 [ R e8 ] , [ B f3 ]  Wanted to get my bishop back into play.
 [ R b8 ]  [ K h2 ]  [ R b3 ]  [ R x b3 ]  [ a x b3 ] , [ B a3 ]  If I don't play this move at once the Pawn will queen.
 [ Q x d1 + ]  [ K h2 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ B x f8 ]  [ Q d8 ]  [ N f5 ]  [ Q x f8 ]  [ h x g4 ]  [ Q f7 ]  [ K g1 ]  [ Q f8 ]  [ Q f4 ]  [ Q d8 ]  [ K f2 ]  [ Q e8 ]  [ g5 ]  [ N h5 ]  [ Q d6 ]  [ K g8 ]  [ K e3 ]  [ N g7 ]  [ N h6 + ]  [ K h8 ] , [ Q f6 ]  And now black is in sort of zugzwang. He cannot move his queen from the back rank the knight and king and the h-pawn can't move at all. So the winning process is fairly simple create a passed pawn on the queen side and trade all of the material.
 [ K f8 ]  [ K f2 ]  [ K e7 ] , [ K e3 ]  31. [ K e3 ] - as Henry moves towards his favourite repast Davide's king also moves towards the centre.
 [ K g3 ] , [ Q e5 + ]  White king moves to [ g3 ] to take shelter and black queen moves to [ e5 ] and checks.
 [ R d5 d7 ]  [ R a b8 ]  [ f5 ] , [ R c6 ]  already [ R d8 + ] is troublesome for Black...
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ] , [ d4 ]  King's pawn Center Game.
 [ N d6 ] , [ N c6 ]  cutting off the B's defence of the [ d5 ] pawn. The alternative tactic was the skewer of N an p with [ R d7 ] but this path swaps off another pair of minor pieces at the same time
 [ Q c7 ]  [ N b d2 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ N f1 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ R a c8 ] , [ B b1 ]  Once again protecting the light squared Bishop. Although the Rook on [ a1 ] is blocked it is not an immediate problem for White
 [ K e8 ]  [ B b4 ] , [ g4 ]  I think black's wasting time....
 [ R f6 + ]  [ K e7 ]  [ R d6 ]  [ R c8 ]  [ B h4 + ]  [ K f8 ] , [ R d8 + ]  THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF THE END........
 [ b3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ h3 ] , [ d5 ]  Tempting white to take the [ e5 ] pawn
 [ K h2 ]  [ N d f2 ] , [ Q g3 ]  Now i can't move either of my knights without one being taken. [ N h3 + ] looks a poor move now.
 [ K d8 ]  [ h4 ] , [ Q g4 ]  Here's some tactics ; black queen's best retreat is [ f5 ] as it holds the [ c2 ] square. Even after an exchange black bishop will still be holding c2. Eventually black will end up gaining quality and black knight can escape from [ a1 ] in late game due to "a" and "b" pawns advance.
 [ B f6 ] , [ B b2 ]  To me this did not seem all that good of a spot for his Bishop.
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ] , [ e5 ]  The advance variation which is one of the sharper options according to most databases. I spent a while deciding on this variation considering also the panov-botvinnik attack in the exchange lines which I think I will try in the future.
 [ K e7 ]  [ R c3 ]  [ Q a4 ]  [ b4 ] , [ Q d7 ]  Black's queen is evicted from White's territory.
 [ b4 ] , [ B x b4 ]  [ a x b4 ] [ R x c8 ] and White is at worst going to be even
 [ K a4 ]  [ K d2 ] , [ K x a3 ]  And now winning the [ c3 ] pawn would make my b pawn a passer.
 [ N c3 ] , [ B b7 ]  Which gives him a nice spot for his LSB. And as we will see which Tom notes in the end this is starting to become a dangerous position for black because of where the B is placed.
 [ c x d5 ]  [ Q x d5 ] , [ e4 ]  Pushing the queen away.
 [ R d7 ]  [ N d1 ]  [ R h d8 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ R d7 x d2 ]  [ N x d2 ] , [ f5 ]  black's plan was to force the exchanges and then undouble the pawn opening up the bishop pair with a slight initiative.
 [ R x f8 ] , [ N e4 ]  I move in my remaining piece.....
 [ B x b2 ] , [ R c2 ]  Black wins another pawn shortly with [ Q a5 + ] with the choice of either [ a3 ] or d5.
 [ f3 ] , [ B b4 ]  White wants to un-kabosh his bishop and who can blame him. Black responds by taking white's knight out of the exchange equation.
 [ g4 ]  [ e4 ]  [ Q d1 ]  [ B x g4 ]  [ Q x g4 ] , [ e x d3 ]  better was for my opinion 22...[ f5 ] to prevent a check and than exd3.
 [ Q g6 ]  [ N h8 ]  [ Q h7 + ]  [ K f7 ]  [ R g3 ]  [ R c g8 ] , [ R e1 ]  ! Stopping the king from escaping.
 [ Q e7 ] , [ O-O ]  Black develops his queen perhaps prematurely. This is the standard 3rd move for black in the Charlick Gambit deferred here by 4 moves. It would be stronger if black's knight were still on [ c6 ] to exert pressure on the white pawn at [ e5 ] (black could remove a defender with [ B x f3 ] then Nx[ e5 ] wins a pawn). As is the queen blocks the black knight on [ g8 ] from it's only reasonable development and she gains little by way of an attack from e7.
 [ R x f8 ]  [ R e3 ]  [ N g5 ]  [ B x c4 ] , [ K g6 ]  Thanks for the game Ananya! I hope you got something out of the annotations. God Bless! Scott
 [ a6 ]  [ Q c2 ] , [ B g4 ]  And there is that black bishop on g4.
 [ d6 ] , [ Q b3 ]  10.[ B e2 ] and O-O are better I think.
 [ e5 ]  [ d5 ]  [ B d2 ]  [ c4 ]  [ Q c2 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ R a b1 ]  [ R f c8 ]  [ R x b8 ]  [ R x b8 ] , [ R b1 ]  White is trying to infiltrate with his Queen somehow let's see...
 [ B e3 ]  [ N h6 ]  [ h3 ] , [ N f5 ]  if g4? i go hxg4! and if hxg4?? i take his rook on h1!!
 [ R g8 ]  [ Q c7 + ]  [ Q f7 ]  [ Q x f7 + ]  [ N x f7 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ K h6 ]  Black can not play Rxb because with the enemy rook behind his pawns it would over very quickly
 [ B x f3 ]  [ Q g3 ] , [ R a e8 ]  Now with doubling the rooks every piece is involved in the attack.
 [ d5 ] , [ d3 ]  Attacks the pinned knight.
 [ R d1 ]  [ a5 ] , [ g3 ]  Unperturbed White continues his kingside attack preparing f4. Unfortunately his plan is too slow. White's best idea at this point is probably to flee the queenside slaughter by Kd2-e1-f1. This may buy him enough time to create threats on the kingside if Black continues inaccurately. Then White should be looking for perpetual check possibilities. Alternative variation: [ It is more appropriate to abandon ship. After] 24. Kd2! [ a4 ] 25. [ K e1 ] [ a x b3 ] 26. [ c x b3 ] [ B e6 ] 27. [ K f1 ] [ B x b3 ] 28. [ R c1 ] [ Q a7 ] 29. [ R c6 ] [White can again fight for the initiative although Black has the better game. What a remarkable idea!]
 [ a3 ]  [ N a2 ]  [ R x a2 ]  [ R c4 x c1 + ]  [ N x c1 ]  [ R x c1 + ]  [ K d2 ]  [ R c4 ]  [ K d3 ]  [ e5 ]  [ f3 ]  [ h5 ]  [ a4 ]  [ a6 ]  [ a x b5 ]  [ a x b5 ] , [ R e2 ]  better try [ R a7 + ] [ K e6 ] [ R a6 + ] [ K f5 ] [ R a7 ] [ K g6 ] Re7...
 [ B b4 ]  [ e3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N f3 ]  [ c5 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ O-O ]  [ d x c4 ]  [ B x c4 ]  [ N b d7 ]  [ a3 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ e x d4 ] , [ B x c3 ]  I don't mind fair trades especially when my opponent had more developed pieces. Now we are more even and white's pawns have two gaps.
 [ N h4 ]  [ g6 ]  [ R a b1 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ B f7 ] , [ R b5 ]  Threatening the pawn at a5.
 [ e4 ]  [ d6 ] , [ f4 ]  More usual is 5.[ N [ f3 ] ] and 5.[ f3 ] (Samisch) used to be popular and aggressive also. Also playable is the peculiar-looking 5.[ N e2 ] the Kramer Attack.
 [ B c5 + ]  [ K h1 ]  [ K d7 ]  [ R a d1 + ] , [ K c8 ]  A key point that Daisy and I had to foresee is that 25. … Kc6? would allow White to win a queen with 26. Nd4+. Loose pieces drop off!
 [ K h5 ] , [ g4 + ]  Surely black considered the en passent here but eventually decided against it.
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ c4 ]  [ c6 ] , [ c x d5 ]  So often in chess we begin with the thought "What happens if I let him achieve what he seems to want to acheive here?" At other times we say "He wants it so I want to deny him it." Here it was something between these alternatives: He spent some time fortifying the square with a pawn I would like that move to have been wasted or come along a line he was not intending. I actually do not know that he felt ill at ease with [ c x d5 ] but I do get to retain a certain control of the game flow with this play.
 [ B x g4 ]  [ B c7 ]  [ B f3 ]  [ R h g8 ]  [ B e4 ]  [ R g4 ]  [ f3 ] , [ R g7 ]  Paul's 2 extra Pawns will be a bigger advantage with every piece exchange.
 [ B f6 + ] , [ K h6 ]  Naturally if [ K x h7 ] [ N f8 ] and it's all over. I didn't quite know yet how to proceed now that the king was taking a walk alone. I was tempted to put this away for the night. I know damn well there's a win in here but it isn't a direct sequence of forcing moves. Then I remembered that if 21... gx [ Q x g6 ] I wasn't looking at a total forcing series of moves there either and I was just fine. So if I can find a similarly unanswerable position -- somewhere to park the queen while waiting safely for my turn...
 [ N d4 ]  [ N x d4 ] , [ c x d4 ]  I decided to go with this instead of [ B x h1 ] because a) I wanted to keep the diagonal and b) It would still stop you from castling. In hindsight it was a mistake because I lost the diagonal after [ R g1 ] and Bg2. I should have just captured the rook.
 [ N d3 ]  [ h4 ]  [ N h1 ] , [ h3 ]  This looked really good at the time but White seemed more than happy with his game.
 [ N x g7 ]  [ R e7 ]  [ R d5 + ]  [ K g6 ]  [ N f5 ] , [ R f7 ]  Hmm aiming for [ R x f2 ] I think. Need to keep the pawn defended whilst retaining the initiative.
 [ R d7 + ]  [ K h6 ] , [ Q h4 # ]  
 [ N x e4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ B x d5 ]  [ Q x d5 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ Q a5 ]  Standard stuff for this opening. Already I'm feeling good about the position since I have played this line very frequently I feel comfortable about the position. My queen is out a bit early but it will be safe over on [ a5 ] for a while.
 [ Q g4 ]  [ Q x g4 ]  [ f x g4 ] , [ g3 ]  forced...
 [ R c7 ] , [ B h3 ]  Heading for e6. Black can not challenge this with his own bishop to [ d7 ] or [ f7 ] owing to the threatened mate.
 [ d4 ] , [ d6 ]  white begins to take control of the center
 [ R a d1 ]  [ R d8 ]  [ N h4 ]  [ R e5 ]  [ Q f3 ] , [ d4 ]  ! -- Al misses the nasty little point behind this move.
 [ h3 ] , [ B x h3 ]  Bravo! I wasn't expecting this but it is clearly black's best hope
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ d x c5 ] , [ Q a5 + ]  that is how the Hungarians do...
 [ Q x f4 ] , [ R x h3 + ]  check another tempo
 [ B d1 ]  [ f5 ]  [ B b3 ]  [ a5 ]  [ a4 ] , [ b4 ]  29. ...... [ b4 ] - I eschew the pawn trade because I have an idea up my sleeve.
 [ e4 ]  [ e6 ] , [ d4 ]  I responded to [ e4 ] with the French defence.
 [ K g5 ]  [ K e3 ]  [ h5 ]  [ K f2 ] , [ K f4 ]  Without the Bishops this would lead to an easy win but having the opposition of the Kings dosn´t do much here. It may sound strange but Blacks win is where his pawn-MINORITY is right now! That should explain the next moves.
 [ N g4 + ]  [ K g1 ] , [ Q x h4 ]  White's pieces are loose. i'm up a minor piece for two pawns the bishop is hanging and I have a mate threat.
 [ R x f2 ]  [ N x f2 ] , [ Q x f2 ]  A bishop down in an endgame it's time to quit. It was still good fun despite making my fair share of mistakes. As i wasn't playing a person i don't feel worried about copywright infringement. Comments welcome of course.
 [ g3 ] , [ b6 ]  This move is a little strange. It seems like Black should be developing and preparing to castle. There is plenty of time for this move later. 3...[ N f6 ] must be stronger.
 [ a x b5 ] , [ B c3 ]  I still though i could resolved it.
 [ R x b3 ] , [ a4 ]  I wanted at least to exchange these pawns then I could have start to set up some for of defense.
 [ a4 ]  [ R g8 ]  [ g4 ]  [ R g5 ] , [ h4 ]  21. [ h4 ] - I try to drive back the black KR but my opponent has other ideas .....
 [ Q x a5 ]  [ R b1 ]  [ Q b6 ] , [ N e4 ]  25. [ N e4 ] - trying to improve the position of my steed and to block out the [ e8 ] rook. Trouble is Ion has an f pawn to assail it!
 [ R x e8 ] , [ d x e5 ]  My advanced position and two bishops for a rook are all plusses in this game.
 [ K h5 ] , [ Q x c5 # ]  Checkmate! The Sicilian Defense is the most popular defense for black against the [ e4 ] push from white. The Dragon Variation is the most aggressive and sharpest line that black has in the Sicilian Defense. White has many options that he can respond with. The most common is the Yugoslav Attack but this is a double edge sword. White will castle on the queen side black will castle on the king side and both will have very sharp options to attack their opponents king. This is one of Magnus Carlsen’s favorite lines and has had much success playing as black opening up the defense white has on the queen side. Some of the other options white has are the Classical Variation the Levenfish and the Harrington-Glek. My personally favorite line is the Levenfish. With the idea in mind to attack the king side of black white makes an early aggressive push with his f pawn to f4. This poses many problems for black and is forced to mix up his normal developement to defend the e pawn from white pushing forward. There are so many exciting lines in the Dragon Variation of the Sicilian Defense it is a must study for any chess player. I highly recommend using this at any level of chess play. But do be cautious as it is very hard to use and one wrong move and you're giving the game away.
 [ B e2 ]  [ c6 ] , [ N h2 ]  7. [ N h2 ] - this curious move prepares Ng4.
 [ b6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ R b8 ]  [ b3 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ N x c3 ]  [ R x e8 ]  [ K x e8 ]  [ R x c3 ]  [ K f8 ]  [ K f2 ]  [ R f6 + ]  [ R f3 ]  [ R x f3 + ] , [ K x f3 ]  White has a passed pawn in a long chain and a more active centralized king. It seems impossible that he would lose from this position.
 [ B g7 ] , [ Q x g5 ]  Not the best move in my opinion. I thought NX[ g5 ] would have been better.
 [ Q c8 ]  [ B c3 ]  [ a5 ] , [ B x b4 ]  When you are up in material. You should trade of pieces and simplify the ending.
 [ K f5 ]  [ a5 ]  [ c6 ]  [ a x b6 ] , [ a x b6 ]  41. ...... [ a x b6 ] - pawn trade.
 [ O-O ] , [ B g4 ]  I think 7. ...[ g6 ] was the best move here.and I might go as far as saying this moves a blunder. It looks nice but the bishop gets scared easy.
 [ B b2 ]  [ B e7 ] , [ g4 ]  8. [ g4 ] - allo allo allo - an attack on Fou Leblanc and the hint of a kingside pawn storm. White looks to be planning to castle queenside.
 [ K c2 ] , [ R d3 ]  What? Why toss Bc4? Black ignores white's counter threat against the white bishop. I like [ B d5 ] MUCH better. It protects the knight while the rook protects the bishop. White can have the [ a7 ] pawn--it is cheaper than black's white bishop.
 [ h3 ] , [ B h5 ]  Major mistake with only one piece defending the bishop now. The queen at [ d7 ] is boxing the bishop in. [ B x e2 ] with some disadvantage to Black in position but minimizing his losses.
 [ Q e7 ] , [ K f2 ]  18. [ K f2 ] - the only piece that can defend this weak pawn is Henry. I am gonna have to uncastle him as you will see over the next few moves.
 [ d x e5 ] , [ K c7 ]  Threatening to win the queen and already pondering forced mating nets with the rook at [ d8 ] and queen at d4.
 [ R x b1 ] , [ K h7 ]  trying to chase his bishop away
 [ O-O ]  [ N x c5 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ b6 ] , [ c x d5 ]  Giving up hope of working the Knight via [ Q B4 ] to [ K5 ] with any effect.
 [ R c8 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ N x f6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ R d8 ]  The rook was threatning to come into [ d5 ]  [ B c7 ] , [ N c5 ]  And this! This just leaves black in a completely lost position
 [ N x g4 ]  [ d3 ]  [ e4 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ B x c3 ]  [ b x c3 ] , [ Q x e4 ]  I can pin him right now!!
 [ g4 ] , [ R e2 ]  Attacking his pawn and hopefully to create a passed pawn on d3.
 [ N x f6 + ]  [ Q x f6 ] , [ Q b3 ]  Similar to a French Defense reversed white puts pressure on [ d5 ] and b7.
 [ Q e2 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ f x e4 ]  [ B x e4 ] , [ N x e4 ]  This appears to lose a queen but in fact White is so fragile at [ c3 ] and [ g2 ] that Black seems to be winning. Fritz is needed to confirm.
 [ b5 ] , [ B e2 ]  forcing the withdrawal
 [ K b8 ]  [ g3 ]  [ h5 ] , [ Q e2 ]  Queen now moves back to safety to prevent black can use little attacks at the queen to further his king side attack
 [ B x c4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ O-O ] , [ Q e7 ]  I'm again not sure about this move. It does setup a longside castle but Black eventually makes a kingside castle. The Queen does support the forward e-pawn in the case of 11. [ Q c2 ] but 10. ... 0-0 11. [ Q c2 ] [ R e8 ] does as well

 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ] , [ N f3 ]  In hope to 2. ... [ f5 ] with Latvian counter gambit.
 [ Q g2 ] , [ B a5 ]  An annoying move as I have to defend the Knight in order to continue my plan. I avoid 26.[ N f3 ] as 26...[ e4 ] is unpleasant.
 [ N f3 ]  [ B b4 + ]  [ N c3 ] , [ N g e7 ]  Perhaps [ N f6 ] followed by the plan of [ N e4 ] is better!
 [ B x f5 ] , [ g x f5 ]  H: Two goals have been accomplished. The kingside bishop is no more and the pawn on [ f5 ] owns the [ e6 ] and [ g6 ] squares effectively building a wall against the black king.
 [ Q h5 ] , [ B e3 ]  Gotta defend the d pawn.
 [ N f5 ]  [ Q b5 ]  [ N g7 + ]  [ B x g7 ]  [ f x g7 ]  [ R g8 ] , [ R x f7 ]  !!! Spielmann would classify this sacrifice as a king's hunt sacrifice.

 [ a4 ] , [ Q a5 ]  I have no idea any more what my motivation behind this move was. Sure it covers [ a7 ] but the queen is hardly active here.
 [ f x e5 ] , [ d x e5 ]  Black has the tactical try 23... [ B d2 ] but fails to gain any material after 24.

[ B x h7 ] here not sure why I didn't see it.
 [ R f1 ] , [ Q h6 ]  Ok how about Q-[ h3 ] then?
 [ R c e1 + ] , [ K x f6 ]  Notice how the Black King continues to gain material while White slowly withers away his substantial lead in material down to a mere +5...
 [ N g6 ]  [ e x f6 ]  [ g x f6 ] , [ N d4 ]  Alternative variation: 13. [ B e3 ] [ Q e7 ] (13... [ Q a5 ] 14. [ a4 ] $14) 14. [ N a3 ] O-O-O 15. [ N b5 ] $14
 [ N e2 ]  [ K e7 ]  [ R h d1 ] , [ R h d8 ]  14. ....... [ R h d8 ] - both kings are centralised with the queens off and now the king rooks face each other on the d file.
 [ Q e2 ]  [ B e7 ] , [ R a d1 ]  setting up a pin which he easily avoids.
 [ c5 ]  [ e5 ]  [ Q b3 ]  [ R b8 ] , [ e4 ]  I missed the power of [ N g5 ] here. What I did see was 10... [ N x e4 ] 11.Qxd5. Should I have tried 10... [ N d4 ] or Be6? [A]10... [ N d4 ] [A1] 11.[ N x d4 ] [ e x d4 ] 12.[ e x d5 ] [ B x c5 ] 13.[ B c4 ] b5. White has an isolated queen pawn and the attack has been diffused.

 [ O-O ] , [ R e1 ]  Too weak I almost think 'too shy'. 7. [ e4 ] had been much better
 [ N e5 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ f x e5 ] , [ R d f8 ]  elemantary: take out the free file for the Rook...
 [ d3 ] , [ B g5 ]  The Bishops go first.
 [ B x h3 ]  [ N x h3 ] , [ N b c6 ]  Hoping for Rook-King fork on c2.
 [ a7 ]  [ B x c6 ]  [ N x c6 ] , [ K b7 ]  Draw agreed. Prokofiev has no way to Queen his remaining Pawn.
 [ N c7 ] , [ B d7 ]  The Black King has been cut off as in the 2-bishop + King vs King checkmate
 [ O-O ] , [ R f d8 ]  I choice this rook for the d column keeping the chance of play [ a5 ] if I need active my queenside.
 [ c x d4 ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ N g f6 ] , [ B b5 ]  I adventured this move being sure black will go [ a6 ] or Qa5. But...

 [ B x h6 ]  [ g x h6 ]  [ Q x h6 ]  [ K f7 ]  [ N h4 ]  [ K e6 ]  [ N g6 ]  [ R g8 ]  [ R g3 ] , [ K d7 ]  Black has secure his king on the queen side and now can resume his plans and attacks.
 [ R x c8 + ]  [ K x c8 ] , [ b3 ]  And I also think about what else I can do to get a passed pawn.
 [ Q f3 ]  [ N e2 + ]  [ B x e2 ] , [ Q c7 ]  15. ....... [ Q c7 ] - making room for Ne7.
 [ R d b8 ]  [ Q a4 + ]  [ N a5 ] , [ Q x a5 # ]  Well it was a good game.
 [ B x d3 ]  [ Q h5 ] , [ N f6 + ]  !! A beautiful sacrifice. Analyze for a few minutes before moving on.................
 [ K e7 ]  [ Q x c8 ]  [ R x b2 ]  [ Q d7 + ] , [ K f8 ]  Here white likes Bh6+.
 [ Q d7 ] , [ Q g3 ]  21. [ Q g3 ] - Step 2- Glenda ends up doing the Timewarp in reverse with a jump to the left as she has already done her step to the right. Next up is [ B f6 ] taking advantage of the pin on g7.
 [ N x f5 ]  [ R x f5 ]  [ Q c2 ] , [ g6 ]  He treatens to take [ d4 ] now
 [ N b6 ]  [ N x b6 ] , [ B x b6 ]  Now 23...[ b4 ] 24. [ R b3 ] [ B f6 ] as I pointed out earlier will give Carlsen excellent play. Oh oh! Carlsen blundered!
 [ g5 ]  [ B g3 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ N b d2 ]  [ Q d7 ] , [ c3 ]  Now black has to deal with a possible [ d4 ] breakthrough. Also white may aim to gain space with [ b4 ] + [ a4 ]  [ b4 ]  [ a6 ]  [ Q b3 ] , [ O-O-O ]  Looks like it is going to be a race who get to the others kings first. Thanks to white 6th and 7th move black has a nice lead with h6and g5. Black is certainly better here.
 [ N f3 ]  [ B g7 ] , [ c3 ]  I don't want to get into the well-known (by others) c4. Black's bishop will bite granite.
 [ e5 ] , [ B c4 ]  I had been getting hammered on this opening on OTB play by 1800's and above when I as playing as black so I thought I would try it.
 [ Q h3 ]  [ h6 ]  [ f5 ]  [ K f7 ] , [ f x g6 + ]  21. [ f x g6 + ] - I now expose my opponent's king.
 [ K d2 ]  [ K x h5 ]  [ K d3 ] , [ K g4 ]  47. ....... [ K g4 ] - Henry decided to go up the board just in case the WK tries to stop my h pawn from crowning.
 [ Q x a6 ] , [ O-O ]  Black's King is actually not safe.
 [ N f6 ]  [ f4 ]  [ e x f4 ]  [ e x f4 ]  [ d6 ]  [ b3 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ B f3 ] , [ B h5 ]  Uh retreat is a bad idea here because BxB NxB QxN and white comes out ahead in this exchange 3 points. B[ x B f3 ] would have been better. QxB [ N c6 ] (to prevent QxPb7).
 [ R x g3 + ]  [ K h1 ]  [ R x h3 + ]  [ K g2 ]  [ Q h4 ]  [ R h1 ]  [ R x h1 ]  [ Q x h1 ]  [ Q x f2 + ]  [ K h3 ]  [ N g5 + ]  [ K g4 ]  [ Q f4 + ]  [ K h5 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ R g1 ]  [ N g3 + ]  [ R x g3 ]  [ Q x g3 ]  [ Q c1 ] , [ B e3 ]  And she resigned.
 [ N x g3 ]  [ f x g3 ]  [ Q f6 ] , [ R f1 ]  Place rook on f line to discourage queen from getting too close to my king. Rook can also threaten the f-pawn near Black's king.
 [ Q x d8 + ] , [ K x d8 ]  The exchange of Queens reduces the chance for fireworks.
 [ Q b6 ] , [ R b1 ]  Missed the Queen on this move. Moving the rook was seemingly the best move. If the bishop takes the pawn then the queen is in trouble.
 [ N f6 ] , [ h5 ]  this was the danger...
 [ c x d3 ] , [ Q x d3 ]  Now my queen is in the game
 [ N x b6 ]  [ a x b6 ] , [ B f5 ]  because of this move
 [ B c3 ]  [ b5 ]  [ a3 ]  [ K e6 ]  [ R e h1 ]  [ R x h1 ]  [ R x h1 ]  [ b4 ]  [ a x b4 ]  [ c x b4 ] , [ B d2 ]  26. [ B d2 ] - Jim has achieved a lot in his last few moves. He now gets the pawn majority on the queenside. I move the rook to [ a1 ] but would [ R h7 ] have been a better try here hitting at the [ g7 ] pawn and tying down one of black's pieces to it and then using one of my minor pieces to deal with the queenside pawn roll.
 [ O-O ] , [ B d7 ]  Here we leave the world DB with 8 games of 10... [ R e8 ] being the main move. This bishop is oddly placed on [ d7 ] and doesn't exert much pressure. The early [ N c6 ] allowed [ B d3 ] which robbed black of the [ f5 ] square.
 [ B x e6 ] , [ Q x e6 ]  My next Big Mistake. Should have taken the bishop with [ f e3 ] freeing up the rook.
 [ B x g3 ]  [ h x g3 ] , [ N x d1 ]  The compiications are over... I ended up ahead. This would be a good time for White to resign.
 [ Q e7 ] , [ h x g4 ]  hmmm one move after i did so he took it :P
 [ B b7 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N a5 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ N x b3 ] , [ Q x b3 ]  9. [ Q x b3 ] - I allow the exchange of lsb for knight because Glenda my queen replaces the lsb on that long diagonal in my previous note.
 [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ] , [ B c4 ]  Even after 2...[ d6 ] this is often what he plays. So I figure out what to do. I'm too experienced for this so he'd never do it. But just to be a little comfortable and try something different I'm pretending that he's attempting the SM. It absolutely isn't so but if I don't think of something this could lead to mistake similar to what happened when I did not play well and lost against one of my students.
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ B c4 ]  I was more hoping for Ruy Lopes and perhaps play the Marshall gambit or even the Open variation that I have played on few occassions but the problem was that I did not have any opening repertoire as black against [ e4 ] or any other first move by white.
 [ B c5 ]  [ K h1 ]  [ B b4 ]  [ b3 ]  [ N d2 ]  [ N e3 ] , [ B a3 ]  I made this move just in time to avoid forfeiting the game.
 [ d x c6 ]  [ e ]  [ p ] , [ b x c6 ]  ..but White prevents this.
 [ c6 ]  [ f4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ N g5 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ Q x g4 ]  [ N x g4 ] , [ B x f7 + ]  Only justification for the Queen sacrifice
 [ K e7 ]  [ N d6 ]  [ R b8 ] , [ N f5 + ]  The game is probably over now. Play should continue 31... [ K f8 ] 32. [ R d7 ] [ B f6 ] 33. [ N d6 ] [ B e7 ] 34. [ N x b7 ]  [ R d6 + ]  [ K f7 ]  [ R d7 + ]  [ K g6 ] , [ R x g7 + ]  If 34... [ K f6 ] 35. [ R h7 ] [ a5 ] 36. [ R x h6 + ] [ K f7 ] 37. [ N d6 + ] [ K g7 ] 38. [ R e6 ]  [ K h5 ] , [ R h7 ]  White missed 35. [ g4 + ] [ f x g3 ] 36. [ h x g3 ] [ a5 ] 37. [ g4 # ] Now if 35... [ K g6 ] 36. [ R x h6 + ] [ K f7 ] 37. [ N d6 + ] [ K g7 ] 38. [ R e6 ] picking up at least one pawn.
 [ d x e5 ]  [ N d x e5 ]  [ N x e5 ] , [ N x e5 ]  11. ...... [ N x e5 ] - followed by a plethora of exchanges.
 [ B x e4 ] , [ f x e4 ]  It can be seen how I have essentially moved the f-pawn to the d-file. Also an advance of my g+h pawns would suffocate White's counterplay. The only downside is the sudden passive nature of my d6-bishop.
 [ K c7 ]  [ N f7 ] , [ B e3 ]  Giving white a tempo to advance the king.
 [ f x g6 ]  [ Q h4 + ]  [ K g8 ]  [ Q x h8 + ]  [ K f7 ]  [ Q g7 + ]  [ K e8 ] , [ Q g8 # ]  But it was to no avail. The Black monarch was soon killed. At that moment the black queen's spell was lifted from eyes and I realised how I had been led into such a terrible war. I was confused didn't know what to do.... then I woke up in bed. It had all been just a dream. Damn that book of Bobby Fischer's it gave me chess nightmares! I won't do that again. It will have to be Kotov's "Think like a Grandmaster" tonight!
 [ a6 ] , [ B h6 ]  ?? offering an exchange of bishops
 [ d6 ] , [ B x f4 ]  pawn recovered but effectively he has castled and my planned kings gambit attack on his kingside has evaporated. could i have done anything different?
 [ N x f7 ]  [ R d e8 ]  [ N x d6 + ]  [ c x d6 ]  [ B b4 ]  [ K d7 ]  [ b x c4 ]  [ d x c4 ] , [ R f3 ]  Aiming to play 25.[ R g3 ] to contest that half open file and protect e3.
 [ d5 ] , [ b5 ]  signifying the Benko gambit.
 [ K c7 ] , [ K d4 ]  Attacking the Bishop
 [ B x f6 ]  [ Q x f6 ]  [ R f8 ] , [ Q x h6 ]  Worked exactly how predicted.
 [ a3 ] , [ d5 ]  2. .... [ d5 ] - after a second flank pawn move by Charlotte I decided to control the centre of the board.
 [ e x d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B b5 + ]  [ B d7 ]  [ B x d7 + ]  [ N b x d7 ]  [ N x d7 ]  [ N x d7 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ R f e1 ]  [ R f e8 ]  [ K f1 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ R x e8 + ]  [ R x e8 ]  [ f3 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ N e3 + ]  [ K f2 ]  [ N g4 + ]  [ K g3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N x f6 + ]  [ g x f6 ]  [ R d1 ]  [ K h8 ]  [ K f2 ]  [ h5 ]  [ d5 ]  [ R d8 ]  [ R d2 ]  [ K g8 ]  [ K e3 ]  [ K f8 ]  [ K f4 ]  [ K e7 ]  [ K f5 ] , [ b6 ]  What! I went b5!
 [ R e1 ] , [ K c3 ]  I should exchanged the f-rook but I remember I here thought I would now win the a-pawn and hence get 2 free pawns.
 [ h3 ]  [ Q d7 ]  [ h x g4 ] , [ h x g4 ]  Black got the passed pawn but it is endangered species.
 [ B x c4 ] , [ b5 ]  This reminds me of some of the Benoni positions I used to play and always lose...
 [ e5 ] , [ B c4 ]  2. [ B c4 ] - in response to a double king pawn opening we have the Bishop's Opening.
 [ N h2 ] , [ h6 ]  good move the idea is to avoid [ B g5 ] in the future what can be dangerous for me however this all so invitation trape for white 16.Bxh6-Bxh6.17.Qxh6-[ Q x f2 ] with the idea of Ne3+with good wining chances for example : 18.Rc1-Ne3+.19.Kd2-Nxc4+.20.Kd1-Nc4+.21.Kd1-Ba6.22.Rb1-Ne3+.23.Kc1-[ B x e2 ] and win a free piece and with wining position.
 [ R d c8 ] , [ f3 ]  ...so that I can finally secure my KP solidly.
 [ O-O ]  [ B b2 ]  [ B d7 ] , [ O-O-O ]  Castling on opposite sides often indicates attacks on both sides. Whomever has the faster attack usually wins.
 [ e x d6 ]  [ e ]  [ p ]  [ B x d6 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N g e7 ]  [ B x c6 ] , [ B x c6 ]  I like the bishops both targeting the king. And I didn't recapture with the knight because I want it on the kingside.
 [ a4 ]  [ N x c5 ]  [ d x c5 ] , [ R x c5 ]  with the vast majority of the pieces gone the picture become very clear. It is a pawn race but black will win because white is behind in moves because he has to make at least two moves in order to advance his pawn.
 [ R f4 ] , [ R g4 ]  White moves his rook to [ f4 ] attacking the rook at [ h4 ] protected by the pawn at [ e3 ] and nlack moves rook to g4.
 [ R e7 ] , [ K e1 ]  trying to get rex out of the way
 [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ B g7 ] , [ B e3 ]  I should say that I don't usually play the Dragon let alone the accelerated version except against my opponents precise order of moves and for quite a few reasons. First of all I avoid the Maroczy bind since White has already played [ N c3 ] and I also avoid the very critical lines with 9.0-0-0 in the main line of the Dragon since not having played [ d6 ] I could play [ d5 ] in one go and save a very important tempo.
 [ Q b3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ R f e8 ] , [ Q c1 ]  side steping any business with [ N c4 ]  [ N c4 ]  [ B x h6 ]  [ R a c8 ]  [ B x g7 ]  [ K x g7 ]  [ R a2 ]  [ N x d5 ] , [ B x c4 ]  This knight is the most dangerous of the two
 [ Q e3 + ]  [ K c2 ] , [ Q x c5 ]  Black is now a piece up. I am expecting [ R x f5 ] and followed with Black playing [ Q e7 ] and I think I can weather the storm. But
 [ e x d5 ] , [ Q b3 ]  Bringing his Queen out early. I don't why Bernard did this. My guess is that he's starting to face distractions as well. That's because my speculation is that maybe my opponent thought that he'd win a pawn with 8.Nxd5?? after which I win a N. Later on I find out that he wasn't going to take but I still think that a distraction played a role. However this move is not premature because there will be several threats affiliated with it when I get distracted and forget some things that Ken noted until it's too late.
 [ Q x e4 ]  [ B x e4 ]  [ N x e5 ] , [ d x e5 ]  Black get's rid of his weakness on [ d6 ] but I did't like black's ideas to come [ c4 ] with his knight plus I get my rooks quicker to open lines than he does.
 [ e4 ] , [ N f6 ]  Alekhine Defence..it's far more fun to play than most chess openings . it's also much underestimated opening . My openent is a good player i played him twice till now and both games are very nice.
 [ N d5 + ]  [ K b5 ] , [ N c3 + ]  An interesting moment psychologically. I had not yet worked out how White gets an advantage after [ c4 + ] and so I decided to play this move to see if I could tempt Black into either ... [ K a5 ] or ... Kc4. On 16. ... [ K a5 ] I was planning the spectacular line 17. [ b4 + ] cb 18. ab+ [ K x b4 ] 19. [ N d5 + ] [ K b5 ] 20. Rxa6!?! ba 21. N6[ c7 + ] with amazing complications. Believe it or not there is a good chance that Black will get mated on a1. However Freddy indicates that he is willing to play for a draw by repetition. Interestingly at this point he still thought that Black would have the advantage if White doesn't go for the draw.
 [ R h1 ]  [ Q e7 ]  [ N d1 ]  [ R h8 ]  [ R x h8 ]  [ K x h8 ]  [ Q e2 ] , [ K g7 ]  Now black builds a fortress. If I can exchange queens the extra white b-pawn will be meaningless as it can be blockaded on [ b6 ] and white will lack sufficient material to control that square.
 [ Q c2 ]  [ e5 ]  [ B g3 ] , [ B x g4 ]  More rain... I realized I had to react and soon.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ f4 ]  [ e x f4 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e5 ]  [ f6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ B b5 + ]  [ B d7 ]  [ B x d7 + ] , [ N x d7 ]  I felt a like-for-like (bishop-for-bishop) exchange was the right move here
 [ d4 ] , [ c x d4 ]  ?? Whoa!! Capturing with the e-pawn isn't pretty but giving up your Q???
 [ Q d4 + ]  [ K h1 ]  [ c5 ] , [ f4 ]  I want to clean the way for my rook on f-file
 [ N x e4 ]  [ O-O ] , [ f5 ]  gains space and allows [ K f7 ] to connect my rooks and remove my king from behind the [ e7 ] pawn on a semi-open column
 [ K f2 ] , [ R x g1 ]  If he takes with the Knight he loses the other Knight but it is better than taking with the rook...
 [ R x c6 ] , [ Q e5 ]  Q on [ e5 ] to forbid [ R d4 ] to move.
 [ R x e1 ] , [ R x e1 ]  With the Rooks gone I can now forget about the Bishop unless otherwise.
 [ Q x a4 ]  [ Q g4 ] , [ Q d7 ]  as you see i am trying for change but he did not accept So i did it by force ;) You will see next
 [ R h8 + ] , [ B x h8 ]  30. ...... [ B x h8 ] - the only legal move.
 [ Q x d7 ] , [ N f3 ]  better location for knight
 [ K x d2 ] , [ N x e5 ]  I won a piece but white has tree pawns to compensate and my pieces are now far less developed than his.
 [ N e4 ] , [ Q g6 ]  If he had decided to assert continuous pressure at this point he would have won the game easily.
 [ B g2 ]  [ h5 ]  [ h4 ]  [ g5 ] , [ R d5 ]  oh an opening
 [ e4 ] , [ d6 ]  I am not used to [ d6 ] defence hence from here on I did whatever seemed natural to me.
 [ K d2 ]  [ K d5 ]  [ K d3 ]  [ g x h5 ] , [ g x h5 ]  41. [ g x h5 ] - another pawn trade.
 [ N c6 ]  [ e3 ] , [ N a5 ]  5. .... [ N a5 ] - with the possibility of putting a knight in on b3. As is now my steed backs up my extra pawn on c4.
 [ B d5 ]  [ K e3 ]  [ h6 ]  [ K d4 ]  [ h5 ]  [ K c5 ]  [ R b7 ]  [ K b4 ]  [ R d7 ]  [ R c a3 ]  [ h x g4 ]  [ h x g4 ]  [ K h7 ] , [ B c5 ]  blockade on c5. nothing can stop now the e pawn.
 [ R x b2 ]  [ N x d1 ] , [ K x d1 ]  White has a fractured queenside pawn structure and has lost castle but is only down 1 pawn so still a competitive game.
 [ R g1 ] , [ Q x d3 ]  white takes the opportunity to gobble up a pawn paving the way for what is now a past pawn.
 [ K e5 ]  [ K e7 ]  [ h5 ]  [ K f7 ]  [ K f4 ] , [ K e7 ]  42. .......... Ke7. After this move we agreed a draw. I think white's next move would be [ K e6 ] holding back my king. Interesting game.
 [ e x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ R d8 ]  [ g4 ]  [ B x c5 ]  [ N x b4 ]  [ R x d3 ]  [ N x d3 ]  [ B x e3 ] , [ K x e3 ]  After I moved I saw a fork with [ N e5 ] then realized he could have responded in time with [ N d2 ] and fork
 [ O-O-O ]  [ O-O-O ] , [ Q e5 ]  ? Well the idea is to mobilize the queen away from lsb's way.
 [ R e8 ]  [ B h6 ]  [ B h8 ]  [ R e3 ] , [ B e6 ]  It is necessary to swap of the bishops. Sicilian players take note: it is very easy to fall foul of combinations reliant on the pinned [ f7 ] pawn.
 [ B e2 ] , [ f6 ]  In case i have to retreat my queen this move should also announce that I plan to castle on the queenside...
 [ N d2 ] , [ Q g5 ]  There we have it... After 19. [ Q x g5 ] [ N x g5 ] 20. [ K f2 ] f6! white's attack grinds to a halt... We do not want that...
 [ R x e6 ]  [ R x b2 ]  [ Q c4 ]  [ K h8 ] , [ e5 ]  Leontxo says this is a mistake. In fact [ R b1 + ] NxR QxN+ and white has a hard time defending against multiple threats. But here the simple [ N e3 ] seems to win.
 [ B x d3 + ]  [ K x d3 ] , [ Q b5 + ]  its over
 [ R h4 + ]  [ f4 ]  [ g5 ]  [ R f3 ]  [ K e7 ]  [ K d4 ]  [ g x f4 ]  [ K c4 ]  [ a6 ]  [ a4 ] , [ R h8 ]  offers the exchange of pawns
 [ Q b7 + ]  [ K e6 ]  [ Q x a7 ] , [ B h6 ]  ?? Doing what she can to stay in black develops. Although black was lost this ends the game even faster and is the worst blunder. Of course there are no good moves left anyway but this move is going to lose an additional Queen+Pawn for a Rook+Knight leaving black at a greater disadvantage. Although it loses another pawn 17...[ d5 ] was essential.
 [ B g3 ]  [ R h c8 ]  [ B e5 ] , [ f6 ]  27..."dizziness from success". Allowing W to get back into it. I had looked at R takes [ c2 ] trading the W rook and preserving the pawn advantage and then forgot(!) to make the move.
 [ N f6 ] , [ d3 ]  Not to my surprise he protects. But figuring that 3.[ c3 ] was inaccurate I decide to continue developing by pinning his Nf4. What comes to mind is what Ken recently taught me which is that it's not a good idea to break the pin with 4...[ B e2 ] So another way of saying it is that I'm trying to put compromises and even on Jack's position.
 [ c x d4 ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ B d2 ]  [ Q g6 ] , [ Q f3 ]  The only move.
 [ Q e2 ]  [ N d5 ] , [ B x d5 ]  I'm all too happy to trade with a comfortable lead on material.
 [ N f3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ e4 ]  [ d6 ]  [ h3 ]  [ e5 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ Q x d8 ]  [ R x d8 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ c6 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ O-O-O ] , [ B e6 ]  N until now all the moves were already played here black played this novelty but I don't see any point unless maybe to develop a piece and try to calm down the game
 [ Q e1 ] , [ B x d4 + ]  And now starts my destruction of his kingside!
 [ B h6 ] , [ b4 ]  If the plan was b2-[ b4 ] rather than d2-[ d4 ] what was the point of playing Rbd1?
 [ K h1 ] , [ N c5 ]  Attacking [ e4 ] with gain of tempo
 [ d5 ] , [ e4 ]  D00 Blackmar Diemer Gambit. This might be called the true Queen's Gambit - the Blackmar-Diemer. Like what the name of the game says
 [ Q e7 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ N c7 ] , [ R f d3 ]  Back to the old d-file theme.
 [ N x e4 ] , [ Q x c4 ]  White accepts the exchange and true is that I am far behind in developement and my opponent has an edge right now. But... how to capitalize on it?
 [ B x c4 ]  [ d x c4 ]  [ N c5 ]  [ R a d8 ]  [ N e2 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ Q x c4 ]  [ N b6 ]  [ Q c3 ]  [ B h4 ] , [ d x e5 ]  The first open file of the game and it's for Black!
 [ B g4 ]  [ h3 ]  [ B x f3 ]  [ Q x f3 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ B b2 ]  [ f6 ] , [ d3 ]  white created "holes" in his black squares on the queen side.
 [ b5 ]  [ d x c6 ]  [ Q b6 ]  [ B d5 ] , [ b4 ]  A fork! In this game I have to have my mini victories as I lose.
 [ e x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ c5 ]  Meanwhile I attack to hinder his development. But I overlooked his next move.
 [ N x d5 ] , [ e x d5 ]  Now I have a passed pawn which is protected by a rook.
 [ e x d5 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ B x d5 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ N x e5 ]  There goes another
 [ R f2 ]  [ Q x d4 ] , [ f x g5 ]  40. [ f x g5 ] This is a good idea on general principals you need counter play. This opens things up to allow it. unfortunately it plays right into his hand assuming he does as much trade off as possible.
 [ R f1 ]  [ K e5 ]  [ K c7 ]  [ f5 ]  [ K x c6 ]  [ K e6 ]  [ R e1 + ]  [ K f7 ]  [ K d7 ]  [ f6 ]  [ R c1 ]  [ K g8 ]  [ R x c4 ]  [ f7 ]  [ R g4 + ]  [ K f8 ]  [ R f4 ]  [ K g8 ] , [ K e7 ]  
 [ e5 ]  [ c5 ] , [ B d2 ]  A quiet continuation. 5. [ a3 ] is the more common move. 5. [ B d2 ] signals white's interest in trading dark square bishops.
 [ B a4 ] , [ b5 ]  I said chasing the ennoying bishop
 [ O-O ] , [ O-O ]  I saw both kings run to the sides. "Typical I thought hide away in the corners and leave us to risk our necks."
 [ c x d4 ]  [ B x d7 ] , [ N e x d7 ]  And the exchange is won
 [ e x d5 ] , [ c x d5 ]  White saves his [ e4 ] pawn but now black has gained the strong center and has much more mobility for his pieces. In addition his strong bishop pair is a decent advantage in such an open position. The black pawn on [ e5 ] is still hanging but now white would lose his knight after 18. Nxe5? Re1.
 [ K b8 ]  [ Q c7 + ]  [ K a8 ] , [ Q c8 # ]  
 [ B b7 ] , [ h4 ]  After black castles and white plays [ B x h7 + ] this pawn will help.
 [ e4 ]  [ e6 ] , [ N f3 ]  not playing [ d4 ] right away: for a change...
 [ B e8 ]  [ h x g6 + ]  [ K h8 ] , [ g7 + ]  [ g x f7 ] would have been fine too. 33.[ g x f7 ] [ R x g5 ] fxe8+(queen promotion) or 33.[ g x f7 ] [ B x f7 ] 34.[ Q f6 + ] [ K h7 ] [ Q x f7 + ]  [ R x g7 ] , [ Q x g7 # ]  Great game even if I have almost lost!
 [ R x e1 + ]  [ Q f1 ]  [ R x f1 + ]  [ K x f1 ]  [ c x d6 ] , [ N x d6 ]  The game is almost decided.
 [ a4 ]  [ B x d4 + ]  [ c x d4 ] , [ c3 ]  haha did you see that one?
 [ Q x g1 + ] , [ K e2 ]  olnly move he had
 [ K a7 ]  [ Q c3 ]  [ Q e7 ]  [ Q a5 + ]  [ K b8 ]  [ Q c3 ]  [ g5 ]  [ Q h8 + ]  [ K a7 ]  [ Q c3 ]  [ Q c7 + ]  [ K g1 ] , [ Q g3 ]  So after shuffling our queens around for a few more moves my opponent allows me to get a draw by repetition.
 [ B x g2 ]  [ K x g2 ] , [ d5 ]  An unsound attempt to break free. The Hungarian had t live with the idea of defending a backward pawn and to this end the best continuation was 15...[ e x d4 ] 16Bxd4!? (16 [ N x d4 ] [ N a6 ] 17 [ R d2 ] [ R a d8 ] looks playable for Black) 16...[ N a6 ] 17 [ B x g7 ] [ K x g7 ] 18 [ Q d4 + ] [ K h7 ] (it is important to put the king here in order to be able to repel the queen invasions on [ f6 ] with ...Ng8) 19 [ R d2 ] Rfd8! (19...Rad8? (19...Rad8? 20 Qb6) with chances to defend successfully White can improve on this line by means of 18 Rd2! [ R a d8 ] 19 [ e5 ] but Black's resources are not exhausted: 19...Nf5! (not 19...d5? 20 Qa1! with an attack) 20...[ N c5 ] and it is not easy for White to win a pawn without allowing some counterplay. Kotronias
 [ e4 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ N f6 ]  Here White should play [ d3 ] but plays a weird move instead.
 [ a3 ]  [ B a5 ] , [ g3 ]  A small blunder. My opponent said later that he just mixed up his plans with [ b5 ] and [ g3 ] and just played a touch too quickly.
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ B b5 ]  i start with ruy lopez.
 [ R c8 ] , [ b5 ]  Continuing my march Queen side.
 [ R e1 + ] , [ K d7 ]  And so the possibility of castling for black is nuanced
 [ K e8 ]  [ R f3 ]  [ R h8 ] , [ R f7 ]  23. [ R f7 ] - King Michael has managed to run away from the kingside and back onto his home square. I now give my opponent a bone in the throat.
 [ N x e5 ] , [ B d6 ]  Without giving it much thought as noted this was played to try and intimidate this runner. I figured that I'd get something out of it. I knew that he'd retreat but the joke is on me (as the saying goes). That's because I'm about to be punished when he reattacks.
 [ N f6 ]  [ R d3 ]  [ K g7 ]  [ h3 ]  [ B e5 ]  [ c3 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ B d4 ]  [ B x d4 + ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ K f2 ] , [ N d5 ]  [ d5 ] is a good square for the N especially since it is difficult to dislodge.
 [ g4 ]  [ R f8 ] , [ f4 ]  OK all now it's time for a stunning drawing resource. Really stunning. Yes really. Really really. OK fine just wait and see then!
 [ c5 ]  [ c3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B b5 ] , [ Q b6 ]  other move is bishop on [ d7 ]  [ B x c6 + ] , [ b x c6 ]  also can play and queen :[ c6 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ B a6 ]  now white have not short 0-0
 [ R c4 ] , [ B a3 ]  Black sees that after [ B c5 ] my R will be free to pick off more of Black's pawns. Black's K cannot fight. Game over.
 [ K b5 ]  [ B b7 ] , [ a8 = Q ]  To get the king in
 [ R x h7 ]  [ B x h7 ]  [ R f2 ]  [ B e4 ]  [ K f6 ] , [ a4 ]  Once again White plays a move that *ought to* compel resignation. Once again Black refuses to tip his King.
 [ R x e5 ]  [ f x e5 ]  [ N d7 ] , [ e6 ]  I'm trying to make that passed pawn.
 [ N x d5 ]  [ B x d8 ]  [ N x c3 ] , [ b x c3 ]  and now i have triple stacked pawns
 [ h3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ d3 ]  [ h6 ]  [ N d5 ] , [ N x d5 ]  I naturally don't want to let White plant his Knight on a powerful central outpost hence the exchange.
 [ R h3 ]  [ N f1 ]  [ K f6 ]  [ R g2 ]  [ R h4 ] , [ N g3 ]  not sure what happens here...
 [ B f5 ] , [ Q b7 ]  26. [ Q b7 ] - Glenda dares venture into the enemy camp - she is attacking the loose pawn on [ a6 ] but .......
 [ R e e7 ]  [ R x e7 ]  [ R x e7 + ]  [ K f6 ]  [ R x c7 ]  [ K e5 ]  [ K g2 ] , [ K f4 ]  Black's King is far more active than White's but there's no way to force a pawn through with that Rook drifting around on the 7th rank and the WK guarding the coronation squares.
 [ b3 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ B x c4 ]  [ b x c4 ]  [ f5 ] , [ R f1 ]  P-[ Q3 ] B-[ Q2 ] and then O-O-O would keep White solid. The WK is now firmly set in the center of the board which will allow for later attack.
 [ e6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ B e7 ] , [ N c3 ]  Well into than Caro/Kann/Panov attack now about even.
 [ B x d1 ]  [ R x d1 ] , [ a6 ]  I don't why black played this. His Q wasn't in danger because had he not played so I decided to play 17.[ B b5 ] he can defend with 17...c6.
 [ Q x f7 + ]  [ K h6 ]  [ B d2 + ]  [ K h5 ]  [ Q d5 + ]  [ K g4 ] , [ h3 # ]  
 [ B a3 ] , [ N b d7 ]  This move was not the best for him because C5 and E5 are blocking him
 [ d3 ] , [ B b4 + ]  I know he ( and I ) am going to castle long so thought I'd force [ c3 ] to weaken his queenside a bit.
 [ N d6 ]  [ N x d6 ] , [ Q x d6 ]  A whole piece down and nearing the end game White's prospects have faded away.
 [ Q x f4 ]  [ Q x f4 ]  [ B x f4 ]  [ N c5 ]  [ B f7 ]  [ g3 ]  [ B h5 + ]  [ B e2 ]  [ B x e2 + ]  [ K x e2 ]  [ R a e8 + ]  [ K d1 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ N b3 ]  [ f4 ]  [ g4 ] , [ f3 ]  Developing pressure in Quenn's side.
 [ Q x a3 ] , [ e6 ]  Setting the Queen on [ g7 ] and cutting off the defense of f5.
 [ K f3 ]  [ Q x d4 ]  [ K g3 ] , [ R e3 + ]  No matter where he went this is what I would've played. That's because I'm trying now to centralize his K until it's confined to one square where I would mate. But this time I don't need my K to do so. This shows the importace of protecting material.
 [ B c4 ] , [ R x g7 ]  Another Blunder I should have brought the Knight to [ d2 ] to protect against the next follow up check by the Queen after I lose mine...
 [ K e6 ] , [ K f8 ]  Now mine is in an excellent position to clear the enemy pawns. I my opponent plays [ K f6 ] I play [ K g8 ] If my opponent moves the king onto the d-file I play [ K g7 ] while [ g5 ] would be followed by hx[ g5 ] giving me a passed pawn.
 [ K x d7 ] , [ R g8 ]  Might as well attack something but this allows black a nice move.
 [ d x c6 ] , [ R b8 ]  get this bishop of the board
 [ B x e5 ] , [ Q b6 ]  Going for a Q exchange which is what I also would've done since Giuseppe's Q is starting to become a menace. In addition this will also fork and force black to exchange his undeveloped B. It's right here that I figure out the likeliness that this is in fact a draw. It's not clear cut yet but I begin to realize just how difficult it would be for Giuseppe to win.
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ B b5 ]  3. [ B b5 ] - This move is the Ruy Lopez/Spanish Torture.
 [ K d8 ] , [ Q x e7 + ]  No more need for the queens
 [ Q e6 ]  [ Q x e6 ]  [ N x e6 ]  [ B x f1 ]  [ N x f8 + ]  [ R x f8 ] , [ K x f1 ]  I trade material but lose my d-pawn. However I have a B v N advantage which I will look to make use of in the endgame. Also notice how all black's pawns are on dark squares. This is something I will have to change if I am to win
 [ B x f6 ]  [ g x f6 ]  [ N h4 ] , [ N e7 ]  in anticipation - moving into [ g6 ] as a buffer
 [ Q x b2 ]  [ N x e7 + ]  [ K h8 ]  [ R c b1 ] , [ Q a3 ]  White to play...
 [ N x e6 ] , [ R x e6 ]  Black takes the bait. It was better to lose a pawn than a pawn and the exchange.
 [ Q d6 ] , [ N f6 + ]  His Q is mine so I can go on attacking and bringing my pieces closer to his monarch.
 [ e x d4 ] , [ c x d4 ]  This exchange seems kind of silly. It undoubles my Pawns and leaves me with a strong flexible Pawn center.
 [ R x e4 ]  [ N x d6 ]  [ R f4 + ]  [ K g6 ]  [ R g4 + ]  [ K f7 ] , [ R f4 + ]  Here i offered a draw but white decided to continue on playing
 [ f x g5 ]  [ Q x g5 + ] , [ K d7 ]  ?! This is a grave error by Black as would have been [ K e8 ] [to continue [ Q f6 ] [ R g8 ] [ Q e6 ] ]. I expected [ K f7 ] or even [ K e6 ] leaving White with some work to do and perhaps even having to accept a draw.
 [ K g3 ] , [ R x g2 + ]  Swapping the Rooks and reducing White's winning chances to a value so close to zero that God herself couldn't tell the difference.
 [ K c7 ] , [ Q e6 ]  73. ...... [ Q e6 ] - Glenda is trying to nudge the WK to the side of the board. Henry will close in until he opposes the WK then Glenda will give the WK the kiss of death. My opponent sees this and waves the white flag. Whew another game that I could have lost was won - this victory resulted in a 13 point upsurge in my rating. Lovely! If there is a Part 6 I will let you know! Bye for now. Joanne
 [ h4 ]  [ Q e a6 + ]  [ K e4 ] , [ N d2 # ]  I had plenty of possibilities here but I felt my knight deserved the honour of being the mating piece as it had been relatively quiet. Shows that being forceful can pay off and my original queen did most of the damage.
 [ R x h2 ]  [ K c5 ]  [ K d7 ]  [ K b6 ]  [ R a2 ]  [ K x a6 ]  [ R x a3 + ] , [ K b7 ]  49 KxP K-[ B2 ] leads to a book draw.
 [ b4 ] , [ B g7 # ]  
 [ R c6 ] , [ K f2 ]  The boss has to give the example
 [ c3 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ R e5 ]  [ c6 ]  [ b4 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ R a e1 ]  [ B f6 ]  [ R f5 ]  [ B x c3 ]  [ R e f1 ] , [ B x b4 ]  Allows to develop pressure on c.
 [ N c3 ]  [ e5 ] , [ N d b5 ]  Putting my knight on an attacking square
 [ N d2 ]  [ R h d8 ]  [ R b2 ]  [ N g4 ]  [ h3 ]  [ N e3 ] , [ R g1 ]  According to my view 27.[ R f2 ] was better for her. In that case I would follow with 27...[ N g2 ] 28.[ R g2 ] and gain a slower victory than the actual. Anyway can you find my next move?
 [ Q e2 + ]  [ K h3 ]  [ Q f1 + ]  [ K g4 ] , [ R f4 + ]  !! Probably the prettiest move of the game and the Coup de grâce.
 [ e3 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ B d3 ]  ?! A little risky as 5...dxc 6. Bxc loses tempo for white.
 [ Q f4 ] , [ Q e7 ]  Prevent [ N g5 ] ... [ Q f7 # ]  [ Q x d4 ] , [ Q b4 + ]  Give check and offer Q exchange
 [ Q f2 ] , [ b5 ]  Overlooked the sacrifice
 [ R b1 ]  [ R x b1 ]  [ Q x b1 ] , [ Q a5 ]  At this point I was hoping for a chance to pressure his queen. 14. [ Q a1 ] [ N h5 ] 15. [ Q a2 ] [ N b4 ] 16. [ Q b3 ] [ N c6 ]  [ Q b2 ]  [ N h5 ]  [ Q c1 ]  [ Q c3 ]  [ Q x c3 ] , [ B x c3 ]  Trying to force trades.
 [ K e7 ] , [ B c2 ]  and the B makes way for its companion
 [ B h6 + ]  [ K e7 ] , [ Q g5 + ]  it is mate in 4
 [ N b3 ] , [ b4 ]  Not so much a sacrifice as a delayed exchange. I learned this technique from years of playing chess computers. I don't see it so much in human play. I can immediately get the pawn on [ b2 ] but it's [ b4 ] that I will want.
 [ a3 ]  [ R f d8 ] , [ b4 ]  ! The first of many tempo losses [ Q a5 ] cost me. No me gusta.
 [ f x e6 ]  [ e ]  [ p ]  [ B x e6 ] , [ Q f3 ]  Perhaps 15. [ e4 ] is better for White
 [ N e x c6 ]  [ b x c6 ] , [ N f5 ]  ! A double-attack the white knight threatens the pinned bishop and the loose g-pawn.
 [ R h2 ]  [ Q x c4 ] , [ R b8 ]  Hastening the Rook back into the game. But Alekhine has a trick worth two of that.
 [ K x a2 ]  [ K a4 ]  [ c3 ]  [ K a5 ]  [ K a3 ]  [ K a6 ]  [ K a4 ]  [ K b6 ]  [ K a3 ] , [ K a5 ]  (If i recall correctly black offered a draw here but white refused)
 [ g x h6 ]  [ e ]  [ p ]  [ + ]  [ R x h6 ]  [ R e h1 ]  [ Q h8 ]  [ N g5 ] , [ N f5 ]  [ R f8 ] might have been marginally better.
 [ K b1 ] , [ N b6 ]  If n[ x b6 ] a[ x b6 ] opens the a-file with strong attack. If the knight doesn't move then n[ x a4 ] b[ x a4 ] q[ x a4 ] is coming. I'm threatening q[ e5 ] in a lot of lines.
 [ K e8 ]  [ K g7 ]  [ R c5 ]  [ g6 ]  [ R c6 ] , [ f7 + ]  Thanks for reading
 [ B x e5 ] , [ B x d5 ]  black is now in position to increase his material advantage
 [ B d2 ]  [ N c5 ]  [ B c2 ] , [ Q b6 ]  This move is very ambitious remember if you go into another mans house you had better have a way to get out! Remember a battery is any two pieces placed along a file rank or diagonal that when you move one it release the power of the other!
 [ K d7 ]  [ K x f5 ]  [ K d6 ] , [ K x g4 ]  40. [ K x g4 ] - two black kingside pawns drop off yum and double yum says Henry!
 [ B g6 ]  [ N f3 h4 ] , [ B h7 ]  Taking the knight on [ f5 ] immediately could have been better to save him a tempo.
 [ N f x d4 ] , [ O-O-O ]  15.[ B x g6 ] was a strong consideration but the Bishop seems likely to get trapped back there and might even give Black an excuse to free his own LSB (via a trade on f5). Instead White accepts the loss of a pawn to activate his other Rook and get his King to a somewhat safer spot.
 [ B x c3 ]  [ R x c3 ] , [ N x b4 ]  19 [ Q b3 ] would have regained the pawn since the white queen can nab the [ b7 ] pawn and get out of there alive.
 [ R x c4 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ g4 ] , [ b5 ]  Sacrificing a pawn
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ d x e4 ]  Humph! Still no Winawer. While I have met this exchange before I didn't remember much about how to play against it so it was a case of working it out OTB.
 [ K h8 ] , [ R f1 ]  Or Bg6. I thought that exchanging the rooks would have facilitaded my taks stopping the pawn and the mate.
 [ B x f4 ] , [ f3 ]  Consolidating the pawn structure.
 [ B x e4 ]  [ Q c4 + ]  [ K h8 ]  [ B g3 ]  [ Q b7 ]  [ f3 ]  [ B d5 ]  [ Q g4 ]  [ B f6 ]  [ a3 ] , [ R f7 ]  24...[ e5 ] is much stronger. (opens bishop at [ b2 ] and breaks into white's King.
 [ c5 ]  [ d x c5 ]  [ N x c5 ]  [ Q e2 ]  [ B e6 ] , [ R d1 ]  Rook needs to attack queen
 [ N d6 + ] , [ K d8 ]  Black had the option of a knight exchange ending in doubled d pawns for white but opted to move the king instead. [ K f8 ] would have resulted only in [ B h6 ]  [ b5 ] , [ Q c2 ]  Nc3[ x b5 ] (leading to c[ x b5 ] Q[ x b5 ] and rethreatening [ N [ b7 ] ] ) may have been better but I do not remember observing the possibility of the [ b7 ] check at the time
 [ R a7 + ]  [ R e7 ]  [ R x e7 + ] , [ K x e7 ]  33. ..... [ K x e7 ] - one set of major pieces have been exchanged and I am the exchange up but after my loss against Expert Charles Higgie I am in no mood to count any chickens!
 [ N g3 ] , [ B x d5 ]  Alternative variation: 35... [ Q x a2 ] [the pawn is something Black will choke on] 36. [ N x f5 ] [Deflection: g6] [ N x f5 ] 37. R[ f x f5 ] [ Q b1 + ] 38. [ K h2 ] [ Q x f5 ] 39. [ Q x f5 ] $18 (39. [ R x f5 ] $6 [ g x f5 ] 40. [ Q x f5 ] [ B x d5 ] 41. [ Q g5 + ] [ K h8 ] 42. [ Q x d5 ] [ K g7 ] $18)
 [ N b4 ]  [ N e1 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ N x d3 ]  [ N x d3 ]  [ B e4 ] , [ R h g1 ]  I'd say black might have a thin edge as his rook is slashing down the d file very nicely.
 [ B d2 ]  [ N x c5 ] , [ a3 ]  I judged that it was time to challenge the bishop. Black's pieces are threatening superiority on my queenside and are both very well-placed. Time to get rid of one of them. Obviously 8...Ba5? 9.b4! loses material so Black has only one move here.
 [ R f h8 ] , [ B x g6 + ]  Then a white bishop made an attack at the Black King. He called across to his beloved queen. "I must resign" he shouted. "No fight on to the death" yelled back the black queen. And my eyes started to open. I saw for the first time the wicked cruel streak in her
 [ e4 ] , [ d4 ]  I was pleased that he decided on [ e4 ] rather than c4. If he had played [ [ c4 ] ] I would have been tempted to exchange as after N(g8) to either [ f6 ] or [ e7 ] he can play Ng5. Also I didn't really fancy the sharp lines of the Benoni or Benko Gambit reversed after 7. [ [ c4 ] ] d5.
 [ Q e7 + ] , [ K f5 ]  ?? Yikes! What about 76. [ K d5 ] [ Q f7 ] Kc6?????? Black now marks a '1' on the wall chart.
 [ e x d5 ] , [ e x d5 ]  I exchange pawns with him clearing up the e-file and leaving his king somewhat exposed.
 [ B e6 ] , [ Q h5 + ]  I place the first check of the game.
 [ N f3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ g3 ]  [ b6 ]  [ B g2 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N f6 ]  [ d3 ] , [ B e7 ]  black is playing an overly conservative opening...
 [ B x f6 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ B e6 ] , [ N x f6 + ]  Removes the problem bishop
 [ K a3 ] , [ N b3 ]  The best move. If a:b - [ Q a6 ] and [ c5 ] # ;
 [ K b4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ K x a4 ] , [ N f5 ]  threatening final hope for black
 [ K h8 ]  [ h3 ]  [ N x d1 ]  [ Q c4 ] , [ N f2 + ]  !! 23.[ K h2 ] [ B e5 + ] 24. [ K h1 ] [ Q x e1 # ] or 24.[ K g1 ] [ Q x e1 ] 25. [ Q f1 ] [ N x h3 + ] means queen is lost and goes down by even more. 24.[ [ g3 ] ] loses the rook and so once again the points is in such a bad position its not worth it. Lessons to learn 1.) Make sure if back rank mate is a possibility don't move pieces that can stop it This may seem like common sense but 20.Qxe6+?? may have seen like an OK move but because of the threat of back rank it turned out to cost white the game.(Although he was already down by 4 points) 2.) When facing attacks on rooks on the a1-[ [ h8 ] ] and h1-[ [ a8 ] ] diagonals always make sure you can protect these 3.) [ b3 ] [ b6 ] [ [ g3 ] ] [ g6 ] are generally good squares for the queen as they force the opposition to be on guard for a possible mate and also means they can quickly hope onto the a1-[ [ h8 ] ] and h1-[ [ a8 ] ] diagonals
 [ R x g7 + ]  [ K f8 ] , [ Q c3 ]  This might still be drawn but If somebody discovers that black was justified in declining the draw offer - please leave a comment!
 [ g x f5 ]  [ g x f5 ] , [ Q h1 ]  ! While it might not appear so at last I understand something that I wouldn't have several moves ago. The idea behind this isn't easy but to put more pressure on that N and force black to do something to avoid a checkmate with [ Q x g7 # ] It's a good plan here because by making things difficult on black white should have an overwhelming advantage from here on in.
 [ R e8 ]  [ Q x c3 + ]  [ K f1 ]  [ Q x d3 + ]  [ K g2 ]  [ Q d2 + ]  [ K g3 ]  [ e2 ]  [ R f e3 ]  [ Q e1 + ]  [ K h3 ] , [ Q f1 + ]  Black can't save the e-pawn in the long run but can make its capture fraught with danger.
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ d6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ a6 ]  5. ....... [ a6 ] (the first 5 moves are standard Sicilian. This is the Naijdorf although it does transpose into a position resembling a Yugoslav Attack)
 [ N c3 ] , [ R e8 + ]  checked the king just wanted to see how he would respond. I expected [ N e4 ] for the block but maybe he didn't want the knight pinned down...
 [ Q h5 + ]  [ K x f6 ] , [ f x e3 ]  (!) Perhaps Anderssen was hoping that his young opponent would lose his way in the mass of tactical complications but Morphy maintained a clear head. It turns out that the King's Gambit is not the only opening where the enemy king can be finished off on the open f-file...
 [ N c5 ] , [ N c3 ]  planning 15. [ N d5 ] with tempo and 16. [ N f6 ] (if black plays carelessly 15..[ Q d7 ] tant mieux :)
 [ K b3 ]  [ g4 ]  [ f x g4 ]  [ h x g4 ]  [ K c3 ] , [ f3 ]  ... [ g3 ] was clearly better but this still wins (time trouble!)
 [ N f3 ] , [ N f6 ]  Pretty common. But I still disagree with Isaiah's assessment. So what I told perrinn is Most common in this position is 2...[ N c3 ] which can lead to interesting variations such as the Ruy Lopez Guaco Piano or Four Knights Opening. So there are more variations but there is nothing wrong this move since it develops a piece and gets you ready to control the center. Now I could capture and exchange right away. But instead I do something else.
 [ B x c4 ]  [ N x c5 ]  [ b6 ] , [ N b3 ]  and now due to the pin on the e pawn I can push [ f4 ] to profit from the pin on [ e3 ]  [ K d2 ] , [ f x e3 + ]  and I achieved to improve even further my position
 [ Q h5 ] , [ N b4 ]  Having seen the weakness of [ d3 ] and [ [ c2 ] ] (B[ d3 ] can't leave to [ e2 ] or [ [ c2 ] ] pawn is freely taken) black hurries to double the pawns.
 [ B g5 ]  [ B e7 ] , [ Q f3 ]  This queen move seems too early but I'm not sure how exactly to make white pay for it.
 [ d4 ]  [ d6 ] , [ c3 ]  a bit unusual. [ c4 ] is better.
 [ e x d5 ] , [ N f6 ]  2... [ Q x [ d5 ] ] is a perfectly reasonable alternative but I hugely prefer this move it prepares a bunch of gambits from the one in this game (the portuguese) to the icelandic with 2... [ N f6 ] 3.[ c4 ] e6. Also it plans to retake on [ d5 ] with the knight instead of the queen. There is a maxim about not bringing out your queen in the opening this move follows that idea as 2... [ Q x [ d5 ] ] loses tempo to 3.Nc3.
 [ K g6 ] , [ R e7 + ]  Black is inevitable lost.
 [ R x h7 ]  [ B x g6 + ] , [ K f8 ]  Critically not blocking in the LSB.
 [ B x c6 ] , [ d x c6 ]  The Exchange Variation. I don't favor this myself so let's see where it will lead.
 [ N x d4 ] , [ B d6 ]  Both sides are developing their pieces quietly
 [ c5 ]  [ g6 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ B g7 ] , [ O-O ]  Would Bxc6...[ b x c6 ] benefit White?
 [ N b6 ] , [ B a2 ]  Black keeps two white pieces en prise but frees his bishop from the pin. White now has a discovered threat against the black queen but not while his rook is en prise.
 [ Q h6 + ]  [ K g8 ] , [ Q h8 # ]  1-0
 [ K x h8 ] , [ R h1 + ]  Another check for me! I have (short lived) bragging rights that I checked a chess master twice in one game. [@vladyslav] Concur I was doing just that until my plan failed then knowing his ranking advantage increases exponentially with less pieces it is fun just to prevent mate...besides I might get a draw :D Thanks!
 [ N x e4 ]  [ B x e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ e3 ]  [ f5 ]  [ B g2 ]  [ d x e3 ]  [ f x e3 ] , [ Q g5 ]  i think that the game is about equal.
 [ K f2 ]  [ B x f4 ]  [ B x f4 ] , [ R x f4 + ]  This wasn't necessary but it works too.
 [ N f6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ Q e2 + ]  [ B e7 ] , [ B b3 ]  Sozin like structure. virtually attacking f7.
 [ f4 ] , [ e5 ]  froms gambit. In article I red said that even Capablanka didn't dare top accept it and went for kings gambit with e4.
 [ N x d4 ] , [ e3 ]  Bit too late. A3 would have probably had the same effect after exchanging the dark squared Bishop with the white Knight.
 [ K h8 ] , [ B h6 ]  Take the offfence and keep putting pressure on him to make moves to protect also a lone queen can not mate by itself.
 [ B e4 ]  [ Q g8 ]  [ b5 ] , [ N c5 ]  23. ....... [ N c5 ] - improving the position of my knight.
 [ Q e2 ] , [ Q h5 ]  The queen is tied to the defense of f3...
 [ e4 ]  [ f x e4 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ B x e4 ]  [ R c3 ]  [ B f3 ] , [ K f7 ]  Cutting off the Rook's entry squares at [ K7 ] and K8.
 [ R a e1 ] , [ N x d4 ]  time to break up the tensions...
 [ R x f5 ]  [ d4 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ B c2 ]  [ R f6 ] , [ Q d3 ]  Subtle really subtle... Black will never see this one coming. Well it could happen... Or really all white expected to do was get his queen a little more centralized with tempo.
 [ K x f7 ] , [ Q e4 ]  Threatening to round up the pawn with Ne2.
 [ N f5 ] , [ R a d8 ]  Black is developing but does not seem to have a concrete plan to enact whereas my plan is quite clear: attack the kingside. the [ d6 ] square can be occupied but with little effect.
 [ N x g3 + ]  [ B e2 ]  [ N x h1 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ Q b4 ]  O-O-O+ won't work--cannot castle into check. :( [ R d1 ] could be good.
 [ B e6 ] , [ R b7 ]  ? The black knight (being placed on b2) is the real threat which 24. [ B e2 ] [ a5 ] 25. [ R x c4 ] [ B x c4 ] 26. [ B x c4 ] eliminates.
 [ K d4 ]  [ N d6 ]  [ K e5 ]  [ N e8 ] , [ d6 ]  Now My d-pawn keeps the king in place
 [ h3 ] , [ B f5 ]  I don't wish to have black's LB hanging around at [ g3 ] so I bring out my pawn to [ h3 ] and bishop retreats to f5.
 [ B c3 ] , [ R h f8 ]  Now my Rooks are connected....
 [ K c7 ]  [ K c4 ]  [ K b8 ]  [ K b5 ] , [ K a7 ]  Dear reader here you can understand that I have no idea how to play endgames...my King instead of face the enemy King with [ K c7 ] scared of him like a coward soldier recedes and almost stoop and let the way to him!
 [ d4 ] , [ B g4 ]  I thought that Ted was going to exchange on [ d4 ] since 3...ex[ d4 ] is the most standard response. Then white's response to this is 4.Nx[ d4 ] which is what I would've done. However Ted decided to pin my N. Not a bad way to. But I deemed this pin to be serious because allowing 4...ex[ d4 ] would force me to recapture with 5.Qx[ d4 ] which allows black to harass my Q with 5...Nc6. Well I didn't want to allow that as this would lose tempo which would allow black to continue developing whereas I'd fall behind. However I overlooked one thing. After 5...[ N c6 ] 6.[ B b5 ] pins the N and therefore does not gain tempo. Not only that but I'd be able to castle on the move after since that pin involves my LSB.
 [ N e5 ] , [ N e4 ]  Blockading a pawn sac [ e4 ] which would liberate white's pieces.
 [ Q x d4 ]  [ Q e2 + ]  [ K g1 ] , [ R x e3 ]  White resigned. He has only [ R c8 + ] and then when Black moves his Queen to safety White has nothing left and the noose has tightened around his King's neck. He would be forced to exchange his Queen for the Rook on [ e3 ] and then Black would mop-up.
 [ K d2 ]  [ Q x h6 ]  [ K e1 ]  [ Q h4 + ]  [ K e2 ]  [ R e8 ] , [ K e3 ]  An interesting choice to play the King forward.
 [ N e4 ] , [ Q g4 ]  Of course! White must put the question to [ g7 ] if he wants Black to make any concessions.
 [ N x a8 ]  [ Q x a8 ]  [ Q c2 ]  [ N c e5 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ b5 ]  [ f4 ]  [ N g6 ]  [ B f3 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ e5 ]  [ B x f3 ]  [ R x f3 ]  [ N h4 ] , [ R f f1 ]  23... [ N f5 ] is best.
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ] , [ c5 ]  I typically play the king's indian but I thought I would try something different considering that I had access to the gameknot database.
 [ Q x a6 ] , [ N b8 ]  An unexpected attempt to chase away the Queen. I could not resist forcing the knight to move again...
 [ f3 ]  [ R c8 ] , [ B h6 ]  Certainly this move is the point of White's setup Be3/[ Q d2 ] but after 13.[ f3 ] the dark squares around White's king look rather vulnerable. It may be wiser for White to develop his rooks before abandoning the central dark squares! Alternative variation: [e.g.] 14. [ R a d1 ] [ Q c7 ] [and now White can continue with the common 15. [ B h6 ] or try his hand on the queenside dark squares via 15.Qf2!?] 15. [ Q f2 ] [ R f d8 ] 16. [ N b3 ] [ N f d7 ] 17. [ N x c5 ] [ d x c5 ] [ and Black's initiative and pawn structure should give him better chances.]
 [ N x d5 ]  [ Q x d5 ] , [ Q c7 ]  I thought about continuing with my development which would've now been too little too late because of William's next move. But I had the [ c2 ] pawn in mind which will make things worse. So while material is level William is certainly winning here especially with his next move. But that's a signature of not having any experience.
 [ B d2 ]  [ R f7 ]  [ R a b1 ]  [ R d f8 ]  [ R g f1 ]  [ d4 ]  [ f3 ]  [ e3 ]  [ B e1 ]  [ R f7 f6 ]  [ g4 ]  [ R c6 ]  [ K d3 ]  [ R d8 ]  [ R h1 ]  [ N c5 + ]  [ K e2 ]  [ N e6 ]  [ K d1 ]  [ N g5 ]  [ B h4 ]  [ R d5 ]  [ B x g5 ] , [ R x g5 ]  not a lot has happened has it.... lots of moving my castles with no real change to the board
 [ K x f1 ] , [ R d1 + ]  Checking and maintaing the brutal pin.
 [ Q x c4 + ]  [ K e1 ]  [ B c8 ]  [ Q x h7 ]  [ Q c1 + ]  [ K e2 ] , [ R b2 + ]  The rook comes into play signalling the beginning of the end.
 [ N e g5 ]  [ N x h8 ]  [ N x h8 ]  [ B x g5 ] , [ h x g5 ]  Now I have the exchange and a very weak pawn structure by black. True I can't give the [ Q g3 ] check but I can still...
 [ B b2 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ e3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ B d6 ] , [ N f3 ]  This is the first deviation from the main line which would continue with 5. [ f4 ] before playing Nf3.
 [ h3 ] , [ h5 ]  6. .... [ h5 ] - it is very dangerous to play PxB here because it opens up the h column to a black rook. Now just stick the Wicked Witch of the West on [ h4 ] (should the [ f3 ] knight evade capture) and white is suddenly in Old Matey's shadow.
 [ e4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ e6 ] , [ N c3 ]  This is a rare subline. Themes will be the same as in the original but sometimes slight differences make a game.
 [ N a3 ]  [ Q d5 ]  [ N c2 ] , [ Q c5 ]  5.[ N a3 ] Qd5! 6.[ N c2 ] Qc5! An excellent move by CM9k that anticipates the coming 7 [ N e3 ] and bolts down the extra pawn. I searched in vain now for a way to exploit the position of Black’s queen but I could not find an effective plan.
 [ N d7 ]  [ N e2 ]  [ N c5 ] , [ N e f4 ]  
 [ c x d4 ]  [ N a3 ] , [ N f6 ]  Does not see the simple threat.
 [ N h4 ]  [ B a6 + ]  [ K e1 ]  [ b x c3 ]  [ b x c3 ]  [ Q b6 ] , [ Q c2 ]  [ Q b1 + ] has to be taken care of: pawn [ g5 ] will hold for now...
 [ B d2 ] , [ Q b8 ]  Black has to try and untangle himself. I thought that it would be best to do this by [ Q b8 ] [ R d8 ] and Nc7.
 [ K g3 ] , [ N c4 ]  Seeking to remove the blockader of the pawn.
 [ B x d3 ] , [ N x e5 ]  bluenoser: 9...Castle Again would this be a good time to castle? a_random_guy: 9.0-0 We might as well while we can. 9.0-0 yes
 [ N e3 ]  [ O-O ] , [ O-O ]  I castle to stay secure
 [ e x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ B x d4 ] , [ Q x d4 ]  Bam Boom Bam and out is the queen and it even threatens the pawn on g7. Coincidence? Who knows. ;)
 [ Q x d6 ] , [ Q h5 + ]  18. ... Kxf6? 19. [ N e4 + ] [ K e7 ] 20. [ N x d6 ] [ K x d6 ] 21. [ Q x e8 ] nets me a Queen and Rook for a knight
 [ K f7 ] , [ R h6 ]  ! threatening [ R h7 + ] winning the black rook.
 [ g6 ] , [ Q e5 ]  targeted the rook
 [ f x e4 ]  [ R d8 ]  [ a3 ] , [ R d d3 ]  Now I have two heavies in your face with minor threats they cut your reply options. Even if you defend your pawns I'll get control over significant squares on your home ground eventually something will give if I chip away.
 [ e5 ]  [ c4 ]  [ e4 ] , [ c x d5 ]  Now I decided to try and lead black in to a series of exchanges according the the following variation: 20...[ e x f3 ] 21. [ d x [ c6 ] ] [ b x [ c6 ] ] - here black can also play 21...[ Q x d1 ] leading to a zwischenzug move [ c x [ b7 ] + ] before capturing back the queen to further open the king's position... 22. [ Q x [ d7 ] + ] - to attract the rook to [ d7 ] 22...Rx[ d7 ] 23. [ N x a7 + ] - to coerce the king to [ b7 ] 23...K[ b7 ] 24. [ N b5 ] - sacrificing the knight to vacate [ c6 ] 24...[ c x b5 ] 25. [ c6 + ] - and the final objective to fork king and rook on the 7th rank 25...[ K c8 ] 26. [ c x d7 + ] Kx[ d7 ] 27. [ R f d1 + ]  [ e x f3 ]  [ d x c6 ] , [ b x c6 ]  here black can also play 21...[ Q x d1 ] leading to a zwischenzug move [ c x b7 + ] before capturing back the queen to further open the king's position...
 [ K f2 ] , [ B g3 # ]  ...mate! I hope you enjoyed this one. White made some mistake (so did I!) but overall he played very intelligent defensive moves in many occasions don't falling in easy traps.
 [ N x g5 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ Q e7 ] , [ Q x e7 ]  Another favorable trade.
 [ R f2 ]  [ a4 ] , [ K f3 ]  Now [ f1 ] comes and I lose my queen for a pawn. Or I can go on checking him until possible... I tried for a line that I hope will surprise my opponent based on tempoes. I miss my goal for one tempo.
 [ B e6 ] , [ K f1 ]  Man when will I learn...?
 [ c6 ]  [ Q x d8 + ]  [ K x d8 ]  [ B c4 ] , [ e4 ]  So after 11 moves Black has a major advantage in pawn structure and his pawn structure is also more open to development of his non-developed bishop. Black's king however is exposed and cannot castle as opposed to White's rather protected king and ability to castle. I give White a very slight advantage right now though it's extremely close.
 [ O-O ]  [ c4 ]  [ B e2 ] , [ b3 ]  I opted to push the b pawn so that it has a supporting pawn rather than grabbing the a pawn which can be captured later
 [ N x f3 + ] , [ g x f3 ]  This is the beginning of the fall once you start opening up your king. Things really started to unravel here.
 [ h5 ]  [ h4 ] , [ R g4 ]  28. ...... [ R g4 ] - that rook is gonna be a pain in the proverbials for many moves to come.
 [ B b3 ] , [ b4 ]  pushing my men to better squares.
 [ K x c5 ]  [ h4 ]  [ K d5 ]  [ h3 ]  [ K x e5 ]  [ h2 ] , [ R h3 ]  He can't promote his pawn because he has to take the king off the e file and when it does my R will check him.
 [ Q x f5 ]  [ h x g4 ] , [ Q x g4 ]  With my piece advantage I want to do the natural thing and trade down
 [ N c3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ c x d5 ] , [ N x d5 ]  I didn't expect this move even if it's played by many players.
 [ N a4 ] , [ Q e5 ]  I am willing to give up the pawn to continue my attack the the king
 [ f6 ]  [ R h e1 ]  [ B f7 ] , [ a3 ]  24. [ a3 ] - consolidation - supports [ b5 ] pawn and avoids an attack from black's lsb.
 [ d4 ] , [ d5 ]  ??? My opponent could have done this last move instead of losing a tempo.
 [ O-O ]  [ d x c6 ] , [ N b x c6 ]  11. ...... N[ b x c6 ] - black is now catching up in her development. What should I do? Ah I now move a pawn to my third rank [ a3 ] - standard prophylactic move to stop a move like Nb4.
 [ N f3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ e3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ d6 ]  [ c4 ] , [ R e8 ]  My plan is simple develop and resist the first White's attack
 [ a5 ]  [ b x a5 ] , [ b5 ]  ! i think that this the only way i can go for a win!! my two bishops control the hole board!!
 [ a5 ]  [ K g2 ] , [ R f5 ]  Turning down the h-pawn because after 26... [ R e4 ] 27. [ b3 ] [ R x h4 ] 28. [ K g3 ] (28. [ R a7 ] Rg4+) [ R e4 ] 29. [ K f3 ] White's king is active Black's rooks are not nor do they have any prospect of controlling the f-file.
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ c4 ]  [ c6 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ B g4 ]  Nothing surprising.
 [ B x h7 + ]  [ K h8 ] , [ B f5 + ]  (A forced mate happens after 22. [ R e5 ] although 22.[ B f5 ] is also fine )
 [ B x f6 ]  [ B x f6 ] , [ N e4 ]  This was another potential downside to moving the D pawn. Now my center was grossly extended.
 [ d4 ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ B b4 + ]  [ B d2 ]  [ B x d2 + ] , [ N b x d2 ]  all is fixed...
 [ R e2 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N f8 d7 ] , [ B g5 ]  Now things get interesting.
 [ R d1 ]  [ Q e7 ]  [ R e6 ]  [ Q c5 + ]  [ K f1 ] , [ R f d8 ]  Fischer is in his element. Intercepting the initiative he develops offensive potential all over the board with irrepressible energy. First of all he threatens 26... Bd5.
 [ B d7 ] , [ O-O ]  Yay more protection for him
 [ R h f1 ] , [ Q b7 ]  Perhaps this was the point of b5?
 [ N c6 ]  [ B d8 ]  [ b3 ]  [ B b6 + ] , [ K h2 ]  A little nervous here. The queen and rook could do damage on my king side
 [ R c7 ] , [ Q b3 ]  The b-pawn will fall.
 [ e5 ]  [ d3 ] , [ d5 ]  Black pushes for an advantage unbalancing the board
 [ B e5 ]  [ R d5 ]  [ R b c1 ] , [ K c8 ]  To me a draw is looking likely and I was thinking of swapping the rook and bishop for the pawn and queen
 [ h6 ] , [ R x h6 + ]  Retourning the courtesy and setting draw game.
 [ R d8 ] , [ R d1 ]  more support added because of the queen/rook threat
 [ R x h6 ] , [ c3 ]  I played this over [ N c3 ] because I wanted the knight on [ [ c5 ] ] via a [ d2 ] [ b3 ] [ [ c5 ] ] maneuver.
 [ c x b4 ]  [ c x b4 ]  [ Q x c2 ]  [ N x c2 ]  [ R a c8 ]  [ R f c1 ]  [ R c4 ]  [ b5 ]  [ a x b5 ]  [ a x b5 ] , [ B c5 ]  Can't aviud bishop's exhange...
 [ B x g7 + ] , [ N x g7 ]  i am sure Steinitz would have liked this... I feel a hedgehog
 [ R x e6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ Q h4 ] , [ B x a6 ]  I expected [ R a8 ] to pin my bishop to which I would reply r[ d6 ] defending the bishop and letting me stack my rooks on the D-file or exchange rooks either of which was fine with me.
 [ R e2 e1 + ]  [ R x e1 ]  [ R x e1 + ]  [ K g2 ] , [ R e2 ]  This set of moves would make things faster: … [ R b1 ] 39. [ h4 ] [ Q e2 ] 40. [ R e3 ] [ Q f1 + ] 41. [ K f3 ] [ Q d1 + ] 42. [ R e2 ] [ R x b2 ] 43. [ Q b8 + ] [ K h7 ] 44. [ Q e5 ] [ Q d3 + ] 45. [ R e3 ] [ B x e3 ] 46. [ Q x e3 ] [ Q f5 + ] 47. [ Q f4 ] [ Q x f4 + ] 48. [ K x f4 ] [ R x f2 + ]  [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ a6 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ f3 ]  [ b5 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ N b d7 ]  [ g4 ] , [ N e5 ]  ?! A major deviation from the normal lines which are 9...[ h6 ] or 9...Nb6. Perhaps my opponent saw somewhere that Black had scored well with this line despite the few number of games played...but this move clearly gives White the initiative and perhaps 14.[ f5 ] came as a surprise to Black...
 [ e3 ]  [ Q b6 ]  [ Q c1 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ c3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ N b d2 ] , [ R c8 ]  Whites queen isn't in a good place
 [ B a5 ]  [ B b2 ]  [ O-O ] , [ R a d1 ]  Rad1?! So far I've made some questionable rook plays this game. Obviously trying to grab the open file but black obviously has [ B d5 ] attacking the Apawn I just abandoned in the corner. Just lost a tempo.....
 [ e x f5 ]  [ N x f5 ]  [ O-O ]  [ b6 ] , [ R f e1 ]  Black returns white's potential threat against the queen with an immediate threat from black's white bishop.
 [ R g1 ]  [ g6 ]  [ Q h4 ]  [ R d7 ]  [ Q h6 ] , [ f6 ]  I may have given away my Queen but I'm not going to overlook the mate threat on KN2.
 [ N x e5 ]  [ R e2 x e5 ]  [ R a d8 ]  [ R x d5 ]  [ R d7 x d5 ]  [ B x d5 ]  [ R x d5 ]  [ R e7 ]  [ b6 ] , [ R x a7 ]  After this forced sequence I have gained a pawn and my Rook is more active so I believe this is a won endgame but unluckily I won't play precisely in the following moves.
 [ K h8 ]  [ N f5 ]  [ Q f6 ] , [ Q x c7 ]  27. [ Q x c7 ] - But the BQ has found another way to defend the [ e5 ] pawn so Glenda now takes off the c pawn. Now I am just two points down on material and more importantly all the pawns on the queenside have been liquidated.
 [ K f8 ]  [ K e2 ]  [ N e8 ]  [ K d3 ]  [ h6 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ f5 ]  [ h4 ]  [ N e5 + ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ B g3 ]  [ a5 ]  [ e4 ]  [ N d6 ]  [ B d1 ]  [ f x e4 + ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ K x e4 ]  [ B f5 + ]  [ K e3 ]  [ h5 ]  [ b3 ]  [ K e7 ]  [ K d2 ]  [ B h6 + ]  [ K c3 ]  [ K f6 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ B f3 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ B e1 ]  [ e4 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ B h2 ]  [ B f2 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ g3 ]  [ B h6 ]  [ B e1 ]  [ K e5 ]  [ B d2 ]  [ e3 ]  [ B c1 ] , [ K d6 ]  
 [ R b4 ]  [ g4 ]  [ B g6 ]  [ f5 ]  [ B f7 ] , [ N e6 ]  Targetting the weak [ c6 ] pawn.
 [ B f7 + ]  [ K d7 ]  [ B e6 + ] , [ K c6 ]  10. ...... [ K c6 ] - avoiding draw by repitition and I have nothing better than to whip off the [ g4 ] knight.
 [ K x d1 ]  [ R d8 + ]  [ K e1 ]  [ B c3 + ] , [ N x c3 ]  I also could've played 25.[ K f2 ] but didn't think about it. At this point I was in a hurry and it was almost time to leave. So I didn't give much thought other then the move played which wasn't so good either. As I willingly liquidate while behind but this wouldn't have happened if I had more time. Actually giving little thought I played that on my next move. I just had a plan to attack his [ N h2 ] which you'll see my next move. But Nathan will stop this on his final move.
 [ K x f7 ]  [ N x e4 ] , [ d5 ]  I build a classical pawn center and give the impudent horse a boot.
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ] , [ N f3 ]  !? not sure... [ c3 ] goes to the smith morra gambit!
 [ B f4 ] , [ Q b4 + ]  A triple fork.
 [ N g3 + ]  [ K f2 ]  [ R d3 ]  [ R f8 + ]  [ K e7 ] , [ R b8 ]  ?? No good moves left
 [ e6 ] , [ N c3 ]  I think this move is probably good since black in this position wants to play d5.
 [ f3 ]  [ R b1 ] , [ a4 ]  I look to trade off our isolated pawns
 [ B e7 ] , [ N x f7 ]  It works!
 [ B e2 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N d4 ]  [ b4 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ B b2 ]  [ c5 ]  [ c3 ]  [ N x e2 + ] , [ Q x e2 ]  White completes his development first.
 [ N c6 ]  [ B d5 ]  [ K a6 ] , [ B c7 ]  Taking the knight is an obvious draw
 [ K x c1 ]  [ K f8 ] , [ R h8 # ]  
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ B c4 ] , [ e6 ]  [ e6 ] is my usual defense for the strong bishop at c4.
 [ O-O ] , [ O-O ]  Both sides get their king off the dangerous open e file.
 [ R a6 ] , [ R b5 ]  Black intends as much as possible to keep the rook on the same rank as his pawn.
 [ Q x b6 ] , [ B d4 + ]  As planned.
 [ Q x d7 ] , [ B d1 ]  threatening Ba4. and heading to [ a4 ] either way.
 [ B f3 ] , [ B x d4 ]  I'd love to see 21. [ N x d4 ] [ N x d4 ] 22. [ B x b7 ] [ N f4 ] but that's a wet dream.
 [ R d8 ] , [ R x h7 ]  too easy...
 [ f x e5 ] , [ Q g5 + ]  Believe it or not I'm looking for a PERPETUAL here.
 [ Q x e4 + ]  [ K f2 ]  [ B c5 + ] , [ K g3 ]  7. Kg3? - this is a mistake according to the gameknot analysis. GK suggested [ d4 ] here although it gives up a pawn at least that move does open up a diagonal for the white dsb which will crucially defend the square [ f4 ] from a very nasty queen check there.
 [ R x c2 ]  [ R x c2 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ N d6 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ R b2 ]  [ R x b2 ]  [ B x b2 ]  [ h3 ]  [ B c3 ]  [ h4 ] , [ B x b4 ]  It is now a matter of time two passed pawns make for a won ending
 [ B x e1 ] , [ Q x e1 ]  ?? But Magnus took back. So in addition to pointing out why this was wrong I gave my student something else to think about by saying This however was another blunder. Ok why did I wait to take your Rook? The answer is that had I done it right away this move would be ok. But by getting out of check with 10.Kh2?? I was able to place you in check. Once you found the right move I took. But the idea is that by taking back you're going to lose more then just the Rook. What I'm implying is that had I captured immediately he'd get a bishop in return. With the delay the Rook was free because I recapturing I'm going to get his Queen and DSB. Right after this however I wasn't going to say anything else because of what ION noted in the fourth training game with knightrider62. He said that it doesn't pay to be critical when you have a won position. Although I sort of disagree with this I also understand why he'd say that. In my books there was always a chance of getting something back or drawing such as stalemate as I've seen with players like TA. But once I've won this material in addition to the Queen it's game over. In other words there's no chance of counterplay. Interestingly enough I came somewhat close to missing the next move. However after what happened in my second game against dynamic_dv where he won the Queen with a discovered attack that placed me in check I was able to do the same thing with this student.
 [ g3 ] , [ g6 ]  Preparing the fiancheto which is part of the benoni
 [ h x g4 ] , [ O-O ]  ? Instead of attacking castling just into the enemy's fire is a common mistake. Don't overestimate castling.
 [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ] , [ B e3 ]  continuing to develop
 [ N x b7 ]  [ Q x b7 ]  [ a6 ]  [ Q f7 ] , [ B b5 ]  It is White who triumphs on the white squares and he can also seize the open QB file at his leisure.
 [ c x d5 ] , [ B b5 + ]  check! more often then not black players will block with their LSB to get an easy trade off of LSB's maybe it is wiser to block with the knight in this instance with the hopes to reinforce the [ d5 ] pawn with the [ b7 ] pawn if white decides to trade his lsb for a knight.
 [ B x e6 ] , [ B x e6 ]  Giving [ B e6 ] a luxurious position. This strangles blacks movement quite a lot. not the least of all the Queen!
 [ N d2 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ a3 ] , [ B a5 ]  I was considering [ B x d2 + ] and trade off but his bishops were my main problem.
 [ N d3 ]  [ R f e8 ]  [ N a c5 ]  [ B c8 ]  [ N b4 ] , [ B x c5 ]  I don't see any choice on this move but it's what I was hoping for all along. I gives me two connected passed pawns in the middle that I can start pushing. My bishop will look weak after it has to go to [ b7 ] but I'll chase his knight away with [ a5 ] and then be able to put it on [ a6 ] later.
 [ K b5 ]  [ R b1 + ]  [ K c6 ]  [ d5 + ]  [ K c5 ]  [ R c1 + ]  [ K d6 ] , [ R c6 + ]  White's position has improved even more!
 [ K f6 ] , [ K d4 ]  ...and I put him on the attack to attempt to get in behind the pawns...
 [ K g6 ]  [ Q e8 + ]  [ K g5 ]  [ Q h5 + ]  [ K f4 ] , [ Q f5 # ]  37. [ Q f5 ] MATE!! Well played David!
 [ h5 ] , [ N d f3 ]  14. [ N d f3 ] protects [ N g5 ] and replaces [ N f3 ] classic post position. ...
 [ d x c4 ] , [ N b5 ]  Knight jumps to a precarious perch to threaten the bishop.
 [ N c6 ] , [ B c4 ]  bishop out... getting set up
 [ B e7 ] , [ e5 ]  ... I then move [ e4 ] pawn? - still behind in development Should have strengthened centre & castled
 [ N b d2 ] , [ N g6 ]  As Black desired.
 [ B c8 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ B x f5 + ] , [ R x f5 ]  stronger than [ Q x f5 ] [ Q f7 ] [ R h4 ] Rg8! [ R h6 ] Rg5...
 [ R b a1 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ a x b5 ]  [ a x b5 ]  [ b4 ]  [ B b6 ]  [ g3 ]  [ R d3 ]  [ R a c1 ]  [ B d4 ]  [ B x d4 ]  [ R x d4 ]  [ R e3 ]  [ R d3 ]  [ R x d3 ]  [ B x d3 ] , [ f4 ]  White missed the chance to skewer my king against my rook but I would queen with check and he would have a rook on [ h8 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ K f2 ]  [ K e7 ]  [ K e3 ]  [ R a8 ]  [ R a1 ]  [ R a4 ]  [ K d4 ]  [ R x b4 ]  [ K c5 ] , [ R b1 ]  And I can not believe my opponent play untill I checkmated him
 [ N c x e4 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ N c5 ]  [ B b1 ] , [ f5 ]  Black achieves his standard break with the added bonus that the [ e4 ] pawn is missing!
 [ d6 ] , [ c3 ]  I could be more aggressive here with c4. But I like the Q's opening with [ c3 ] instead of [ c4 ] just by taste.
 [ B x d4 + ] , [ R x d4 ]  This now improves white chances as i still have the bishop pair nearing the endgame which is a great advantage in most cases against the bishop and knight paring.
 [ c5 ] , [ B c4 ]  Not my favourite move against the Sicilian
 [ B x d2 ]  [ R d1 ] , [ B x e3 + ]  and I resigned...
 [ Q x e4 ] , [ f5 ]  now it's a matter of technique from white and resistance from black.
 [ R b8 ]  [ R b1 ]  [ c5 ] , [ R c1 ]  In Rook endings it's important do stay mobile and attack. I now threaten RxP and the slaughter of the Black Q side Pawns.
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e3 ] , [ e6 ]  at this moment better black defense whould be [ B f5 ] or [ K c6 ] in order to move [ e5 ] and break from the biginnig the wall. I think that he did not realize from the biginnig that he will fight a stonewall.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ d6 ]  Philidor's Defense - a little weak in my opinion.
 [ Q x c6 ] , [ Q c7 ]  Now he can because white's queen is not on the good diagonal. Why not o-o? Because black is absolutely sure white has no better choice than to exchange queens and that he will survive the attack.
 [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ B b5 ]  And a Ruy it is.
 [ Q x d8 + ] , [ K x d8 ]  so no balck castle possible anymore
 [ N x a8 ] , [ B x h1 ]  ¡Ñam! (read as: "gnam" :-). A little excercise: not to leave the knight escape!
 [ B c6 ] , [ B f5 ]  (( White is pounding at Black's [ e6 ] pawn and is planning to invade the position with his rooks. Kasparov cannot hold onto all his extra material and desperately decides to surrender his queen for a rook and a bishop. ))
 [ h4 ]  [ Q g6 ] , [ R c d2 ]  focusing on the central weak pawn.
 [ B x g2 ]  [ K x g2 ] , [ Q d8 ]  ?! This I remember was a horribly passive consolidation move made under lower time it gives away the majority of black's advantage although it has the idea of ...Bc5. It also avoids [ N a4 ] attacking the queen.
 [ N g5 + ]  [ K f6 ]  [ N e4 + ]  [ K g6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ R a1 ]  [ N x a4 ] , [ R x a4 ]  Black is happy maybe White could have delayed a capture and tried to sneak some of his pawns further up the board.
 [ N e5 ] , [ R e1 ]  The idea here was to force my way through with [ R x e5 ] Analysis calls this a blunder and prefers its mate in 9 35. [ g5 ] [ B f8 ] 36. [ g x f6 ] [ B x h6 ] 37. [ N x h6 + ] [ K f8 ] 38. [ B a4 ] [ N g6 ] 39. [ d6 ] [ R b7 ] 40. [ e7 + ] [ N x e7 ] 41. dx[ e7 + ] [ R x e7 ] 42. [ R d8 + ] [ R e8 ] 43. [ R x e8 # ]  [ N c7 ] , [ B h5 ]  Analysis calls this a blunder however it was intended to maintain the plan to blunt force with [ R x e5 ]  [ R x e6 ]  [ N e7 ] , [ B x f6 ]  Continuing with my elimination plan I can't see that black can do much to prevent it
 [ K d2 ] , [ R x f3 ]  White is in serious trouble.
 [ N b d2 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ B e2 ] , [ e6 ]  An immediate [ e5 ] from black would have opened some lines for black's bishops.
 [ B e6 ]  [ N d2 ]  [ N b d7 ]  [ N g f3 ]  [ R f c8 ]  [ R c1 ] , [ B b4 ]  (!)If you check out most of my annotations I almost NEVER give exclamations to moves even if they are very good. However I was very proud to discover this move and the idea behind it. It simply looks like a blunder at first sight since white can gain material getting of the 2 rooks for queen. However black has a strong idea in mind. Definitely an exclamation.
 [ B c4 ] , [ Q c7 ]  Queen needed to move here on move 5 in order to prevent the Bishop going to c4.
 [ Q h3 + ]  [ K f7 ]  [ d x e5 ] , [ K g8 ]  17. ..... [ K g8 ] - castled by hand wheew and double wheew!
 [ N h4 ]  [ B h7 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ B x d3 ] , [ Q x d3 ]  11. [ Q x d3 ] - bishop trade.
 [ N x e5 ]  [ N x c4 ]  [ N x c4 ] , [ d6 ]  Alternative variation: 7... [ d5 ] 8. ex[ d5 ] Nx[ d5 ] 9. [ N b d2 ] $16
 [ R x h3 ]  [ a3 ]  [ N d3 ]  [ R b1 ] , [ R x f3 ]  Mm I'm thinking Bd6. This lets the a rook slide over to the h rank. But this does even up the points.
 [ K f8 ]  [ N f2 ]  [ B e7 ] , [ N e4 ]  Aiming twice for d6.
 [ R x h4 ] , [ N d2 ]  [ B e2 ] right?
 [ N g6 ]  [ R d g1 ]  [ Q f4 ] , [ h5 ]  Now that my rook's are where I want them I will continue my push with the pawns.
 [ N x d4 ]  [ e x d4 ] , [ Q x d4 ]  Oh yes.... and Black lost a pawn as well. He is now left into the bargain an isolated d-pawn (a.k.a. IQP or 'isolani'). Note that White's Q is nicely placed unassailable in centre board.
 [ Q g5 ] , [ N f5 ]  Look at how many times both players are moving the same pieces again and again.
 [ N d7 ]  [ N x c5 + ]  [ N x c5 ] , [ b8 = Q ]  37. b8/Q - the black knight was lured away from the defense of [ b8 ] and now Glenda re-appears hitting again at the hapless [ d6 ] pawn.
 [ N f6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ b6 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ N b d2 ]  [ e6 ] , [ c3 ]  Not really necessary. The London attack must be played without any time loss and this move is not really necessary. I must have played the g/h pawns inmediately.
 [ K f3 ]  [ b5 ]  [ a x b5 ] , [ c x b5 ]  Uh-oh he has two connected passers
 [ g3 ]  [ B b4 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ B g2 ]  White plays a straightforward English Bremen opening. I've played this a lot as white but have not played against it.
 [ B e7 ]  [ O-O-O ]  [ O-O ] , [ h4 ]  thewrongreason: I'm not so used to seeing the h pawn advance so soon. I'm thinking that you probably played this to get an open file for the R. But there's a smaller thought process based on our last game. As it's also possible that you might be trying to surround and even attack the K side. I didn't want to play this but I have a feeling that 10...[ [ h6 ] ] is necessary to prevent something like 11.h5. As my fear is white being able to play 12.[ [ h6 ] ] where I feel there would be problems because of something similar that happened in our last game after our blunder. The idea being that the same B was sacked for a devastating attack and I'm looking into what variations would come in that could be devastating here. bhidragon: If you remember back to our discussion of the fundamental concepts of the Sicilian we mentioned speed. White is now going to throw a bunch of stuff at the Black King to see if anything sticks.
 [ h x g5 ]  [ Q x g5 ] , [ d5 ]  More than an attempt to open the d-file the text also wants to prepare the opening of both the a1-[ h8 ] and a2-[ g8 ] diagonals plus keep options available for activity on the b1-[ h7 ] diagonal.
 [ R c2 ] , [ R e8 e4 ]  I expected 42...[ R d8 ] with the threat of 43...Rd1+! 44.[ B x d1 ] [ R e1 # ] and that's also Fritz' preference.
 [ K h2 ]  [ Q f4 + ]  [ K g2 ] , [ f5 ]  Black is trying to get one of his rooks onto the side to enable mate.
 [ B a3 ] , [ Q a5 ]  spy a chance to attack
 [ B f4 ]  [ Q d7 ] , [ N c3 ]  14. [ N c3 ] - Dave deviates from the database at this move playing [ N c3 ] instead of Nd2. This throws me off the beaten track and into open play.
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ] , [ c3 ]  A number of book lines are available here: [2. ...[ d5 ] 3. ex[ d5 ] Qx[ d5 ] 4. d4] [2. ...[ N f6 ] 3. [ [ e5 ] ] N[ d5 ] 4. [ d4 ] cx[ d4 ] 5. cxd4] [2. ...[ [ e5 ] ] 3. [ N f3 ] [ N c6 ] 4. Bc4]
 [ K g3 ] , [ N x f8 ]  Taking back the rook and a strong position.
 [ Q h8 + ] , [ K f7 ]  Forced again. Here I thought white would take the [ a8 ] rook but I didn't see the final blow.
 [ B x c6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ b6 ]  [ O-O ] , [ N e7 ]  Looking back I now realize I should've attacked his pawn early with a pawn. I am not much for this move.
 [ K c3 ] , [ R f4 ]  [ K e4 ] is not better as the h pawn will fall to white's Rh8.
 [ N x e4 ]  [ d5 ] , [ N e5 ]  after 8...[ e x d5 ] 9.[ B x d5 ] the weakness on the [ f7 ] pawn comes too much into play
 [ B b4 ] , [ N d2 ]  Trying to protect the R and keep it in the semi open file. Much better was the simple Rf1.
 [ B x d4 ]  [ Q c7 ] , [ f4 ]  f4. Love/hate this move by White in the French. Extremely aggressive and a great way to get retribution for Blacks c5. Am positive you considered [ N b5 ] but most certainly [ f4 ] is much better in the long run.
 [ a x b5 ] , [ B x b5 ]  Now White has its King's Bishop in the game! If Qxb5?? then [ N x c7 + ] forking not just the King and Rook but the Queen too!
 [ N b4 ]  [ R f e1 ]  [ Q f4 + ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ Q x d2 + ]  [ R x d2 ] , [ N x a6 ]  now black is clearly winning
 [ B c3 ] , [ B a3 ]  White's Back rank is weak.
 [ b6 ] , [ N c5 e4 ]  I can now pin his knight and gain back some advantage.
 [ R e6 ]  [ R h c1 ] , [ Q x e4 ]  And blunders the queen lol! What does he have after Nxe4? Yeah....you got that right.... precisely NOTHING!!
 [ R x f4 ] , [ R x f4 ]  After 19. cd [ R x f1 ] 20. [ Q x f1 ] [ N d4 ] Black is better as I will soon activate my light-squared bishop and bring the rook to f8.
 [ f5 ]  [ R d5 ]  [ R e f1 ]  [ B x e6 ]  [ B x g6 ]  [ h x g6 ]  [ f x e6 ]  [ K h7 ] , [ R f8 ]  Sun Tzu "Ground equally advantageous for the opponent or me to occupy is key ground...in key ground I would hasten up my rear elements" (ibid. 11:4 17).
 [ B f5 ] , [ B d3 ]  I think this is unnecessary for white; he may be better advised to castle now and challenge the bishop on his next move. This may be with the bias of hindsight though!
 [ B c6 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ N g4 ]  [ c3 ]  [ N x e3 ] , [ f x e3 ]  17. [ f x e3 ] - this exchange of B for N does keep my pawns together.
 [ c6 ] , [ B g5 ]  !
 [ N e2 ]  [ R g h4 ]  [ N f4 ]  [ R h4 h6 ]  [ N e2 ] , [ R d6 ]  Completing the regrouping. Fortunately for Black his opponent has been in the meantime unable to initiate any worthwhile counterplay.
 [ B a4 ] , [ Q e7 ]  preparing a quaint little trap for white which unfortunately he did not see.
 [ N x e6 ]  [ R f f7 ]  [ N g5 ]  [ R f g7 ]  [ R d e1 ] , [ R a8 ]  the bottom row needs to be covered...
 [ R g1 ] , [ B h4 ]  Has white a way out? I thought castling was ok but [ N x e4 ] is looming anyway.
 [ R d1 + ]  [ K c7 ]  [ N d5 + ]  [ N x d5 ] , [ e x d5 ]  29. [ e x d5 ] - another set of pieces has been exchanged and more significantly a passed pawn appears on the d column.
 [ B c4 ] , [ Q h4 + ]  Anderssen attacks at once forcing Harrwitz' monarch to bestir himself.
 [ Q e3 ]  [ N x f1 ]  [ K x f1 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ N d2 ] , [ c5 ]  [ b6 ] might have tricked him... with the idea of c5...
 [ N x e4 ] , [ B x e4 ]  Now mate is threatened but easily avoided.
 [ N f4 ] , [ O-O ]  Time to tuck away the King.
 [ B d2 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ O-O ]  should castle here.
 [ Q g6 ] , [ B f3 ]  In case I had to move the knight no [ Q e4 + ] will bother me. It was a mistake. [ R h8 ] was the strong move threatening Re8+.
 [ g5 ] , [ h3 ]  Ineffective and further delays his counter-attack.
 [ N g3 ] , [ h5 ]  Now this is where I started to over-estimate my position again. I thouhght that if he castles [ [ [ h4 ] ] ] and his knight is forced back to [ h1 ] where is has no influence. I can follow with moves like [ B e6 ] 0-0-0 and [ g5 ] and a ready-made attack on his castled King. On the other hand I thought that 12. [ [ [ h4 ] ] ] would virtually rule out King side castling for him and is pawn on [ [ [ h4 ] ] ] could prove weak. Computer prefers the simple 0-0.
 [ B c4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ d3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ N g4 ]  Breaks the rule of moving same piece more than once in the opening...but there's a clear and present danger on [ f2 ] now. So...
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N x c6 ]  [ b x c6 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ d5 ]  [ N d2 ]  [ B e7 ] , [ R e1 ]  9.[ Q e2 ] 9.[ b3 ] or 9.[ c4 ] are all commonly played.
 [ N c6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ] , [ d4 ]  The idea behind my [ b3 ] opening to break open the queen side.
 [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ] , [ N x d4 ]  4. N x [ d4 ] (all book standard so far but Marin's next move takes me right out of the book - in the database there did not seem to be that many good lines for white after 4. ........... Qb6)
 [ f4 ] , [ B c5 ]  More queen chasing you bring the queen out early and all you can do is make her run all over the place like a chicken with it's head cut off until you block her in again or she gets herself killed.
 [ N c3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ d4 ]  Straight to the heart of things a good center play by White and all standard fare.
 [ K h2 ]  [ g3 + ]  [ K h3 ]  [ B f5 + ]  [ K g2 ]  [ K g4 ]  [ K g1 ]  [ h3 ]  [ R e3 ]  [ B e4 ]  [ R e2 ]  [ c3 ]  [ R a2 ]  [ c2 ]  [ R x c2 ]  [ B x c2 ]  [ K f1 ]  [ h2 ]  [ K e2 ]  [ h1 = Q ]  [ K d2 ]  [ Q d1 + ]  [ K c3 ]  [ Q d3 + ]  [ K b2 ]  [ B b3 ]  [ K a1 ] , [ Q c2 ]  
 [ e x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ] , [ B d2 ]  White wants to maintain the Bishop pair. In doing so he temporarily locks in his Knight on [ b1 ] but he can play [ [ c4 ] ] dislodging the Knight on [ d5 ] and allowing [ N c3 ] - a good idea? L-D-J points out that the [ [ c4 ] ] [ N c3 ] idea is no good because it leaves the weak backward [ d3 ] pawn on the half-open d file. Alternatively leaving the Bishop on [ e3 ] with Black taking it would give White a central e pawn and open the f file for his Rook - good compensation for losing the Bishop pair.
 [ O-O-O ] , [ b6 ]  This shows another disadvantage of takingwith the pawn instead of the knight. After castling the pawn on [ c5 ] was easier to attack since only the Bishop could have defended it. Now it's to late and still I try to attack.
 [ c3 ] , [ Q h4 ]  14. ...... [ Q [ h4 ] ] - after [ c3 ] asking Glenda where she wanted to go I chose h4. It is not very often you see Glenda on [ h4 ] (if black) or [ h5 ] (if white) even less so against an Expert.
 [ b5 ] , [ b3 ]  There's that move black wanted to make a while back and now supported by 3 pieces. I want to leave my pawn at [ d5 ] supported without advancing my e-pawn yet.
 [ B x d4 + ]  [ N b2 ] , [ Q x b2 # ]  
 [ Q e2 ] , [ B b6 ]  10. ......... Bb6?! - here is where I start to go wrong as this bishop retreat allows a pawn thrust to e5. Would a pawn exchange on [ e4 ] have been preferable here? If so there would have been the possibility of Glenda and Frere Lenoir lining up on the b8-[ h2 ] diagonal putting pressure on the h 2 square and leaving the possibility of a knight move to [ g4 ] to add still more pressure. But this doesn't happen and a series of exchanges will leave me in Old Matey's shadow on the h file.
 [ B g7 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ d5 ]  And now we're playing the grünfeld if memory serves me right.
 [ R h h1 ] , [ N d7 ]  so that the DSB can retreat and still protect the d pawn and open the e file for a rook move. Furthermore the knight on [ d7 ] covers [ c5 ]  [ N b2 ]  [ N c5 ]  [ R d d1 ] , [ R e2 ]  Black controls now 2 third of the board.
 [ c5 ]  [ R f d8 ] , [ N d3 ]  a fairly sensible move - in the current position ... [ d x c5 ] [ Q x d7 ] [ R x d7 ] [ N x [ c6 ] ] would hang the knight so the the knight has lost use on the [ c6 ] square. however now note that as whites knight is now on a light square it must next move move to a dark square meaning that black has the oppertunity to trap it or exchange the bishop for it
 [ B x h8 ]  [ f6 ]  [ h3 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ f x e5 ] , [ B x e5 ]  After the opening Black lost a rook and White has two powerful bishops on the a1-[ h8 ] and b1-[ h7 ] diagonal line.
 [ N c6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ B c4 ] , [ e6 ]  Although this isn't an uncommon move for black I always feel the black central pawns look a little uncomfortable.
 [ B c8 ] , [ Q h4 ]  Black doesn't see my threat. He thinks I merely moved the Q to get it out from the Bishop's fire.
 [ B g7 ]  [ g3 ]  [ d6 ] , [ N c3 ]  So that I can play d4-[ d5 ] in case if [ c5 ] or e5.
 [ N h5 ] , [ R x g6 ]  what a great move!!! it took me some time to see it all the way through. black is simply lost.
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ c4 ]  [ c6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ e3 ]  [ N b d7 ] , [ Q c2 ]  This is my first annoted game. In this game I want to show an unusual attack of the semi-slav game the Shabalov attack. At 6th a very usual continuation is the meran variation with 6.[ B [ d3 ] ] [ d x c4 ] 7.[ B x c4 ] [ b5 ] and now white must choice were to put his bishop ([ d3 ] o e2) with a loss of time. To avoid this I prefer to play 6.[ Q c2 ] which is the anti-meran variation.
 [ R e8 ]  [ Q h7 + ]  [ K f8 ] , [ R f1 ]  This is no doubt stressful for black and I really want to win it now as I took so many risks and am down in material even. Great to win against a strong player when you are down in sacrificed material I feel. This is the move by the "hopefully forgotten rook". You know the rook move we see can happening and screwing us over and we hope the other guy does not see or has forgotten about.
 [ N f5 ]  [ R c1 ] , [ R g6 ]  another counter?
 [ a4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N c2 ] , [ R f e6 ]  Purposeless move but it was difficult to find a plan.
 [ B e6 ] , [ Q c5 ]  The plan is to exploit White's king position and threaten Qe5.
 [ O-O ] , [ O-O ]  Both players protect the king's and have all their pieces developed but the quality of white's development is poor and for that black dictates play for the rest of the game.
 [ N d4 ]  [ Q d1 ]  [ O-O ]  [ f4 ] , [ N e c6 ]  White took the control of [ e5 ] but now his king is weak
 [ h5 ] , [ Q g5 ]  25. [ Q g5 ] - But Glenda ensures that appearances are deceptive and she is eyeing up Tim's pawn on g7.
 [ R x g7 ] , [ b6 ]  A futile attempt to bring the other rook to defend with a Bb7.
 [ e x f5 ]  [ R x f5 ] , [ N h7 ]  Now 28. [ R f7 ] loses to [ N g5 ] 29. [ R x e7 ] [ N x h3 + ] 30. [ g x h3 ] Rxe7.
 [ K b1 ] , [ Q x c1 + ]  At this hope I gave up hope of avoiding the end game.
 [ Q d2 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ R a b1 ]  [ h6 ]  [ a3 ] , [ N c d4 ]  Aiming to be a thorn in white's center.
 [ N c6 ]  [ e6 ]  [ f x e6 ]  [ B x e6 + ] , [ K h8 ]  Of course I would love to exchange my under-developed bishop but 16... [ B x e6 ] 17. Qxe6ch and my knight drops
 [ B x d3 ] , [ Q x d3 ]  10. [ Q x d3 ] - and now the bishops are traded off and the WQ is on a pretty good diagonal.
 [ K f3 ]  [ b2 ] , [ N e6 ]  another mistake by white as white is becoming desperate
 [ K c6 ]  [ N x a8 ] , [ K b7 ]  Now just a matter of time.
 [ g x f6 ] , [ Q g3 + ]  Now here move 25....q[ x b4 ] is punished the queen is helpless against the attack
 [ e5 ] , [ d3 ]  My position looks somewhat passive but I am very solid so if Black overextends then he could be left with weaknesses.
 [ e5 ] , [ f4 ]  Fischer said that the King's Gambit had been defeated. I might agree since GM's rarely play it at high-level tournaments. But canuto and I are not GM's so I always take a shot at it when possible.
 [ K b8 ]  [ R x g8 ]  [ R x g8 ]  [ B x h7 ]  [ R g5 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ B f6 ]  [ f4 ]  [ R g7 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ a6 ] , [ Q h5 ]  White maintains pressure and is now searching to simplify as the ending is academic
 [ b4 ]  [ N f4 ]  [ O-O-O ]  [ N x e6 ]  [ Q x e6 ] , [ R h f1 ]  Cogitating and cogitating. How white dearly would love to get his LSB on the h3-[ c8 ] diagonal and skewer the black queen to her king but I could not find the way to force it to happen. Though if I had not played 16. [ N h4 ] the way would be open for 20. H4 threatening 21. Bh3. Not that I think that would have worked and it's even less likely as a three-move combo. So instead white launches a mini-campaign against black's kingside pawns.
 [ R e7 ]  [ K f6 ] , [ N d5 + ]  27. [ N d5 ] - this knight move becomes pivotal to what is to come later.
 [ d2 ]  [ K e2 ]  [ K x b4 ]  [ a6 ]  [ K c3 ] , [ K d1 ]  55. [ K d1 ] - after I managed to stop the d pawn crowning black realises he cannot stop Glenda from reappearing cleaning up the two black pawns and then turning her attention to the enemy king and threw in the sponge.
 [ B b4 ]  [ Q b8 ] , [ O-O ]  Not budging an inch.
 [ N g6 ] , [ N d2 ]  White appears to be bringing its own knights over to the kingside to counter Black whilst also guarding against Black advances on the d or e squares. Which Black of course has no intention of making. Curious that White has played a very similar game before and lost with an unwise series of exchanges on the kingside that let Black's Q and rooks come into play. Assuming White is attempting to replay this game but using sounder strategy we'll presume we won't be invited to waltz into the precious kingside so openly this time. At this stage then just like in our complimentary game as White our opponent's Qside is beginning to look rather vulnerable ([ B b2 ] could change that a little). Here the centre may become the screen not just for kingside but queenside attacks as well building those little threats that Euwe wrote about until White just has too much territory to cover. Here the [ c6 ] movement will anchor our hanging d pawn in order to help accomplish this plan. [ B e6 ] may become delayed for [ b5 ] as Black's 10th move.
 [ N f6 ] , [ f3 ]  Why not Qc2? You get your queen off the back rank and threaten the pawn on c4. Actually [ f3 ] is a mistake (not a blunder). You hinder the development of your knight and your bishop. [ N e2 ] closes you bishop in unless of course you take the pawn on c4.
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ B b5 ]  The Ruy Lopez or Spanish Opening the second opening I ever learnt after the Giuoco Piano.
 [ R c b2 ] , [ R e c8 ]  I had not fully thought of all of my pieces during this move. I was locked in on the right half of my board. The computer recommended me moving [ R c1 ] at this point and I would concur. However the change in advantage was minimal.
 [ N x e4 ]  [ f5 ] , [ Q b3 ]  ? I think [ [ f3 ] ] would have been better gaining back the pawn for the piece. An example would have been [ [ f3 ] ] gx[ [ f3 ] ] gx[ [ f3 ] ] [ f x e4 ] [ f x e4 ] and the position would have been at least unclear.
 [ d4 ] , [ N b6 ]  Incoming fork. I thought 3 pawns would compensate for the piece quite nicely.
 [ g6 ]  [ d3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ d4 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ e3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ B d2 ] , [ N f6 ]  I have noticed that my toughest games was the ones that took this shape
 [ O-O ] , [ N a4 ]  Trying to exange the night for the bishop.
 [ B x f5 ]  [ B x f5 ]  [ N x f5 ]  [ R x f5 ]  [ Q d4 ] , [ N d7 ]  Black finally gets the last piece developed to a useful square--on move 17. However Black also has a significant material advantage.
 [ R a d8 ]  [ g x f5 ]  [ B x d2 ]  [ B x d2 ]  [ R x d2 ]  [ R b c1 ]  [ f6 ]  [ R e3 ]  [ R e5 ] , [ c4 ]  This may be risky but I plan to move g6. Hopefully he takes the bait then I reply with [ R g5 + ] and I can gain a lot of ground with both rooks on his side of the board.
 [ R d8 ]  [ R x e6 ] , [ a5 ]  This leads to checkmate in three but the alternatives were not pleasant either. Only giving up a lot of material postpones immediate loss. It is also too late for f7-[ [ f5 ] ] as white can play around the obstacle: 26... [ [ f5 ] ] 27. [ Q e5 ] [ R g8 ] 28. [ R x e8 + ] [ R x e8 ] 29. [ Q f6 + ] [ Q f7 ] 30. [ Q x f7 # ]  [ Q f6 ]  [ R g8 ] , [ R f3 ]  White misses a pretty mate in two with 28. [ Q e7 + ] [ Q x e7 ] 29. [ d x e7 # ]  [ a4 ] , [ R e7 ]  Again misses the pretty conclusion 29. [ Q e7 + ] and 30. [ d x e7 # ]  [ a x b3 ] , [ Q x f7 + ]  This time the queen sacrifice was easy to see checkmate next move 30. [ B x f7 ] 31. Rxf7#. Notice the unusual grouping of pieces around the black king after 31. Rxf7#: All pieces except the white king have gathered around him.
 [ N f3 ] , [ N c6 ]  Nothing strange going on yet. Had tried answering k[ f3 ] with [ d6 ] for a while but back to k[ c6 ] and am indifferent to the doubled pawn issue that can arise if he moves his bishop down. Used to hate that now do not see it as a big insoluable problem anymore.
 [ N f d4 ] , [ Q g4 ]  Offering to trade down the Queens.
 [ d6 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ B d7 ] , [ N g e2 ]  White builds his position in the classical way for this opening.
 [ B g7 ] , [ a4 ]  I was emboldened because of the diagonal my WSB commanded.
 [ K f3 ] , [ K g6 ]  Now Black's K joins the race for the centre
 [ g6 ] , [ Q d1 ]  Her home was indeed the better square. White has compensation for giving up the lead in development.
 [ B x f3 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ B x d4 ] , [ B x d4 ]  massive exchanges to simplify the position
 [ c x d6 ] , [ O-O ]  castling freeing up my knight on c3.
 [ e5 ] , [ O-O ]  Kingside castle. Now here comes the fun!
 [ B x b7 ]  [ Q x g4 + ] , [ K f7 ]  I don't want to corner my K with K-R2.
 [ Q x g4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ Q h4 ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ R x e8 + ]  [ Q x e8 ] , [ Q x d4 ]  Any capture of [ d4 ] or [ B b7 ] is great for White here
 [ N d2 ] , [ R f4 ]  .
 [ B f4 ] , [ N d7 ]  White attempts to protect his pawns. Right now the only counterplay he has is a pawn push on the queenside which he does do in a bit. I have the luxury of nothing urgent to deal with so continue with developing my other knight threatening [ e5 ] and c5. The black knight has done it's work fracturing white's plans to pieces. In this position the white rooks remain worthless for a long time. With care I think black should already have a won game.
 [ B x f3 ] , [ R g1 ]  My earlier mistake forces another move which I think I pay for much later on in the game in the form of an exposed K.
 [ e5 ]  [ B b2 ]  [ B x b4 ]  [ B x e5 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ a3 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ e3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ a6 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ c5 ]  [ O-O ] , [ N c6 ]  Blk has good hold on the center
 [ Q e3 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ Q f3 ]  [ N b6 ]  [ Q b3 ] , [ Q f6 ]  black manages to gain lots of space. the white bishop says all about White's position.
 [ R h6 ] , [ K x g2 ]  I had to take here since the [ R h6 ] move protects the invasion but also prepares to double on the h-file.
 [ R f8 ]  [ R a b1 ]  [ b5 ]  [ c4 ]  [ b x c4 ]  [ d x c4 ]  [ R g5 ]  [ R b6 ]  [ R h5 ] , [ K f1 ]  an other interesting situation: black's threat: mate on [ R h1 ] and white has a passed pawn. 30... [ R h1 ] 31. [ K e2 ] [ R x e1 ] 32. [ B x e1 ] [ c5 ] 33. [ R b7 ] [ Q [ e6 ] ] 34. [ Q d3 ] [ R e8 ] 35. [ B c3 ] [ B f6 ] 36. [ B x f6 ] [ Q x f6 ] 37. [ Q d5 ] [ K h8 ] 38. [ a4 ] [ Q c3 ] 39. [ R b6 ] [ Q c2 ] 40. [ K [ f3 ] ] Qx[ a4 ] 41. [ R x d6 ] [ Q b3 ] 42. [ K g4 ] Q[ a4 ] 43. Qx[ c5 ] [ R f8 ] 44. [ R d5 ] [ Q e8 ] 45. [ R f5 ] [ R x f5 ] 46. [ Q x f5 ] [ Q b8 ] 47. [ e5 ] [ f3 ] 48. gx[ f3 ] [ h6 ] 49. [ e6 ] [ Q b4 ] 50. [ K h5 ] [ K g8 ] 51. [ Q f7 ] [ K h7 ] 1-0
 [ B b7 ]  [ Q d3 ]  [ f6 ] , [ B g4 ]  '!' - Black's last move has created serious light-squared weaknesses which White rushes to exploit.
 [ e6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ b5 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ c6 ] , [ e5 ]  That finicky analysis said all these moves were mistakes or blunders. I can't believe it! The only thing I'm concerned about is this game and how Black responds to my moves and that's how mistakes are born.
 [ B d3 ] , [ B g4 ]  I thought I would go ahead and come out of the gate a little aggresive. I knew I had to jump on gcah2006 to many times allowing the better player to be aggresive I get into trouble fairly quickly.
 [ N x c6 ]  [ Q h4 ] , [ h3 ]  i made this move to prevent any possible ng4`s
 [ B d3 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ N a6 ]  Personally I think [ N d7 ] was better but this move is by no means bad
 [ Q d4 + ]  [ K f5 ]  [ g4 + ]  [ K g5 ]  [ Q x g7 + ]  [ K f4 ]  [ R f6 + ]  [ K e5 ] , [ R f1 + ]  phew!
 [ N e8 ]  [ N e2 ]  [ h6 ]  [ N g3 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ R c1 ]  [ f5 ] , [ e x f5 ]  Now pawn to pawn attack. Just an exchange though white pawn advancing and white side got a plus.
 [ K d7 ]  [ R e7 + ]  [ K c6 ] , [ R c8 + ]  After ...[ R c7 ] Rxc7#.
 [ Q d7 ] , [ K f1 ]  here the computer suggests that White's best move would have been [ K h2 ]  [ e x d5 ] , [ c x d5 ]  now I fully control the center. My score is +0.93
 [ N g8 ] , [ N d5 ]  Black responds to [ N c7 + ] which would fork Ra8.
 [ O-O-O ] , [ B c3 ]  Brings the bishop back to base and forces black to do something about the [ a5 ] knight that is under attack.
 [ R b7 ]  [ g4 ] , [ g5 ]  "Artifically" isolating the advanced White Pawn.
 [ N c3 ]  [ c x d4 ] , [ Q x d4 ]  Black has a central majority but will be hard pressed to take advantage of it.
 [ Q x a1 ] , [ g5 ]  Trap the White bishop in. He can't move it lest it be captured. Now I have to figure out a mating scenario.
 [ Q x d5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ e4 ]  [ N h4 ]  [ e3 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N e4 ] , [ B f4 ]  Not a great move for White as it frees [ f2 ] for the knight although I may have taken the bishop just to double up White's pawns and further expose the King.
 [ h x g3 ]  [ Q h3 ]  [ K f2 ]  [ Q h2 + ]  [ K e1 ] , [ Q x g3 + ]  So now black is winning once more and has another clear plan: Kill the king in the center area.
 [ B e7 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ h6 ]  ...h6? drops an important clogging center pawn. ...[ Q b6 ] was called for here. which would also serve two purposes: 1) help get king towards ...O-O-O; 2) make White think twice about moving the dark squared Bishop... development is more important. ...h6? does not help make the king more secure AND does not support the center.
 [ N g e7 ]  [ O-O ] , [ N g6 ]  9. .............. [ N g6 ] - must clear the line of Frere Lenoir to enable Henry to castle on the next turn.
 [ R a4 ]  [ K f5 ]  [ R a5 + ]  [ K g4 ]  [ R a4 ]  [ R e3 ] , [ K e6 ]  This would be stupid if White's N weren't pinned!
 [ B x f5 ]  [ g x f5 ]  [ R x h6 ]  [ Q x h6 ]  [ R h1 ] , [ Q g6 ]  This position is lost. Once the White R gets into the position Black will slowly but surely get worse.
 [ Q c6 ] , [ Q x d4 ]  Yep. This protects both knight and bishop. But that h knight remains at risk.
 [ K h1 ]  [ Q f3 + ]  [ K g1 ] , [ R x g7 ]  32. .... [ R x g7 ] - I finally recapture on g7. Now I am in a position to bring my rooks into the firing line. If one of my rooks ends up on the g file then Steve's king is certainly not long for this world.
 [ Q d6 ]  [ N e6 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B h3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ b3 ] , [ B h6 ]  I thought be bishop would be better placed on [ g7 ] after [ R g8 ] Bg7.
 [ K x f2 ] , [ R x d4 ]  so finally white will exchange the bad pawn...
 [ R a7 x a3 + ]  [ N x a3 ] , [ Q x a3 + ]  forcing trading Queens...
 [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ e6 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ a6 ]  [ O-O-O ]  [ B d7 ]  [ f3 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ h4 ]  [ O-O ]  [ g4 ]  [ b5 ] , [ N x c6 ]  We are falloing the game: Alternative variation: 12.

 [ a5 ] , [ B c4 ]  This stops the c-pawn from moving. However White's king is in a poor position so he needs to move the a-pawn to free the king. Also black maybe able to play [ [ a4 ] ] however I am not a fan because it places the pawn on a light square however this would free the c-pawn to be pushed. White will trade the bishop and have two pawns for his piece with one of them an outside passed pawn. Good thing with [ [ a4 ] ] is that it ties down the white king
 [ c3 ]  [ B g7 ] , [ R x d6 ]  I only discovered it here since this move was overlooked.
 [ Q h5 ] , [ f3 ]  help mate anyone?
 [ R c1 ] , [ B b6 ]  Also possible was 16...[ B d6 ] blockading the d-pawn but Black wants to keep this Bishop lined up on the WK to discourage White from pushing his center pawns too strongly.
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ N c3 ]  3 Knights Game. I have been playing this quite a bit lately but i think I am ready to try more aggressive openings. Although I do like how center is covered and the bishops haven't been committed yet.
 [ B e6 ] , [ N d8 ]  Looking for any chance to trade down.
 [ R c d1 ]  [ R f d8 ]  [ R x d4 ]  [ R x d4 ]  [ R d1 ]  [ R x d1 + ]  [ B x d1 ] , [ Q e6 ]  my king is too far to try the exchange.
 [ N g5 ] , [ B x d3 ]  dOUBLE BISHOP SACRIFICE. He thinks he has [ h2 ] covered but HAVE YOU SPOTTED THE ALT ATTACK
 [ O-O ]  [ B e7 ] , [ e4 ]  Now finally White opens out and takes on a more dynamic position with a strike at the centre.
 [ e4 ] , [ c5 ]  The Sicilian.
 [ Q e7 ] , [ N h6 + ]  If he takes my knight (I know it's unlikely) then I can recapture and have a won game.
 [ g6 ] , [ g4 ]  g4! now white go to the attack and may be dont do 0-0 :-)
 [ Q d3 ]  [ Q x d3 ]  [ e x d3 ]  [ a5 ]  [ R e7 ]  [ R b8 ]  [ b3 ]  [ h5 ] , [ R a e1 ]  Doubled rooks should be more intimidating.
 [ N x d4 ]  [ Q x d4 ]  [ Q x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ] , [ a6 ]  Roughly equal again. White has gained some air. I enjoy my space and double Bishops.
 [ N f3 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ N b d2 ] , [ d5 ]  Kind a loss of time but I can understand black' desire to control the center.
 [ f4 ]  [ B f6 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ B x d4 ]  [ R x d4 ]  [ R h g8 ] , [ R d3 ]  20. Rd3?? loses pawn.
 [ K x g5 ]  [ B g8 ]  [ h6 + ]  [ K f7 ]  [ B h5 + ]  [ K e7 ] , [ B g6 ]  black must lose his bishop and with it the game. hope you enjoyed. if you have any questions/comments or spot something i didn't feel free to message me. hope you enjoyed
 [ Q x d2 ]  [ B x d2 ]  [ B c2 ]  [ B x c3 ]  [ R x c3 ]  [ f6 ]  [ R f1 ]  [ N f7 ]  [ N f4 ]  [ g6 ]  [ N e6 ]  [ R f c8 ]  [ R x f6 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ B b3 ]  [ N g4 ]  [ R f4 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ R c2 ]  [ N d3 ]  [ R f6 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ h3 ]  [ N f7 ]  [ R c f2 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N d3 ]  [ R f2 f3 ]  [ N e5 ] , [ R g3 ]  Since he could not play [ R [ f8 ] ] to contend my rooks on the file and he has the [ f7 ] & [ f8 ] squares covered I saw no need for both rooks there. Better to get on the g file and harass his g-pawn since the king can't move forward.
 [ N d5 ]  [ N c6 + ]  [ K d7 ]  [ N x d8 ] , [ K x d8 ]  The black king can be chess by the white rook (and lost a piece in the d column) better to take with the rook
 [ Q d7 ] , [ N e5 ]  It now looks like white is developing a threatening attack but the black defensive structure is solid.
 [ B d3 ] , [ B f5 ]  The more indirect [ B g4 ] might be better positionally.
 [ N x f1 ] , [ Q f5 + ]  Black needs to play [ Q f6 ] to avoid checkmate - this line still ends in Black giving up a lot of material. It goes something like 22... [ Q f6 ] 23. [ e x f6 ] [ N x d2 ] 24. [ N e6 + ] [ R x e6 ] 25. Qxe6... I think Black has to take the pawn because of the mate threat which allows White to effectively finish the game with Bg8.
 [ B b7 ] , [ b4 ]  Trying to get that DSB out of the a3-[ f6 ] diagonal needed to prevent mate. If [ B x b4 ] [ Q x b4 + ] threatens Qe7#.
 [ B g7 ]  [ f4 ] , [ f6 ]  This is consistent with the passive defence to which Black has resorted and was probably prompted by the fact that 30...[ e x f4 ] cedes the central d4-square to the white knights.
 [ g3 ]  [ Q h3 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ B g4 ] , [ Q d3 ]  A little trick in the marshall is when the queen moves to any other square other than [ d3 ] and black's plays [ B f3 ] when mate can't be avoided on g2.
 [ B b4 + ]  [ B d2 ]  [ a5 ]  [ B x b4 ] , [ a x b4 ]  bishops off
 [ N a3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N b5 ]  [ N g4 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ R c6 ]  [ N x a7 ] , [ R c2 ]  The beginning of the end starts here.
 [ N c3 ] , [ e6 ]  Tempting him to Nh4.
 [ R a1 + ]  [ K g2 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ e7 ] , [ R e6 ]  scaring whites B & here I must admit black managed to do it.
 [ B d4 ]  [ K h2 ] , [ g3 + ]  and now the pawn will sail home. White resigned.
 [ K c6 ]  [ Q f7 ] , [ b5 ]  Hope that one does me somethin.
 [ Q x f6 + ]  [ g x f6 ]  [ g x h5 ] , [ R x b2 ]  (!?) Creating new problems elsewhere. I'm beginning to appreciate that this is the way Freddy plays: continually confronting his opponent with fresh problems to overcome.
 [ Q d1 + ]  [ K f2 ]  [ Q c2 + ] , [ K g3 ]  there it is...
 [ B b3 ]  [ B c5 ] , [ Q f3 ]  Still trying on 4 move checkmate... probably a mistake in retrospect.
 [ R a1 ]  [ R e8 ] , [ R a6 ]  Blacksaw the attack. I was planning [ R e2 ] next and he would have lost his bishop but now he has it protected.
 [ N e8 ]  [ b x a5 ] , [ c5 ]  Trying to get his own pawns to move but they are easily blocked by White's knight.
 [ N f4 + ]  [ K h2 ] , [ N h5 ]  Black could have won the b-pawn by playing 41...[ R b7 ] 42.[ R a4 ] Nd3.
 [ Q x h4 ] , [ Q e3 ]  Here she is finally... The rooks sacrifice has actually allowed black to bring in reinforcements.
 [ R e d1 ]  [ N d3 ]  [ R d2 ]  [ f3 ] , [ g3 ]  30. [ g3 ] - I try to keep my kingside castling position as closed as possible but it is still starting to look draughty.
 [ R c2 + ] , [ K e1 ]  I looked at Bishop A5 check but THEN I saw the ending combo...
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e3 ] , [ e6 ]  I mimic these moves keepng the board symmetric freeing up the bishops and queen...
 [ Q x f2 ] , [ Q b8 + ]  defends [ g3 ] and allows me to promote
 [ f4 ] , [ b5 ]  I was hoping to be able to move my B and develop my K-side pieces after this but...
 [ K h7 ]  [ N x h3 ]  [ g5 ] , [ K g2 ]  Could see the knight getting trapped so trying to give it an out.
 [ K g7 ]  [ R x f5 + ]  [ K g6 ]  [ R g5 + ]  [ K h6 ] , [ B g7 # ]  this is my first annotation i hope it was not 2 bad
 [ R f1 ] , [ R g4 ]  There is no protecting e4.
 [ B g4 ]  [ B e3 ] , [ N f d7 ]  the continuation of this variation calld Smyslov variation the idea of Fischer's last move 8...[ N f [ d7 ] ] is to maneuver hes knight from [ d7 ] to [ b6 ] and with the help of [ N c6 ] force the white move hes D pawn on [ d5 ] and than shock the center with the moves [ e6 ] and c5.
 [ R d5 ]  [ R x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ d2 ]  [ K c2 ] , [ K f7 ]  Black leaves the WK tied down at the edge of the board while he mobilizes his own.
 [ B c4 ] , [ N a5 ]  It attacks the N and gains tempo so I understand why Erika played this. But slightly better was 7...[ b5 ] and from there we can see where it goes. As right now the N also doesn't belong on the rim. Either way advancing the b pawn would be an inconvenience to Ole because he either has to block the center with 8.[ B d3 ] or 8.[ B e2 ] Or the only other alternative would be 8.[ B b3 ] and then would be the time would be to play 8...[ N a5 ] as now Ole would be forced to exchange his less active N for Erika's more active B.
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ B c4 ]  Still in book but we have the Guaco Piano as opposed to the Ruy Lopez.
 [ c x d4 ]  [ c3 ] , [ d5 ]  Black isn't interested in the gambit.
 [ g3 + ] , [ K f3 ]  Here White has an elegant mate in 2. After the quiet 16.[ K f1 ] or even 16.O-O! (cutting off g2) there is no way for Black to stop 17.Nh2#. Lasker however finds a slightly longer but highly amusing finish.
 [ N x f4 ] , [ g x f4 ]  One pair of minor pieces zapped...
 [ O-O ] , [ B g4 ]  Bishop development - this was the only logical place for the bishop. the [ f5 ] and [ h3 ] squares are prohibited for obvious reasons [ B d7 ] is too inactive and [ B e6 ] allows [ B x e6 ] weakening my pawn structure
 [ g x f6 ]  [ N c e4 ] , [ Q d4 ]  V.Anand wants to exchange queens
 [ h4 ]  [ K f8 ]  [ g5 ]  [ h x g5 ]  [ h x g5 ]  [ K g7 ]  [ K g4 ]  [ Q f1 ]  [ K f4 ]  [ Q c1 ]  [ K g4 ]  [ Q f1 ]  [ K f4 ]  [ Q c1 ]  [ K g4 ]  [ Q c4 + ]  [ R d4 ]  [ Q e6 + ]  [ K g3 ]  [ Q b6 ]  [ R d2 ]  [ Q b3 ]  [ K g4 ]  [ Q e6 + ]  [ K g3 ]  [ Q b3 ]  [ K g4 ] , [ Q c4 + ]  Drawn by agreement. ... 1/2-1/2
 [ R x d1 ] , [ Q e2 ]  Black gets to threaten mate again and there is really only one answer.
 [ c3 ]  [ R f e8 ] , [ Q f2 ]  This might not be White's strongest move. By offering the queen trade White will forgo any possibility of castling to a strong position and he ties his WSB to the [ e4 ] pawn defense.
 [ N e6 + ]  [ K f7 ] , [ N d8 + ]  Repeating the position not a problem in CC but in OTB it can have a psychological effect on your opponent who might just crack under pressure and deviate with a worse move.
 [ B x h6 ] , [ R c7 ]  It's trivial but 30. ... gxh6?? 31. [ R g1 + ] [ B x g1 ] 32. [ R x g1 + ] [ R h7 ] 33. [ Q g6 + ] [ R h8 ] 34. Qxh6#.
 [ Q f3 ]  [ Q x g5 ]  [ B x d5 ] , [ B e6 ]  [ B d7 ] would probably have been better. Alternatively [ Q g6 ] gives black a new line of attack while defending the black knight.
 [ K h5 ] , [ g4 ]  White resigns. The finish would be 54 K-[ R4 ] K-[ B6 ] 55 K-[ R5 ] P-[ N6 ] and the Pawn cannot be stopped from Queening.
 [ N d4 ]  [ R e d8 ]  [ R f d1 ] , [ N e5 ]  Preparing to land.
 [ N b d7 ]  [ Q f3 ] , [ Q c8 ]  Black wants to capture back on [ c6 ] with the queen.
 [ Q b6 ] , [ B e1 ]  24. [ B e1 ] - uh oh the familiar Jo Stevens passivits appears to set in ……..
 [ g5 ]  [ f x g5 ]  [ h x g5 ]  [ R a5 ]  [ R h4 ] , [ R x a6 ]  And drops another pawn. Now i have 2 pawns vs a bad bishop
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ] , [ B c4 ]  Black's knight to F6 this is the second move for black in the Bishop Openning Berlin defence book.
 [ N f6 + ]  [ K g7 ] , [ N x e8 + ]  black resigned and would be checkmated shortly
 [ B f5 + ]  [ N e6 ]  [ N e4 ] , [ Q f8 ]  26. ....... [ Q f8 ] - I see a possible knight fork on [ f6 ] but I am prepared to give up my rook for this pesky horsie. Dmaestro's dsb will go into the bargain.
 [ Q f6 ]  [ R a b1 ]  [ b6 ]  [ a4 ]  [ K c7 ] , [ Q g3 ]  Again my Q is prepared for discovered check.
 [ R c x b1 ]  [ R x b1 ]  [ R x b1 ] , [ a x b1 = Q ]  but wins back queen :)
 [ R h d8 ]  [ K c3 ]  [ N f8 ]  [ R h d1 ]  [ N e6 ] , [ b4 ]  And here I miss an opportunity. I failed to look completely earlier at what will happen on b4. We could have 26. ...[ a x b4 ] 27. [ a x b4 ] [ R x a1 ] 28. [ R x a1 ] [ c x b4 + ] and the king can recapture but the bishop is hanging; no matter what white does black will win one of the white bishops: if 29. [ K c2 ] [ N d4 + ] and if [ K d2 ] [ N x f3 + ] and the [ h2 ] bishop falls; if [ K d1 ] both bishop are attacked after Nxf3. Or if 29. [ K d2 ] then [ N c5 ] and the [ d3 ] bishop falls. To prevent this white could move 27. Kb2; but white's problems continue and black will likely still win a bishop. I however had stopped thinking tactically momentarily here deciding that nothing critical was going on a few moves before. Lesson learned: things change. I can see I'll have to look further ahead in my games at the tactics available.
 [ Q f3 ] , [ N h6 ]  Black defends against check not checkmate albeit a painful check (several free pieces for white).
 [ N x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ O-O ] , [ a5 ]  grabing space on the queenside and threatening [ a4 ]  [ a4 ]  [ Q d1 ] , [ N x f4 ]  removes a defender of [ [ e5 ] ] and preparing the advance of ...[ c5 ] with the aim of undermining the [ [ e5 ] ] Knight.
 [ R x a3 ]  [ N e6 ]  [ N d2 ]  [ R d8 ]  [ K c2 ]  [ N d4 + ]  [ K c3 ]  [ N e2 + ]  [ K c2 ]  [ N d4 + ] , [ K c1 ]  I did assume here he was trying for perpetual.
 [ R h e1 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ B x e7 ]  [ Q x e7 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ B x d5 ] , [ Q x d5 ]  13. [ Q x d5 ] - after two further minor pieces are traded off Glenda becomes further centralised and has her eye on the pawn on b7.
 [ g x h5 ] , [ g5 + ]  Black resigned because after 35 ... [ K g6 ] 36. [ B e4 ] [ Q x e4 ] 37. [ R x e4 ] White have enough material advantage to win.
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ c4 ] , [ c6 ]  the Slav Defence. the Slav is a solid line against the queens gambit where black retains some counterattacking chances.
 [ B x f4 ]  [ N x f4 ]  [ c x b4 ] , [ R x b4 ]  The most striking difference between these two positions is the activity of the rooks and minor pieces. White's rooks and knight are all dominating the board controlling a multitude of squares; by contrast Black's rooks and bishop are all huddled on the back rank controlling hardly any squares at all! I resolved to do something to sort this out immediately:
 [ d x c3 ]  [ e ]  [ p ] , [ N b1 ]  its the third time the Knight stands on b1.
 [ N c7 ]  [ R b2 + ]  [ K g3 ] , [ R a2 ]  I'm thinking liquidate the rooks if white will oblige then liquidate the knights if at all possible then eventually find a way to sacrifice my extra piece to eliminate a white pawn in such a way that my 3 vs. 2 pawn ending will be favorable. I expect white to avoid this eventuality.
 [ N e4 ] , [ B x a6 ]  ..although white has taken the piece black has the intermediate move to win material back straight away...
 [ e5 ]  [ N f5 ]  [ R f e8 ] , [ Q b2 ]  is good but not as good as Qd2. Alternative variation: 19. [ Q d2 ] [adds some pressure on the d pawn.] [ Q b8 ] 20. [ c x d5 ] [ R x c1 ] 21. [ R x c1 ] [ N x d5 ] (21... [ B x d5 ] [loses a pawn to] 22. [ B x a6 ] [ Q a7 ] 23. [ Q e2 ] $18) 22. [ B c4 ] N7[ f6 ] 23. [ e4 ] [ N f4 ] 24. [ B x f4 ] [ e x f4 ] 25. [ N d6 ] [ and white should not have a difficult time winning this.]
 [ N x e4 ] , [ g6 ]  ? Still Trying to push the pawn. I think it's to early for that
 [ B d7 ] , [ O-O ]  I must say the [ B d7 ] dosent do my opponent any good. He should have played [ B e7 ] in preparation for castling....
 [ K e2 ]  [ Q h5 + ]  [ K d2 ]  [ e x d3 ]  [ c x d3 ] , [ Q d5 ]  White is overloaded with little threats.
 [ a5 ] , [ N x e4 ]  12. [ N x e4 ] - narrowing the deficit by 2 points.
 [ B e4 ]  [ B x e4 ]  [ R x e4 ] , [ R a d8 ]  Basically now rock is active for free - white queen on [ e2 ] is not much better than on d1.
 [ Q x a4 ] , [ Q f6 ]  alright lets roll!!!
 [ B b3 ] , [ N d4 ]  And he swarms in. In most of the games that I've played I just allow the opponent to exchange my [ B b3 ] for the N.
 [ d5 ]  [ c4 ]  [ c6 ]  [ c x d5 ] , [ c x d5 ]  Tournament starting position
 [ B x e5 ] , [ N d7 ]  My dream of bishop [ h8 ] is just a dream because of f6!
 [ Q a5 ] , [ K b8 ]  Not [ a6 ] as I would've attacked (in my norm ;^) with 10. Bx[ a6 ] bx[ a6 ] 11. Qx[ a6 ] positional advantage still two pawns ahead
 [ N x d4 ] , [ N x e5 ]  Here I won a pawn. 8.[ B x c3 ] was the move trying to change his bad bishop.
 [ Q x e4 ]  [ N x e8 ] , [ B b7 ]  Black's last hope to mate white on g2. Always be careful when game s about to end.
 [ N f6 ] , [ Q e2 ]  !? This is where the Litus Gambit starts to look even stranger. The queen now blocks in the f1-bishop and it should be clear to black that the queen wants to go to [ b5 ] forking the king and bishop.
 [ B e1 ] , [ R a2 ]  White is now hog-tied by the [ R a2 ] and his weak dark squares. Black has a number of plans including picking up the Q-side pawns mating on [ g1 ] pushing the h-pawn invading down the g-file with the other rook etc.
 [ R f7 ] , [ Q x a5 ]  .
 [ B b1 ]  [ N c5 ] , [ B x h7 ]  White is back up a pawn
 [ R x c3 ] , [ N x c3 ]  Bad move I could have got checkmate in two moves.
 [ d6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B g4 ] , [ N a4 ]  White is now aiming for a Q-side pawn phalanx with which to crush resistance.
 [ N c5 ]  [ f x g6 ]  [ h x g6 ]  [ Q f2 ]  [ R f8 ]  [ e5 ]  [ B x e5 ]  [ Q h4 ]  [ B x d5 ]  [ R x d5 ]  [ N e6 ]  [ R f3 ] , [ B f6 ]  ?? +4.23/35 (23... [ N g7 ] +0.16/30 24. [ R h3 ] [ f5 ] 25. [ B f3 ] [ K f7 ] 26. [ R b5 ] [ b6 ] 27. [ B x a8 ] [ Q x a8 ] 28. [ B [ g5 ] ] [ Q e4 ] 29. [ Q x e4 ] [ f x e4 ] 30. [ R x e5 ] [ d x e5 ] 31. [ R h7 ] [ K g8 ] 32. [ R [ h4 ] ] [ N e6 ] 33. [ B h6 ] [ R f4 ] 34. [ B x f4 ] [ e x f4 ] 35. [ R g4 ] [ g5 ] 36. [ h4 ] [ K f7 ] 37. [ g3 ] [ K g6 ] 38. hx[ g5 ] K[ f5 ] 39. [ R [ h4 ] ] )
 [ B d3 ]  [ a6 ]  [ h3 ] , [ c6 ]  11. …… [ c6 ] - challenging white's queenside bind.
 [ d4 ] , [ e x d4 ]  Black correctly responds and could have a good game with further accurate responses. However from here many inaccuracies begin to accumulate.
 [ N f d7 ] , [ h4 ]  This seemed an interesting way of trying to box black in. As black's queen's bishop is blockaded by forced night move 4...[ N f d7 ] castling queenside is a lengthy process. Here I try to make a kingside castle unattractive as well...
 [ h6 ] , [ N f3 ]  I have been reading a lot lately about piece activity as it realtes to your pawn structure. I want to get my knight more involved in things as I see a future for him on black's queen side.
 [ N e6 ] , [ K f2 ]  Thinking about bringing the king in for defensive duties in order for a minor piece to activate.
 [ e4 ]  [ K d4 ]  [ e5 ] , [ K e3 ]  (!) Looks risky but the threat of mate reins in White's e-pawn: If now 50.e6? [ K f3 ] 51.[ K e1 ] [ R e2 + ] etc. The King dare not retreat to g1: 51.Kg1? [ K x g3 ] 52.[ K f1 ] [ K f3 ] 53.Kg1?? [ R e1 + ] 54.[ K h2 ] [ g3 + ] 55.[ K h3 ] Rh1#.
 [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ] , [ B c5 ]  But this however is where I start getting myself into trouble as I'm familiar with this move. I figured he'd play 4...[ a6 ] since it's still very similar but with a slightly different move order. Therefore although not a transposition I wouldn't be in unknown territory. What I didn't realize however is that it was all in book until we discussed it after this game. Figuring that this was played to exchange my more active N for his less active bishop I remember what Ken and Susan Polgar told me.
 [ B d3 ]  [ B g7 ] , [ B e3 ]  Reinforces [ d4 ] I thought black might play [ c5 ] with maybe Ne7. Really I guess it's just development.
 [ B d7 ]  [ B x d7 + ]  [ Q x d7 ] , [ d4 ]  White left the NCO-13 opening book at this point. Probably a benefit for me in looking for the first tipping point advantage. I would rather be closer to castling and maybe not have the queen off the back rank yet. BUT I'll take the possibility of advantage.
 [ e3 ]  [ e5 ]  [ Q f3 ]  [ f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ c6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ Q e4 + ]  [ Q e7 ]  [ Q x d4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ Q d5 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N b5 ]  [ Q e5 ]  [ Q x e5 + ]  [ f x e5 ] , [ N c7 + ]  a bad start...
 [ B e3 ] , [ B d7 ]  Now both Black's bishops are banging their heads against granite. And it's time for me to put the pressure on down that lovely open d-file.
 [ K b1 ] , [ N d6 ]  and now the knight protects the f pawn & attacks my rook ... All this could have been avoided with intermediate 19.[ N g4 ] move
 [ K e1 ]  [ R h2 ] , [ R x a4 ]  ...then 5-3...
 [ N c3 ]  [ e6 ] , [ h3 ]  Don't understand the point of this move... maybe to play [ g4 ] next
 [ K x f7 ] , [ Q f3 ]  Queen moving in for attack black must tread carefully not to lose queen. Kg E8 BG6 Kg E7 BG5 black loses queen if king not moved releaved check and queen taken with bishop.
 [ N f6 ]  [ B b5 ] , [ d6 ]  My guess is that Rotterdam did this for a pawn chain. But I would not have imposed the pin as black. This is one way that I need work because I don't like pins. So my thing was always to break the pin. In this position it was 4...[ B d7 ] only because Jack Stockel said that in general you want break the pin with the Bishop. During my second training game with Ken he said that I needed to give more thought then just what I was told. The big problem is that I failed to do that until I made that terrible blunder in the team game with which I got that lucky when the reality is that I should've been lost.
 [ e x d4 ] , [ e5 ]  A tipycal move in this kind of position.
 [ B f4 ] , [ d4 ]  Black trying to attack the h-rank rook
 [ Q e4 ] , [ B d7 ]  This was another bad move just giving up the pawn. I don't really know what was i doing in this game.
 [ B h3 ] , [ g6 ]  I still "threat" to release pressure.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d4 ] , [ B g4 ]  As Bobby Fischer noted "This is a weak move already."
 [ K e2 ]  [ B h1 ] , [ R d7 + ]  White begins a series of checks that drive Black's king into a corner.
 [ Q f5 ] , [ B d4 ]  its amazing how quickly things can change
 [ a5 ] , [ B d7 ]  With the intention to additionally block [ b5 ] and to probably harass the rooks. B[ b5 ] will totally dominate the f file. and I could play [ d3 ] ... [ B d4 + ] and [ N f7 + ] afterwards...
 [ N d7 + ]  [ K e7 ]  [ O-O ] , [ R a d8 ]  Aha! This looks good pinning White's knight and building up attacks on it.
 [ N f3 ]  [ c5 ]  [ e3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ e6 ]  [ O-O ] , [ B d6 ]  not much happening here: White has followed a slow version of this opening...
 [ O-O ] , [ B d6 ]  8. ...... [ B d6 ] - after white castles I clear the line for doing likewise. All very quiet so far but trust me there is about to be some action.
 [ B e3 ] , [ B g7 ]  Alternative variation: 4... [ c6 ] 5. [ Q d2 ] [ b5 ] 6. [ f3 ] [ B g7 ]  [ Q d2 ] , [ c6 ]  As far as I know Black usually plays [ c6 ] and [ b5 ] before the move [ B g7 ] but I don't think that this shift changes something seriously.
 [ K x b5 ]  [ N c3 + ]  [ K b6 ]  [ N d4 ] , [ g6 ]  useless move. It would have been better to bring the a rook on c file
 [ Q h7 + ]  [ K f8 ] , [ Q h8 + ]  White forced into playing winning exchange and wait for the win.
 [ N e7 ]  [ d4 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B d3 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ O-O ] , [ h6 ]  ? waste of time and weakens the kings side pawns. Knight to F6 or G6 would have been better.
 [ R a1 ]  [ B x a7 ] , [ R b b1 ]  Now is where if white plays as I suppose I'll get him in a sided undefended situation.
 [ N f3 ]  [ B g7 ] , [ B b5 + ]  The standard plan of the GPA.
 [ K a1 ] , [ b4 ]  White tries another way but this leads to a quick and brutal checkmate if he's not careful.
 [ d3 ] , [ e x d3 ]  10. ...... [ e x d3 ] - In retrospect although Master Freddy also took the pawn on [ d6 ] in his game I now think that it was probably an unnecessary waste of tempo. Perhaps [ N a3 ] or [ g6 ] were better here.
 [ b3 ] , [ Q b6 ]  I considered advancing a central pawn here 18. [ c5 ] dx[ c5 ] 19. dx[ c5 ] Bx[ c5 ] did not look very appetizing to me. 18. [ [ d5 ] ] cx[ [ d5 ] ] 19. cx[ [ d5 ] ] Nx[ [ d5 ] ] doesn't do much for white either nor 18. [ [ d5 ] ] cx[ [ d5 ] ] 19. [ R b1 ] [ c x d4 ]  [ h6 ] , [ R a b1 ]  eyeing the queen and preventing [ d x c4 ]  [ Q c7 ] , [ R f e1 ]  I thought a long time before this move as [ c5 ] looks good. However after 22. ... [ N e4 ] I have some tough choices and will probably end up with a backward pawn on [ d4 ]  [ B d6 ] , [ N e5 ]  loses a pawn but opens the center for my remaining white bishop
 [ K d2 ] , [ K e4 ]  Now this situation looks familier!

 [ c6 ]  [ B a4 ]  [ b5 ]  [ B b3 ] , [ N x b3 ]  Got the bishop
 [ N c6 ] , [ Q a4 ]  Keeping pressure on the knight but I am unsure what to do from here so recommendations please :)
 [ c x b5 ]  [ N x b3 ] , [ K f3 ]  Here I could win both White's pawns but after 55. ... Nxd4+; 56. [ K x f4 ] Nxb5; 57. [ N c4 ] and there is nothing to be done to save the pawn on b6. Knights are notoriously bad at stopping passed Rook's pawns but I don't have enough theory to know if K + N + hP beats K + N and I suspected it probably didn't.
 [ b5 ] , [ B b3 ]  A capture on [ b3 ] is generally not recommended since it further weakens the [ d5 ] square in black's position. He is forced to defend that square with pieces rather than pawns.
 [ K d6 ]  [ Q f8 + ]  [ K c6 ]  [ B e8 + ] , [ K b6 ]  he is running into a brick wall.
 [ N x f3 + ]  [ N x f3 ] , [ f x g6 ]  Swapping the knights gives [ f3 ] knight some trouble when the file opens for my rook(s)
 [ N f1 ] , [ R a5 ]  ?! I've said that there were no tactics in this game but this was Ubilava's one chance to tactically transform the position with a piece sacrifice: 15. ... Ncxe4!? 16. fe Nxe4. It looks to me as if Black either wins two pawns emerging with four pawns for a piece or he wins the exchange leading to a R+2P versus B+N situation. Curiously Mike didn't mention this possibility at all when we were going over the game so I don't know what his intention was. As for Ubilava I think that he was not interested in this variation because he intends to play a maneuvering game. This gives some valuable insight into grandmaster psychology. This may not be true for all grandmasters but I think that most of them when playing an amateur or in this case a low 2200 player would rather turn the game into a soccer game that they win 1-0 than play a basketball game and win 101-99. There is less of a chance for things to go wrong. It doesn't mean that Ubilava will avoid tactics but he will go into tactics only if they lead to a clear advantage.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ B c4 ] , [ N f6 ]  Berlin Defense of the Bishop's Opening.
 [ N b3 ] , [ Q b6 ]  I think Black is looking at [ f2 ] but with no support that will be a tough one. I don't like having both my knights placed so far from his (and my) King but this looks playable!
 [ c4 ]  [ Q a4 ]  [ N e2 ] , [ B a8 ]  ?? what else is there
 [ B x c1 ] , [ R x c1 ]  Also possible was 28.[ N x c1 ] but I wanted to prevent the same thing as now the risk while not immediate is ...[ R d4 ] and if he were to double up with ...[ R d8 ] and then the worst would be ...Rd1! which would lose a R. That's the perfect example of where two R's on one file is extremely dangerous. So this move stops black from the bringing a R onto the first rank even if black were to double up.
 [ B d5 ]  [ R a7 ]  [ c3 ] , [ N c6 ]  [ N [ e6 ] ] and pawn to [ e6 ] were considered but ultimately dismissed for this move. I know I can potentially lose castling with this move but an exchange of queens and a bishop for my knight and my queen is not too bad in terms of material and without the queens it's a bit safer for my king to not have the castling ability vs having queens and more pieces on the board. The more pieces on the board the more dangerous it is for the king to stay in the center usually unless it's somehow a very fixed position or board where pawns are stuck against each other and bishops knights rooks queens are cramped.
 [ a3 ] , [ g6 ]  I need to attack the centre pawns. I will try and get the bishop out. He might attack my knight if i moved [ N f6 ] giving me the run around. And i dont want to lose any pawns yet as it would open me up.
 [ K h8 ] , [ K h2 ]  Now the game is all over. White has trapped the black queen.
 [ K g7 ]  [ c4 ]  [ R h f8 ]  [ R x f8 ] , [ K x f8 ]  I'm ahead so I don't mind trades.
 [ Q x c4 ] , [ Q b7 ]  Instead black took the easy pawn and now it's all over for black. 27. ... [ Q x c3 ] lets him live a few extra moves.
 [ B e7 ]  [ N g5 f3 ]  [ c6 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N g f3 ]  [ b6 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ O-O ]  [ R e8 ] , [ c4 ]  it seems that the black pisces are missplaced and suffering from very passive and stuck game.
 [ R f e1 ]  [ Q d7 ]  [ R d5 ] , [ R f c8 ]  And that's being this move which is what I noted. And what's important to note is that my a pawn is still protected.
 [ K x g7 ] , [ b x a5 ]  Now Black's fate is sealed. The [ b7 ] pawn can't stop both my 5th rank pawns.
 [ B h3 ] , [ O-O-O ]  now there's two attackers and 2 defenders to the N but....
 [ e x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ] , [ B x d5 ]  The position seems great for black now although that's just how it looks since White has a rather cheeky move here.
 [ N c3 ]  [ h6 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ R e8 ]  16. ......... [ R e8 ] - backing up my e pawn.
 [ O-O ]  [ N h5 ]  [ R f3 ] , [ B x c3 ]  and he's taking e4...
 [ R a e1 ] , [ N h5 ]  This move seals Black's fate. 15... Q-[ K2 ] was the only chance.
 [ R f e8 ]  [ R e1 ] , [ N e4 ]  Of course I don't want a trade at this point.
 [ h6 ]  [ B x f6 ] , [ Q x f6 ]  Black's Q is potentially misplaced which could cost a tempo later.
 [ K h2 ]  [ R x f1 ]  [ R g8 ] , [ B d6 + ]  chessmate on [ R h1 ]  [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ f4 ]  [ e x f4 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ a6 ]  Black shoud consider developing instead.
 [ O-O ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ d4 ]  [ N d6 ]  [ B x c6 ]  [ d x c6 ]  [ d x e5 ] , [ N f5 ]  The critical position for the Berlin Wall. White has a kingside majority which he intends to advance. Black intends to blockade and prevent the kingside breakthrough.
 [ N a3 ]  [ a6 ] , [ c4 ]  13.[ c4 ] to create a breaking point.
 [ h4 ]  [ Q f5 ]  [ b5 ]  [ B e4 ] , [ f3 ]  Since I was late playing [ b5 ] the bishop had a flight square.. But I was determined to win material.
 [ R e5 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ R b8 ]  [ K h3 ] , [ K g6 ]  threatening ... [ K x h6 ] followed by ... [ K x g7 ]  [ K x h6 ] , [ N x f5 + ]  this desperado capture is white's best chance.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ] , [ N f3 ]  Alright this game is commentated by Nimzowitsch himself. I just found this in my book and thought that I would put it up. However if someone else has put this game up as an annotated game tell me and I will put this game down. Also you will note that Nimzowitsch will talk a lot about blockading in this game. Edited: I had trouble translating the descriptive form to algebraic so correct me if I am wrong somewhere.
 [ B x e7 ]  [ R f7 ]  [ R e3 ]  [ R x e7 ]  [ N b5 ] , [ N a6 ]  Black finishes development and hopes apparently to attack on the Kingside. But the N is hanging.
 [ R a d1 ]  [ R x d1 ] , [ R x d1 ]  Now white is in control and black has the awkward development.
 [ B a7 ] , [ c5 ]  I do believe that [ c5 ] isn't the strongest move here.. [ R e1 ] looks much stronger to me. The only way to avoid exchanging my queen for his rook is to play Be6. [ B e6 ] is standing there without any further meaning just a stubborn block to avoid losing the queen. Black also gets in a problem when white decides to move up the f pawn after.. Imagine a pawn on the square [ f5 ] and black is in serious problems
 [ e6 ] , [ B d3 ]  Not a very good posting for the bishop. It has nowhere to go from [ [ d3 ] ] and is doing the menial job the d-pawn could do better. So 3.[ [ d3 ] ] would have been a better move. But White could equally well have played 3.[ N c3 ] or 3.[ N f3 ] or 3.[ g3 ] with the idea 4.Bg2. All those would have been good options.
 [ B x b4 ]  [ c3 ]  [ B a5 ]  [ d4 ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B b6 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d5 ] , [ N e5 ]  This may not have been the best move - perhaps [ N f6 ] is better?
 [ c x b5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ a5 ]  [ N d5 + ]  [ K d8 ] , [ B b6 + ]  that rook becomes mine 100% sure left or right?
 [ Q b5 + ]  [ K c8 ] , [ Q x c6 ]  Black lost a knight. Not looking good for black....
 [ Q b6 ] , [ a4 ]  That Queen has to be stopped!
 [ K g2 ]  [ R g4 + ]  [ K h3 ] , [ R c4 ]  The White King can't support the advance of the f-pawn if it can't get adjacent to it.
 [ Q a4 ] , [ N d4 ]  Protecting the c-pawn and attacking my Bishop
 [ N f6 ] , [ K e2 ]  King - I want to join The rest of the army - NOOOO!!
 [ Q d5 ]  [ N x f2 ]  [ h x g5 ] , [ N g6 ]  Black is slightly too ambitious. Better here was [ N f3 ] but my opponent wanted to generate threats. I will soon be a piece up.
 [ e3 + ]  [ K c3 ] , [ Q x d1 ]  White resigned.
 [ B h3 ] , [ R g8 ]  I prepare for an attack on the g-file if White castles kingside. .........[ B x c4 ] looks like a good move since it severely weakens White's b-pawn but after [ B x f5 ] White has a lot of annoying threats mostly his attack on my pawn chain.
 [ K e3 ]  [ b3 ]  [ K d3 ] , [ K x f4 ]  43. ..... [ K x f4 ] - munch!
 [ Q g7 ] , [ K d2 ]  His kingside is about to come alive and I think it may even favor me but I am moving my king to safety. In an unusual turn of events Shredder agrees with both black and white moves here.
 [ R a d1 ] , [ B c8 ]  ! - The obvious square really.
 [ B x d2 + ]  [ Q x d2 ] , [ N e7 ]  Why not KnF6? KnE7 not only limits the knight's maneuverability but completely boxes in the Queen who otherwise has a nice diagonal track to develop against white's weak side.
 [ B d4 ]  [ O-O ]  [ R e1 ] , [ B d7 ]  I now feel pretty safe. I have a good position but am unsure of where to go!
 [ c4 ]  [ g6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ e3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ b3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ B b2 ]  The game started as a english opening but this takes the game in a differnet direction.
 [ Q b3 ]  [ Q b x b3 ] , [ c x b3 ]  Now the capture spree.
 [ N f6 ] , [ K f1 ]  17. [ K f1 ] - for want of nothing forcing at the moment Henry decided to move towards the centre.
 [ d x e4 ]  [ f x e4 ] , [ R d8 ]  There was nothing wrong with 22... [ R c2 ] planning doubling the Rooks on the 2nd rank and if 23.[ d5 ] [ e5 ] leaving the 'e4' pawn vulnerable.
 [ e4 ] , [ e6 ]  1....[ c5 ] is statistically the best.The Sicilian Defence puts a greater premium on tempo than other replies to 1.e4.I however as I"ve aged I prefer a slower game even giving up opening 1.e4.
 [ K x e1 ]  [ N x g3 ]  [ B x g3 ]  [ a5 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ B c3 + ] , [ K d1 ]  A blunder. Underestimates the power of the pin on d8.
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ f6 ] , [ B h4 ]  is this a playable line? - comments very welcome as i'm new to this opening
 [ R f2 ] , [ R d d7 ]  I'd say ? since the doubled rooks are potentially very strong. It forces me to Rf2-[ d2 ] and I can proceed with my simplification plan.
 [ e5 ]  [ f4 ]  [ e x f4 ]  [ B c4 ] , [ Q h4 + ]  !? A speculative move not considered the strongest reply leading to the type of tactics that appeal to KG players.
 [ f6 ]  [ Q e2 ] , [ Q f7 ]  15. ....... [ Q f7 ] - preparing [ d5 ] instead.
 [ K f1 ] , [ B x g1 ]  Normally exchanging a powerful active piece for a passive one is not a great idea but in this case Black not only has the chance to eliminate a critical defender but also wins at least one more pawn by removing the Knight.
 [ h x g5 ]  [ h x g5 ]  [ R x h8 + ]  [ B x h8 ] , [ N x g5 ]  ...and I'm fairly satisfied. The lsb is threatened and maybe [ d5 ] was the better move. Still black can now hardly defend his kingside and if [ N f6 ] is used in the exchanges [ Q h5 ] will be very annoying for black.
 [ B b4 ] , [ N h4 ]  Hitting the bishop. We are still in the opening database.
 [ R x c3 ] , [ R c1 ]  Now the Rooks come off the board.
 [ K g7 ] , [ N c3 ]  14. Nc3?? - a reasonable developing move but it allows a couple of knight forks to get Yours Truly off to a good start in my Part 2 MT.
 [ g3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B g2 ] , [ c6 ]  7. .......... [ c6 ] - white also develops on the flank and castles next move the purpose of this move is to try and negate the white lsb's path to [ a8 ] and perhaps prepare d5.
 [ K f2 ]  [ B g3 + ]  [ K g1 ] , [ R x e3 ]  Bearing down on the [ f3 ] square
 [ R x c5 ]  [ f4 ]  [ R c3 + ]  [ K g2 ] , [ g x f4 ]  I would eventually checkmate him so he resigns
 [ Q c8 + ]  [ K h7 ] , [ R f e1 ]  He saves both his Queen and Rook by attacking my King forcing it to [ h7 ] but then makes the mistake of trying to save his rook by pinning my Knight to my Queen. This mistake will eventually cost him his Queen and one Rook to my Bishop and my Knight when I place his King into check with three consecutive moves. A better move would have been [ R c1 ] to defend against [ Q [ c2 ] + ] even though it trades his Rook on [ f1 ] for my Knight. [ R f2 ] would also defend the [ c2 ] square but allow for me to play ... [ Q x b1 + ] taking his Rook without trading my Knight as well as continue attacking his King.
 [ K f6 ]  [ Q h4 + ] , [ K e5 ]  Every option for this move is no longer than mate in 2.
 [ Q c7 ]  [ f3 ]  [ N d6 ]  [ B g3 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ B x d6 ]  [ e x d6 ] , [ Q b5 + ]  Those three pawns conquer the center of the board alone. But he checks my king.
 [ N c6 ]  [ c3 ]  [ B g7 ] , [ d3 ]  at this point both players have to decide whether to castle long or short...
 [ N b c3 ] , [ B x c4 ]  Getting the free pawn.
 [ d4 ]  [ d6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ e3 ] , [ B g4 ]  I hate this variation of this opening. I must thinking where to place my Bishop. On [ e2 ] or on d3.
 [ Q x d2 ] , [ N e7 ]  Logical development in preparation for castling.
 [ R e2 ]  [ R x e2 + ]  [ B x e2 ]  [ B f7 ]  [ K e3 ]  [ g5 ]  [ N d3 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ K d4 ]  [ B a6 ] , [ N f4 ]  and another exchange...
 [ R d1 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ c4 ] , [ N x c4 ]  ?? - With this move I can deliver the finishing blows to the exposed king and attack the queen whose power has been greatly diminished in this game.
 [ B d6 ] , [ O-O ]  7.[ d3 ] allowing the [ c1 ] bishop to enter the game!!
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ] , [ N f6 ]  This is most likely black's most snarly move this promises to be a very spirited affair.
 [ R d8 ]  [ a4 ]  [ R b6 ]  [ Q c4 ]  [ R c6 ]  [ Q b4 ]  [ R b6 ] , [ Q a3 ]  Black seemed content to play for a 3-move repetition there but white isn't ready for that yet.
 [ R e8 + ]  [ B e2 ] , [ B x c2 ]  My plan here was to sacrifice my bishop to get a big attack and his king and queen. If he took here my next move would have been [ N x d4 ] attacking his LS bishop and his queen.
 [ R x b4 ]  [ R x b4 + ]  [ K x b4 ] , [ h4 ]  Black to avoid complications will just promote the h-pawn.
 [ B d7 ] , [ R e7 ]  7th rank madness.
 [ R f5 ]  [ K h6 ] , [ c4 ]  A well placed king is hard to beat and this is exactly why.
 [ N x c3 ]  [ R d8 ] , [ a4 ]  Computer doesn't like this move either because it misses the opportunity to trade off rooks and gain control of the open d file.
 [ R c f8 ]  [ g3 ] , [ B g5 ]  [ B e3 + ] is unneccesary. His king is good where it is at.
 [ K x a3 ]  [ Q c1 + ]  [ K b3 ]  [ Q x c5 ] , [ R x e6 ]  Yes White is completely winning — Rybka gives me a +5-pawn advantage. However over the board I didn’t know this and the win was still looking anything but routine. With all my pawns gone except the forgotten soldiers at [ g2 ] and [ h2 ] I’m not going to win any pawn races. Basically I have to play for either a checkmate or a major win of material. Fortunately the queen bishop and knight are an extremely effective attacking force and Black’s king is far from the rest of his army. For those reasons the position more or less played itself from here.
 [ c5 ] , [ e5 ]  Mission accomplished. No way to prevent Bxh7+.
 [ B x a6 ]  [ N x a6 ] , [ d3 ]  As mentioned earlier my d pawn can only advance one square since black already played ...d4.
 [ Q c6 ] , [ B g2 ]  putting the Black Queen at risk again...
 [ N x d4 ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ R x e4 + ]  [ B e7 ]  [ R x d4 ] , [ a6 ]  Not surprisingly Ted attacks now.
 [ R x e3 ]  [ R a2 + ]  [ K d3 ]  [ R a3 ]  [ R e5 + ]  [ K c6 ]  [ R e6 + ] , [ K b7 ]  White is trying to get revenge on me.
 [ O-O ] , [ a6 ]  this loses a pawn! I believe this same error occurred in a correspondence game at instantchess.com.
 [ R f d8 ]  [ R x d8 + ]  [ R x d8 ]  [ R d1 ] , [ R x d1 + ]  a judgement call: not enough is [ a5 ] [ R x d8 + ] [ Q x d8 ] b4! [ c x b3 ] ep [ a x b3 ] [ Q d5 ] [ c4 ] [ Q b7 ] c5...
 [ Q d3 ] , [ R d8 ]  adding d pawn protection aiming for the queen and avoiding the [ B d6 ] skewer.
 [ Q c2 ]  [ B c8 ] , [ Q g2 ]  31. Qg2?! - tries to renew pressure on [ c6 ] but I now force a swap of c pawn for b pawn.
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ] , [ f4 ]  always against the Sicilian...
 [ g6 ] , [ N x g6 ]  more wood! is the war
 [ N g4 ]  [ N x g2 + ] , [ K d2 ]  I thought 15... [ Q g5 + ] was dangerous and also 15... [ f5 ] looked interesting - try to open the position and take advantage of my King's position.
 [ N e4 ]  [ Q d4 ] , [ Q x d4 ]  ?! Takes an attacking piece away. Maybe 20.[ Q d2 ] was more precise.
 [ N x d4 ] , [ Q d3 ]  I have a better central Pawn and more advanced pieces: Black's compensation is a material advantage of one Pawn.
 [ R b1 ]  [ B d5 ]  [ R b4 ] , [ R a5 ]  [ a5 ] !? Now the rook is kind of trapped.
 [ B b3 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ Q e2 ] , [ Q d6 ]  Being careful if white plays [ B x f6 ]  [ Q x f6 ]  [ N x e4 ] , [ Q c6 ]  Pinning the knight and attempting to turn the aggression around. I feel as if I've finally reached equality...at least roughly.
 [ O-O ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ O-O-O ]  All by the book so far although [ B c4 ] can also be expected here.
 [ K g1 ] , [ B g3 ]  boxed in
 [ N x e5 ]  [ f x e5 ]  [ d x e5 ] , [ B b5 + ]  Bb5! Was is his plan?
 [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ] , [ g6 ]  This move is particularly weak because of white's f-pawn if instead black simply played [ B e7 ] and then 0-0 on the next move he would had at least a solid position!
 [ N x a4 ] , [ Q a5 ]  Of course black is hoping and attempting to win my N. This time I will allow it with the idea being that if he takes I get a couple of pawns after placing him in check. What I overlooked however is his [ f8 ] R so letting him take is actually a mistake as it would allow him to compensate for a lost piece.
 [ B c4 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ B a6 ]  [ B c6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ B e8 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ K d5 ]  [ B c2 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ K c5 ]  [ B e4 ]  [ B e8 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ B c6 ]  [ B c4 ] , [ B e8 ]  
 [ g3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ B g2 ]  White has chosen a somewhat weird plan in my opinion. But perhaps a big assault can be made from this spot by white.
 [ g6 ]  [ R a5 ]  [ h4 ] , [ K g2 ]  This is critical so that 32....[ h3 ] does not seal in the White king into an early grave on [ g1 ] or h1.
 [ a4 ] , [ a5 ]  24. ...... [ a5 ] - to try and seal up one side of the board the start of another Operation Joblock perhaps? Note that I am trying to fix Ken's pawns on the white squares. Doesn't last though.
 [ N e2 ]  [ O-O ] , [ Q c2 ]  ? White would have been better off castling immediately. At the time I wanted to prevent an e5-[ e4 ] intrusion but the WQ will prove too easily harassed on c2.
 [ N f1 ]  [ N h5 ] , [ K e3 ]  To cover 21...[ N f4 ]  [ g4 ]  [ N g7 ] , [ N g3 ]  I was thinking on weakening black´s by advancing onto [ f5 ] as I said but first I have to hold [ g4 ] and that will require time.
 [ B b2 ] , [ f6 ]  Creating "luft" and sealing the diagonal.
 [ B c4 ] , [ B d6 ]  Development is a better option as you should never violate the golden rule " never move the same piece twice in the opening"
 [ c3 ] , [ B e6 ]  so that the queen is no more necessary to protect [ d5 ]  [ e3 ] , [ N c6 ]  All of black's minor pieces are out now and white has still a bishop in his garage (and need 2 moves to leave because of the menace 16. [ B e2 ] Rxg2)
 [ e5 ] , [ f2 ]  He cannot take it because of [ R x h2 ] and loses the bishop...
 [ b3 ]  [ R d2 ]  [ R c1 ] , [ K d7 ]  Now it's time for my king to jump into the action. I was looking to lodge my king on either [ c3 ] or [ a3 ] to start hoovering up White's queenside pawns. Then Black's more active king and rook will win the endgame.
 [ K b4 ]  [ Q h8 ]  [ K a4 ] , [ Q x h2 ]  My queen eliminates my opponent's last pawn for good measure...
 [ B x e7 ]  [ Q x e7 ] , [ Q h3 ]  White immediately goes to attacking my castled position. Notice my knight is not on its ideal square of [ f6 ]  [ g4 ] , [ K h8 ]  14..Kh8? 15. g4! [ K h7 ] but this did not happen as white goes in for the kill with Bd3!
 [ N x d3 ]  [ Q x d3 ]  [ Q b6 ] , [ c4 ]  ? Black's bishop on [ g7 ] now becomes a powerful piece.
 [ O-O ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ B d7 ] , [ N d e2 ]  White keeps his options open as to which side to castle for as long as possible.
 [ N x d4 ]  [ Q x f6 ] , [ Q h3 ]  With the mate threat and the secure Black king White wont be able to defend this.
 [ R x h3 ]  [ R x a5 ]  [ R x f3 ]  [ K d3 ]  [ B g5 ] , [ R e5 ]  ...being this my only chance. Now it's a pawn's race I will lose since his B will be exchanged and his h pawn will promote.
 [ N f3 ]  [ O-O ] , [ a3 ]  11. [ a3 ] - to prevent Nb4.
 [ R e8 + ]  [ R f8 ]  [ R x f8 + ]  [ R x f8 ]  [ Q c6 ]  [ R f6 ]  [ Q e8 + ]  [ Q g8 ] , [ Q x g8 + ]  with a pawn up the black will want not to exchange pices.
 [ B d6 ] , [ c5 ]  Trying to lock up the queen's side so I could enjoy attacking the weakened black king...and also hoping for black's next move. Trading black bishops really helps because my white bishop has so much more power at the time since my pawns are on black and his on white.
 [ R b8 ]  [ b3 ] , [ N h6 ]  We are going along with our plan while black's moves have nothing in common. He obviously does not know what to do. Usually that is fine in most positions where we can just make seperate principled moves without such worry that they will be bad. But here it is dangerous.
 [ K d6 ]  [ f x e4 ]  [ Q c8 ] , [ Q x c8 ]  excange is good for me now
 [ B c7 ]  [ B x h7 + ]  [ K f8 ]  [ R x f3 ]  [ B x e5 ] , [ c5 ]  c5?! Maybe [ B x e5 ] was a little better...
 [ R x h6 ]  [ R a5 ] , [ O-O-O ]  shit! forgot you could still do that! only one pawn then... grrrrr
 [ O-O ] , [ g6 ]  I'm not surprised to see Carl play this at all. Similar to me he enjoys fianchettoing and having long diagonals for his B.
 [ N b d3 ]  [ B x d3 ]  [ N x d3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ R g8 ]  [ B f6 ]  [ R d7 ] , [ R e2 ]  Computer says ? on account of 26...[ Q f5 ] setting up a double attack on my DSB and f-pawn with the addition of a discovered attack by the same Q on my K through his N which is also threatening 2 of my pawns. Holy tactics batman!! Computer calls for 26.Re3-[ R f3 ] which I never would have seen. I'm only human.
 [ B d7 ]  [ e4 ] , [ e5 ]  I decided to block the position so that I could continue my Queenside operations without worrying about the centre. If White took en passant I was happy to recapture on [ e6 ] with the B attacking c4.
 [ N c3 ]  [ b5 ] , [ e4 ]  Grabbing a hold of the centre. This was unavoidable however I can undermine it through moves like ...[ c5 ] and ...[ B b7 ] and ...[ b4 ] later.
 [ N x g6 ]  [ f x g6 ] , [ R d6 ]  My guess is to gain tempo since black must defend. But my other instinct is that Joe might have more dangerous up his sleeve.
 [ N b d2 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B x d2 ]  [ B x d2 ] , [ h6 ]  11. ........... [ h6 ] - to prevent a knight incursion on g5.
 [ R d5 x d3 ]  [ c x d3 ]  [ Q d7 ]  [ R d1 ]  [ K c7 ] , [ Q c5 ]  ? This was my big mistake for the game. I played it to prevent him from pressing any of his pawns on the queenside. 27...b6? 28 Qa3! and I could force draw (but I wouldn't) eliminate his pawn at [ b6 ] or force a queen trade (which I would love at this point)!
 [ h x g7 ] , [ R f3 ]  I am not completely sure that this position is lost for White - but despite being two pieces up; it is obviously going to be difficult to defend.
 [ K b1 ]  [ e4 ]  [ d x e4 ] , [ R x e4 ]  Again he is trying to get down piecess for him to get even more of an advantage.
 [ h x g6 ]  [ R x g6 ] , [ R x g6 ]  No choice. If [ K e2 ] Rd-g8.
 [ R a b8 ] , [ Q a3 ]  The queen's exchange would give me a bad pawn's structure but I preferred it to [ Q c7 ] for some strange (and probably wrong) reason.
 [ B x g7 ]  [ K x g7 ] , [ Q a4 ]  I have to defend the a pawn that seems to be all my advantage in this game. Note that my kingside is still paralyzed!
 [ N e5 ]  [ R x g7 ] , [ h5 ]  I could win [ g4 ] but I feel that the most important factor in my favor in this position is the passed h pawn and thus it's advance is more important than regaining a silly pawn.
 [ B c4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ d4 ] , [ c5 ]  Ok what have you got against your king's rook?
 [ K g5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ K x h5 ]  [ b1 = Q ]  [ R x b1 ]  [ N x b1 ]  [ K g6 ]  [ R x d3 ] , [ h5 ]  Rearguard action advancing the last remaining pawn but too late to be of any use
 [ f x e5 ]  [ Q d5 ] , [ B f4 ]  (?)Now this is a concrete mistake that seriously hampers my attack. If I were to be given this position now I would have chosen 13.Qe1! in seconds. Unfortunately my inexperience at the time led me to make the best looking move: The [ B f4 ] develops and looks good while the queen to [ e1 ] looks strange at best and moves the queen before completing development. This brings up rule #3: The power/quality of your move depends only on your opponent's possible responses to it and the positions those lead to. Q[ e1 ] would eliminate counterplay at once while this move gives black a chance at survival.
 [ K e6 ]  [ R e1 + ] , [ B e5 ]  also he think that he attack and actualy he isn't the pin frees my [ g3 ] rook actually i have a strong cover check
 [ B g4 ]  [ c3 ]  [ O-O-O ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ Q b4 ] , [ a3 ]  In turn trying to capture my queen.
 [ O-O ]  [ N x e4 ] , [ R e1 ]  All part of the mainline after castling.
 [ h x g4 ] , [ B x g4 ]  So Black has two pawns for a B and an annoying pin on White's N. White's Kingside is in ruins but Black has yet to castle and has a gaping hole at d5. The scene is set for more fireworks.
 [ R b6 ]  [ c3 ]  [ c6 ]  [ b4 ]  [ N e6 ]  [ N b3 ]  [ N c7 ]  [ N d c5 ]  [ R b8 ]  [ K e2 ]  [ R b6 ]  [ K d3 ]  [ R b8 ]  [ K c2 ]  [ R b6 ]  [ R a1 ] , [ R b8 ]  Black is helpless; his Queen side is all tied up.
 [ Q x c3 ]  [ Q b2 ]  [ Q e5 ] , [ Q x e5 + ]  With an exposed king trading queens is a good move for white.
 [ g5 ]  [ N c4 ]  [ K f6 ]  [ N c2 ]  [ e3 ]  [ N e1 ]  [ g4 ] , [ b4 ]  Just delaying the inevitable.
 [ a6 ] , [ N d5 ]  Returning my knight to it's position of power.
 [ B x g2 ]  [ N c7 + ] , [ K d8 ]  Maybe [ K f7 ] was better.
 [ B f4 ]  [ N g6 ]  [ B g3 ] , [ R a e8 ]  Black's first questionable move by my tastes. The other rook is doing nothing on [ f8 ] whereas 18...[ R f e8 ] would have allowed a later [ R a c8 ] taking the open file or [ R a d8 ] placing both rooks behind the powerful central pawns.
 [ Q b4 ] , [ N c6 ]  develop and attack the queen who want to walk around the board
 [ B g4 ]  [ R c1 ] , [ R f e8 ]  If he takes I fork his King and useless Knight.
 [ B c4 ]  [ f x e5 ] , [ O-O ]  Taking the pawn is a bad move: a)9...exd4?? 10.Nb3! [ Q b6 ] 11.[ B x d5 ] and black has lost the knight b)9...Nxd4?? 10.[ N x d4 ] [ e x d4 ] 11.Nb3! [ Q b6 ] 12.[ B x d5 ] and again black has lost the knight
 [ B f8 ] , [ N g3 ]  The plan behind [ N g3 ] is to install the knight in f5. SF5 prefers to first play [ [ d4 ] ] and considers white's advantage to have vanished after this move. The point is that the move allows [ c5 ] after which [ [ d4 ] ] becomes very difficult.
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ g6 ]  A tricky move order. Black doesn't let White continue with certain attacking structures (e.g. the feared 9.0-0-0 Rauzer) because he threatens an early ..d7-[ d5 ] (discussed in a later note). This move order is often neglected in the Dragon because of the nagging possibility of 6.Nxc6! [ b x c6 ] 7.e5; in that line White immediately pressures Black's negligence in the center even at the cost of strengthening Black's pawn structure. Black tends to score poorly in that line hence the early ..[ d6 ] (preventing this idea entirely).
 [ e6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ B b4 ]  white declines the gambit for development.
 [ Q h4 ]  [ f5 ]  [ g x f5 ]  [ g x f5 ] , [ b6 ]  Hadn´t it been for the pawn on [ d6 ] I would still have some optimism but my opponent finds all the right moves.
 [ Q x e3 ] , [ B x e3 ]  white is much more developed. So the end of the queens may be a good thing for white after all
 [ B x c8 ] , [ R x c8 ]  White is a full rook up and black has no counterplay.
 [ N x f6 ]  [ N b c3 ] , [ O-O ]  I should castle long here. White's idea is to attack on the king side and I am a pawn short on the f-file.
 [ N a4 ] , [ N d7 ]  I just take the tempo to develop! I don't want to retake the bishop with the kinight. The pressure on the diagonal is most important because it maked difficult for white to develop coherently and attackingly. White has just one very powerful resource... can you see it?
 [ c x b3 ] , [ B b4 ]  not bad Idea but making pieces move twice in preparation stage was unsual
 [ R e2 ]  [ K f7 ]  [ K g2 ]  [ K e6 ] , [ e5 ]  Dooms the pawn. If black would have been forced to come towards it and place the king besides it to support [ R e3 ] white may have had a shot of defending it or at least abandoning it at a moment where it would allow him to apply counter pressure on the pawns on [ g7 ] and h6.
 [ K e7 ] , [ B f4 ]  [Threatening [ Q x d6 ] and mate to follow.]
 [ B e5 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ Q x f6 ] , [ N c3 ]  I would definitely have played 18.[ B c2 ] which I think leaves White with a winning attack. White can at the very least pick up an extra pawn after 18...[ Q g6 ] 19.[ Q x g6 ] [ f x g6 ] 20.Bxg6.
 [ N f6 ] , [ B c6 ]  Obviously I don't want to lose or exchange the Bishop.
 [ B x b4 ] , [ N x b4 ]  It is worth noting that in his first seven moves white has moved his DSB four times. Initially I looked at playing that wicked fork 7. ... [ Q f6 ] threatening checkmate on [ f2 ] and also attacking white's rook. (note: This same move at a different time was useful in my other game against this opening - I am wondering if the danger to white's rook along that long diagonal is a serious flaw of the Orangutan). However after 7. ... [ Q f6 ] white plays 8. [ N f3 ] defending the mate with development and now if 8. ... [ Q x a1 ] 9. [ B x f8 ] [ K x f8 ] material remains even. I usually prefer to keep pieces on the board when playing against a lower-rated opponent so I decided to minimize the exchanges at his point. Besides black hasn't given up on the threat yet.
 [ O-O ]  [ B b2 ]  [ d6 ] , [ h3 ]  Preventing the [ B g4 ] pin which seems especially awkward with the current pressure on the [ d4 ] pawn.
 [ Q c7 ] , [ e4 ]  The standard method of attack in this position
 [ O-O-O ] , [ R c8 ]  to prevent 19. [ N c7 + ] [ K e7 ] (19...Kf8? 20. Ne6+!)
 [ B c6 ]  [ R f d1 ]  [ R d7 ]  [ R d2 ]  [ R h d8 ] , [ R c d1 ]  21. [ R c d1 ] - bolstering my isolani.
 [ R e1 ]  [ f2 ]  [ R f1 ] , [ B d4 ]  this is crushing for black. White resigns.
 [ Q c1 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ B x e4 ] , [ Q x e4 ]  21. ...... Q x [ e4 ] (now I lose a pawn after the knight takes the e pawn which was doubly attacked). My position is bad - he has a passed e pawn and a very dominant queen - mine is horribly passive (as usual).
 [ N e2 + ]  [ B x e2 ]  [ R x c1 + ] , [ K f2 ]  So now we come to an interesting position. I believe white has a slight advantage.
 [ N x h7 + ] , [ K g7 ]  ...and now white must lose material!
 [ N x g8 + ] , [ Q x g8 ]  now to stay ahead in piece advantage
 [ K g1 ]  [ Q x h6 ]  [ Q f2 + ]  [ K x g4 ]  [ Q f3 + ]  [ K h4 ]  [ Q h3 + ]  [ K g5 ]  [ Q x h6 + ]  [ K x h6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ K g7 ]  [ g4 ]  [ K f7 ]  [ c5 ]  [ K e7 ]  [ N d2 ]  [ K d7 ]  [ K f2 ]  [ K c6 ]  [ N b3 ]  [ K d5 ]  [ K e3 ]  [ K c4 ]  [ c6 ]  [ K x b3 ]  [ c7 ]  [ K c4 ]  [ K e4 ]  [ K c5 ]  [ c8 = Q + ]  [ K d6 ]  [ Q f8 + ]  [ K d7 ]  [ Q x f6 ]  [ K d6 ]  [ g5 ]  [ K d7 ]  [ g6 ]  [ K d6 ]  [ g7 ]  [ K d7 ]  [ g8 = Q ]  [ K d6 ]  [ Q g d8 + ]  [ K c5 ]  [ Q f d4 + ]  [ K c6 ]  [ Q c8 + ]  [ K b5 ]  [ Q d c4 + ]  [ K b6 ] , [ Q c4 a6 # ]  
 [ d4 ] , [ d5 ]  I was going to open with an Indian system (1. ... Nf6) but I thought that it would scare him or annoy him no end since I'd told him that I wasn't "that good."
 [ B c4 ] , [ B e6 ]  Only defence. But it was interesting (with more time) for black to explore BxQ BxQ [ B x c2 ] [ R d2 ] [ B a4 ] [ b3 ] [ B c5 ] [ R f d1 ] but conceding the exchange was doubtful...
 [ e5 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ d4 ] , [ d6 ]  Standard play so far. This move aims to undermine white's strong pawn presence in the center.
 [ N c3 ] , [ N d8 ]  This move looks horrible. Presumably it is to prepare [ c5 ] but surely [ N a5 ] was a better way to prepare it.
 [ Q d6 ] , [ B e4 ]  I don't need that rook
 [ N b8 ]  [ B d3 ] , [ N a6 ]  an intermezzo before the attack can proceed. White must avoid Nb4...
 [ R e c7 ] , [ K h2 ]  Here he agreed with my assessment offered the draw and I accepted. This represents my first draw against a 1900+ opponent. I don't know that either player made a large error--rather a few smaller errors. I enjoyed the game and it was a pleasure playing against paolo. I welcome any comments.
 [ d3 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ Q g6 ]  [ Q h4 ]  [ f6 ] , [ g3 ]  That I thought was a big mistake. But it was all part of a cunning ploy that I fell right into.
 [ B d5 ] , [ K f6 ]  Possibly [ B c7 ] was a better move.
 [ K g8 ] , [ R e3 x e7 ]  I've made up the material from the knight sacrifice and now black is in serious trouble. I'm threatening both his queen and checkmate and there's just no way for him to protect both of them. Realizing this my opponent resigned and thus ended this fun game. I think my opponent's main mistake this game was in wasting too much time with his pawns. Comparing pawn structures at endgame I only moved 3 of my pawns whereas not one of his pawns is still on its original square. Since he never really developed his pieces he couldn't mount a good defense once my attack was prepared.
 [ K b1 ]  [ R b4 ]  [ R f c1 ]  [ R a4 ]  [ R c2 c3 ] , [ N f4 ]  deflecting the defender of D4
 [ N c3 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ c x d5 ] , [ d6 ]  This is all very standard.
 [ f3 ]  [ g x h4 ]  [ Q g4 + ]  [ Q g7 ]  [ Q x e6 + ]  [ K h7 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ N e3 ]  this move had been forseen. it crushes white's resistance.
 [ K d8 ] , [ N x f7 + ]  forcing again - I was thinking of [ Q x e7 ] [ N x h8 ] to save the brave Knight who won the battle single handedly but then I saw it would cost me the bishop on [ c4 ] whithout whom the knight is caught on the back rank....
 [ N c6 ]  [ e3 ] , [ N d7 ]  White can go for the normal line with Nd2-[ f3 ] or...
 [ R d8 + ]  [ K f7 ] , [ R x c8 ]  
 [ Q a2 + ]  [ B d5 ]  [ Q a7 + ] , [ N d7 ]  Black's piede are tied to defend each other.
 [ K d8 ]  [ b5 ]  [ N g4 ] , [ B x e7 + ]  Now I'm up on top with my "bishop" and I put him in check too.
 [ c5 ]  [ R h f1 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ N c3 ]  Uh-Oh... This is the key blunder which cost the game ends to 19...[ c x d4 ] 20.[ R x a2 ] [ Q x c3 ] 21.[ K b1 ] [ d x e3 ] 22.[ Q x f7 ] Kh8. [ K c2 ] was a much more better move.
 [ K h8 ]  [ R x h7 + ]  [ K x h7 ]  [ Q h4 + ]  [ K g6 ]  [ R g1 + ]  [ K f5 ]  [ Q e4 + ]  [ K f6 ]  [ Q d4 + ]  [ K f5 ]  [ Q e4 + ] , [ K f6 ]  He has a draw here (3 move rule) but he decides to go for more. bad idea.
 [ B d2 ]  [ B d4 + ] , [ K g2 ]  22. [ K h1 ] [ R f1 ] mate.
 [ N b d2 ] , [ O-O ]  ? Black is allowing me a wonderful outpost!
 [ R f4 ]  [ R g5 ] , [ c4 ]  All this deserves more deep look than mine...
 [ a4 ] , [ N b4 ]  I still haven't seen [ R b2 ] - looking at [ N x d3 ] with mate to follow
 [ d5 ] , [ O-O ]  Knowing that I castled here as this was also part of my plan behind 4.[ B e2 ] Though it wasn't possible right away I kept in mind that castling would become possible. So I took advantage of that opportunity before it was gone.
 [ B e7 ]  [ B h3 ]  [ f6 ]  [ B x f5 ]  [ e x f5 ]  [ g x f6 ]  [ g x f6 ] , [ Q e2 ]  White calls the bluff all the way... 16. ... [ R g8 + ] 17. [ K h1 ] [ f x e5 ] 18. [ f e x5 ] 0-0-0 is fine...
 [ R f3 f1 + ] , [ K g2 ]  The white king starts his march up the board
 [ c5 ]  [ a3 ] , [ b4 ]  Now I can undouble the Pawns without giving up a fully open file.
 [ Q b3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ Q c2 ]  [ Q b7 ]  [ N d2 ]  [ R f d8 ] , [ N b3 ]  Now with two rooks lined up I best move the knight out of the way. And get the knight to where I can put it on the front lines.
 [ B f7 ] , [ N c5 + ]  I check him
 [ a6 ]  [ B c4 ] , [ N a5 ]  If I can dislodge the bishop then his knight is undefended
 [ B a3 ] , [ N g6 ]  !
 [ a6 ]  [ N b d2 ]  [ h6 ]  [ Q c2 ]  [ Q c7 ] , [ c x d5 ]  ?! This move is a bit hasty. No need to release the tension yet. Better was moves like [ R a c1 ] or [ R f d1 ] since these files will open up very quickly.
 [ N e5 ]  [ Q e6 ]  [ d5 ] , [ Q d6 ]  ?? This is costing him. There is actually a tactic to win an exchange here. It's really funny because my older bro (he has won the British Title 3 times in a row!) didn't spot this whereas I did. Can you spot it?
 [ N f3 ] , [ N e4 ]  White moves NF3 Black responds with Ne4. I could of developed another piece rather than this response but if you notice black knight has a great position here for the time being. There are minimal threats to the black knight pending whites additional moves. If white moves his knight to advance his pawn to F3 Black can move to KG3 and fork the bishop and rook. Alternatively the other moves will end in a swap
 [ N d7 ] , [ B g3 ]  now is time to retreat
 [ Q x h3 ]  [ B x h3 ] , [ B x h1 ]  Black is poorly developed but is up two minor pieces and a R. Once the position is consolidated it should be easily won.
 [ Q x f3 ] , [ Q h4 ]  Attacking the exposed and foolishly placed Bishop on [ h6 ]  [ K c2 ] , [ R c8 ]  I don't like the way this is shaping up with a Rook directed at my King...
 [ K h8 ] , [ B b2 ]  looking for combination.
 [ Q x d5 ] , [ e x d5 ]  I had a bit of a dilema here which piece do I take ...[ N x c1 ] obviously isn't best but do I take the rook at [ a1 ] or the bishop on d2? after ...[ N x d2 ] white can trap my knight with [ B d1 ] so I chose to take the rook.
 [ e4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ d5 ] , [ N d2 ]  To allow in the simplest manner the support of the Pawn skeleton by P-QB3.
 [ R e b1 ]  [ R b5 ] , [ R f c1 ]  34. [ R x b5 ] drops the [ c2 ] pawn.
 [ g5 ]  [ b4 ]  [ g4 ] , [ N e5 ]  I think this is a mistake as the pawn that is about to recapture on [ e5 ] will become hard to defend. [ N h4 ] is possible but 16.[ N e1 ] looks best as it can work it's way to the [ f4 ] square.
 [ R c2 ] , [ b x c3 ]  ? Better was [ a4 ] increasing the pressure.
 [ B g2 ] , [ N c5 ]  ...This was a mistake. I should have gone Ra-[ e8 ] or a5.
 [ a3 ] , [ Q x b6 ]  what horrible blunder ! 36..Qb3! and the game is lost black was to greedy and because of that he payed the price .
 [ g6 ]  [ Q x e7 ] , [ Q c7 ]  Must care of B on [ c2 ] - but why? I have a much better position the black king is alone - I must give my bishop for a pawn to worstens the pawnstructure of black and if it is not enough I have one pawn in 2 islands. Black has 3 islands. The endgame seems to me better.
 [ B x d6 ]  [ B x d6 ] , [ K x d6 ]  And my king is much more centralized for the endgame. This is a very interesting endgame we both still have a knight undeveloped and it's only move 15. Some people might say it's still the middlegame but I think it's the endgame.
 [ R c8 + ]  [ R x c8 ]  [ Q x c8 + ]  [ K f7 ] , [ R f1 ]  If I could just play [ B e3 + ] it would be mate very soon. Unluckily the Bishop is pinned.
 [ B e7 ] , [ N e4 ]  And more messing.
 [ f3 ]  [ B d7 ] , [ Q d2 ]  In the Dragon White would love to trade off Black's powerful bishop as once this happens his attack often proves decisive.
 [ B x f6 ] , [ N x f6 ]  Now white must save his bishop.
 [ K g1 ]  [ g x f4 ]  [ e x f4 ] , [ Q b6 ]  This was a mistake [ N d3 ] or [ N g4 ] were probably both better..
 [ g5 ]  [ B d2 ] , [ N d4 ]  My knight goes to the strong outpost with a tempo.
 [ a3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ R f e1 ]  Centralizing his R.
 [ g3 ] , [ g6 ]  and now revert to Plan A!
 [ e x f2 + ]  [ K x f2 ] , [ Q e4 ]  ! Strong move the queen is actively centralized and the threat is 28... [ R x b3 ] 29.[ Q x b3 ] [ Q d4 ] picking up the [ a1 ] rook.
 [ g x f5 ]  [ R x b1 ]  [ R x b1 ] , [ Q x c6 ]  Recovering the pawn I sacrificed at f5.
 [ K x g4 ] , [ N e5 + ]  ! Black has sacrificed all four minor pieces and now victory is imminent! The pawn is drawn off the open file claimed and checkmate given.
 [ O-O ] , [ B c4 ]  pointing [ f7 ] the good old [ f7 ]  [ B f5 ] , [ B e3 ]  could have exchanged on [ f7 ] rook+pawn = knight and bishop.
 [ f4 ]  [ N e6 ]  [ g3 ]  [ c5 ] , [ c3 ]  Now I've got a nice pawn structure. Moved to [ c3 ] to protect it from the rook and to avoid Nd4.
 [ B d2 ] , [ Q d5 ]  I don't think now is the right time for [ [ d3 ] + ] the pawn isn't that helpful on [ d3 ] and it gives white time to move their king to a safer square. And the squares on [ e2 ] and [ c2 ] are in my control already if white moves a piece there [ [ d3 ] + ] wins it with a sneaky discovered check. Instead i move the queen to a safe square on [ d5 ] where it's got plenty of options later.
 [ B x e3 + ]  [ R x e3 ] , [ a x b6 ]  And this move was necessary now otherwise white just has a large material edge. So take stock now -- black's pawn structure is a wreck he has a knight to white's bishop in the endgame and his rooks are on ineffective squares and it's white's move.
 [ N g f6 ]  [ O-O ] , [ Q c7 ]  At move nine all of white's minor pieces are out and white has castled. Black still has a bishop in bed and has not castled yet.
 [ R x f1 + ]  [ R x f1 ]  [ Q x e4 ]  [ N x g4 ] , [ e2 ]  Now he's threatening and saving his pawn from my N
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ N c6 ]  Slightly less common than 2...d6; both prevent the further advance of the e-pawn but this develops a piece albeit one that can be attacked - and probably exchanged if White wishes - by 3.Bb5.
 [ K e5 ] , [ K b5 ]  A mistake. Houdini 1.5a recommends a4. Now black's king could come down and take the knight.
 [ B c4 ] , [ N f6 ]  After 3. [ B c4 ] I would need a very good reason to play anything other than: 3. ... [ N f6 ] (Two Knights Defence) I've played it at least 252 times before (as Black... at Gameknot)
 [ R d8 ] , [ Q a4 ]  why did I do that???? this is absurd!
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ N c6 ]  Nothing out of the ordinary yet.
 [ N x e4 ]  [ R g1 ] , [ Q x g1 + ]  ?? A blunder by black - as is obvious. He still has a reasonably strong centre but he has lost his queen and freed white's in return (after 15 Nxg1).
 [ R x c1 ]  [ R x c1 ]  [ R f6 ] , [ e4 ]  Protecting the bishop
 [ B x f4 ] , [ Q x f4 ]  Happy to trade off pieces now.
 [ R x d6 ]  [ R x d6 ]  [ Q x d6 ] , [ g3 ]  From this point on the game was obviously totally lost I just didn't want to give in. The rest is pure self torture
 [ B d3 ]  [ N h5 ]  [ Q h3 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ g4 ]  [ N h f6 ]  [ N g3 ]  [ Q c8 ] , [ N f5 ]  pxN followed by Bxp would pin the knight at [ d7 ] and open the g file. White knight threatens [ N x e7 ] winning the queen
 [ d5 ]  [ h4 ]  [ d6 ]  [ R c1 + ]  [ K h2 ] , [ R e e1 ]  So being checkmated in one move? Wrong think again!
 [ N f6 ]  [ B f3 ]  [ g6 ] , [ R f d1 ]  ? as you will see on the next move.
 [ R c8 ] , [ B d2 ]  Doubling the defense of c3. This is the point that the game timed out. My opponent has been offline for 5 days and has had over a dozen consecutive games timeout during that time. Apparently he is away - I hope he is well. As for this game as my previous comment states my intention is to play for advancing the c-pawn banking on my extra knight to ensure its safety and hoping to force black to sacrifice more material to prevent its promotion. Black's advance pawn on [ e4 ] looks like a possible target too. This game still had a lot of potential for both sides. Too bad we didn't get to finish it.
 [ d x c4 ] , [ b x c4 ]  Less sure about this. I did not really like the center-controlling pawns but I found nothing better to do.
 [ e5 + ]  [ K e6 ] , [ c3 ]  Can't quite understand this move I realise the Bishop isn't going anywhere but I don't see why defending [ d4 ] suddenly becomes a priority. I was expecting white to either play [ e x f6 ] or develop instead. Perhaps moves like this is the difference between 1950 and 2100?
 [ f5 ] , [ Q e5 ]  Black's Q is still en prise but I now have an additional threat...
 [ R x b1 + ]  [ B x b1 ]  [ c5 ]  [ K f1 ]  [ R e7 ]  [ N g5 ]  [ h6 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ N e4 ]  White is protected from a king bishop fork (Nd7) by his knight. But the protection vanishes with Ke2-Nc3+.
 [ N f3 ] , [ c5 ]  Doesn't accomplish much.
 [ R b2 ] , [ R d1 + ]  thewrongreason: My vote is for our only legal move 22.Rxd1. Although I forgot but it should be a good thing because of what ION noted a couple of moves back. archduke_piccolo: Only move... ... 23.[ R x d1 ] I don't think Black had any good alternative to the coming exchanges. redfoxrising: 23. [ R x d1 ] is all that can be played
 [ B x e5 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ N e4 ]  pressure on the defending knight at worse black loses a rook & pawn for a knight or...
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ c4 ] , [ d x c4 ]  The queens gambit accepted.
 [ N g e2 ] , [ N x e4 ]  I don't know if white's 7th move was intended as a gambit but it loses the [ e4 ] pawn that was only defended by the (now pinned) knight on c3. Probably ought to put a ? on 7. Nge2?. And before a commenter might point out that it's unnecessary to indicate the "g" in that move I'm only parroting what the GameKnot notation recorded. 7. Ne2? would be sufficient but the automatic notation wizard inserted the unnecessary "g" so I did to for consistency.
 [ B g2 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N b d7 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ R e1 ] , [ N g4 ]  A thematic idea in the benko gambit.the knight reroutes so that he can have extra control over [ e5 ] and he can then look to play there and have a pair of knights exchanged but since white has moved the rook away from [ f1 ] I figured I would leave my knight where he is until he gets kicked away since quite often the pressure against [ f2 ] can come in useful and whilst the knight is here my bishop has a clear diagonal.
 [ f4 ] , [ B x f4 ]  Probably better is [ g x f4 ] but this still leaves White in bad shape.
 [ g4 ] , [ R a e8 ]  White has to be very careful as black now has a number tactical possibities.
 [ d4 ] , [ N c6 ]  He brings his pawn out but I don't have to worry about that right? Because my pawn is guarded!
 [ B e1 ]  [ Q h6 ]  [ B f3 ]  [ R g7 ]  [ c x d6 ]  [ c x d6 ]  [ K h1 ] , [ B d8 ]  Frees up the light square bishop. Also give the possibility of some activity for the dark square bishop Bb6. Black would have an interesting mating idea. [ B b6 ] [ R g6 ] [ Q x h2 + ] [ K x h2 ] Rh6#.
 [ N d5 ] , [ B x d5 ]  I sacrifice the good bishop but the diag will be closed to his bishop too. Black's worst enemy is his own [ e7 ] pawn.
 [ K f2 ] , [ g5 ]  I bring my king into action.
 [ Q d7 ] , [ R e1 ]  A sidestep to prevent black's rook escaping from the coming fork with [ R x f1 ] .
 [ Q c2 ]  [ R a d8 ]  [ R f d1 ]  [ R e6 ]  [ a3 ]  [ R e d6 ]  [ R a c1 ]  [ b6 ]  [ Q d2 ] , [ Q b3 ]  Black chooses an aggressive approach calculating that the more unbalanced pawn position favors black.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ B b5 ]  Ah! The Ruy Lopez
 [ Q x d3 ] , [ c5 ]  ! Topalov achieved the desired break getting rid of the backward c-pawn so he has roughly equalized.
 [ B x c4 ]  [ Q x c4 ] , [ Q c7 ]  You are supposed to finish development before you let the Queen out. Well "There is always an exception to everything" as chesskingdom64 would say and this is certainly one of them. Why? In this position I want to win back a pawn by continuting with proper develop. That way everything is even and I can connect my rooks. That would not be feasible if the Queen was not on the c file. Because of this move I will win it back after he castles Kingside. So far I have only made a "fender bender" which=a small error nothing serious or big. In fact I feel that this is one of my best games against a strong player and the best one on this site. In addition I intend to keep it that way.
 [ d x c6 ] , [ Q f6 ]  This opponent always tries to get scholar's mate but much better would have been taking my pawn.
 [ R g8 ]  [ N x f5 ] , [ N f3 + ]  ? I'd worked out that this didn't quite work but played it anyway hoping that something would turn up. Better to go down all guns blazing than meekly turn up your toes! The motivation behind launching the attack now was to avoid either 21. [ N x h6 ] or 21. [ B x h6 ] both of which looked horrible.
 [ R f6 ] , [ Q h5 ]  Threatens a mate in 3 - 46.[ Q h7 + ] [ K f8 ] 47.[ Q h8 + ] [ K e7 ] 48.Qe7#. The fact that such tricks like these are still available for Rybka at this late stage in the game is amazing!
 [ K h1 ] , [ Q x h3 + ]  clearing the area to have more freedom.
 [ R c4 c8 + ]  [ K g7 ] , [ R c1 c7 + ]  Bringing the second Rook in.
 [ B x c2 ] , [ Q c7 + ]  After the Black Powder smoke is gone it is White's turn to fire and marches to a victory
 [ h3 ] , [ N e3 ]  [ c2 ] is now very weak and [ g2 ] looks like it could fall as well.
 [ Q h4 ]  [ g3 ]  [ N x g3 ] , [ N x h8 ]  In the Traxler - it's not about material - its all about tempo and space - or the lack of it.
 [ e x f3 ] , [ N x f3 ]  better with the knight in order to castle
 [ c5 ]  [ d x c5 ]  [ N c4 ] , [ Q d1 ]  He goes right where i want him
 [ K f8 ]  [ N x g6 + ]  [ K g8 ] , [ N x h8 ]  Taking that rook is a relative blunder. he has forced mate: 13. [ N e7 ] [ K f8 ] 14. [ N f5 ] [ K g8 ] 15. [ N h6 ] [ B x h6 ] 16. [ B x h6 ] Now if black doesnt cover his back rank (moving Knight or Queen) Qf1#. 16. ... [ Q c8 ] 17. [ Q x f6 ] [ Q f8 ] 18. [ Q g5 ] [ Q g7 ] 19. [ Q x g7 # ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ Q x e4 + ]  [ B e3 ] , [ Q g6 ]  I resigned directly after making this move :-) Had I not made this error I might have survived a few more moves. maybe 15. ... [ Q x g2 ] or 15. ... [ B x h8 ] would have let me survive beyond move 20 but not by much. That nineth move spelled disaster.
 [ K h8 ]  [ b5 ]  [ e4 ] , [ B b7 ]  Another combination! fork attack
 [ Q c2 ] , [ N g7 ]  Bringing the knight to a better square
 [ K e5 ] , [ K g2 ]  OK: White does well to be cautious. But I would probably have chosen 38.[ R x a7 ] [ K f4 ] 39.[ R a6 ] [ K x g4 ] 40.Rxb6; or 39...[ b5 ] 40.Rxh6. With nothing to oppose them White's could have shove home one of the Q-side pawns to promote; otherwise with the h-pawn gone Black would have lost the last vestige of attack.
 [ B d7 ]  [ K e3 ]  [ B e8 ] , [ K f4 ]  32. [ K f4 ] - Freddy's king advances up the board and is threatening to infiltrate via e5/d6.
 [ R e4 ]  [ b6 ]  [ R g4 ] , [ N x e5 ]  11. Re4?! was an attempt at a classic rook lift aiming to bring a rook to bear on black's castle. Not a bad idea but perhaps [ e3 ] was a better lift since from [ e4 ] the rook is unable to safely reach [ h4 ] but it would be safe on h3. Black solidifies his pawn on [ c5 ] so he won't have to worry about it later. 12. Rg4? was a blunder by white at it cost him a pawn. Worse white now has his rook and bishop forked and black will be quite comfortable with the idea of trading material doubling some white pawns and enhancing his new found material lead.
 [ B d1 ] , [ B x g4 ]  I just couldn't resist this move but the best move order is in fact 22...Bd2. After that 23.[ Q d2 ] [ Q e4 ] gets [ R h1 ] and 23.[ K d2 ] [ B g4 ] creates horrible threat 24...Qb4. This can be prevented by a Queen move but then [ B g5 ] is lost after Qc1. If 24.[ B g4 ] then 24...Rc2; 25.[ K d3 ] Qb3; 26.[ K d4 ] [ e5 # ]  [ K f2 ]  [ B x d2 ]  [ Q x d2 ]  [ Q x e4 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ Q f5 + ] , [ K g3 ]  26.[ Q f4 ] Qf4; 27.[ B f4 ] Bd1; 28.[ R d1 ] is similar to the game ending. Black has 6 (!) pawns for the Bishop.
 [ N f7 ]  [ Q x g6 ] , [ Q g1 + ]  17...[ B x c3 + ] 18.[ b x c3 ] [ Q x c3 + ] 19.[ K f1 ] [ Q x a1 ] 20.[ Q g8 + ] Black did not choose this line perhaps due to fear of White's active piece.
 [ R f6 ] , [ B g2 ]  This is what I mean by the beauty of this formation!
 [ R d7 ]  [ N x g7 ]  [ R x g7 ]  [ Q x f6 ]  [ Q x c4 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ Q f7 ]  [ Q x f7 ]  [ R x f7 ] , [ g4 ]  Black's rook will have to vacate the 7th rank prompting an exchange of rooks. More than good enough for White.
 [ c5 ]  [ R e3 ] , [ d4 ]  ? -- Too tempting I guess. In my opinion the right continuation here was 25. ...[ Q g5 ] 26. [ Q e2 ] [ R f6 ]  [ R f3 ]  [ Q e5 ]  [ R x f8 + ] , [ R x f8 ]  One pair of Rooks bites the dust. Mission accomplished.
 [ B b5 + ]  [ Q d7 ] , [ Q x d7 # ]  strong midgame and finish by white
 [ B x d6 ] , [ N g5 ]  Well the bishop is now pinned so the knight is heading for [ f7 ] where it can force further exchanges.
 [ R x h7 ]  [ R a e8 ]  [ O-O-O ]  [ K c8 ]  [ c4 ]  [ N g6 ] , [ R f7 ]  With this move white game was basically over. Moving back the bishop would have left the game more even.
 [ N f d2 ] , [ N x e5 ]  At this stage I was feeling quite pleased with myself. I had a decent grip on the centre and was two pawns to the good. I just needed to develop my remaining pieces castle and then relax right?
 [ N c7 ] , [ N x c6 ]  Double Queen threat.
 [ g x h4 ]  [ B x h4 ]  [ K e3 ]  [ a4 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ a3 ]  [ N a2 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ N b4 ] , [ g3 ]  And now both of these threats cannot be stopped.
 [ N c8 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ B c7 ]  Perhaps trading his weakend bishop for my knight may have been the play here....
 [ Q h1 + ]  [ K e2 ] , [ R x f2 + ]  White resigned as [ K e3 ] or [ K x f2 ] lose him the queen...and probably a lot more. Very well played phishbone6984; Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year! The score is 1-1...it isn't over yet...
 [ N f3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ g3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ B g2 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ O-O ] , [ O-O ]  By the book so far.
 [ d3 ] , [ f4 ]  Forcing back the Q.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B c4 ] , [ h6 ]  ? This is one of those useless move that wastes a vital tempo. Don't play them unless they are needed to stop a full scale attack.
 [ K f2 ]  [ K f8 ]  [ g3 ]  [ N e6 ]  [ K e3 ]  [ K e7 ]  [ K d3 ] , [ K d7 ]  Moving the Black King to support the strong central pawn push.
 [ e5 ]  [ c4 ] , [ d4 ]  no second thoughts: cxd3ep is not good...
 [ B x c6 ] , [ R a2 ]  Immediately punishing white by winning two pieces for a rook pawn.
 [ Q e7 ] , [ N c3 ]  Now I won't allow [ N d4 ] since it gives me an uneasy position. And I have to care about [ N e4 ] too. I made a not natural move: c6. My black bishop is free to move now after Ne4. I have blocked my rook future action on the 6th row and I have further delayed my developement. It looks no good at all.
 [ Q c5 ] , [ Q b4 ]  Not a great move. White should keep the queen while he can. 24. [ Q f1 ] [ Q h5 ] 25. [ Q h3 ] [ N b3 ] is better but still opponent has advantage.
 [ B d3 + ]  [ K e1 ] , [ R e8 + ]  Activating my rook and avoiding changing it for white´s.
 [ R g2 ] , [ f x e4 ]  Opening the f file. Not 17. ... Nf4?? 18. [ Q x g7 # ]  [ B d5 ] , [ N x d3 ]  This is about more than snatching pawns I am eying [ f2 ] which has no defender.
 [ B x h1 ] , [ N x h1 ]  Black exchanges his final peace for a knight and the ability to promote a queen. (Black is +14.6) You can see what I mean by black's most powerful weapon the LSB trades himself for two knights. This soldier evens the point values and allows the noble black king to vanquish the cowardly white king.
 [ Q b5 ]  [ b3 ]  [ a4 ] , [ R b1 ]  a bad decision: probably the losing move...
 [ K e8 ] , [ K b8 ]  .
 [ N x f3 ]  [ e x f3 ]  [ R x f1 ]  [ Q h2 ]  [ N d3 + ]  [ K c3 ]  [ R x g1 ]  [ Q x g1 ] , [ N f4 ]  cant take [ h6 ] pawn [ N e2 ] then lose a queen
 [ K e1 ] , [ f2 + ]  58.Ke1! [ f2 ] ?? Oh boy !!! This is not just a blunder - it is a crime. Black is very much in the game after 58...Rf4! 59 [ K d2 ] [ f x g2 ] 60 [ Q e3 ] Kg7! getting the king out of harm's way.
 [ K e3 ]  [ R b4 ]  [ R c3 ]  [ K e6 ]  [ K d3 ] , [ R d4 + ]  I expected something like 32. ...[ f5 ] here and figured I'd have to play [ K c2 ] and Rc4. Black makes it a tad easier for me.
 [ e4 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ Q c6 ] , [ N e5 ]  This was somewhat experimental. The unsupported knight could have gone more conservatively to [ d4 ] and then if pushed to b3.
 [ K x h5 ] , [ K e7 ]  trying to offer assistance from my king even though blocked by white rook - staying on black squares out of habit (because of white bishop)
 [ O-O ]  [ a6 ] , [ d4 ]  [ d4 ] to open the board a bit.
 [ R f3 ] , [ B b5 ]  My LSB wasn't finding any good squares and so I don't mind trading it off for his knight.
 [ N x e5 ] , [ Q e6 ]  The N was now pinned to his K. Looking at the computer analysis from the previous move the computer said my move here should have been Qc7. I like having both N's pinned for the time being.
 [ B x d2 ]  [ K x d2 ]  [ N e4 + ]  [ K c2 ] , [ N x d6 ]  
 [ d x c5 ] , [ R d c8 ]  ? I don't know why he moved here but this is the move that loses a pawn. Instead best was to recapture at once with 20...[ b x c5 ]  [ Q d4 ] , [ g5 ]  Understandable wanting to drive that N away and gaining tempo. But why do that when you can win something back. As it turns out 21...bxc5! would have done that.
 [ K e7 ]  [ Q x a6 ]  [ g6 ]  [ B e2 ] , [ e5 ]  Exposing an attack on the queen. But it is easily defended.
 [ R b8 ] , [ f2 ]  The Charge of the Light Brigade! That pawn is not going to stop!
 [ a4 ] , [ N d6 ]  20. ....... [ N d6 ] - I wonder why he did not play [ b x a3 ] e.p?
 [ b4 ] , [ R d d3 ]  Starting to wind the game down.
 [ K x f1 ] , [ N e3 + ]  White can't take my knight because of my queen on a3. White can't take my queen because of my knight on e3.
 [ Q f7 ]  [ Q x f7 ] , [ B x f7 ]  here we are
 [ R c6 + ]  [ B f6 ]  [ f x g4 ]  [ f x g4 ] , [ K f4 ]  end is coming : [ R b8 ] ...[ R b4 + ] must help !
 [ f x e5 ] , [ f x e5 ]  29. ...... [ f x e5 ] - pawn trade. This pawn is gonna be a killer later on.
 [ O-O ]  [ B e2 ]  [ e5 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N c6 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N e7 ]  [ b4 ] , [ N e8 ]  [TR] By the way THIS is the absolutely critical stage where both players decide on their strategy for the next many moves. Don't just play any old move at this point. You have committed to Qside expansion with the great move b2-[ b4 ] and there are many ways to continue just try to form the long term plan for your piece placement now. I recall that Walter Korn in MCO13 didn't like my move [ N e8 ] here but I disagree. It has been played by Kasparov and it has many good points; the fact that it doesn't inhibit the c4-[ [ [ c5 ] ] ] advance (like it would on d7) is a weakness but White can force c4-[ [ [ c5 ] ] ] in any case so I'm not concerned about that. One setup for White is [ B e3 ] [ N e1 ] [ f3 ] [ N d3 ] and c5. Another involves [ B a3 ] [ Q b3 ] [ [ [ c5 ] ] ] and Nb5. Another is to play on the Kside after f7-[ f5 ] by [ N g5 ] and if f5-[ f4 ] then Bg4. There are many more as well.
 [ R d7 ]  [ a5 ]  [ R d5 ]  [ R a2 ]  [ R b5 ] , [ R a3 ]  threatening to clean the (ex-)queen-sides
 [ f3 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ b3 ]  [ R b4 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ O-O ]  [ R a b1 ]  [ R x b5 ]  [ Q f2 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ f x e4 ]  [ B x g5 ]  [ a4 ]  [ R x b3 ]  [ a5 ]  [ Q b5 ]  [ R x b3 ]  [ Q x b3 ] , [ K h1 ]  Avoiding 23...[ B e3 ] losing the queen.
 [ R c f1 ] , [ f5 ]  Stopping white's f pawn seemed a priority.
 [ R e8 ] , [ B h6 ]  ? This bishop belongs on the long diagonal not this tiny corner. I am trying to press my advantage with a mating attack but frankly I can't and I don't need to. This Bishop should retreat to [ b2 ] and then I need to pull back my Knight and focus on defending my kingside. This move doesn't lose on its own but it certainly is one big step along the road.
 [ Q c2 ] , [ N x g3 ]  Starting to feel the stirrings of a draw coming on here. I'm thinking that if white wants to keep his centrally located bishop he might recapture with 30. [ f x g3 ] damaging his pawn structure a little. If he does I may fight on a bit to see if I can exploit it.
 [ a6 ] , [ b3 ]  Intending to fianchetto the QB...
 [ B f4 ]  [ B x f4 ]  [ Q x f4 ]  [ B b3 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ Q g4 ]  [ Q g5 ] , [ R f4 ]  Ahora si D[ d8 ] T[ f8 ]  [ Q x a8 + ]  [ N b8 ]  [ Q d5 + ]  [ N d7 ]  [ e6 ]  [ Q x c2 + ]  [ R f2 ]  [ Q c8 ]  [ Q a5 + ]  [ N b6 ]  [ Q x b4 ]  [ B h6 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ R d1 ]  [ Q x e6 ]  [ B x h8 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ R f8 + ]  [ K d7 ]  [ Q b5 + ]  [ Q c6 ]  [ R d8 + ]  [ K c7 ] , [ Q b8 # ]  
 [ N x e4 ]  [ B x e4 ]  [ Q x e4 ] , [ R d2 ]  Why did I continue? Because I generally don't resign after the first major blunder. But this move was a memory lapse and when I made it I was thinking to myself that something doesn't look right here. My issue? I had just seen the move I missed which would've made this system work.
 [ R c8 ]  [ Q a4 ] , [ R x d4 ]  I played this move to get his queen away from the c-pawn so I can take and then play RxP followed by Rc1#. I did not see yet 23. [ R d1 + ] 24. BxR Qd2#.
 [ Q x h3 + ]  [ K e2 ] , [ N e6 ]  Black defends valiantly by centralizing his pieces.
 [ R x d8 ]  [ R x d8 + ]  [ K g7 ]  [ R e1 ] , [ Q x a3 ]  White has two rooks but Black's passed pawns are menacing.
 [ e6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ N f6 ]  3...[ B b4 ] is the very sharp Winawer Variation of the French. 3...[ N f6 ] usually leads to a much calmer game.
 [ R e1 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ Q d4 ]  What about the poor guy on [ c2 ] ?
 [ h6 ]  [ N x f6 + ]  [ N x f6 ]  [ B x f6 ] , [ g x f6 ]  My pawns are a mess but he doesn't have the B pair. I'm a pawn down but not entirely bad.
 [ f x g5 ]  [ R e1 + ]  [ K d2 ] , [ R d1 # ]  i just didn't see that his white bishop would guard that spot... well! thats how you learn.. if i would have taken his pawn [ d4 ] it would have bee very nice...
 [ f5 ] , [ f3 ]  Slightly better is f4.
 [ N d5 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ a6 ]  [ B x c6 ]  [ Q x c6 ] , [ B e3 ]  In White's shoes I would have captured the bishop.
 [ g3 ]  [ f5 ]  [ N e d2 ] , [ f4 ]  I decide to try and make something happen and it wasn't actually too bad of a choice.
 [ R d1 ]  [ R d8 ]  [ b4 ]  [ b5 ]  [ a4 ]  [ b x a4 ] , [ N x a4 ]  White's b pawns are now doubled and more importantly isolated. Another potential target later in the game.
 [ B e6 ] , [ f5 ]  And the fireworks begin. White is now preparing to throw everything including the kitchen sink towards black's king.
 [ a3 ] , [ R a c8 ]  A Knight withdrawal may have been more prudent.
 [ d3 ]  [ N g e7 ]  [ Q h4 ] , [ N x d5 ]  I grabbed a pawn as soon as I saw it.
 [ N x d5 ] , [ Q f3 ]  This time what white played is just as good as bringing the DSB out. This move should gain tempii and tempo is absolutely essential.
 [ O-O ]  [ B e7 ] , [ c3 ]  White tries to occupy the centre with two centre pawns. Next move he will strike the centre unless I strike it first.
 [ c3 ]  [ a7 ] , [ K g8 ]  Black hopes a blunder (which can happen). If 65. ... [ c2 ] 66. Bx[ c2 ] KxR
 [ K d5 ] , [ Q d4 # ]  Hope you enjoyed this little mating attack.
 [ B g5 ]  [ e6 ]  [ f4 ]  [ Q b6 ] , [ Q d2 ]  The poisoned pawn variation. While the cute 8. a3?! could lead to [ Q x b2 ] 9. Na4! trapping the queen it's a waste of a move if black sees through that simple threat.
 [ Q x h5 ]  [ B d7 ] , [ K d2 ]  Reinforcements are to come!
 [ N x d4 ] , [ e x d4 ]  I take his Night and he takes mine with e:d4. Now the queens are face to face!
 [ B g2 ] , [ e5 ]  The only move I could find in any quick reference was 2. ... [ d5 ] but the GK DB seemed to like 2. ... [ e5 ] just as well so I tried it this way.
 [ Q e7 ]  [ N g5 ] , [ h6 ]  This is the reaction I expected. Otherwise ...[ Q h5 ] is uncomfortable.
 [ Q g2 + ]  [ K f4 ] , [ Q g5 # ]  I thought I played quite well but there was I crucial mistake at move 27 which White did not punish. So I won.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ B c4 ]  The Giuoco Piano. I was expecting the Ruy Lopez.
 [ c4 ]  [ e5 ] , [ g3 ]  after [ c4 ] [ e5 ] [ N c3 ] [ N f6 ] [ g3 ] we enter the Carls' Bremen system: after that [ d5 ] would lead to some kind of a reversed Dragon; [ B b4 ] to the Smyslov system...
 [ N x f7 ]  [ K x f7 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ N d7 ]  Keeping white's knight off e5.
 [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N d b5 ]  [ d6 ]  [ e4 ] , [ a6 ]  It is necessary to drive away the advanced knight before proceeding with the rest of my development.
 [ R c3 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ R c4 ] , [ R d8 ]  The position was starting to run out of the tactics that had held me through the late opening middlegame and early endgame.
 [ Q f3 ] , [ R g h8 ]  this makes sense
 [ e5 ] , [ B x e5 ]  Going one pawn up - note that untill now white had 3 active minor pieces against a knight that blocked in his bishop and another bishop that has to defend [ g7 ]  [ N x e5 ] , [ Q x e5 + ]  Up to here I had planned and I liked what I saw - but then the gift that kept on giving [ Q e7 ] - in hind sight [ B e7 ] looked worse to me but it would be less costly......
 [ d5 ]  [ g3 ]  [ c5 ]  [ B g2 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ d4 ]  She turns it into a reversed Grünfeld Defence https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gr%C3%BCnfeld_Defence I would have preferred a reversed King's Indian Defence https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King%27s_Indian_Defence
 [ B x d4 ] , [ R x d4 ]  ...and again we trade pieces giving my rook a bit more tempo being so high up with a possibility of doubling on the d-file although [ N e2 ] would force it back...
 [ N e2 ] , [ N d7 ]  connecting the rooks and aiming for Nc5...
 [ K e2 ]  [ R a2 ]  [ R c1 ]  [ c5 ] , [ b x c5 ]  37. [ b x c5 ] - I take what I can.
 [ B g5 + ]  [ K d7 ]  [ c4 ] , [ R e8 ]  He couldn't have been dumb enough to go for a checkmate but I still decided by moving Bishop to [ e3 ] I would be able to push the pawn to c5.
 [ O-O ] , [ a3 ]  I force him to make an unpleasant decision.
 [ Q x c7 ]  [ Q x e4 ]  [ Q c4 ]  [ Q e7 ] , [ Q c8 ]  I am trying to keep the Knights from approaching. If 40 N-K3? 40... R-K sq wins a piece.
 [ B x e4 + ]  [ K h8 ] , [ Q e3 ]  Good and solid.
 [ B x d2 ] , [ Q x f3 ]  Black takes out my light squared bishop his best trade here.
 [ B x c5 + ]  [ b x c5 ]  [ N f5 ]  [ R f3 ]  [ h4 ]  [ g x h4 ]  [ R x h4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ R h8 ]  [ R d1 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ R h3 ]  [ K b8 ]  [ R d7 ]  [ K c8 ]  [ R h5 ]  [ R x e6 ]  [ R f7 ]  [ R e1 + ]  [ K f2 ]  [ R f1 + ] , [ K g2 ]  why not take the rook? then you're left with rook vs. knight - an easy win
 [ Q e7 ] , [ Q x h8 ]  Plan for mate on [ h2 ] foiled...and lost a rook.
 [ O-O-O ]  [ R b1 ] , [ B c5 ]  11. ..... [ B c5 ] - I could have played [ N x a5 ] here but I decided to clear the decks. At least two of Charlotte's pawns are now en prise.
 [ N x f6 + ] , [ g x f6 ]  ?! Black wants to keep a strong center pawn mass and open the g-file for Rook play against the White kingside as well but 7...[ Q x f6 ] was probably more sound as it gives Black the option to shift the Queen over to [ g6 ] and pressure the hard-to-defend e-pawn.
 [ O-O ] , [ N c7 ]  11. ...... [ N c7 ] - asks the [ e6 ] knight a question.
 [ R g8 ] , [ h4 ]  Locking the position. Neither side can accomplish much and I'm happy to take a draw given that I'm still behind in material.
 [ B x e5 ] , [ R x e5 ]  Look at the last four white moves all of them being very aggressive responses and dealt within the opposing territory.
 [ Q h7 ] , [ d x e5 ]  but here he does change my plans he left a huge space for me to attack from the left side
 [ Q x c4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N b d7 ]  [ B f4 ] , [ N b6 ]  driving back the queen and strengthening my hold on d5.
 [ N g2 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ R a c8 ] , [ B b3 ]  Black has a very strong [ f5 ] square. I think Carlsen needs to start trading some minor pieces before the position becomes dangerous. Caruana's pieces are better placed.
 [ e x f6 ] , [ N x f6 ]  After white's next the [ e5 ] break is off the cards so I am not sure if the alternative captures help at all.
 [ Q x h7 ] , [ R c1 ]  he needs to plan out his moves better.
 [ N f6 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ B f5 ]  Development....wanting to get the bishop out before I close the diagonal off.
 [ K f5 ] , [ R x f3 ]  Allowing a discovered check
 [ e6 ]  [ e4 ] , [ B c5 ]  Excellent! impedes 4.[ B e3 ] and short castling. This is what happens when you don't think about the consequences of your opening flaws.
 [ b5 ]  [ a5 ] , [ b6 ]  Black has to take or else I promote it.
 [ R g1 ] , [ B c6 ]  May be not the best move but it is consistent with my style of play in this game. For instance 10.- [ B d5 ] 11.[ c4 ] [ d x c3 ] e.p. 12.[ Q x c3 ] [ N c6 ] would take away much of my initiative and suddenly White would be better developed. I would still have the better position being one Knight and two pawns up but I feel that 10.- [ B c6 ] is more on the spot.
 [ N f6 ] , [ B f4 ]  So my opponent chose to play the London System. I will admit that I had not prepared for this opening at all. So I just played moves that were natural and followed opening principles.
 [ c5 ] , [ f4 ]  I play the sicilian against my chess enemy cdf555(who is much better than I am). He always plays the kings gambit against my sicilian so....
 [ B x c3 ]  [ Q d7 ]  [ Q e2 ]  [ O-O-O ]  [ O-O-O ] , [ N g e7 ]  Now both sides have finished development and the middle game is about to start
 [ N e8 ]  [ e x d5 ] , [ N d6 ]  The knight has obviously improved as has the bishop so it has to be said that black has made progress. The loss of the d-pawn is at the moment important as the c4-pawn is about fall and d5-pawn after that too. White now tries to roll blakc over whit those pawns to make as much damage as he can.
 [ B x c7 ]  [ R c8 ] , [ B a5 ]  [ B g3 ] would have been better in order to maintain control over the important square e5.
 [ K g1 ] , [ R x a3 ]  One move too late to force a win.
 [ B d2 ] , [ B h6 ]  and now I expect [ B c3 ]  [ R a d1 ] , [ B x e3 ]  he refused the kind offer so I'll exchange bishops to deny white the bishop pair and next I'll bring the knight to the center in a conjugated effort to get some material or positional benefict
 [ Q a5 + ]  [ B d2 ]  [ R e8 + ]  [ K f2 ]  [ Q a6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ N g4 + ]  And here comes the sacrifice. Had he not taken the bait and moved 17. [ K g3 ] instead then i think he would have been better after 17. ..[ Q d6 + ] 18. [ B f4 ] although he would still have a vulnerable position.
 [ Q x g2 + ]  [ K x g2 ]  [ a6 ]  [ a4 ]  [ a x b5 ] , [ a x b5 ]  Locking the Q-side in place.
 [ R a e8 ] , [ N f3 ]  It would seem that the poisoned pawn is now safe to capture. But I was looking there when making this move and hoping black thought so too.
 [ K x b2 ]  [ h5 ]  [ K x a3 ]  [ h6 ]  [ b5 ]  [ h7 ]  [ b4 ]  [ h8 = Q ]  [ b3 ] , [ Q a1 + ]  Timely stopping black's pawns while moving the king closer.
 [ c4 ] , [ g6 ]  Now King's Indian defense. Rather than challenge W's control of the middle of the board with 2. [ e6 ] B allows W control of the middle for now.
 [ N f3 ]  [ B b7 ] , [ d3 ]  Extra protection for the e-pawn so the c-knight can move better. Also allows the black squared bishop to develop.
 [ b x c6 ] , [ N d3 ]  Stage two.
 [ R b2 ]  [ B e4 ] , [ R x e4 ]  Werid exchange he probably was afraid on [ B x f3 ]  [ e4 ]  [ c6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ N x e4 ] , [ N d7 ]  This move has a long pedigree. Aron Niemzowitsch in the 1920's Salo Flohr in the 1930's World Champions Tigran Petrosyan and Vassili Smyslov in the 1950's and 1960's and in the 1980's Kasparov's predecessor as champion Anatoli Karpov have all made use of it. The idea is to develop the KN at [ K B3 ] and be able to reply to NxN with... NxN thus preserving the Black pawn structure.
 [ Q a4 ]  [ Q x d5 ] , [ c x d4 ]  If 15. [ Q x d4 ] [ B b7 ] 16. [ Q x d5 ] [ B x d5 ] Black is better due to his more active pieces better pawn structure and 3-to-1 majority on the queenside.
 [ d3 ] , [ Q g7 ]  Black's queen risks being pinned against the rook here.
 [ f4 ] , [ e x f4 ]  If [ B x g6 ] then 20. ... [ B g4 ] 21.[ K x g4 ] [ Q x g3 ] 22.[ K h5 ] [ h x g6 ] 23.[ K x g6 ] [ R f6 ] 24.[ K h5 ] Rh6#; if [ N e2 ] then 20. [ f x g3 ] [ N f4 ] 21. [ B g4 ] and again Black wins material.
 [ Q e8 ]  [ Q f5 + ]  [ K g7 ]  [ B x d7 ]  [ Q d8 ] , [ N e4 ]  Don't like his lsb pointing at my [ g2 ] pawn. Dont want complications should his rook move to [ g8 ] in the future. Also brings my knight over into the attack
 [ B x c4 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ N e5 ]  attacking the bishop
 [ K h2 ] , [ Q g1 # ]  This is my favorite short game :)
 [ O-O-O ] , [ N d7 ]  Probably better e6. I wanted to counter a possible [ B d4 ] with [ c5 ] but this is a bad plan since it leaves the white knight very good squares.
 [ Q b8 ] , [ N x d7 ]  I'm not sure White should have gone this way. The knight was quite well placed.
 [ Q f7 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ B x e5 ]  [ R x e5 ] , [ N g6 ]  A favorable simplification follows leaving white better
 [ R d4 + ]  [ K g5 ]  [ f4 ]  [ R f3 ]  [ R d2 ]  [ h5 ]  [ R x a2 ]  [ R x f4 ]  [ R g2 + ]  [ R g4 ]  [ R x g4 + ] , [ K x g4 ]  OK here's where I blow my win...
 [ N f3 ]  [ g5 ]  [ B h2 ]  [ e6 ]  [ B e2 ] , [ c6 ]  I felt 8.[ c4 ] was in order to win space on the queenside while giving my opponent something to play for on the kingside...
 [ N c3 ] , [ Q g5 ]  now that I've freed up my position it's time to develop some more
 [ c6 ] , [ a4 ]  Erm yes like I said my kingside attack ... :S Not quite sure why the change of plan here -- I think I was blocking bishop advances to [ b5 ] whilst hoping to play [ R a3 ] to get the Rook into kingside play.
 [ a3 ]  [ a6 ]  [ b3 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ B b2 ]  [ b6 ]  [ e x f5 ]  [ B x f5 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ B x e4 ]  [ Q x e4 ]  [ R f4 ]  [ Q e3 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ R a c1 ] , [ R a f8 ]  hereabouts black starts to take control of the board
 [ g3 ] , [ R g4 ]  Not 13...Bd5? (thinking to invade [ h1 ] and deny White's castle) because of 14.f3! simultaneously blocking the threat and winning the Rook.
 [ K e2 ]  [ a4 ]  [ N d3 ]  [ a x b3 ]  [ a x b3 ] , [ B g2 ]  I want White to play [ h4 ] when his pawns are locked and I can play on the queen side.
 [ e4 ] , [ c5 ]  I never play the sicilian. It is too studied too played. I don't study so... Anyway: I am a little tired of the Scandinavian. I know that my system can be beaten so it's time to explore new sets.
 [ R b1 ]  [ g5 ]  [ K f1 ] , [ f4 ]  To support the advance e4-[ e3 ]  [ g x f4 ]  [ g x f4 ]  [ R f2 ]  [ e3 ]  [ R f3 ] , [ K f5 ]  There isn't much white can do (unless you can suggest something) so I take my time to ensure the win.
 [ R d2 ]  [ R f d8 ]  [ R x d8 + ]  [ R x d8 ] , [ h4 ]  An escape hatch.
 [ R h4 ]  [ R b e8 ]  [ R x e4 ]  [ R x e4 ] , [ Q h1 ]  ?! I thought of rerouting the Queen to the Kingside to attack the [ c7 ] pawn and infiltrating the 7th or 8th rank. 28. [ a4 ] opens the game and maybe even 28. Rb4?! works with the idea of RxNc4. I was in time trouble
 [ Q d1 ] , [ N e4 ]  [AK] "Minus a rook Tal plays as if nothing has happened. His threats of ...[ d3 ] and...[ N c3 ] are serious." But it would seem that White could safely take the d-pawn here: 20.[ N x d4 ] Ba4!!? 21.[ Q x a4 ] [ B x d4 ] 22.Be3! [ B x a1 ] 23.[ R x a1 ] [ N c3 ] 24.[ Q c2 ] with an OK game. But that's not to depreciate Portisch's actual choice of move...
 [ B x b7 ]  [ K f5 ] , [ K d5 ]  ! Black king must not let to go to other side of the board.
 [ B x d7 + ]  [ K e7 ] , [ Q x d4 ]  11. [ Q x d4 ] - winning the knight and central control.
 [ B x d6 ] , [ c x d6 ]  The pawnstructure is worse.
 [ N h6 ] , [ B x h6 ]  Forced if I don't want to give back the pawn.
 [ R x f8 ]  [ Q e6 + ]  [ K d8 ] , [ Q x d6 + ]  That's about it my whole reason behind white's 11th and 12th moves - to gain a pawn and in doing so creating a passed pawn on the e-file though it looks like it may have a very short life at the moment. I figure this is where my attack will peter out. Black has a good reply to defend against the fork of his king and his rook on [ f8 ] and white has to consider retreating the bishop and regrouping.
 [ N c3 ]  [ c6 ]  [ b4 ]  [ a6 ] , [ a4 ]  White is clearly going for a pawn attack on the queen side. At this stage I decided to leave off trying to counter this and switch attention to normal development on the king side.
 [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d x c5 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ c x d6 ] , [ e x d6 ]  I let white take a couple of pawns before recapturing.
 [ N f5 ] , [ N x c2 ]  As now I take and am beginning to feel quite happy about my position believe it or not. Though the problem is becoming too satisfied that I miss other things.
 [ R x f7 ] , [ R f8 ]  No help - in fact it leaves White with a forced 3-move checkmate. Better was carry on with a counter-attack plan (something I took care to calculate out you betcha): 29...Rxf1ch 30.[ K x f1 ] Qb1ch 31.[ K e2 ] Qc2ch 32.[ K f3 ] ... and as 32...Qe4ch 33.k[ g3 ] simply ran Black out of checks 32...[ R f8 ] 33.Rxf8ch [ K x f8 ] 34.[ Q x e6 ] and wins.
 [ c x d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ b5 ]  [ Q g4 ] , [ f5 ]  ...has to be..
 [ a x b4 ]  [ a6 ]  [ h4 ] , [ R c6 ]  preparing to double
 [ B c4 + ]  [ K c2 ] , [ B x b5 ]  
 [ Q x d4 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ Q d1 ]  A good of a move as any.
 [ N e2 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N g3 ]  [ g5 ]  [ B e2 ] , [ h5 ]  At this point I'm quite happy. Pawn charge time good support behind....
 [ K f6 ]  [ K f2 ]  [ K e5 ]  [ K e3 ] , [ N e6 ]  played around to [ c5 ] but since the knight was keeping the bishop at bay as a guardian of [ g2 ] it would probably have been better to reposition the pawns on the king side on dark squares so they can't be attacked by the white bishop. 39...[ g5 ] has an additional benefit of preventing [ f4 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ N c5 ]  [ B c2 ] , [ N d7 ]  Very passively played but since the KS pawns are now locked in position because they are on light squares there needs to come some sort of support.
 [ b3 ]  [ B a3 + ]  [ K b1 ]  [ N d2 + ] , [ K a1 ]  ?? I thought [ R x d2 ] was best...
 [ B g1 ]  [ g5 ]  [ N c4 ]  [ R e7 ]  [ R d2 + ]  [ K e4 ]  [ R d4 + ]  [ K f3 ]  [ R x d5 ]  [ R x h6 + ]  [ K g8 ]  [ R g6 ]  [ N e5 + ] , [ R x e5 ]  There wasn't a credible threat to my king with the way he was doing it and now I am ahead and not worried.
 [ K f1 ]  [ B d4 + ]  [ K e2 ] , [ Q e3 # ]  
 [ R x g1 ]  [ K x g1 ]  [ f x e4 ] , [ f x e4 ]  A curious mistake. I guess there is a chance I could have won it anyway after pushing [ e5 ] and playing [ B x f5 ] but this was a gift to my pawn structure.
 [ R e1 ]  [ Q x e5 + ]  [ R x e5 ]  [ R h8 ]  [ K c3 ] , [ c5 ]  Black offered a draw at this point since even though a pawn up an endgame wing pawn seemed unlikely to promote. 1/2- 1/2
 [ N c6 ]  [ N b3 ] , [ R d1 ]  36. [ R d1 ] - threatening mayhem along the d file. Tim decides to wave the white flag at this juncture. GA confirms resignation on the grounds of ruinous loss of material as I have a plus score of 6.48. A fascinating example of how an uncastled king can be in danger even when the queens have been exchange and on Move 36! I hope you have had a good read and another example of a king being caught in the centre will occur in my Jo against The Titans game against Coach Ion. It is Henry but against a player of Expert/Master strength such as Ion will it be a recipe for disaster? Well wait and see. Till next time bye for now - Joanne
 [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ N c6 ]  I wasn't very familiar with this variation of the Sicilian and honestly had no idea what I was doing in the opening.
 [ c5 ] , [ c4 ]  This kind of play is I believe not that uncommon but is definatly not to my taste.
 [ Q f7 ] , [ Q x f7 # ]  Not the longest game but it's neat how such a bad opening leads to a win. I'd love to hear input thx for reading.
 [ N c6 ] , [ d4 ]  Time to challenge the [ c5 ] pawn. As white I rarely play this move opting usually to let the piece occupy the square defending it might have been a bit difficult for my opponent later but I wanted to see where this line would lead.
 [ R x a1 + ] , [ N x a1 ]  only problem: my knight is far from the center.
 [ Q g2 ] , [ K d2 ]  My only possible response. Anything else loses the h-rook. I was not a happy camper.
 [ e5 ]  [ d5 ] , [ N b8 ]  This may look bad at first but due to the closed nature of the position black can afford a few extra tempi in re-routing his Knight to a stronger square. As pawn formations change new plans need to be formulated. The original idea behind ...[ N c6 ] was to take the route Nc6-e7-[ g6 ] but as this was prevented the Knight will now be most effective on c5. After taking all of this into consideration ...[ N b8 ] is the best move!
 [ R d8 ] , [ g3 ]  ? These positions do not forgive any waste of time. 17.[ R h e1 ] is the correct move when white has enough resources for a draw but nothing more like in Lutz - Gelfand 2002.
 [ Q g3 ] , [ R b c8 ]  Stopping the pawn's advance for the time being.
 [ h4 ] , [ N x f2 ]  White further prevents [ g5 ] positioning by black. Maybe an attempt to relocate his N. [ N f3 ] may have been a little hope chess. I was unsure of the best move. I started a bad exchange to force white to make a tactical decision.
 [ Q g4 ]  [ B f8 ]  [ R d4 ] , [ R x d4 ]  
 [ e x f6 ]  [ e x f6 ] , [ N b3 ]  (23. [ R x f6 ] [ B f5 ] unclear position)
 [ R c7 ]  [ N c4 ]  [ R c f7 ]  [ R x f7 ]  [ g x f7 + ]  [ K f8 ]  [ R c2 ]  [ d4 ] , [ a4 ]  toughest is [ K f2 ] [ B f5 ] [ R c1 ] [ d3 ] [ R x c3 ] [ d2 ] Rxc4...
 [ B c4 ] , [ N c6 ]  White's 2. [ B c4 ] seems to have confused the Game DB but 2. [ B c4 ] is called the Philidor Variation.
 [ c5 ]  [ N a3 ]  [ c6 ]  [ O-O-O ]  [ d5 ] , [ e6 ]  If the d pawn takes my [ e4 ] pawn Rook takes Queen. Here I pushed [ e6 ] to allow my Bishop to attack his Rook.
 [ K d8 ] , [ R x d5 + ]  Taking the pawn and bringing my rook in for support.
 [ b3 ]  [ e5 ]  [ B b2 ] , [ Q e7 ]  Here's a move I've never seen before. He said he wanted to get me out of the normal lines quickly but I don't think it's worth clogging up the kingside.
 [ e x f6 ]  [ e x f6 ]  [ Q x h7 + ]  [ K f8 ] , [ Q h8 + ]  and black resigns after 27... Ke7.28.Nxd5+Qxd5.29.[ R e1 + ] and black in lost position . thank you and i hope you enjoyed the game .
 [ g4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f5 ]  [ g6 ]  [ g5 ]  [ g x f5 ] , [ e x f5 ]  Has white gone mad!! No in fact this knight sacrifice though unclear is usually regarded as very sound.
 [ B e2 ] , [ Q a5 ]  Qa5. This puts pressure on the diagonal.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ B b5 ]  Spanish.
 [ B x g5 ]  [ N x g5 ] , [ b6 ]  if [ N x e6 ] I have [ R e8 ] wining the [ e4 ] pawn... this is a common structure for black's queen side majority leaves [ c6 ] for the knight and defends the [ c5 ] pawn
 [ K f6 ]  [ R c8 ]  [ R a4 + ]  [ K h5 ]  [ K x f5 ] , [ e7 ]  "Nearly there now. He can't stop me!"
 [ b3 ] , [ Q x e1 # ]  ...but to my great surprise I end up with the rook and mating. I sure gave him a nasty surprise!
 [ B g2 ]  [ Q c8 ]  [ Q e2 ]  [ Q f5 ]  [ R d1 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ R c1 ]  [ B d4 ]  [ B x e5 ]  [ B x e5 ]  [ Q x c4 ]  [ K g7 ]  [ Q e4 ]  [ N h6 ]  [ Q x f5 ]  [ N x f5 ]  [ K e2 ]  [ R d8 ]  [ R h d1 ] , [ N d4 + ]  I think I'm back in the game at this point.
 [ a4 ] , [ B d8 ]  The threat is an obvious one but hey the bishop needed to find a better home than [ e7 ] anyway.
 [ N d5 ]  [ Q d6 ]  [ N x c7 + ]  [ K d8 ] , [ N x f7 + ]  
 [ N x g6 ] , [ K f6 ]  40....... [ K f6 ] - sidestepping a nasty discovery.
 [ b5 ]  [ N b8 ] , [ g3 ]  Why is white still pushing just pawns?
 [ e x d5 ] , [ e x d5 ]  thankfully he took my pawn and I took back and now I have a little bit of relief for my knight.
 [ B d3 ]  [ N c5 ] , [ B f5 ]  Seems like a terrible blunder but he would have lost a bishop anyways had he gone for 13. [ B b1 ] [ N b3 ] 14. [ R a2 ] [ N x c1 ] 15. [ R a1 ] [ N b3 ] (for the getaway followed by O-O-O or bishop activation). The blunder probably happened with his attempt to defend an indefensible position.
 [ K f8 ] , [ R a g1 ]  Black threatened to win the white rook on [ g7 ] (21. ... Qx[ g7 ] 22. Qx[ g7 ] Kxg7) but it never would have worked. White defends by bringing his inactive rook into the fray.
 [ f5 ] , [ f6 ]  To prevent [ f6 ] and weaken kingside structure.
 [ Q h1 ]  [ B x h6 ] , [ Q g1 ]  I think I would have snagged the bishop with the pawn. Taking it with the knight sacrifices P[ h5 ] to the white queen.
 [ O-O ]  [ f4 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ B g2 ] , [ c5 ]  13. ...... c5?! - this move chucks away my material advantage and gives Freddy a big edge.
 [ R x c1 + ]  [ Q x c1 ] , [ d6 ]  This move temporarily stops his knight from moving into c5. More importantly however it opens up the game a bit. This allows my bishops to be much more effective particularly my black bishop.
 [ N x f7 ]  [ B x f7 ]  [ g x f7 ] , [ R e d8 ]  Protecting her Rook.
 [ R x f6 ]  [ K d8 ]  [ R a7 ] , [ K e8 ]  This prevents [ R f6 ]  [ g6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ e4 ] , [ d6 ]  3. ........ [ d6 ] - transposes into a Pirc/Robatsch Defence.
 [ R a d8 ] , [ B f4 ]  I was trying to provoke ...[ e5 ] from Black which would transpose to the modern Italian. A position which could also be reached with the [ d3 ] Spanish. The move also prevents...d5.
 [ h5 ] , [ R h6 ]  ?? Just a waste of time.
 [ B f5 ] , [ Q g3 ]  In this position I was thinking he would initiate some trades; the position is getting dangerous for black's king. Black castles long next but that really was not wise as the next few moves would prove.
 [ B b6 ] , [ a4 ]  ! And now Black needs to be verrrrrry careful or else the Bishop gets trapped.
 [ O-O ]  [ O-O-O ] , [ N d7 ]  Development is now complete and the middle game proper begins.
 [ h x g6 ]  [ N e4 ] , [ Q c7 ]  I could have saved the bishop but it forced me to more time losses.
 [ d x e5 ] , [ d x e5 ]  Ok just stay calm nothing had happened still. His dsb is really sad there. Much better for him I think was f5. He granted me a good future for my dsb. Now I'm sure that after [ B e3 ] [ f5 ] will come so I had to be smarter...
 [ N x f5 ]  [ B x f5 ]  [ B x d6 ] , [ Q x d6 ]  Although I still have just a measly pawn in material advantage the situation is starting to look very menacing for black. He will need to do something about the very immediate threat of the queen rook and bishop that are aimed at his king.
 [ Q d3 ]  [ Q x b2 ] , [ O-O ]  I'm as the error
 [ B e3 ] , [ Q c2 ]  I wonder how can white defend [ b7 ] and develop but I was dead wrong.
 [ R x b1 ] , [ R x c6 ]  I still can't put enough defence on my b pawn so I have to look for something else
 [ O-O ]  [ B b7 ]  [ R a b1 ] , [ e5 ]  Black certainly needs a break but this is inaccurate giving White the opportunity to lock out both Black Bishops with 12.d5! or simply blast apart the center with 12.dxe5. Better was 11...c5. Already it's clear how White's advantage in space and energy badly restrict the Black options.
 [ Q d7 ]  [ N b5 ] , [ N b4 ]  should of castled
 [ Q d2 ] , [ N c6 ]  triple attack on my d pawn
 [ Q e2 ] , [ B f5 ]  Why not [ B f2 + ] ? Well after [ K d1 ] [ Q x d5 ] [ N f d2 ] and white is going pile pieces onto the fixed knight probobaly winning a pawn and maybe some kind of [ Q h5 + ] Ideas as [ f5 ] is pretty forced.
 [ O-O ]  [ O-O ] , [ N a5 ]  I'm not too sure about this move. my queen wasn't doing a whole lot and this move only mislaces the knight who will now use a further tempo to get back into the game. I presumed at the time though that maybve this is so black can develop his LSB.
 [ g5 ] , [ Q h3 ]  I definitely want White's Queen gone.
 [ N a6 ] , [ h x g6 ]  resigns!!! why: if [ f x g6 ] than n[ x e6 + ] winning or [ h x g6 ] q[ h6 + ] winning or n[ x g6 ] qh6+winning!!!
 [ Q c1 ] , [ a x b5 ]  now the knight is helped by the rook
 [ B a6 ]  [ N c4 ]  [ B e7 ] , [ f x e5 ]  2nd capture puts me up by 4.
 [ K e8 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ R a8 ] , [ B b5 ]  Pinning the N.
 [ Q c7 ]  [ R b1 + ]  [ K h2 ]  [ R b2 + ]  [ K g1 ]  [ N c4 ]  [ Q c6 + ]  [ K e7 ]  [ Q e4 + ]  [ B e6 ]  [ Q x h7 + ]  [ K d6 ]  [ Q g7 ]  [ b5 ]  [ Q f8 + ]  [ K d5 ]  [ Q d8 + ]  [ K c6 ]  [ Q e8 + ]  [ B d7 ]  [ Q e4 + ]  [ K c7 ]  [ Q d4 ]  [ B c6 ]  [ Q c5 ]  [ K b7 ]  [ K f1 ]  [ R d2 ]  [ K e1 ] , [ R d7 ]  This is looking bad for white! real bad...
 [ Q f1 ] , [ f3 + ]  Only giving up the queen prevents checkmate now. [ Q h6 ] would have forced mate in 3 but the match is over regardless
 [ R a1 ]  [ K e4 ]  [ R a6 ] , [ K d5 ]  Wasn't too keen on the Rook getting behind my passer though I don't think he could stop me winning if he did. I'd prefer him to have his Rook over on the h-file.
 [ R e8 ]  [ e6 ]  [ K f6 ] , [ d6 ]  This move gets a ?? Here I foresaw 33...[ B x e6 ] 34.[ B x e6 ] [ R x e6 ] 35.d7! and White's pawn cannot be stopped from queening. What I had NOT seen however was
 [ B h3 ] , [ N e4 ]  Not the best move as it gives equality to Black with best play. However the move sets a little trap that black falls into.
 [ R c1 ]  [ B x b5 ]  [ Q x b5 ]  [ Q x b5 ] , [ a x b5 ]  Now material is even but Black might be slightly better owing to more control of the open file.
 [ N b8 ] , [ B e4 ]  ? Helping Blacks cause. Possibly thinking Bh7+? That does absolutely nothing at all.
 [ N b1 ] , [ N h5 ]  Why not ...Ne4? I see a vulnerability in his setup that requires me to get his queen off. it also requires me to keep that file open for my knight and pin his instead. now if he moves his knight I can kill it and bring my other rook around.
 [ R g1 ]  [ Q e4 ]  [ Q c4 ] , [ Q d5 ]  I spotted [ R x g7 ] BxR and [ N e7 ] royal fork but KxR will save him and I have no force to win.
 [ b2 ]  [ R h8 + ]  [ K e7 ]  [ R b8 ]  [ R h2 ]  [ R b7 + ]  [ K e8 ] , [ e7 ]  Black's position is lost. The winning moves here will be [ d6 ] and Rb8+.
 [ g x f3 ]  [ Q h4 ]  [ K e2 ] , [ K h8 ]  Not 31. Kg2? to try and hold the pawn at [ [ h3 ] ] allowing 31. ... [ R g6 + ] 32. [ K f1 ] [ Q x [ h3 ] + ] capturing the pawn with check and gaining a tempo. Now that pawn at [ [ h3 ] ] isn't going anywhere and black is worried about the possible knight fork on e7. It's a shame to tie the rook on [ e6 ] down to the tedious task of defending against the fork. So 31. ... [ K h8 ] seems to be called for to free the rook.
 [ R c1 ]  [ R e6 ]  [ K g1 ]  [ K f4 ]  [ R a1 ] , [ N a3 ]  Slamming that door for a second time! White is dead lost now.
 [ a x b4 + ]  [ K x b4 ]  [ N x a4 ]  [ R x c4 ]  [ N b6 ] , [ R d4 ]  Alternative variation: 59. [ R c7 + ] [ K d8 ] 60. [ R g7 ] [ N x d5 + ] 61. [ K b5 ] [ N e7 ] [=]
 [ R b8 ] , [ Q c2 ]  "Cool". Two in one.
 [ e x d5 ]  [ e4 ]  [ g3 ] , [ e3 ]  (JC) I do not like this move. It blocks the action of the powerful B at [ Q B4 ] and tends to make White's position safer than it should have been.
 [ g4 ]  [ K g2 ]  [ h5 ]  [ h3 ] , [ K g6 ]  Black wants to keep control of his pawn islands with his king but they are in no immediate danger it is best to keep the King close to the passed pawn action. 41...[ R d6 ] is safe if White tries to advance with 42. [ d5 ] Black can interposed 42...[ K e5 ]  [ f3 ]  [ K g5 ]  [ h4 + ]  [ K f6 ]  [ f x g4 ]  [ f x g4 ]  [ K f2 ]  [ K f5 ]  [ K e3 ] , [ a6 ]  With very little moves left Black makes a careless blunder. As per the previous note 46...[ R d6 ] is best. Now White can infiltrate Black's defenses.
 [ g3 ] , [ B e6 ]  where were we again?
 [ B c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ f3 ]  [ N h6 ]  [ Q h3 ]  [ R f h8 ]  [ g4 ]  [ h x g4 ]  [ f x g4 ] , [ Q d8 ]  the [ a1 ] rook is still sleeping and its absence on the kingside will soon be felt
 [ B b3 ]  [ B h3 ]  [ g3 ] , [ N f3 + ]  Pinning the king down on [ h1 ] and adding it to the endangered species list.
 [ a5 ]  [ N b d2 ]  [ a4 ] , [ N c4 ]  Getting my N to a better square in the center.
 [ O-O ] , [ f4 ]  Slowly but inexorably my Pawns grind onward.
 [ b5 ] , [ c5 ]  I fully lock up the pawn structure hoping to just wait white out.
 [ K g1 ]  [ N x f1 ] , [ K x f1 ]  37. [ K x f1 ] - for now white plays on. Sooner or later however Glenda will demonstrate why a queen is much stronger than a rook.
 [ N c6 ]  [ R d7 ]  [ Q b6 ]  [ e4 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ Q f7 ] , [ N f5 ]  Fritz likes 24 [ Q b3 ] for White and I tend to agree. ...[ f3 ] 25 [ N x d6 ] [ N h4 ] 26 [ f4 ] [ N d5 ] 27 [ c x d5 ] [ B x d4 ] 28 [ K f1 ]  [ Q h5 ]  [ N e3 ]  [ N f g4 ]  [ N x g4 ] , [ Q x g4 ]  29...[ N x g4 ] is probably better
 [ Q e4 + ]  [ Q e2 ]  [ Q x h1 ]  [ O-O-O ]  [ Q e4 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ N b d7 ]  [ g4 ] , [ N x e5 ]  Bad move. White takes the knight which attacks [ N f6 ] while simultaneously exposing the h rook to white's black bishop.
 [ h5 ] , [ R d7 ]  39. [ R d7 ] - I continue to attack but unfortunately after black moves his pawn to [ c5 ] the rook has nothing to attack - at the moment. It does however confine his king to the back rank. Normally a rook on your opponent's seventh rank is called "a bone in the throat".
 [ K x b4 ]  [ N x c2 + ]  [ K c3 ]  [ N x e3 ]  [ f x e3 ] , [ R d3 + ]  And another pawn. He resigned.
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ c4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ d4 ] , [ N f3 ]  This is all standard so far for the Countergambit so far
 [ Q x g6 ]  [ R f7 ] , [ R d f1 ]  Also playable was [ R d2 ] if [ Q x d2 ] then Qxf7ch [ K h8 ] Qxg7mate.
 [ e x f6 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ f5 ]  [ B x d4 + ] , [ R x d4 ]  Now the Candidates of greatest interest seem to be 26...[ Q [ e5 ] ] or the move I have been intending to make here; 26...[ N d6 ] . I should also review 26...[ Q a7 ] to be sure it cannot be played safely enough to win his [ R d4 ] via ...[ e5 ] push or any other idea?! And doing so it can be found to be 3 distinct ways for BL to lose his Q by playing 26...Qa7|~??! Such as this: *** 26. [ R x d4 ] [ Q a7 ] 27. [ f x e6 + ] [ K x e6 ] 28. [ R e3 + ] [ N x e3 ] 29. [ Q x e3 + ] [ K d7 ] 30. [ R x d5 + ] [ K c6 ] 31. [ R c5 + ] [ K d7 ] 32. [ R d5 + ] [ K c6 ] 33. [ R c5 + ] [ K d7 ] 34. [ Q d4 + ] [ K e7 ] 35. [ R e5 + ] [ K f8 ] 36. [ Q x a7 ] *** For an EG of Qe5: [ B x d4 + ] 26. [ R x d4 ] [ Q [ e5 ] ] 27. [ f x e6 + ] [ f x e6 ] 28. [ R f7 + ] [ K e8 ] 29. [ R d f4 ] [ R h7 ] 30. [ R f8 + ] [ K d7 ] 31. Rf4[ f7 + ] [ R x f7 ] 32. Rx[ f7 + ] [ K d6 ] 33. [ R a7 ] [ R c6 ] ****
 [ N c3 ]  [ Q b6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N c6 ] , [ B e3 ]  Here the normal [ N h6 ] would have been the best but I fall into a naive beginner trick and I went...
 [ e x d6 ] , [ Q f3 ]  !
 [ B x d1 ]  [ N x d3 ] , [ B x c2 ]  Somehow I now have 4 pawns for the piece together with a bishop pair and a lead in development.
 [ B x f8 ] , [ R x f8 ]  Here I also took a long time. I was eyeing [ g5 ] (still !) but I was very worried about unleashing the knight to work in conjunction with his bishop and queen around my king. I started thinking that my k-side pawns were OK where they were. His pieces were sort of stifled and blocking each other a bit. I wanted to get my rooks going so...
 [ b5 ]  [ K e1 ]  [ N x c2 + ]  [ K f2 ]  [ b x c4 ] , [ B b2 ]  Now the black queen will be captured.
 [ c3 ]  [ Q a5 ]  [ N g f3 ] , [ g6 ]  so now the [ B f8 ] is going to [ g7 ] where it will bite on granite. Another strange choice by my higher-rated opponent.
 [ O-O-O ] , [ R g8 ]  Black is going for it
 [ B d7 ] , [ Q d5 ]  ! applying more pressure to the back rank.
 [ e x d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ Q d7 ]  [ N h2 ]  [ N x d2 ]  [ N x d2 ]  [ N b4 ] , [ R a3 ]  He want that otha bishop...but it is the nights that you need to penetrate the middle-game...sacrificing both mean that you will do a nights work with a bishop.
 [ b4 ] , [ N e2 ]  I advance to avoid a fractured pawn structure.
 [ e6 ]  [ N g3 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ c3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B e3 ]  [ d4 ]  [ B f2 ]  [ f6 ]  [ e x f6 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ c4 ] , [ e5 ]  Opening the e file the bishop and removing a weak pawn.
 [ N e5 ]  [ Q a5 ] , [ R e1 ]  I threaten the knight but I am really after the king
 [ K f2 ]  [ N c5 ]  [ B g2 ]  [ b6 ]  [ h5 ]  [ b5 ] , [ h4 ]  Things may look grim but I had some ideas in mind.
 [ R x h6 ]  [ N x h6 ] , [ Q d1 ]  Morphy has a slight advantage with Harrwitz's KP backward and a flank majority on the K-wing.
 [ B g6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ h6 ]  [ B e5 ]  [ Q f7 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ R f c8 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ Q e8 ] , [ N x g6 ]  Not an easy decision but I think I'm far enough ahead that I can win this endgame.
 [ h6 ]  [ Q e4 ]  [ a4 ]  [ Q g4 ]  [ g6 ]  [ N x h6 ]  [ K g7 ]  [ R e5 ] , [ a3 ]  Chess computer analysis rate this game costing blunder.
 [ e4 ] , [ b6 ]  Oh dear one of the weaker defences.
 [ Q h5 ] , [ N f6 + ]  !! Excellent move by white. Black has no choice but to recapture opening up the g file for counterplay.
 [ K h3 ]  [ R c3 + ]  [ K h2 ]  [ R c2 + ]  [ K h3 ]  [ R c3 + ] , [ K g2 ]  I'm up I can try to win.
 [ O-O ] , [ N d4 ]  Improving my knight and planning 17. [ N f5 ] to attack the pawn again.
 [ O-O ] , [ B e7 ]  The most sensible square for the bishop preventing any pins and keeping the center stabilized. Also preparing to castle.
 [ K e7 ] , [ N x d5 + ]  Even for a World Champion at the height of his form it can be hard to resist the temptation to win a pawn with check even more so in a minor piece endgame where material is usually key. However in this instance the text is a serious error which could and should have cost Karpov the win. After his superlative play hitherto that would have been a tragedy. The problem with the text as we will see is that it allows the black king a path into the white position via [ d5 ] and c4. For the time being White should leave the d5-pawn on the board where it hampers Black's counterplay and only take it when the time is ripe. In fact Karpov's error is a perfect example of breaching our beloved principle "Do not hurry!" and it is rare indeed to see the 12th World Champion err in this respect. The correct winning method was to annex only the f-pawn and gradually inch his way into the black position as follows: 55. Nh5! [ B x f3 ] 56. [ N x f6 ] [ K e6 ] 57. [ N e8 ] (threatening Nc7+) 57. ...[ K d7 ] 58. [ N g7 ] (taking the e6-square away from Black's king) 58. ...[ K e7 ] 59. [ K f5 ] [ K d6 ] 60. [ K f6 ] [ B e4 ] 61. [ N f5 + ] [ K d7 ] (of course the king and pawn ending is lost after the exchange on f5) 62 [ K e5 ] (White is gradually inching his way in on the dark squares) 62. ...[ B f3 ] 63. [ N e3 ] [ K c6 ] 64. [ K e6 ] [ B e4 ] 65. [ N f5 ] [ B f3 ] 66. [ N e7 + ] [ K c7 ] 67. Nxd5+. Now that White has full control he can take the d5-pawn without allowing counterplay and he will win simply.
 [ B c4 ]  [ g4 ] , [ O-O ]  The Muzio gambit. White is ready to sacrifice a whole piece to obtain a decisive development advantage and open lines.
 [ c5 ] , [ Q e3 ]  ...but loses a little thanks to the QBP which is now protected by the bishop. Still she sits nicely on the 3rd rank...
 [ B g5 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ e3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N c3 ]  [ b6 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ c5 ]  [ d x c5 ]  [ b x c5 ] , [ B x f6 ]  The intention here is to undermine the black's center. Now the d5pawn is under attack.
 [ N d2 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ R x e5 ] , [ N d7 ]  But Joe doesn't like ION's R there. On the other hand after retreating we get into another series of exchanges. I'm not exactly sure why it's necessary since when all is said and done white will be up the equivalent to a piece for pawn which is to ION's advantage.
 [ K d4 ]  [ R c b3 ]  [ K c5 ]  [ R b3 x b6 ]  [ K d5 ]  [ R e6 ]  [ K c5 ]  [ R d1 ]  [ K b5 ]  [ R c1 ]  [ K b4 ]  [ R b6 + ]  [ K a5 ] , [ R b2 ]  An elementary checkmate.
 [ Q x d4 ] , [ B c7 # ]  I love it when you stick to the plan and it comes to fruition its even sweeter to come through with a checkmate by seemingly giving up your Queen! I think black should have been aware of the risks in keeping the Queen out in the open and allowing white to gain tempo I think after 2. [ e x d5 ] [ Q x d5 ] the safest place is to get the queen back onto [ d7 ] and continue to naturally develop. Anyone got another opinion?
 [ N d5 ]  [ R x b7 ]  [ Q x b7 ]  [ B x a6 ]  [ Q a7 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ Q x a4 ]  [ B x a4 ]  [ N b4 ]  [ N b d4 ]  [ N c5 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ N x a2 ]  [ B c7 ]  [ R a8 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B f6 ] , [ B x b6 ]  mistake. sets up the [ N a4 ] fork which follows. Better was [ N f e5 ] linking the Ns deep in black's space and blocking the attack on b2.
 [ N c6 ] , [ a6 ]  Pressing onward...
 [ R d b8 ]  [ N x c3 ] , [ Q e5 ]  Can't move the knight as it exposes the mate in one.
 [ N d5 ] , [ B c4 ]  I also considered 4.[ c4 ] but that doesn't develop which is the only reason that I played this instead.
 [ Q x g5 + ]  [ K h7 ]  [ N g4 ] , [ N c2 ]  ?? In desperation black goes for the knight fork and prays to luck at the other end. His luck's not in though...
 [ B h6 ]  [ f x e4 ] , [ N g5 ]  Intensifying the pressure.
 [ Q c1 ]  [ Q e4 + ]  [ K h8 ] , [ c6 ]  44. [ c6 ] - only 2 to go.
 [ N x e5 ] , [ B x e5 ]  You're going to ask me why I captured this way instead of using the knight. I wasn't comfortable letting my knight get pinned -- though I don't see a way he can take advantage of it. I can of feel he has more options with his bishop (he can play it to h6) than I have with mine ([ a3 ] isn't attractive). But I'm not thrilled that we're getting closer to an endgame where I have the knight to his bishop. I'm going to need to hurry and take advantage of my rook on the c-file while his rook is still out of play.
 [ c3 ]  [ d6 ] , [ N x f4 ]  The [ f4 ] pawn falls.
 [ d x e6 ]  [ B x e6 ] , [ B e2 ]  Black has a tempo to develop. A little edge provided he can control white's center. For this black has o-o-o... Now the "strong" line is [ Q e7 ] (self blocking the dsb to be freed later) but with the B already on [ e2 ] this is no good for black. So I went for another line:
 [ B x c4 ] , [ R x c4 ]  Handing over the outpost for the rook now I'll be able to double up on the c file!
 [ B d4 ]  [ K f3 ]  [ B b6 ] , [ K e4 ]  the bishop can cover one and only one spot. white can get rid of the c pawn but this frees up the king. The better option is to remove those pesky right side pawns.
 [ e x f4 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ d3 ] , [ g5 ]  Greed! Wants to save a pawn?
 [ B b2 ]  [ R a d8 ]  [ h3 ]  [ Q f5 ] , [ N e2 ]  Coming to the aid of his King...
 [ e x f6 ]  [ d5 ]  [ B f5 ] , [ e4 ]  ( See the note at move 5. )
 [ Q d5 + ] , [ K a7 ]  If Tom had gotten out of check with 47...[ c6 ] I would answer with 48.[ Q d7 + ] and after being forced to bring it back to the eighth rank I'd mate with 49.[ R f8 # ]  [ K b7 ] , [ R f7 ]  Which is exactly what I kept in mind here.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ f5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ f x e4 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ N x c6 ] , [ Q g5 ]  Check out the position! I've never really been able to resist this sort of tactical freewheeling You may object that Black has no development to speak of and you would be right. Black is playing early tactics and taking a big risk in so doing. But it will be the tactics that will keep him in the game. Note that the queen was attacked on [ d8 ] but 7...[ b x c6 ] was scarcely playable on account of 8.Bxc6ch [ B d2 ] and now 9.[ B x a8 ] [ Q x a8 ] 10.[ Q e2 ] ... and I don't see Black holding his e-pawn; or better 9.Qh5ch! [ K e2 ] (9...[ g6 ] 10.Qe5ch tsk tsk) 10.Qe5ch [ B e6 ] 11.Bxa8... The line has been tried though.
 [ Q x d3 + ]  [ K x d3 ]  [ h5 ]  [ N f4 ] , [ R g3 + ]  (?!) OK but more consistent was 83.[ h6 ] at once. E.g. 83.h6! [ N x g2 ] 84.[ K x g2 ] [ K e4 ] 85.Bxd4! wins.
 [ N c3 ]  [ Q x b2 ] , [ N a4 ]  That's because Susan recommended [ a3 ] right after. But the issue was Nc3. So I explored a different option which she also mentioned by kicking the Queen. The thing however is that I'm not going to be able to trap it no matter how hard I try.
 [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ d3 ]  ?! i dont know what this move is called but its not the best it blocks the LSB i would go Bb5.
 [ Q g3 ]  [ e6 ] , [ d3 ]  12. [ d3 ] ?! this inaccuracy frees the bishop but 12. [ d4 ] was better - since my bishop is pinned and can't win the pawn - it demonstrates white's focus on the king rather than on the center.
 [ O-O ]  [ B b4 ] , [ e4 ]  Now that I've castled I can initiate complications.
 [ B x f3 ]  [ Q x f3 ] , [ O-O ]  At this point he decides to castle.
 [ B x d5 ] , [ B x f2 ]  Free pawn(not very useful)
 [ B x g2 ]  [ K x g2 ]  [ N d7 ] , [ N c6 ]  for some reason Black timed out here...
 [ B g2 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ O-O ]  [ e6 ] , [ N b d2 ]  I was just reached the standard position for White in the King Indian's Attack.
 [ c3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ N d f3 ]  If I were White here I probably would have pushed the pawn to [ f5 ] and launching an attack that I think Black would have a very difficult time surviving.
 [ K e3 ]  [ R x h2 ] , [ R b6 ]  to stop the king's activities.
 [ N c3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ B d3 ] , [ B g7 ]  I was looking to get the Fianchetto bishop set. Control the center without owning it.
 [ N e5 c6 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ Q b3 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ Q b7 ] , [ Q d6 ]  The move 40...[ Q d7 ] looks tempting here to force off the Queens.But Black would be in for a big shock as he would lose his Queen to 41.[ N f6 + ] !
 [ N b d2 ] , [ B b7 ]  Dufresne gets the first opportunity in the game to castle which he ignores. This delay in castling lands him a lot of trouble in the rest of the game.
 [ Q x e6 ]  [ B x e6 + ]  [ K b8 ] , [ K e2 ]  Freeing the rook and abandoning any queenside attack plan.
 [ R c d1 ]  [ Q c3 ] , [ R x d8 + ]  Black is in serious difficulty here and down a lot of material.
 [ B x e6 + ]  [ K h8 ] , [ B x h6 ]  And now there are two very sharp beady-eyed bishops licking their chops at an almost helpless and paralyzed rook.
 [ O-O ] , [ B c4 ]  Need to do the castling asap I think. I was also planning on delaying it and doing it on the queen´s side but requires too many moves.
 [ K x f3 ]  [ K d6 ]  [ h5 ]  [ K x e6 ]  [ f4 ]  [ g x f4 ]  [ K x f4 ]  [ a4 ]  [ h4 ]  [ a5 ]  [ K g4 ] , [ a6 ]  
 [ N b3 ]  [ Q b6 ] , [ a4 ]  And with it Bob uses that time to stop black's open file. For if he didn't Victor might threatened to get a passed pawn even sooner.
 [ B e3 ] , [ K g8 ]  Unpinning the Knight and giving shelter to my King.
 [ Q d8 + ]  [ R e7 e8 ] , [ Q d6 ]  White's rooks are running out of defensive power. White can only move his [ e5 ] rook because if R8[ e7 ] then [ Q b8 ] [ R e8 ] [ Q b3 ] [ K h8 ] ([ K f8 ] Qf7#) [ Q h3 ] [ K g8 ] [ Q h7 ] [ K f8 ] [ Q f7 # ] White should defend the 7th rank with the e5-rook since other moves along the e-file allow [ Q d5 ] [ K h8 ] ([ K f8 ] Qf7#) [ Q h5 ] [ K g8 ] [ Q h7 ] [ K f8 ] [ Q f7 # ]  [ R e5 e7 ] , [ Q f6 ]  This is similar to the positions after move 41 where Black is trying to get in a bishop check except now White's rooks are forced to defend unlike after move 41 where White's rooks can be disruptive. White has nothing because the e8-rook must support the e7-rook and the e7-rook is defending [ Q g7 # ] White's e7-rook can only move along the 7th rank allowing [ B e6 ] so Black's win is clear now. The superior attacking pieces have forced zugswang so that the defenders are forced to disrupt the defense.
 [ N f6 ] , [ K e2 ]  Now once I activate my QB my King will be secure and I can focus on attacking and simplifying.
 [ K f6 ] , [ g3 ]  g3- W/ Blacks only bishop on light squares I needed to get the final 3 pawns onto dark ones.
 [ Q b3 + ]  [ K e2 ] , [ K a5 ]  understanding the pawn is a goner and avoiding 30.[ R x a7 + ] [ R x a7 ] 31.[ R x a7 # ]  [ R g5 ] , [ a6 ]  the pawn is now safe
 [ N x f6 ] , [ Q e2 ]  [ e4 ] needs protecting. other options were [ e5 ] and [ B d3 ] but I decide to move my Queen in preparation to castle Queen side. Was [ B d3 ] better. Should I have prepared to castle king side instead? comments please.
 [ B x f6 ]  [ Q x f6 ]  [ Q c2 ]  [ h4 ]  [ Q h7 ] , [ O-O-O ]  ? I do not know what to think of this move. King-[ e7 ] would also work
 [ B x d5 ]  [ B x f5 + ]  [ K x f5 ] , [ N h6 + ]  pushes the king back into his tomb
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ B b4 ]  Nothing unusual in this
 [ h x g4 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ Q h3 ]  aimed to [ h6 ]  [ Q x f4 ] , [ N f d5 ]  and black likes to pursuit my pieces all over the board without any concrete objective
 [ Q d4 ] , [ a5 ]  The move is so deep very hard to find the idea.
 [ N c4 ]  [ B x c4 ] , [ d x c4 ]  Here we have traded his knight for my bishop in a closed game as well as weakening his center and hanging a black pawn. The thing I really love about this though is that black has all but GIVEN ME THE [ N d6 + ] OUTPOST!!!
 [ N e7 + ]  [ K f7 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ R b5 ]  [ N c7 ] , [ R b7 ]  Just when I thought I'd forced the win of the pawn I realised that the pin of my N against my R could be fatal but eventually worked something out ...
 [ Q c7 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ O-O ] , [ N f1 ]  16. O-O is what he should have done 16 ... [ B h2 ] doesn't do anything because of 17. Nxh2.
 [ b x a4 ]  [ R x a4 ]  [ R d8 ]  [ N b7 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ K f2 ]  [ R e5 ]  [ N d6 ]  [ B x f5 ] , [ R a5 ]  Black is forced to exchange rooks or he loses the Bishop. Computer analysis prefers letting the b pawn advance protected 33. [ b5 ] [ R d5 ] 34. [ R a8 + ] [ K g7 ] 35. [ R d8 ] [ B e4 ] 36. [ b6 ] [ R d2 + ] 37. [ K g3 ] [ R b2 ] 38. [ N x e4 ] Rx[ b6 ] + (5.16--)
 [ B b4 ]  [ B d2 ]  [ B x c3 ]  [ B x c3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ e3 ] , [ O-O ]  As you will see later I quickly break into blacks king side only it cost me.
 [ O-O ]  [ B x c6 ]  [ b x c6 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ B x e5 ] , [ R x e5 ]  Ok so I lost a pawn but it may not matter too much given the disparity in development.
 [ g x f3 ] , [ Q x f3 ]  13. [ Q x f3 ] - one set of pawns and two sets of minor pieces have been exchanged but I still keep my kingside pawn majority.
 [ N g4 ] , [ R e e8 ]  It looks like black might want to move [ Q h4 ] though that would be easily countered by Rh1.
 [ N x c6 ]  [ R x c6 ] , [ Q f3 ]  This was less predictable though and caused me to invest about 15 minutes ...
 [ R a7 ] , [ N c5 ]  I move to defend the threatened a-pawn but this turns out to be another blunder...
 [ e5 ] , [ N e4 ]  A blunder because the knight will be trapped.
 [ R a2 ] , [ Q d6 ]  Protecting and getting ready for a deadly assault.
 [ a x b6 ] , [ R x c6 ]  Whoo-hoo I'm only down a pawn and have drawing chances.
 [ R a5 ]  [ B x d4 ]  [ R x d5 ] , [ B e3 ]  That line of pawns with the Bishop on the end has been there since early in the game the direct result of the accepted gambit.
 [ K h2 ] , [ R a e8 ]  thus controlling the e file
 [ B x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ R x d4 ] , [ Q x b7 + ]  21.Qxb7+!! This sac is wonderfully possible thanks to the strategic placement of Bg2.
 [ e x d5 ] , [ N x d5 ]  At the cost of a pawn.
 [ c x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ] , [ B d3 ]  With black's pawn on [ e6 ] missing a future P-[ f5 ] seems like the best and most obvious plan for white.
 [ K d5 ]  [ B h6 ]  [ K e6 ]  [ K e4 ]  [ K f6 ] , [ g5 + ]  ...to decoy the King.
 [ R b1 + ] , [ Q b3 ]  Making the game last longer. This is so typical of primitive computer chess such as this: they will do anything to prolong a lost game or hold off a loss on material even if it gives them no more counterplay.
 [ Q x e4 + ] , [ N c e7 ]  I moved this knight to provoke....
 [ R x f3 ]  [ K x f3 ] , [ R b8 ]  This is an interesting choice. Black cuts off the WK's access to the a-file and prepares to interpose his Rook if White plays [ R e3 ] or Re2.
 [ Q d3 ]  [ f5 ]  [ g4 ] , [ f4 ]  Mistake. The aftermath is actually very frightening for Black.
 [ B d7 ]  [ N e5 ] , [ N c6 ]  the big fight already. The kind of thing we average players play chess for... and usually don't find...
 [ b x c5 ]  [ b x c5 ]  [ d x c5 ]  [ R c8 ] , [ N f5 ]  The knight lands on fS with much greater effect than would have been the case earlier. The h6-pawn is already doomed but as it turns out White already has bigger fish to fry.
 [ d5 ] , [ N x f3 + ]  A desperate sacrifice but an excellent move by my opponent. The [ f3 ] pawn now becomes the target of the sacrifice and white's king-side becomes exposed. White is forced to take.
 [ f6 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ Q d6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ a6 ]  [ B a4 ]  [ b5 ] , [ B b3 ]  trying to force back my bishop
 [ K d8 ]  [ B x g5 + ] , [ N e7 ]  18... [ B e7 ] instead of ...[ N e7 ] would have prevented the following sacrifice.
 [ g6 ] , [ h4 ]  Bringing the pawns up in front ensure blacks doom
 [ Q c3 + ]  [ K b6 ] , [ g3 ]  to stop any back rank mate and get my king into play if necessary. [ Q x g7 ] probably was alright too.
 [ e x d5 ]  [ e4 ]  [ d x c6 ]  [ e x f3 ]  [ d4 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ h3 ]  [ B h5 ]  [ g4 ]  [ B g6 ]  [ N d2 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ N x f3 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ h6 ]  [ R x e8 + ]  [ Q x e8 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ g x f6 ]  [ B d5 ]  [ f5 ]  [ N h4 ]  [ Q e7 ] , [ N x f5 ]  Hmm? I remember I didn't take the bishop because I was afraid that [ Q g5 ] would just win it back with advantage but [ N e5 ] seems to be a sufficient rescue.
 [ R b3 + ] , [ K e2 ]  Being that Ted was forced onto the second rank with his K.
 [ N c3 ]  [ c6 ]  [ a4 ] , [ e5 ]  This is the first time I encountered this move. It seems harmless but it is full of poison.
 [ B f3 ]  [ R b8 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ N b3 ]  [ b6 ] , [ g4 ]  White has to risk some more if he wants an attack line.
 [ d4 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ B d2 ] , [ Q b6 ]  I think this is a ?! Black is behind on development and is going pawn grabbing. This is usually not a good idea in a game but sometimes in blitz aggressive moves pay off since there is not as much time to analyze. This move does win a pawn.
 [ Q c8 ]  [ d4 ]  [ e x d4 ] , [ B x d4 ]  ?! better is to take with the knight with the hope to exchange them.
 [ N x d5 ] , [ Q x d5 ]  An exposed queen but the only developed piece on the board is not so bad. I bet that I can handle this.
 [ O-O ]  [ N c6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B e6 ] , [ c5 ]  Somewhat unexpected. I expected 10. [ c x d5 ] which seems to be more commonly played.
 [ R x a7 ]  [ N b2 ]  [ R x e7 ]  [ B x a2 ]  [ R a7 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ R b1 ]  [ d1 = Q + ]  [ B x d1 ]  [ R x d1 + ]  [ R x d1 ]  [ N x d1 ]  [ R a1 ]  [ N b2 ]  [ g4 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ K h2 ]  [ N d3 ]  [ K g3 ]  [ g5 ]  [ R a6 ]  [ h5 ]  [ f3 ]  [ h4 + ]  [ K g2 ]  [ B d5 ]  [ R a3 ]  [ N e1 + ]  [ K f2 ]  [ N x f3 ]  [ R d3 ]  [ B c6 ]  [ R x f3 ]  [ B x f3 ]  [ K x f3 ]  [ K g7 ]  [ K e4 ]  [ K f6 ]  [ K d4 ]  [ K e6 ]  [ K e4 ] , [ f5 + ]  !? The only way for black to win is to confuse white into making a mistake which I hoped to surprise him into doing with this move.
 [ Q x c2 ]  [ Q x c2 ]  [ N x c2 ]  [ R c1 ]  [ N e3 ]  [ R c7 ]  [ N c4 ]  [ R x g7 + ]  [ K f8 ]  [ R g5 ]  [ N x b2 ]  [ R f5 + ]  [ K e7 ]  [ R h5 ] , [ N c4 ]  I cannot win this pawn-grabbing contest.
 [ h5 ]  [ b x c4 ]  [ K g7 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ b6 ]  [ N g5 ]  [ R e e8 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ N x c4 ] , [ N x c5 ]  Trading off material
 [ B f6 ]  [ K f1 ]  [ e6 ]  [ K e1 ]  [ R a2 ]  [ R d1 ]  [ B d8 ]  [ h4 ]  [ B a5 + ]  [ K f1 ]  [ K g7 ]  [ R c1 ]  [ K f6 ]  [ R c2 ]  [ R a1 + ]  [ K g2 ]  [ R a3 ]  [ B f3 ]  [ h6 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ K f5 ]  [ K f3 ]  [ B c3 ]  [ g4 + ]  [ K f6 ]  [ K g2 ]  [ R b3 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ R a3 ]  [ R a2 ]  [ R x a2 ] , [ B x a2 ]  Bishops of opposite colors equal pawns both Kings on the side where the pawns are: this game is a book draw: hence my third draw offer again refused.
 [ K f2 ]  [ B x a3 ] , [ R e1 ]  And game is over.
 [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ a6 ]  Typical of the Najdorf or the Dragon variations.
 [ f4 ] , [ N c6 ]  Looking to exchange the Knights.
 [ c6 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ e6 ]  This gets into a Semi-Slav which is a very common defense to the Queen's Gambit
 [ Q x c5 ]  [ Q x c5 ]  [ B x c5 ] , [ B x c5 ]  Rook for Bishop and Pawn :P
 [ R a c1 ] , [ R c6 ]  I thought this move looked dangerous. Black avoids surrendering the c-file via and exchange of rooks and gives himself the option to play [ Q c7 ] doubling the heavy pieces. Now if white plays 22.[ R x c6 ] [ b x c6 ] 23.[ R c1 ] then simply 23....[ c5 ] closes the file permanently and leaves white struggling. On this basis I decided that the best course would be to maintain the tension and try and get my queen back into the picture.
 [ Q f7 ] , [ B c4 ]  White must have wanted to improve his position by protecting the bishop. Black can ease up on the pressure by moving the king off the white square.
 [ f5 ] , [ O-O ]  8. 0-0 allows [ f4 ] advancement challenging [ g3 ] allows [ B g4 ] to retreat [move 9]. if g3x[ f4 ] "g" file opens for direct attack on [ K g1 ] [see move 16. Rhg8] and pins Bg2.
 [ g4 ]  [ N f4 ]  [ B x f4 ]  [ e x f4 ] , [ N e2 ]  exchanging his Bishop against my seemingly useless Rook is needed here. So one important helper for his King will be out of the game.
 [ h x g6 ]  [ B e2 ] , [ Q e5 ]  and this means the pawns are now pushing back the rooks or the queen has to stay on protection too.
 [ d4 ] , [ N f6 ]  It's been a while since I've annotated a game; this is the first game I have finished in nearly two weeks. Tired of the old [ d5 ] I play something a little different. The Indian Defense.
 [ Q d4 + ] , [ K h1 ]  It is clear that 17.[ K h1 ] was better than 17.[ R f2 ] as [ R f2 ] pins the rook to the king.
 [ B x f8 ]  [ R d8 ] , [ Q b2 ]  A highly original position possibly unique in the annals of chess in which both players simultaneously have a Queen's bishop on the starting square of their opponent's king bishop.
 [ g x f5 ] , [ e x f5 ]  With the exposed K-side Pillsbury's King may be best off in the center or even if he can clear his Q on the Q-side with an eventual ...O-O-O.
 [ d3 ]  [ c6 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ b5 ]  [ B b3 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ c3 ] , [ B e6 ]  gameknot: Inaccuracy: +0.13 » … [ B e6 ] 9. [ B x e6 ] [ f x e6 ] 10. [ [ a4 ] ] [ a6 ] 11.

My reply would have been 9.O-O aiming for the [ [ [ [ d4 ] ] ] ] push maybe even the immediate [ [ [ [ d4 ] ] ] ] with no pressure on my e-pawn.
 [ e3 ] , [ B g4 ]  with this move hi knight is lost
 [ B x f3 ] , [ R e3 ]  Re3! Good move by white.
 [ N d7 ]  [ N d6 + ]  [ B x d6 ] , [ B x d6 ]  Exchange of pieces complete.
 [ f x g6 ]  [ B x g6 + ]  [ h x g6 ]  [ R x h8 + ]  [ K e7 ] , [ B g5 # ]  another world-class move which happens to be mate
 [ e4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ Q x d5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ Q a5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ h3 ]  [ Q h5 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ d3 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N h2 ]  [ B x e2 ]  [ Q x e2 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ Q x h5 ]  [ N x h5 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B d6 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ O-O-O ]  [ a3 ]  [ e4 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ B x h2 + ]  [ K x h2 ]  [ f5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ f x e4 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ h6 ] , [ N c5 ]  You will see how much this move worth !!!
 [ N d5 ]  [ Q x c2 ]  [ R a c1 ]  [ Q x e4 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ Q g6 ]  Having won two loose Pawns I naturally offer to exchange Queens and White of course refuses.
 [ N f3 ] , [ Q d8 ]  If the queens don't get exchanged then at least the black knight move to [ g5 ] will be allowed.
 [ N x d3 ]  [ Q x d3 ]  [ N b3 ]  [ Q x d1 ]  [ R a x d1 ] , [ R c2 ]  computer calls this position even.
 [ N h4 ] , [ B e4 ]  My other choice is Bg6. I expect him to play [ [ f3 ] ] and then I'll play Bg6. The advantage of playing [ B e4 ] first is that after he plays [ [ f3 ] ] he won't be able to put his bishop there. If I play [ B g3 ] immediately I think his best move is B[ [ f3 ] ] to try and get rid of my knight. And I need it there at least one more move.
 [ N g7 ] , [ Q x g7 # ]  i really enjoyed how my last dicth attempt became the winning move.
 [ B x d6 ] , [ Q x d6 ]  The bad side of this exchange is that now I don't have anymore the [ N c5 ] thrust taking advantage of the pinned d pawn. Too bad.
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ g6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ e4 ]  [ N x c3 ]  [ b x c3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B c4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N e2 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B g4 ]  [ f3 ]  [ N a5 ]  [ B x f7 + ]  [ R x f7 ]  [ f x g4 ] , [ R x f1 + ]  This has all been seen many times before. It was the old "main line" of the Grünfeld Defence Exchange Variation. Please see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gr%C3%BCnfeld_Defence#Exchange_Variation:_4.cxd5_Nxd5_5.[ e4 ] From about 1960 to about 1980 it wasn't played much it being replaced by Smyslov's idea of 10....[ Q c7 ] followed by 11. [ R c1 ] [ R d8 ] but this was rather put out of business by 12. Bf4! so players went back to this older system. To quote from Wiki "this was frequently played by Karpov including four games of his 1987 world championship match against Kasparov in Seville Spain is the Seville Variation after 6...[ B g7 ] 7.[ B c4 ] [ c5 ] 8.[ N e2 ] [ N c6 ] 9.[ B e3 ] 0-0 10.0-0 [ B g4 ] 11.[ f3 ] [ N a5 ] 12.[ B x f7 + ] long thought a poor move by theory as the resultant light-square weakness had been believed to give Black more than enough compensation for the pawn.
 [ B b2 ] , [ B g4 ]  Well I got my wish. C3 as per my thoughts..
 [ h5 ] , [ N e3 ]  Hoping to play [ h3 ] with the risk of getting a passed pawn on the g file.
 [ c x b5 ] , [ a x b5 ]  now it seems the be all over for the white do they know it ?
 [ d x c4 ] , [ e3 ]  Going to avenge the fallen soldier on c4!
 [ O-O ]  [ N f6 ] , [ R e1 ]  I don't want to defend with [ [ d3 ] ] or [ N [ c3 ] ] because I am planning to take over the centre with [ c3 ] and [ d4 ] and moves like [ [ d3 ] ] or [ N [ c3 ] ] interfere with those plans.
 [ K d3 ]  [ f5 ]  [ b4 ]  [ c x b4 ] , [ K x d4 ]  I sac'd my bishop for his last pawn... not a bad trade all things considered.
 [ d4 ]  [ e x d4 ] , [ Q x d4 ]  The most aggressive recapture although not necessarily better than Nxd4. This entices black to play Nc6.
 [ B c4 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ O-O ] , [ Q f3 ]  Pressuring the knight but in hindsight this is really too optimistic or at least too early: as we will see in a moment the queen will be hurled around a bit while black positions his pieces nicely. simply developing the knight seems better.
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ c6 ] , [ c3 ]  Don't forget this move (or c4) or [ b2 ] and the black squares will suffer.
 [ R d3 ] , [ R x d3 ]  I don't really want to exchange but my opponent from this point on seems determined to take us into an endgame. Maybe he's read that I am no good at endgames?!
 [ B d3 ]  [ Q e7 + ] , [ K d2 ]  Very interesting and unusual. White opts to move his king and lose castling rights instead of more naturally blocking with [ Q e2 ] or [ B e3 ] both of which the DB suggests. I suppose that after 7.[ Q d2 ] [ Q x d2 ] 8.[ B x d2 ] White's light-squared bishop is not on such a good square while White's dark-squared bishop is probably not very well placed on e3. At any rate White's king is now blocking any development of White's dark-squared bishop and preventing White's knight from developing onto any square other than [ a3 ] so I would definitely go for blocking the check in White's position.
 [ K h5 ]  [ Q e5 + ]  [ K x h4 ]  [ R h2 + ]  [ K g4 ]  [ R g2 + ]  [ K h3 ]  [ Q e3 + ]  [ K h4 ] , [ B g5 + ]  The next move is [ Q f3 ] mate.
 [ B x f6 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ Q h5 + ] , [ K d7 ]  only move... 11... [ K e7 ] 12. [ Q f7 # ]  [ Q x f5 + ] , [ K c7 ]  the black king is going for a walk...
 [ B x h7 + ]  [ K h8 ]  [ N x f4 ]  [ N e3 ] , [ N x e6 ]  This *has* to be correct. White gets a dictatorship on the king-side light squares and black's king isn't looking too happy. This must be more than enough compensation for the exchange.
 [ g3 ] , [ B g4 ]  Oh that knight looks AWFUL now!
 [ Q x d3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ a6 ] , [ b6 ]  Now black is panicking. [ b x a6 ] would have opposed more resistance by eliminating white's advanced pawn.
 [ N e2 ]  [ R e3 ] , [ N g1 + ]  My little guy made the best move here!
 [ e x d4 ] , [ a3 + ]  Luring the white king to the a-file where he can't stop the e-pawn from promotion.
 [ R h8 ] , [ h5 ]  I went on to win from here and stopped annotating but I got my King to the QS and forced black to sack the knight for the e pawn and then sacked the rook for the h pawn so that I had passed a and c pawns with black's king on the KS corner. My opponent resigned with 30 seconds left with his bishop on [ c8 ] (my pawns on [ d6 ] and [ h5 ] after I played [ a6 + ] because one of the pawns will queen and black is lost.
 [ K f2 ]  [ N e7 ] , [ B x h5 ]  Maybe the breakthrough at last? I wins a pawn thanks to this tactics!
 [ B x d5 ] , [ Q e5 ]  SUddenly White threatened mate! The whole point seemed close to me.
 [ B d6 ] , [ c3 ]  This move protects my [ d5 ] pawn while allowing me to coordinate my queen and my bishop by moving to c2. With my black squared bishop developed I don't need the [ c3 ] square open for it.
 [ N a2 ] , [ N c5 ]  the knight is getting into the party too.
 [ Q c7 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ O-O ] , [ h3 ]  I know that out team captain does not like this kind of move but I wanted to play [ B e3 ] and did not want to see Ng4.
 [ Q g1 + ]  [ K h3 ] , [ B e5 ]  Somehow black's important pawns are still defended and the WQ is no closer to her Black-crowned target across the board. White's two Bishops each wish they could be nearly as useful as Black's single one.
 [ d4 ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ] , [ N c5 ]  I simply didn't see the white's move here...
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ d5 ]  Queen's pawn. Most of the responses to this move look pretty good for black.
 [ R x f4 ]  [ Q x f4 ]  [ N x c8 ]  [ Q d2 ] , [ N e7 + ]  After this error White should only have a draw. 29.[ B f1 ] [ Q x b2 ] 30.[ Q e3 ] was indicated where White can keep his advantage.
 [ B x f3 ] , [ g x f3 ]  This is one of the dumber moves Black has made. Black should when already down so much conserve whatever pieces he can. Entirely unnecessary trade.
 [ c4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ B b4 ]  Black opts for the Nimzo-Indian.
 [ R d x c7 + ]  [ K b8 ]  [ R c b7 + ]  [ K c8 ]  [ R x b6 ]  [ R g2 + ]  [ K x f3 ]  [ R a2 ] , [ a4 ]  It was more a delaying tactic and a lure.
 [ B c4 ]  [ B c6 ]  [ Q f7 + ]  [ K d6 ]  [ Q e6 + ]  [ K c5 ]  [ B e3 + ]  [ Q d4 ]  [ c x d4 + ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ B f2 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ Q d5 + ]  [ K b4 ]  [ a3 + ]  [ K a4 ] , [ Q x b5 # ]  
 [ K e1 ] , [ B x d2 + ]  Instead white allows both exchanges.
 [ a6 ] , [ N f5 + ]  Safe and simpler than 23. [ B c4 ] as black's replies are extremely limited.
 [ N e5 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ f3 ]  [ e x f3 ]  [ Q x f3 ] , [ B e6 ]  A painful retreat. Maybe [ g6 ] would have been better?
 [ R x f2 ]  [ R x b7 ]  [ R x h2 ] , [ R a3 ]  The reason why white is willing to give up two pawns including an outside passer for two doubled pawns. Rook behind the pawn is a winning idea and here the rook in the dark square can never be attacked. The rest is a matter of technique.
 [ Q c2 ]  [ g6 ] , [ N g5 ]  ...aiming to the weak [ e6 ] but also eyeing a sac in [ h7 ] in the future.
 [ B h3 + ]  [ K g1 ]  [ N x f1 ]  [ N x f1 ] , [ R x f1 # ]  I guess ataka wanted to give me the credit of the mate. thanks for this. All of this is of course full of mistakes by white but shows one of the main idea of this opening: black counter-attack on the king-side has many chances and has to be fast.
 [ N e3 ] , [ d5 ]  This move loses a pawn but left me an isolated d-pawn and got black's pieces active.
 [ e4 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ N f3 ]  Black chose the Nimzovich Defense. I don't know this one very well so I'm winging it from my second move. I guess I'll learn it as I go...
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ] , [ e5 ]  the advance variation
 [ R c3 + ]  [ K b1 ] , [ R x c4 ]  +3 and a good King side pawn structure makes me feel good about this game.
 [ Q a4 ] , [ B c5 ]  [ B c5 ] prevents [ B e3 ] and [ R e1 ]  [ B d2 ] , [ Q a7 ]  White gets further ahead with development
 [ Q c7 ]  [ N g4 ]  [ N x g4 ]  [ B x g4 ] , [ B d7 ]  9. ...... [ B d7 ] - I did not want the Wicked Witch of the West to bear down on Henry on [ g4 ] so I decided to let Dan initiate the next set of trades.
 [ c x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ] , [ e4 ]  This is why. And I'm not surprised to see Maxime exchange N's. Personally I would not here but instead would answer with 5...[ N b6 ] as I don't see a reason to do it. But I know that there's got to be one. I'm not sure what level they are but even if it's not GM level they're both at least experts.
 [ K d3 ]  [ R d8 + ]  [ K e2 ] , [ Q x f2 # ]  Inredible. I sac a rook and a knight and didn't recover them when I had the chance and I won. My apologize to white he deserved to win.
 [ R b d8 ] , [ B e5 ]  Another tempo and another pin.
 [ f4 ]  [ N b c6 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ a6 ]  josetborda: now I start preparing to do O-O on the a wing.
 [ B b7 ] , [ B b5 ]  White attackes d7. If the [ d7 ] pawn goes Paula on [ c5 ] really will have a clear path to promotion.
 [ Q x e4 + ]  [ Q e2 ]  [ Q x h1 ] , [ Q f1 ]  Protecting the queen knoght
 [ f6 ]  [ g3 ]  [ K f7 ]  [ K g2 ] , [ R e h8 ]  27. [ R h8 ] - I think I will have one rook plus either Fou Lenoir or Henry guarding my [ h6 ] pawn. This will free my other rook to move wherever he likes on the first rank. My knight will hold firm on d6. I have confidence that I can prevent an ingress and a zugzwang. This can only mean one thing for me and Dave. My mouse is already beginning to hover over that Offer Draw button!
 [ Q h4 ] , [ e2 ]  Black decides to threaten to promote - if white's queen strays to far then it could become a very sad end to the game.
 [ Q x e2 ]  [ R d7 ]  [ Q g4 ]  [ R a d1 ] , [ N f4 ]  This attack is smoke and mirrors.
 [ Q x d5 ] , [ c4 ]  Trying to attack my queen I did not know this opening so i chose to play what looked logical.
 [ N h6 + ] , [ K h8 ]  I could play a straight [ R x f8 # ] but I finish in grand style.
 [ B c4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ O-O ] , [ d5 ]  Gaining space for development with tempo.
 [ R d1 ]  [ e4 ]  [ f x e4 ] , [ f x e4 ]  White could reasonably resign here.
 [ c3 ] , [ b6 ]  Your queenside pieces are still hemmed in. What is your plan to develop them and gain greater activity?
 [ R b x e3 ] , [ Q c1 + ]  No it wasnt. If white goes [ K g2 ] I just lost a tempo and I will lose (or near to) after g6. But it white's turn to blunder.
 [ g x f3 ] , [ R c8 ]  The best placement for my rook is behind the pawn and it will stay there while the other rook will force it's advance to promotion
 [ K d3 ]  [ N b6 ]  [ K c3 ]  [ N c8 ]  [ N f5 ]  [ N x f5 ] , [ g x f5 ]  Now black's task is even easier!
 [ N f6 ] , [ B x f6 ]  pity Knight
 [ B x d5 ] , [ Q e8 + ]  ?? This is just wrong.
 [ c6 ] , [ B c7 ]  ? It's better to go through with my original plan 25. [ N c7 ] just losing a pawn. Computer:25. [ N c7 ] [ R f8 ] 26. [ R a d1 ] -/+
 [ b4 ]  [ N e2 ]  [ R c2 ]  [ N g1 ]  [ R x b2 ]  [ g3 ]  [ R a2 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ b3 ]  [ N x e5 ] , [ b2 ]  This game shows how in time trouble all it takes is one mistake the slightest inaccuracy may determine whether you have a won or lost endgame!
 [ R e1 ]  [ b5 ]  [ B b3 ] , [ O-O ]  Black indicates he wants to play the Marshall attack with 8...d5. I have no theoretical knowledge of that opening but I keep hearing it's drawish in the highest level. That has nothing to do with my games though. Why should I play like my opponent wants me to and defend for a long time? Then he would be in his element and I would be struggling. So from a psychological point of view I deceided to sacrifice a pawn of my own for an attack or force a closed type of system both of which seemed to take the attacking Marshall Attack player out of his comfort zone.
 [ N x c6 ]  [ B x c6 ]  [ B c1 ] , [ Q a7 ]  new targets...
 [ e4 ]  [ c6 ]  [ f4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ N g5 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ Q x g4 ]  [ N x g4 ] , [ B x f7 + ]  The thematic position.
 [ e x d4 ]  [ B x g4 ] , [ h5 ]  After I capture on [ g4 ] my bishop is immediately chased away...
 [ f5 ]  [ g5 ]  [ K x e3 ]  [ b6 ]  [ c x b6 ]  [ a x b6 ] , [ K f2 ]  I believe he did that so he could move his Bishop.
 [ B b7 ]  [ N b3 ]  [ a5 ]  [ N c1 ] , [ c4 ]  he stopped me!
 [ N c4 ]  [ Q d8 ] , [ N b6 ]  I really wanted a piece on b6. Computer gives +1.51. He is following the analysis somehow??
 [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B e2 ]  [ d6 ]  [ O-O ] , [ B d7 ]  Intending to trade knights followed by Bc6. An interesting idea for white might be [ N c2 ] here I assume its still book but I opt to stick with the most common mainline for now.
 [ R g8 ] , [ Q h4 + ]  ...and mate the next one. So once again: NEVER GIVE UP! Things like this won't happen often but it is fun to try! :-)
 [ R f g8 ] , [ g5 ]  I'd been hoping for this since it seems to reduce White's attacking options but it pushes Black further back into his shell. I was now 100% preoccupied with defence abandoning any ideas of counter-attacking on the queenside with for example ...[ a4 ] followed by ...[ N b3 + ] (a possibility I've only just seen) ...[ a x b3 ] and ...Ra1+. Whether Black could achieve such a sequence and whether it would have been worth trying I leave to the reader to consider ...
 [ e5 ] , [ d5 ]  let's break up the center...
 [ h3 ]  [ B h5 ]  [ B b2 ] , [ N d4 ]  The only thing that caught me off guard for one second was this move. It took me between 2-5 minutes to figure out what to do. I looked at something like 11.Nxd4?? but almost forgetting that I'm indirectly pinned it didn't take much to figure that this wouldn't work out. I also looked at 10...[ N e2 ] but with 2 attackers against only 1 defender my [ N f3 ] would be lost for only a pawn. And of course I was reluctant to play 11.[ g4 ] because I thought that it would weaken. But after thinking more about it I realized that this was my only way out and afterwards even with a weakened K things hold out quite well.
 [ N x f6 + ] , [ g x f6 ]  Now his Pawn advantage is virtually neutralized because of his horrible K-side Pawn structure if it comes to an endgame.
 [ B x c3 ]  [ b x c3 ] , [ Q f6 ]  He saw through my tactics and I return my focus to the four pawns that is just laying crunched up.
 [ B x f7 ] , [ e6 ]  Blocks the B in on the kingside cutting it off from the defence of White queenside castled King.
 [ R x e6 ] , [ f x e6 ]  ! leaving a dangerously weak pawn on [ e6 ] but an f column ready for my R to grab.
 [ N h4 ]  [ N b8 ]  [ g3 ]  [ N e8 ]  [ N g2 ]  [ f5 ] , [ h4 ]  Now that ...P-[ B5 ] has been stopped forever White will be able to devote his whole attention to the Queen-side.
 [ R f6 ] , [ c3 ]  Got to quit fearing so much
 [ B d6 ] , [ e4 ]  the fight for the middle
 [ Q e2 ] , [ N a6 ]  I cannot have my pieces coordinated.
 [ d6 ]  [ a4 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ B b5 + ]  [ B d7 ] , [ b4 ]  Blundering a pawn. After 6.... [ c x b4 ] 7. [ c x b4 ] [ Q x b4 ] white has nothing and still has to defend the pawn on [ e4 ]  [ B x b5 ]  [ a x b5 ]  [ c x b4 ]  [ Q b3 ]  [ a6 ]  [ Q x b4 ]  [ a5 ]  [ Q d4 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ b6 ]  Look how fast it gets crazy. Should have castled!!
 [ R g7 ]  [ R d1 ]  [ B d5 ]  [ R c1 ] , [ K d6 ]  Black's king is becoming very restricted but he only needs to make it through move 96 for the draw...
 [ B g5 ] , [ N a6 ]  I did not expect 8.[ B g5 ] and it confused me. It seems white only has a slight space advantage but I could not decide on a good plan. I did not know what to do here. I was tempted by 8...[ N e4 ] but after 9.[ N x e4 ] [ f x e4 ] 10.[ N d2 ] [ [ [ [ d5 ] ] ] ] (10...[ B x d4 ] 11.[ N x e4 ] loses because white's pieces are more active) 11.cx[ [ [ [ d5 ] ] ] ] cx[ [ [ [ d5 ] ] ] ] 12.[ N b3 ] I cannot prevent [ f3 ] which will destroy my center and white is better developed. I thought about 8...[ Q e8 ] but then 9.[ [ [ [ d5 ] ] ] ] and I cannot play 9...[ [ e5 ] ] because after 10.[ d x e6 ] [ B x e6 ] I am no longer defending the [ d6 ] pawn. So I decided I will continue developing pieces (planning Nc7). I also thought about 8...[ N b d7 ] because if 9.[ [ [ [ d5 ] ] ] ] [ [ e5 ] ] 10.[ d x e6 ] [ N c5 ] regaining the pawn with a nice game. But if not 9.[ [ [ [ d5 ] ] ] ] the knight only blocks the bishop c8. So 8...[ N a6 ] planning ...[ N c7 ] even though this does not help me achieve ...e5.
 [ Q d8 ]  [ R d1 ] , [ b1 = Q ]  4 queens but mine are alot better placed also aiming to remove my rook from the d file but thats easy to rectify
 [ N c6 ] , [ c4 ]  Planning ultimately to scythe through black's pawn centre with e6.
 [ O-O ]  [ B e7 ]  [ R e1 ] , [ b5 ]  6. ........ [ b5 ] - driving back the white bishop to b3.
 [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ B e3 ] , [ a6 ]  Introducing the "Dragadorf" (or Naja-Dragon) which for a time seemed as silly as its namesake. Black's early ...[ a6 ] suggests that he will continue ...[ b5 ] and attack along the b-file a powerful plan both as a minority attack or simple mating attack. For a long time however top players considered this setup simply too slow to meet White's most aggressive option the Yugoslav. In a sense it still is but as we'll see Black has some concrete ideas that justify his play - at least for now!
 [ N d4 ] , [ R c6 ]  I now move my knight to [ d4 ] and attack the rook at [ e6 ] which moves to c6. The rook is now in my grasp but my opponent was probably thinking he could gain access down this file to my king and forgot he was still at risk on that square.
 [ N c6 ]  [ N b c3 ] , [ g6 ]  3.....[ g6 ] is meant to develop the DSB (dark-squared bishop) to [ g7 ] (called fianchetto) a rather typical procedure in this opening
 [ N x b5 ]  [ N x b5 ]  [ a x b5 ] , [ B x b5 + ]  Open the position and even out the score again. Lots of action and exciting turns in the game.
 [ B x e5 ]  [ Q x c8 + ]  [ K e7 ] , [ Q x g8 ]  resigned..he could have played..
 [ b4 ]  [ b6 ]  [ B b2 ]  [ B a6 ]  [ N b d2 ] , [ N e4 ]  Bit offensive !
 [ K g3 ]  [ R x a4 ]  [ e4 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ K f4 ]  [ R x e4 + ]  [ K g3 ] , [ Q g1 + ]  Only a matter of time
 [ Q g5 ]  [ h4 ]  [ Q e5 ] , [ f3 ]  This is the most useful move. All squares on my kingside are now secure. The vulnerable e4-pawn is now protected and the h6-knight cannot infiltrate onto g4.
 [ K g7 ]  [ N e2 ]  [ Q d5 + ] , [ K g1 ]  Black resigns as he has run out of checks.
 [ B x c7 ]  [ N x c6 ]  [ N e3 ] , [ B b5 ]  15. Nd4? Bf4! 16. [ B b5 ] Nf1!! goes terribly wrong for white... Now 15. ... Bf4? is met with 16. Ne7+! [ K f8 ] 17. Ng6+! [ h x g6 ] 18. [ Q b4 + ] [ R e7 ] 19. Qxf4...
 [ b4 ]  [ R a b1 ]  [ a5 ]  [ R f d1 ]  [ N g8 ]  [ N x e7 ] , [ N g x e7 ]  18. ..... N[ g x e7 ] - I know this means that my knight's outpost on [ d5 ] is forfeited but it gives me the bishop pair and now the backward pawn on [ d6 ] comes under the hammer. I overlooked this fact though. Luckily my opponent gives me a second chance on the next turn.
 [ R c8 ]  [ R d d6 ]  [ R c7 ] , [ R e x g6 + ]  it's all over but the shouting.
 [ B x f6 ]  [ R x f6 ] , [ g3 ]  It's hard to see any purpose behind this move. Black is threatening 25 ... [ B b4 ] with a double pin on the White knight. The logical response would be to move either the queen or the [ e1 ] rook. E.g. White might try 25 [ Q d3 ] q[ x b2 ] 26 [ N e4 ] [ R a6 ] 27 [ N x c5 ] [ R x c5 ] or 25 [ R f1 ] [ R b6 ] 26 [ N a4 ] [ R [ b5 ] ] 27 [ b3 ] [ Q g4 ] or 25 [ Q a4 ] [ b5 ] 26 Q[ b3 ] Rf2.
 [ R b1 ] , [ B b2 ]  (?!) This seemed such a good idea at the time! The enemy rook cut off from the rest of the b-file is in effect immobilised. I didn't quite appreciate the effect on Black's own pieces. Two alternatives suggest themselves: [A] the sac on [ a7 ] though I didn't really fancy Black's chances with bishop against 4 pawns; or [B] simply 53...[ R a c2 ] inviting White to declare himself or repeat moves.
 [ R f2 ]  [ O-O-O ] , [ g4 ]  a critical mistake by white. Black can win with the immediately with h5!
 [ N x f4 ]  [ N x f4 ] , [ e5 ]  This is very nice. Because now my [ a7 ] rook is coming into the game!
 [ B x d1 ]  [ R a x d1 ]  [ Q h3 ] , [ N g2 ]  Not good as it allows this combo.
 [ Q g7 ] , [ g3 ]  I foresee Black doing [ R x g2 + ] and move to prevent that.
 [ Q g1 ]  [ R h5 ]  [ Q f2 ]  [ B x g2 + ]  [ K g1 ] , [ Q h2 # ]  I hope you liked it. Thanks for reading and I hope you will leave your thoughts. Appreciate it.
 [ Q a7 + ] , [ K b5 ]  And now close the other one.
 [ B f7 ]  [ Q b8 ] , [ B x g8 ]  Safeway was acting impulsively now
 [ R c4 ]  [ N f4 ] , [ g6 ]  25. .......... [ g6 ] - decides to back up his h pawn but I find another way to win material - the d pawn must now fall after I move my rook to d1.
 [ R e4 ]  [ N x e7 ]  [ R f e1 ]  [ N g6 ]  [ Q g5 ]  [ R a e8 ]  [ d5 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ c x d5 ] , [ N e7 ]  White wait for some blacks mistake but he play all the best moves
 [ R f b1 ]  [ Q x f4 ] , [ g x f4 ]  Notice again how the 'double' pawns turn out to be useful this now gives me an additional break to consider and it also protects [ e5 ] for when I do eventually get in [ d5 ]  [ R c6 ] , [ K f2 ]  Of course immediatly playing 28.[ d5 ] suggests itself however there is no way for black to hold onto [ b6 ] so I take a moment to improve the position of my king. It also puts black in something of a mini zuzwang
 [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ] , [ Q x d4 ]  A relatively unusual continuation. White's early Q move causes Black to reconsider his planned Najdorf variation. Should I chase the Q straightaway with ..[ N c6 ] or leave it there a while? I decided that the immediate N move would invite White's LSB to pin on [ b5 ] and would thus achieve little. Therefore I continued with a normal Najdorf move ...
 [ d4 ]  [ B b4 + ]  [ c3 ]  [ B a5 ]  [ B x f4 ]  [ Q c6 ] , [ B g5 ]  Already considering mating possibilities here I thought about exchanging my [ d5 ] knight with opponent's [ g8 ] knight and then stick my bishop and queen into [ d8 ] and e7. It didn't work exactly as planned and here I was looking at an unpleasant move from my opponent
 [ e6 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ B d6 ]  This is an early choice for black. Normally players go [ B e7 ] etc. This challenges me at once: either I let him exchange the bishops (and I reckon it is played and not regarded as "bad" for white but it is not my choice) or I go for e5.
 [ B h6 ] , [ R g8 ]  I now attack the rook at [ g7 ] with my DB and black moves his rook up to g8.
 [ B c3 ]  [ Q d6 ]  [ B x f6 ] , [ Q x g3 ]  Not capturing leads to mate. Alternative variation: 22. ... [ e5 ] [The longest try but still...] 23. [ B x h7 + ] [ K h8 ] (23. ... [ K x h7 ] 24. [ Q c2 + ] [ Q d3 ] 25. [ Q x d3 + ] [ [ e4 ] ] 26. [ Q x [ e4 ] + ] [ B f5 ] 27. [ Q x f5 + ] [ K h8 ] 28. [ B x g7 + ] [ K g8 ] 29. [ B f6 + ] [ N g5 ] 30. [ Q g6 # ] ) 24. [ B x g7 + ] [ K x h7 ] 25. [ Q c2 + ] [ [ e4 ] ] 26. [ Q x [ e4 ] + ] [ K g8 ] 27. [ B e5 + ] [ B g4 ] 28. [ R x g4 + ] [ N g5 ] 29. [ R x g5 + ] [ K f7 ] 30. [ B x d6 ] [ R f e8 ] 31. [ Q g6 # ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ R x f6 ]  [ K g7 ]  [ R f2 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ c5 ]  [ R a d8 ]  [ B c2 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ h6 ]  [ h3 ]  [ R d4 ]  [ N d6 ] , [ R d8 ]  Time for the finishing touch
 [ N e7 g6 ]  [ N x g6 ]  [ Q x f2 + ]  [ K x f2 ]  [ B x c1 ]  [ R x c1 ] , [ h x g6 ]  18. ....... [ h x g6 ] - after a plethora of exchanges the position has changed a lot in the space of a few moves. Now comes an exchange of bishop for knight.
 [ R x c8 ] , [ N d7 # ]  thank you very much hope you enjoyed my annotation i would like to read your comments Daniel (Matsany) .
 [ B x f6 ]  [ Q x f6 ] , [ Q c6 + ]  a 3-way fork this time!
 [ R x f4 ]  [ B x d4 ]  [ R x d4 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ R d d1 ]  [ R a a8 ] , [ N e5 + ]  A clever swap off using a pin.
 [ Q x d2 + ]  [ K f3 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ g6 ] , [ Q x f2 + ]  I control my kingside of the board but he's got two pawns coming up
 [ O-O ]  [ B d3 ]  [ b5 ] , [ Q c2 ]  H7 always better queen first and bishop below for mate but thats how it goes
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ a6 ] , [ B g5 ]  the same Najdorf 6. [ B g5 ] tournament...
 [ R a3 ] , [ B d4 ]  A quiet but very powerful move. The bishop is pinned now as if it moves it will be mate. The king can't move because of the bishop.
 [ N d f4 ]  [ N g e7 ] , [ c3 ]  I predict an attack in the centre from the queen pawn.
 [ b4 ]  [ a x b4 ]  [ a x b4 ] , [ Q f6 ]  [ Q f6 ] threatening [ Q e6 + ]  [ Q e6 + ]  [ K h8 ]  [ R x d6 ] , [ R x f3 ]  After [ R x f3 ] I had to be very careful here I thought about [ Q x e5 + ] but I came up with a shocking move.
 [ B d6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ f5 ]  [ B x e5 ]  [ B x e5 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ B x b2 ]  [ R d b1 ]  [ B c3 ] , [ N g5 ]  !?
 [ g4 ] , [ Q f6 ]  Focusing on *White's* KB2.
 [ K c2 ] , [ R x b3 ]  Sacrificing more material to open up the king is okay when your opponent's pieces are out of play. I learned that from (bakerbaker) who has many attacking games annotated on gameknot. It was actually him who taught me his Sicilian repertoire and his theories behind it. I agreed with all his theories and he has taught me a lot of attacking strategies in the lines of our Sicilian repertoire
 [ c x b5 ]  [ a6 ] , [ e3 ]  not so usual line but playable...
 [ B f6 ]  [ b3 ]  [ R f d8 ]  [ R d1 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ B e2 ] , [ B x d4 ]  strong knight out
 [ N x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ Q x d4 ]  [ Q x c2 ]  [ B c4 ] , [ Q g6 ]  After two time-wasting Queen moves he needs an additional move to get the Queen back to safety. Black's extra Pawn is of little value in the face of White's considerable lead in development.
 [ e4 ] , [ c5 ]  In a recent tournament I was up against a WIM and FIDE Master who is also the Canadian Women's Champion.
 [ R d5 ]  [ K f3 ]  [ R x e5 ]  [ R x e5 + ]  [ K x e5 ] , [ K e3 ]  White keeps the king from advancing
 [ Q h5 ]  [ g6 ] , [ Q h4 + ]  If 14... [ N f6 ] 15. [ N b3 ] and White is doing well.
 [ N e2 ] , [ B g4 ]  Once again this is the most aggressive move and I played it without much thought if you know how to play logical chess then it is easy to find good moves in less than a second.
 [ B e6 + ] , [ K c7 ]  8. ...... [ K c7 ] - with a pawn on [ c6 ] this response is the popular one. The other alternatives are [ K d6 ] (not good because it does expose the BK on the open d column) and [ K e1 ] which could allow repetition. Black must be careful after white whips off the black knight because my steed on [ g5 ] threatens to deliver a Royal Fork on e6.
 [ g x f6 ]  [ K f1 ]  [ K f7 ]  [ K e2 ] , [ K e6 ]  Black is winning now because he has complete control of the centre. White can no longer break through his defenses
 [ B b7 ]  [ g5 ]  [ h x g5 ] , [ B x g5 ]  Okay so White finally gets to play Bg5.
 [ N x e5 ]  [ Q x e2 ]  [ N x e2 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ N g4 ] , [ B d4 ]  blocking my open file as well as defending his pawn. If 16. [ B f4 ] instead I can counter with 16...[ g5 ] 17. [ B g3 ] [ R d2 ]  [ R d5 ] , [ B c3 ]  Defends [ e5 ] as 17....Nx[ e5 ] can now be answered with 18.[ N f4 ] winning the knight.
 [ N c2 ]  [ R g3 ]  [ N x a1 ]  [ Q e2 ] , [ Q a5 ]  27...[ Q a5 ] my attack is stronger than his. 28.[ N x e5 ] comes to nothing. 28.Nb1? again.
 [ B f6 ] , [ B c4 ]  ? And I pull back so that if ...[ e6 ] my B won't be attacked. Come to think of it that wasn't a good enough reason for this move since I could always when he does it but the problem is that I didn't know what else to do either. And with it it's worth noting that if his N weren't on [ b8 ] I would've quick played 16.Bc6+. But I'm prepared for what happens after Carl castles as it is a conditional move. Yes it's true that ace-of-aces mentioned that in OTB chess we don't talk about conditional moves. That's true with everyone except me. I do but by conditional moves; what I mean is that I study and plan out what I'm going to do during the opponents moves in the tournament. That's also to prevent me from getting nervous and losing with mistakes that shouldn't be made in the tournament. However I forgot that this was a mistake that should've allowed black win a pawn. Better was 16.Rab1. But after playing this when it was Carl's turn with his Flip Coin Chess I figured that he'd overlooked this move. And what he plays next is what I anticipated which is also why I get into conditional moves for even OTB games since he's known to miss important opportunities like this.
 [ K h7 ] , [ B g3 ]  lingering on two thoughts and preparing f4; already better was [ h4 ] with a much better result...
 [ Q x f6 ]  [ R c f8 ] , [ N c4 ]  Only way he can prevent [ Q g7 # ] is to sacrifice his queen. Time for him to resign.
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ e4 ]  Maybe my pawn structure will not be very stable but I'll get a quick development with tempo
 [ c6 ]  [ d x c6 ]  [ R d8 + ]  [ R d4 ] , [ Q x b2 + ]  White ran out of time at this point but his position was pretty hopeless. The conclusions I've been drawing from playing odd openings is openings really are pretty insignificant. Although one may come into the middle game with a slight disadvantage solid knowledge of the middle game and especially that of the endgame will level things out. I'll leave the opening knowledge to the masters.
 [ Q x e4 + ]  [ K b2 ]  [ O-O-O ] , [ N f3 ]  I think I may see something...
 [ d6 ]  [ O-O-O ] , [ N f4 ]  H pawn is attacked twice
 [ K x b4 ]  [ K f5 ]  [ c5 ]  [ K f6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ K g7 ]  [ c3 ]  [ K x h7 ]  [ c2 ]  [ g6 ]  [ c1 = Q ]  [ g7 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ K h8 ] , [ Q x g7 + ]  And this is the fourth and last move flagged by GameKnot as a mistake. In a sense it's right -- with both a-pawns removed 51... [ Q h2 + ] mates in 12 and I can't imagine that putting the a-pawns back on makes much difference to that -- but this came at a time when my opponent had been online for a while we were making moves rapidly and I wanted to get the game finished. More moves but much less thinking time needed this way!
 [ N a4 ] , [ d5 ]  In the meantime she decides to attack my [ [ e4 ] ] pawn. As I had alluded to earlier she is probably did this to scare and intimidate me in this game. However I am not going to allow that. Therefore I will not exchange my [ [ e4 ] ] pawn with her [ d5 ] pawn. Instead I exchange my [ h3 ] pawn with her [ g4 ] pawn. In my opinion that poses a bigger threat but I could be wrong. If I am going correct however I am going to get rid of the threat immediately. Note: I am not obsessed with or think about these types of threat due to my level of inexperience. It is because I was taught to analyze the position and look out for the threats and disadvantages of each candidate move.
 [ c x d5 ]  [ Q x d5 ]  [ Q x d5 ] , [ e x d5 ]  This game is even... but I still think I'm ahead as far as development goes.
 [ B x f7 ]  [ N x f7 ] , [ R x f7 ]  I am at +2 and a winning kingside!
 [ Q e7 ]  [ f5 ]  [ g x f5 ]  [ N x f5 ]  [ B x f5 ]  [ Q x f5 ]  [ f6 ]  [ K g2 ] , [ Q g7 ]  Workin' it. Awww yeah.
 [ e4 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ f6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ B f7 ]  The 2nd 3rd and 4th move of black have 2 purpose: 1) get out of books 2) (may be) make me in "attacking mode" I did not succeed to prove it but loosing tempo in the opening is dangerous.
 [ O-O-O ] , [ a5 ]  White has a space advantage and black tries to grab space on the queen side. I'm not convinced that this achieves much
 [ b6 ] , [ B d6 ]  [ c x b6 ] [ N b5 ] [ K a8 ] (against Qg3+) [ B x b6 ] [ R c8 ] [ Q g3 ] [ N e7 ] [ N c7 + ] is not nice; but this is worse...
 [ N g6 ]  [ B x g6 ]  [ h x g6 ] , [ R e3 ]  The open KR file becomes the road to victory for Karpov.
 [ a x b3 ]  [ N x b3 ]  [ Q c2 ]  [ N x c1 ]  [ Q x c1 ]  [ h6 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ c6 ]  to avoid the Nb5.
 [ R a d1 ]  [ R a d8 ]  [ R x d5 ] , [ R x d5 ]  And now we're down to a Bishop and Rook end game.
 [ a5 ]  [ b4 ]  [ a x b4 ] , [ a x b4 ]  25. [ a x b4 ] - pawn trade. I may now have the chance of picking off the isolani on [ b5 ] and winning back one of my pawns.
 [ Q x b2 ]  [ N e2 ] , [ d5 ]  I did this in order to prevent [ N c4 ] but it is hard for me to decide for another move. [ N d5 ] could have been more precise.
 [ N x d5 ] , [ c x d5 ]  Taking the knight with queen side pawn to avoid opening my king side too much. Possilbe [ B d4 ] or [ e5 ]  [ e6 ] , [ B g5 ]  Force the queen from hiding hoping for black to move [ f6 ] therefore removes bishop from play
 [ N g3 ]  [ f x g3 ]  [ f x e5 ] , [ N x e5 ]  probably the best way for Black to lose this piece...
 [ Q e7 ] , [ Q h5 + ]  the end is near...
 [ g5 ]  [ B g3 ] , [ h5 ]  Black makes a threat of his position. I was careless and it took me a little by surprise.
 [ N d7 ]  [ h4 ]  [ b4 ] , [ N e2 ]  16. [ N e2 ] - evading black's pawn stab. This however will be a rather unfortunate placement for this knight. In hindsight [ N d4 ] [ f4 ] [ N f3 ] might have been a better plan but do you jury agree?
 [ N d6 + ]  [ K b8 ] , [ N x b6 ]  The best that I can do with the knight is to break up the last of the paired pawns.
 [ b4 ]  [ R c8 + ]  [ K b2 ]  [ R c2 + ]  [ K b1 ] , [ R x f2 ]  Here white realizes that his lsb is lost no there is no point in going on. But it was a fun and a wild game I enjoyed it.
 [ d3 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N a3 ] , [ O-O ]  12. ...... 0-0 I castle and next move play [ Q c7 ] to connect my rooks - again the mantra - clear the decks!
 [ Q e2 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ a4 ]  [ R x h2 ]  [ N h7 + ]  [ K e7 ]  [ B e3 ] , [ R x h1 + ]  The knockout ! 0-1
 [ K e2 ]  [ R e8 + ] , [ K d2 ]  and the king runs for his live
 [ d4 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ c4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ h3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B d3 ] , [ N a6 ]  8. ... Na6!? Trying new idea on [ N [ [ a6 ] ] ] Repertoire. Move Knight to [ [ a6 ] ] square have becoming more popular in KID and other opening. It look ridiculous but [ [ a6 ] ] just a temporary post before jump to [ b4 ] or [ a5 ] or more defensive square c7. Obviously this move is out of "Chess positional rule of gravity" :p
 [ R a8 ] , [ Q b2 ]  I had 5 minutes more here and i was a pawn up. [ Q b3 ] was probably better because the rook cannot come to [ a4 ] but i thought "let's keep the man busy and let him think not trying much until move 40."..and indeed he accepted the complications again.
 [ Q b8 ] , [ e5 ]  !! (maybe it doesn't deserve "!!") Threatening the Knight on [ c6 ] and the d6-Pawn!
 [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ] , [ N x d4 ]  I'm not sure this is wise. Black should be paying attention to development rather than swapping off his one developed piece. On the other hand it draws White's Queen out into the middle where she can be attacked.
 [ K e3 ] , [ Q f4 + ]  And with triple repeat game was decided as draw.
 [ N x e5 ] , [ N x e4 ]  Like to have less pieces.
 [ e6 ] , [ g4 ]  White immediately harasses the annoying Bishop having secured [ e4 ] against a counter-attack on h1.
 [ e x d4 ] , [ O-O ]  White had a wide choice here: 5.Nxd4; 5.e5; 5.[ Q e2 ] being the main ones. This ducks the King out of danger and offers a pawn that White hopes will lead to good things along the e-file for his rooks.
 [ B b8 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ R f8 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ K f6 ]  Black should have made the most of his passed pawns. 36...[ a5 ] 37. [ N d4 ] [ R c8 ] 38. [ g3 ] [ K f6 ] keeps White's advantage to a minimum but the text-move does not cause any major damage.
 [ R d c8 ] , [ B e5 ]  The bishop has to retrun here. If 26. Ba5? b6! and it is lost for a pawn.
 [ N c3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B c5 ]  [ d3 ]  [ a6 ] , [ R e1 ]  Preparing for [ B e3 ] I want to eliminate his dark bishop.
 [ R a5 ]  [ K b6 ] , [ R a a4 ]  [ R a8 ] to see if it may be a draw. Black must then see the win...
 [ K e7 ]  [ R c5 ]  [ K d6 ]  [ R c1 ]  [ K d7 ] , [ f5 ]  
 [ d x c5 ]  [ e5 ] , [ c3 ]  ? Weak move - White should be trying to catch up on development!
 [ K e3 ]  [ K b5 ]  [ h4 ]  [ K a4 ]  [ h5 ] , [ K x a3 ]  Mission accomplished!
 [ N x e4 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ Q x e4 ] , [ f5 ]  Down a pawn but have a possibility of an attack.
 [ d x e6 ]  [ e ] , [ p ]  Taking the pawn and opening a path to take the Rook
 [ Q g5 + ]  [ K e6 ]  [ Q d5 + ]  [ K e7 ]  [ Q b7 + ] , [ K f8 ]  ? A serious mistake which allows White's king to run away. Much stronger was 30...Bd7! 31.[ K g5 ] Rh6! getting the last piece into play. For those who are interested you can turn on the engine and see that its evaluation is as usual: triple zero. That means it is a forced draw somehow. But from the human's point of view the position is far from being clear and all three results are possible.
 [ Q x f6 + ] , [ B x f6 ]  Down to our B's.
 [ N x b3 + ] , [ c x b3 ]  The other alternative which i feel is a better one is 16. [ a x b3 ] [ B x f5 ] 17. [ e x f5 ] the game is equal and whites queen side is defended where as now blacks advantage is the exposed king on the C file which white will have to move to keep safe and defend the [ a2 ] pawn.
 [ K e5 ]  [ N b5 ]  [ K f4 ]  [ N d2 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ N d6 ]  [ B c6 ]  [ b3 ]  [ B x d2 ]  [ K x d2 ]  [ K x f3 ]  [ a4 ] , [ K g3 ]  He resigned here. Let me know what you guys think and give me lots of pointers! :D Oh and if anyone wants to play me as white and play the kings Indian rated or unrated message me or challenge me and I'll play. It has to be the Kings Indian though! lol
 [ h x g4 ]  [ N x g4 ] , [ R b1 ]  And now Black's Rook begins to seek his vengeance.
 [ N h4 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ N g2 ]  [ R a8 ]  [ R a1 ]  [ h4 ] , [ N c6 ]  Analysis calls this a mistake. I would prefer to keep a rook
 [ K x a3 ]  [ K f7 ] , [ e8 = Q + ]  41. e8/Q - a joyous fanfare greets the arrival of Glenda the Defender in all her splendour! Glenda does not have defense in mind here though! She too is not above chasing other queen's kings!
 [ Q d2 ]  [ h6 ] , [ h4 ]  It looks weird bringing out the pawn so early but I wanted to stop any counterplay including 10...[ g5 ]  [ N e7 ]  [ d x e6 ]  [ f x e6 ] , [ B c4 ]  Attacking that weak pawn
 [ R d4 ]  [ R e5 e1 + ]  [ K h2 ]  [ R a1 ]  [ R g g4 ] , [ R e e1 ]  Now my rooks are on the first rank and one is threatening to take the a-pawn.
 [ f x g4 ]  [ Q d6 ]  [ R x f7 ]  [ B x f7 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ B x d4 ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ Q f2 ]  [ c5 ]  [ R x e8 + ]  [ B x e8 ]  [ Q g3 ] , [ Q x g3 + ]  i counted that my bishop was better than his knight: i can force him to stay by his [ c2 ] and [ a2 ] pawns and go to explore by myself... On the other side he will try to force my king to stay on my side... And by succeeding this it is a draw.
 [ R d1 ] , [ N d7 ]  33...Nd7?? I think I had a dream wherein I went [ N f6 + ] and then working my Q down to Black's King. I sometimes wonder how I maintain the ranking I have.
 [ K e7 ]  [ e4 ]  [ R c8 ] , [ e6 ]  ? Probably throwing away the advantage! [ K c2 ] was to be considered.
 [ B e2 ] , [ N d8 ]  black retreats back so white brings the rook onto the open file
 [ B g5 ]  [ Q b6 ]  [ B x f6 ] , [ g x f6 ]  now my king side is really weak but in exchange i got his dsb but I'm starting think about castling queen side.
 [ K e7 ] , [ B e4 ]  This was the point- but not enough to save the game.
 [ e x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ R b8 ]  [ c5 ] , [ B c8 ]  The bishop is completely useless on [ a6 ] so I'm trying to find a better place for it
 [ R f e8 + ]  [ K d1 ]  [ Q x f1 + ]  [ K c2 ] , [ R x c6 ]  pinning the queen down
 [ g3 ] , [ B e7 ]  In my head I had seen 9. ... [ B g4 ] but when it came time to actually play it I quickly realized that would cost me a piece so back to [ e7 ] I go. I'm starting to feel cramped and miserable and it's looking like white's having all the fun.
 [ O-O-O + ]  [ K c2 ]  [ B d4 ]  [ g3 ]  [ B x c3 ]  [ K x c3 ]  [ R d3 + ]  [ K b4 ]  [ Q e7 + ]  [ K a4 ] , [ Q d7 + ]  forced mate in a few moves
 [ Q c1 ]  [ Q d8 ]  [ R b2 ]  [ Q d7 ]  [ B f4 ] , [ B h3 ]  Psst ... I fallen down and I can't get up... help! Hail hail the gangs all here and here comes the queen!
 [ e x d4 ]  [ N e x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ] , [ N x e4 ]  now black pockets the pawn with a better position. This is an important moment in the game. Now that white is down a pawn he will go for the draw. White's material advantage is not big enough to stop playing tactically and making threats immediately. He will try to expand his advantage if possible. Black will want to be playing much more tactically and fogging the position.
 [ K h1 ]  [ R a3 ]  [ R d1 ]  [ h5 ]  [ h3 ] , [ R x d3 ]  !!!
 [ R x g8 ]  [ f x g8 = Q ] , [ c3 ]  As Tom is still planning to promote. But it doesn't matter as I have a mating sequence starting with my next move.
 [ K g7 ] , [ N g5 ]  Or [ d5 ] (with the idea of [ a6 ] then Nbd4) or also interesting is Nxa7.
 [ Q a6 + ]  [ K b4 ]  [ N c2 + ]  [ K b3 ]  [ N d4 + ]  [ K b4 ]  [ Q x a2 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ a5 # ]  
 [ b x a3 ]  [ e x f5 ]  [ R x b2 ] , [ f6 ]  22. [ f6 ] - pawn fork. Black also finds himself in Old Matey's shadow (Qxh7#). Our chessic Grim Reaper is gonna be a very busy man from here on in.
 [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ] , [ e5 ]  This takes us a bit off the beaten path but still with well-known popular responses for white. White will turn the move into an attack.
 [ g6 ]  [ Q e2 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ O-O ] , [ O-O ]  10. O-O (from moves 7 to 10 we just continue to get our pieces out - the [ g7 ] bishop cuts right through to [ a1 ] and a lot of pieces can be lost to tactics there.
 [ B x d3 ]  [ Q x d3 ]  [ h6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ a3 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ O-O ] , [ O-O ]  Rather early but safe-bet castling.
 [ R b4 ]  [ R c4 ] , [ R b8 ]  Alternative variation: 38... [ R x c4 ] 39. [ N x c4 ] [ R d4 ] 40. [ N x b6 ] [ R x f4 ] 41. [ K h2 ] $19
 [ N f6 ]  [ d3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ] , [ Q e2 + ]  7.[ Q e2 + ] brings out the Queen with check but I can undo it by developing my dark squared bishop after which I can castle. White played this move before moving away his bishop on c4. Maybe the idea was to make a forcing move and gain time and at the same time develop the Queen. But now my ambition is to castle and play [ R e8 ] putting the Rook in front of White's Queen.
 [ B e6 ]  [ O-O ] , [ O-O-O ]  Long castle for black whith white DSB aiming at a7... danger
 [ B a6 ] , [ Q e3 ]  Again 15. [ Q e5 ] was the correct move.
 [ R e1 ]  [ K g7 ]  [ R d6 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ R e d1 ]  [ R b6 ]  [ R d6 d5 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ Q e5 + ]  [ Q x e5 ]  [ f x e5 ]  [ R e6 ]  [ B h3 ]  [ f5 ]  [ e x f6 ]  [ e ]  [ p ]  [ + ]  [ R x f6 ]  [ K g1 ]  [ R f3 ]  [ R d1 d3 ]  [ R x d3 ]  [ R x d3 ]  [ K f7 ]  [ B g2 ]  [ a5 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ K e6 ]  [ B c8 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ R d1 ]  [ B c7 ]  [ K g2 ]  [ R f8 ] , [ d8 = Q + ]  I was laughing. black resign
 [ K f8 ] , [ g5 ]  I also considered 20.[ B x h6 ] but I'd rather try to open up the g-column. Besides I didn't have the guts for a second sacrifice :) (I bet Morphy wouldn't have hesitated for a second)
 [ B e3 ] , [ Q d1 ]  Per spec. At this point though still half expecting 33.[ h6 ] I began looking around at alternatives. At first moves like 33.[ R h4 ] or 33.[ K g3 ] seemed to rule ...[ R e1 ] out of court. What to play instead? Then I lit upon the remarkable 33...Bf3!! in reply to both. Pleased with this I awaited White's 33rd move...
 [ R e6 ]  [ K b2 ] , [ K b7 ]  Allows [ c6 ]  [ K c6 ]  [ N x h4 ] , [ c4 ]  Interesting [ R h6 ] seems to force white to lose a pawn and the iniative but I think black was trying to simply storm the Queenside with brute force. It was very nearly successful.
 [ Q x g6 ] , [ Q g8 ]  But I am winning easily anyway
 [ N c3 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ e3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ B x c4 ]  [ B b4 ]  [ h3 ]  [ B x c3 + ]  [ b x c3 ]  [ B x f3 ] , [ Q x f3 ]  White has the bishop pair against 2 Ns better development and a central majority. Enough to win with proper play.
 [ Q e7 ]  [ Q e2 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ N a3 ]  [ d x c3 ] , [ e6 ]  This pawn was safe where it was. Now it isn't.
 [ B f8 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ B a4 ]  [ N d7 ] , [ B e3 ]  Time: 12 min 10 secs
 [ K f4 ] , [ h6 ]  Now this move to keep the White king out of g5. Black's idea is that he will push his b-pawn force White to take it with his rook - thereby unprotecting the c-pawn - and allowing ...Rxc7.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ f5 ]  What the heck? I had to look this up. It's called the Latvian Gambit. It's "supposed" to be an aggressive but weak opening. I decide to attack.
 [ g x f3 ]  [ R x b3 + ] , [ K c2 ]  This is the point where I start to struggle a little to make good moves I am trying to trap the white king on the back row so that the rooks are no longer linked. If I can use my bishops to do that I can bring a rook in for mate
 [ K a5 ]  [ K e4 ] , [ K x a4 ]  I now clear his last pawn. Now as I have one pawn left my king must stay ahead of it until he reaches the 7th rank or my opponent's king can cover the queening square.
 [ Q x f2 + ]  [ K d1 ]  [ R d8 + ]  [ K c1 ]  [ B e3 + ]  [ N d2 ]  [ Q x d2 + ]  [ K b1 ]  [ Q b4 + ]  [ K a2 ]  [ R d2 + ]  [ B c2 ] , [ R x c2 # ]  ...and that was how it went. So sometimes "creative" moves can be helpful. If they focus on a possible weakness even if it seems unbreakable.
 [ B x b7 ]  [ N x b7 + ] , [ K c8 ]  Here I can't keep both knights.
 [ B x f3 ]  [ B x d8 ]  [ B x e2 ] , [ B x e2 ]  I have to take as my rook and bishop are hanging.
 [ K g7 ]  [ R x b8 ] , [ N f5 + ]  Well it seems to be very evenly matched excepting a few pawns but this is were skill kicks in. (And some luck!)
 [ N g5 + ]  [ K g8 ] , [ Q h5 ]  And now we get a very important lesson. If you have a good winning move that gives you great advantage and an unclear line(Of course the unclear line is just losing) that simply take the great advantage. I suppose that white expected the move ...Rc8. If white checks it is actually not so clear anymore and white needs to do a SERIOUS calculation. White should simply capture the bishop.
 [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ] , [ g6 ]  The Accelerated Dragon is not seen very much at master-level these days but it is still a fresh alternative to the bulk of theory of the more common Sicilian lines. GM Lothar Schmid played some interesting games with Black back in the Sixties and Seventies.
 [ N f3 + ]  [ B x f3 ]  [ Q x f3 ] , [ B x g7 ]  I was wondering what to do here. I thought about recapturing which I should've done.
 [ R b c1 ] , [ Q b4 ]  QxP[ f6 ] forces Rf8. White kills after this with QxNe6+.
 [ B b3 ] , [ a5 ]  The bishop retreats. Black tries to corner it in by doing a4.
 [ B c7 ] , [ R x a6 ]  who needs a rook?
 [ b x c6 ] , [ e5 ]  Now Black really doesn't want to take on [ e5 ] and leave himself with doubled isolated pawns.
 [ a x b3 ]  [ N x d5 ] , [ R x d5 ]  The only good option for White is to preserve the outpost square [ d5 ] as ex[ d5 ] renders the [ d6 ] weakness irrelevant and cedes the upper hand to Black. Alternative variation: 18. exd5? [ R b6 ] 19. [ h5 ] [ g5 ] 20. [ N g3 ] [ R a6 ] 21. [ N e4 ] [ f6 ] [and now Black's kingside is closed White's queen is stuck offside and Black has no weaknesses. All of this adds up to a winning game for the second player.]
 [ N x d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ d x e6 ] , [ B x e6 ]  Black has a weak d pawn but seems to be ahead in development. However...
 [ e3 ] , [ N c6 ]  attacking e pawn twice
 [ h3 ]  [ e6 ] , [ B d1 ]  I drop the bishop back with thoughts of R-[ a2 ] and perhaps exchanging the white squared bishop
 [ N b6 ] , [ R d x c7 ]  I believe this is his final blunder. 41. [ N b6 ] R[ c x c7 ] would have been a far better move. It would still have resulted in pretty much a lost position though.
 [ R c1 ]  [ Q e5 ] , [ Q d3 ]  I wanted to get my Queen out into the field but I have to make sure that as of right now [ c2 ] is guarded twice
 [ c3 ] , [ N c2 ]  and white resign.
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ e5 ] , [ d5 ]  This took me a little by surprise. I am experimenting difficultied "defending" the Budapest (my personal cruzade) but I face often dxe that is not at all bad for white despite some tricks he must be aware of.
 [ B g7 ] , [ B c4 ]  Got what I wanted.
 [ N f4 + ] , [ K f7 ]  At this point Black was lost. Any other move loses material. If 23..[ K f8 ] 24.Rxd7! [ R x d7 ] 25.[ N e6 ] and White is ahead a piece. If 23..[ K d8 ] 24.[ N e6 ] ! And if 23..[ N e7 ] 24.N(c3)[ d5 ] wins material as well.
 [ K x f2 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ d4 ] , [ O-O-O ]  15. .......... 0-0-0? I decided to leave the db at that point. Maybe I should have sent Henry the other way but I thought that this way would keep Henry close to the centre. A few rook moves from white and I found myself having to put Henry in the corner. Really bad especially when the enemy king is on the other side of the board and more active.
 [ B g4 ] , [ B c4 ]  Putting a bit of pressure on [ f7 ] this might be useful later on. Recently I've taken to putting the LSB on [ c4 ] rather than [ b5 ] to see how it works out.
 [ N e5 ] , [ B d6 ]  Another developing move with tempo. You can see now that the plan for Black will be to attack on the kingside and/or in the center.
 [ a4 ] , [ Q x c3 + ]  I thought about what to do when Henry gets out of check. Of course 32.[ K a2 ] is his only option. I had considered 32...[ B x c4 ] which wins another pawn and forces mate with 33...Qb2#. But I quickly figured out that there's no need to win another pawn because 32...[ Q b2 # ] is mate at once. And that is exactly what I had played.
 [ K f3 ]  [ K c4 ]  [ R b1 ] , [ K c3 ]  Pushing the rook off the b file.
 [ R e d7 ]  [ Q f3 ] , [ K g7 ]  21. ..... [ K g7 ] - forced - to defend the knight on f6.
 [ B x e3 ]  [ d x e3 ]  [ N x e5 ] , [ R x e5 ]  A few exchanges do not hamper the blacks attack. Now the game ended rather quickly.
 [ g x f5 ] , [ R x f5 ]  24. [ R x f5 ] - I decide to take back with the rook.
 [ R b3 ] , [ e5 + ]  Well it had merit for reasons beyond the previous analysis! If only I had played it earlier but here it allows the black bishop to be attacked while providing a worst-case exchange on the troublesome d pawn.
 [ b x a3 ]  [ b x a3 ] , [ B e6 ]  Which black stops.
 [ K g8 ] , [ Q e4 ]  Centralizes the queen and restricts the black knight.
 [ e4 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ e5 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ d x e5 ] , [ Q d5 ]  !? Unusual and loses time.
 [ B e4 ] , [ B x d7 ]  Just lost a knight
 [ Q e5 ]  [ d x c3 ]  [ R c1 ]  [ R x f2 ]  [ Q e4 + ]  [ Q f5 ]  [ Q x f5 + ]  [ R x f5 ]  [ R x c3 ]  [ R f4 ]  [ R x c7 ]  [ R x b4 ]  [ R x a6 ]  [ R b1 + ]  [ K f2 ]  [ b4 ]  [ R a a7 ]  [ b3 ]  [ R c x g7 + ]  [ K h8 ] , [ R g e7 ]  
 [ N f3 ]  [ d5 ] , [ c4 ]  The Reti can be a dangerous weapon when Black chooses to occupy [ d5 ] with a pawn.
 [ d5 ] , [ g3 ]  4. [ g3 ] - so far only pawn moves and 1 king move. You cannot afford to do this against the Master Mater! In retrospect maybe [ c3 ] was better here or even a developing move like Ne2.
 [ B x c6 + ] , [ b x c6 ]  13 ...[ K e7 ] 14.[ B c5 + ] is also bad here.
 [ R f b8 ] , [ R c7 ]  If I play for attack I have to do it consequently. [ N g4 ] right now could have been better but I wanted the R on the 7th rank first. I sweared my opponent would have gone for the pawn instead and after that I have still 4 moves before he can queen the a pawn... my attack will go faster (!?). Are you able to tell me if I was right?
 [ R a d1 ] , [ B d6 ]  Carlsen has 2 big problems: 1) White's d pawn and 2) The weak a1-[ h8 ] diagonal! I personally prefer 23. [ R a e1 ] and not Rad1. I think it is more forceful. But White is still considerably better here. Just my preference The one hope for Carlsen is this is a very concrete position tactically. So one slight inaccuracy can let the opponent back in the game. This is what Carlsen is hoping for because with accurate play I think it is finito! And
 [ Q x c5 ]  [ b x c5 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ N a4 ]  [ B e4 ]  [ N g5 ] , [ B c6 ]  all forced...
 [ N f3 ] , [ h6 ]  Wonderful black underestimates the dangers of retarded piece developement.
 [ K x h7 ] , [ Q c2 + ]  but it is not a sacrifice here because the [ Q c7 ] move
 [ R e1 ] , [ R c4 ]  Now the moment of truth... This move wins the [ a4 ] pawn at a minimum and has potential for much more depending upon White's response. This is my attempt to go after White's queen on the cheap.
 [ Q x c4 ] , [ N h4 ]  I'm not worried about white's Knight and Queen here they can't mate me so I just continue to eat pawns.
 [ c4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ c x d5 ] , [ N x d5 ]  All book so far.
 [ N f6 ]  [ R d1 ]  [ b5 ] , [ h3 ]  I need to avoid the possible pin on d4.
 [ N b d2 ] , [ a5 ]  Sigmund's pawns on [ a5 ] and [ b4 ] prevent his own Bishop from standing on those squares. This can be a useful tool for determining whether or not we want to play our pawns to certain squares or not - what will this do to the team of Pieces that I have?
 [ e x d5 ] , [ e5 ]  Boehnke Gambit of the Scandi. Who the hell is Boehnke? Seems like a German last name to me.
 [ B d7 ] , [ N c7 ]  Since the knight hits both [ e6 ] and my [ a8 ] I'm obliged to capture.
 [ Q f3 ]  [ f5 ]  [ N g3 ]  [ e4 ] , [ d x e4 ]  I think [ Q d1 ] was better
 [ N c6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ B b4 ]  [ Q d3 ]  [ B x c3 + ] , [ b x c3 ]  7. [ b x c3 ] - B for N trade busting white's queenside pawns.
 [ N e2 ] , [ h3 ]  Loses immediately. Although after 23. [ R f1 ] the only move that avoids mate White is obviously lost.
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ a6 ]  Najdorf I play this for solidity however I feel that I should have played the dragon in the long run since I'm not as familiar with this opening.
 [ f x g5 ] , [ N x g5 + ]  32. [ N x g5 + ] - a fork but luckily I will end up with 2 pieces for the rook.
 [ d4 ] , [ f5 ]  A Dutch defence may be a brave choice to play against Nisipeanu.
 [ O-O ]  [ R b1 ] , [ B e6 ]  Planning to exchange on [ b3 ] doubling white's pawns. Otherwise white has to withdraw the knight to [ c1 ] which doesn't look good in an already passive position.
 [ e5 ] , [ N e4 ]  So the game would have been a bit better without the mouse slip. At this point white just finishes:
 [ B d4 ] , [ K f1 ]  This black bishop is a good piece but white's rooks are strong so it is best to get rid
 [ N h3 ] , [ g5 ]  White knight retreats to [ h3 ] and a black pawn push to g5.
 [ a3 ] , [ N f6 ]  3. [ a3 ] seems to be just wasting time so I'll develop with an attack on e4.
 [ c x d4 ]  [ Q h4 + ]  [ K d7 ] , [ e x d4 ]  ...so to defend [ f4 ] for one more move. But there is no hope for white since the black king escapes to the queenside and white can't avoid it.
 [ O-O ]  [ B g7 ] , [ B e3 ]  Now white is 2 tempos ahead with 4 pieces developed castling vs only 3 pieces for black white's pieces are well posted and look like cooprating really nice!
 [ e4 ] , [ B c6 ]  The Bishop retreats to the only square available blocking the c-pawn. Also possible was 5…[ e6 ] attacking the advanced knight 6.[ d4 ] Bc6.
 [ R x a6 + ]  [ K x a6 ] , [ R c6 + ]  Double attack on king and knight his knight is defended by the pawn but his pawn is pinned by the white bishop. If he captures rook with pawn he loses his bishop if he doesn't he loses his knight and/or more.
 [ Q f5 ]  [ R f6 ]  [ Q g4 ]  [ R c2 ]  [ h5 ]  [ N e7 ]  [ Q d7 ]  [ N e c6 ]  [ g4 ] , [ N x d4 ]  Nxd4! Taking advantage of the pinned knight on [ d2 ] and if White takes he will lose both knights.
 [ K f8 ]  [ R d7 d8 + ]  [ K g7 ]  [ R x g8 + ]  [ K x g8 ]  [ R d8 + ]  [ K g7 ] , [ R a8 ]  The idea is to win back a pawn.
 [ N e5 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ e3 ]  [ N f5 ]  [ g4 ] , [ N d6 ]  my knight is now in the center of the board
 [ Q e3 ] , [ R x f2 ]  ?? No safety check. The idea is that White cannot retake on [ f2 ] because of 16...Bd4! and Black will give a Rook and Bishop for a Queen and pawn the initiative and vastly superior activity but I overlooked a critical intermezzo which would have been easy to catch if I'd only looked... Not to mention that 16.Qx[ f2 ] [ B d4 ] 17.[ B e3 ] [ R f8 ] just loses a piece anyway for basically no compensation (good catch tiger_lilov)
 [ g4 ] , [ e5 ]  In this game I am black. My Opponent isn't very good and I know a fair amount of chess so I have a clear advantage in that department. I still make dumb mistakes and don't see everything though so I am putting this game up so that I can get some advice. Also I make a pretty huge blunder and come back successfully due to my opponent making many mistakes. Any pointers will help so please comment.
 [ B x c5 + ]  [ K g2 ]  [ B x a3 ]  [ K f1 ]  [ B c4 + ]  [ K f2 ]  [ B b4 ]  [ K g2 ]  [ B e1 ]  [ f4 ] , [ e x f4 ]  And now it really is academic.
 [ N f6 ] , [ a4 ]  This is a poor move from me better perhaps would be to develop my dsb or even [ a3 ] my intention was to get that black pawn out of my way
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B b4 ]  [ a3 ]  [ B x c3 + ]  [ b x c3 ] , [ d6 ]  The starting position for all the games.
 [ N e5 ]  [ N e3 ]  [ h6 ]  [ B x f6 ] , [ R x f6 ]  Alternative variation: 15...[ Q x f6 ] 16.[ N d5 ] [ Q d8 ] 17.[ b3 ] [!] [ c6 ] 18.[ Q a3 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ Q c5 + ]  [ K h1 ]  [ R d6 ]  [ f6 ] , [ g5 ]  Alternative variation: 18...[ Q x c4 ] 19.[ N e7 + ] [ K h8 ] 20.[ f x g7 + ] [ K x g7 ] 21.[ N f5 + ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ d6 ] , [ R x g5 + ]  A win in the old style of English Opening play.
 [ N c b5 ] , [ a6 ]  Now there comes the anticipated pawn move but what to do? If [ N b5 ] moves [ N d5 ] is in trouble. If [ N d5 ] moves then [ N b5 ] is in trouble. But wait what about [ c7 ] and Bc5? Black's queen is protecting both. What if she couldn't do that?
 [ N c6 ] , [ O-O ]  king in safe rooks and queen joined white's developpement is almost completed.
 [ Q b4 ]  [ Q e3 + ]  [ K h1 ] , [ Q x g5 ]  At least I get two knights for my rook.
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ d6 ]  [ e4 ]  [ g6 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ N g e2 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ N a6 ]  [ a3 ]  [ N c7 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ a6 ]  [ a4 ]  [ h6 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ K h7 ]  [ h3 ]  [ B d7 ] , [ g4 ]  Up to this point Stockfish 10 would choose different opening moves for both sides however this is where the game starts to get very interesting. Black plays very accurately for the remainder of the game.
 [ d5 ] , [ e3 ]  2. [ e3 ] is a bit passive. I would play 2. [ c4 ] and enter the Queen's Gambit. There are opening databases on Gameknot which can help you play the openings without making any major mistake.
 [ R x b8 ]  [ R x b1 ] , [ R x g8 ]  With the game now 'cleaned of evil' it is up to both players to prove who is the most 'Grophworthy'.
 [ R f e8 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ Q f5 ] , [ N c4 ]  Looking towards [ N d6 ] for the Rook/Queen fork.
 [ N g7 ] , [ R x e6 ]  He finally bites on one of my attempted sacrifices. Mate next move for him if I don't take rook on e6. I have something up my sleeve though....
 [ g x f6 ] , [ e x f6 ]  Black is hopelessly lost here.
 [ R g5 ]  [ B g6 ]  [ B d2 ]  [ N c7 ]  [ R a g1 ] , [ R g8 ]  Both sides free up their remaining pieces. How to proceed?
 [ R f2 f7 ]  [ R x f7 ]  [ R x f7 + ]  [ R e7 ]  [ R x e7 + ] , [ K x e7 ]  The result is an exchange of all the rooks and now it's down to the kings.
 [ B e7 ]  [ Q g4 ] , [ B f8 ]  [ g6 ] can be considered better and the weakness of the black squares is not so terrible until black's dsb is in the game.
 [ f4 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ e5 ]  This essentially ruins blacks plan for any attack. My dark-squared bishop also helps put a cap on the d-file and any ideas of counterplay look to have gone down the drain
 [ Q x f4 ]  [ R x f4 ]  [ B e5 ]  [ R f f1 ]  [ b6 ]  [ g4 ]  [ a5 ]  [ K g2 ]  [ R f g8 ]  [ K f3 ]  [ K g5 ] , [ h4 + ]  White decided to give back a pawn for some active piece play.
 [ N c5 ] , [ B c2 ]  the first step of my game plane is completed its not a good idea for black to exchange his DSB for my knight on [ c5 ] because of after 10.Bx[ c5 ] -dx[ c5 ] .11.Nxe5?-Nxe4!.12.Nxe4-[ B x e5 ] . and if 10.Bxc5-dxc5.11.0-0 -[ N e8 ] .... black blocks whites advance on the queen side and white is all so stays with his LSB which it take a long time to get good position .
 [ N c3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ N x c6 ] , [ b x c6 ]  This exchange should benefit black. White spent three tempi to blacks one and brought the 'b' pawn toward the center where it can support a [ d5 ] advance.
 [ N a4 ]  [ a5 ]  [ g4 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ h4 ]  [ d5 ] , [ e5 ]  I decided to close the centre whilst gaining space
 [ R x f5 ] , [ c6 + ]  ?? The wrong advance. I have to play [ a6 ] because [ c5 ] guarded by the king is my defence against the rook.
 [ g3 ]  [ Q h5 ]  [ K g2 ] , [ c4 ]  Pressing forward.
 [ R c8 ] , [ B c4 ]  Black forfeits on time. The game is over anyway. If 27... [ R x c5 ] 28. [ Q g8 # ] If 27... [ Q x c5 ] 28. Qf7#. If 27... [ K e8 ] 28. [ g x f6 ] [ B x f6 ] (28... [ Q x f6 ] 29. [ Q d7 + ] [ K f8 ] 30.[ Q x c8 + ] [ K e7 ] 31. [ Q d8 # ] (31. Rd7#)) 29. [ Q g8 + ] [ Q f8 ] 30. [ Q e6 + ] [ Q e7 ] 31. [ Q x c8 + ] [ Q d8 ] 32. [ R x d8 + ] [ B x d8 ] 1-0
 [ N b6 ] , [ N f3 ]  Following the general principle(GP): Knights out before Bishops.
 [ d6 ]  [ Q g7 ]  [ K d7 ]  [ Q h6 ] , [ Q f8 ]  13. ........... Qf8. Glenda now fronts the Wicked Witch of the West. White has the option of either leaving his queen where it is taking my queen - either option results in a queen trade disarming white's mating attack or retreating it. White takes the latter option by checking on h3. Henry goes back to his home square.
 [ R x a5 ]  [ R d2 ]  [ R a3 ]  [ N e2 ]  [ R e a8 ]  [ R a1 ] , [ B e4 ]  The fight over [ a2 ] takes a lot of effort for black but the centre was too crowded
 [ Q x a8 ]  [ Q x a1 ]  [ e6 ]  [ a3 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ B x d6 ]  [ K x d6 ]  [ e3 ] , [ a5 ]  !!??
 [ B c3 ]  [ R f d8 ] , [ B c2 ]  White seems happy to go for the exchanges. Maybe my play was not sound here as the side that controls more space shouldn't normally be exchanging.
 [ N x e4 ] , [ d3 ]  ? But this is a mistake which loses a pawn. The irony is that I almost made a blunder which would've lost a piece. And that would've been an example of what Jack calls "a 2 second move". Maybe Tom thought that this won back a pawn but best for Tom would've been 7.[ Q e2 ] which would've done just that.
 [ f5 ]  [ e x f5 ]  [ R x f5 ]  [ N h4 ]  [ R f7 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c7 ]  [ N g5 ]  [ R f f8 ]  [ b4 ]  [ b6 ]  [ a4 ]  [ c x b4 ]  [ R x b4 ]  [ N a6 ]  [ R b5 ]  [ N c5 ]  [ a5 ]  [ R a b8 ]  [ R f b1 ]  [ B h8 ]  [ B x c5 ]  [ d x c5 ]  [ N c e4 ]  [ Q f5 ] , [ Q e2 ]  He doesn't have many good moves and I was thinking he would bring the bishop down to d4.
 [ R x f6 ]  [ Q x f6 ] , [ Q x d5 ]  Desperate black wants to end his misery fast
 [ b x a7 ]  [ K e8 ]  [ R b1 ]  [ B c6 ]  [ R b8 + ]  [ K e7 ]  [ Q a5 ]  [ K f6 ]  [ R g5 ] , [ Q f3 ]  White is down but he's attacking well.
 [ d4 ]  [ e x d4 ] , [ Q x d4 ]  [ e5 ] would be better. I can harrass the queen.
 [ d5 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ e6 ]  All by the book.
 [ R a d1 ] , [ B h4 ]  All of a sudden I realize: This is the knight I should be threatening! Sometimes I just randomly see things I probably should have seen earlier. His other knight isn't hurting me much this knight is preventing me from pushing f5. By doubling his kingside pawns it will give me a favorable endgame. There is no good escape for this knight moving it to [ h1 ] would be a good defensive move but that's not all that obvious of a move. The queen is tied to the defense of the bishop.
 [ K h1 ]  [ R f e8 ] , [ R g4 ]  (RC) To weaken Black's attack on his K pawn and so make R-[ Q1 ] possible continuing the pressure on the Q pawn.
 [ N x d6 ] , [ Q x d6 ]  Like my DSB the queen is not very active on a dark square looking for ways to improve this.
 [ g x f6 ] , [ R d5 d3 ]  ! Stifling black's defenses by cutting of lines for the black queen. Black has very little piece coordination on the king side and is soon going to find this king to be uncomfortable.
 [ Q x b6 ]  [ a x b6 ] , [ a3 ]  Now black only has a sac to penetrate my queenside. I have to solve the lsb's developement though.
 [ e4 ] , [ c5 ]  I had started playing this opening since a few years without actually studying it very well but so far my results have not changed much.
 [ d4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ] , [ a6 ]  The Sicilan Narjof defence. I will leave the theory of this varation to others as I know very little about it.
 [ N b5 + ]  [ K c6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ R a8 ]  [ N e d4 + ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 + ]  [ K c7 ]  [ N b5 + ]  [ K c6 ]  [ N c3 + ]  [ K c7 ]  [ Q d4 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ N b5 + ]  [ K b8 ]  [ c5 ]  [ B c6 ]  [ c x d6 ]  [ B d8 ] , [ d7 ]  Threat is Qd6+.
 [ N c3 ] , [ N b4 ]  I'm just trying to use my space here and make potential threats.
 [ B e8 ]  [ N c4 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ N d6 ]  [ d6 ] weak sq for blk strong sq for w
 [ B f8 ]  [ K d3 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ K c4 ]  [ N f4 ]  [ g3 ]  [ N e6 ] , [ N h6 + ]  Forcing the exchange of Black's dark squared bishop for the knight. Note that the black king has no escape squares from the check.
 [ B b2 ] , [ h6 ]  Throughout the whole game Black remains very conscious of the safety of his King. Though this move may feel a bit excessive (I have hardly any threats in that direction yet) the point here is just as much to create some 'luft' (air) around the King (thus preventing 8th rank mates) as it is to take away control of [ g5 ] from White. This makes it a very useful waiting move in many positions and indeed you will want to do something like this relatively early in the game for you will often find that it is far too late to do this once things actually starts heating up! If you play through some grandmaster games from the last 20 years or so you will find that this kind of move is very common quite early in the game! So pay heed and remember this - give your King a bit of 'luft' to avoid finding him strangled later on ...
 [ g x f6 ] , [ g x f6 ]  [ Q x f6 ] could have been safer but he correctly wanted to control [ e5 ] with a pawn.
 [ B g7 ] , [ f4 ]  OK this pawn push was needed to protect the e pawn.
 [ R e2 ]  [ d3 ]  [ R e4 ] , [ d2 ]  Of course Black now queens. White resigns.
 [ R d8 ]  [ N e5 ] , [ R d2 ]  ? Well this allows [ Q x c6 + ] QxQ NxQ Rxa2. Not so bad...
 [ R e2 ]  [ Q d3 ]  [ K f2 ] , [ f5 ]  A dirty trick! [ R x e5 ] [ Q d4 + ] 40 [ R e3 ] [ f4 ] losing the rook.
 [ c3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ N a3 ] , [ a6 ]  Move to stop knight from moving onto [ b5 ] square
 [ K e3 ]  [ K b4 ]  [ K d2 ] , [ K b3 ]  65. .... [ K b3 ] - now Henry cuts off the WK from c2. My a pawn is now has a clear run to Glendadom.
 [ N x f4 ]  [ b5 ]  [ B b3 ]  [ K f8 ]  [ N d3 ]  [ e5 ]  [ d x e5 ] , [ B e6 ]  A bit of a blunder as I miscalculated but my opponent does as well.
 [ N f3 ]  [ g5 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ d6 ]  [ O-O ] , [ B e6 ]  A weak move
 [ N x c3 ]  [ b x c3 ]  [ O-O ] , [ N h4 ]  ?? This is the blunder. I guess he didn't realize I had two pieces attacking it.
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ B f4 ] , [ g6 ]  Seldom played but very good in my view. It becomes difficult to work the pawn storm I normally plan here.
 [ R c b1 ] , [ f4 ]  White moves [ c1 ] rook being attacked to [ b1 ] and black moves pawn to [ f5 ] attacking pawns in front of the king . This pawn is protected 3 times and attacked twice.
 [ N g6 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ g x f6 ] , [ N c3 ]  control moe of the centre
 [ b3 ] , [ a x b3 ]  Yes! White has growing hopes but the black Knight can now take the h pawn at only three moves!
 [ K e8 ] , [ K f3 ]  ? ... But still allowing it. This is in my view the losing move of this game. The pawn ending is an easy win for Black although it takes some time.
 [ N h f1 ] , [ d x e4 ]  Clearing the way...
 [ N g e7 ] , [ e5 ]  ???
 [ Q d7 ] , [ N d5 ]  15. [ N d5 ] - eyeing up a potential fork on f6.
 [ O-O ] , [ h3 ]  To restrict black's light squared bishop (which at this stage I'm a little scared of as it is still very strong.
 [ R e4 ] , [ Q h5 ]  Not surprisingly Carl's trying to further liquidate while ahead.
 [ N f3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ g3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B g2 ] , [ g6 ]  3. ... [ g6 ] is inconsistent with 1. ... [ e6 ] not necessarily because it weakens the dark squares but because the bishop is just as happy at [ e7 ] or [ d6 ] and the move played is inviting white to play h2-h4-[ h5 ] in due course.
 [ R x c2 ]  [ Q b3 ]  [ R c6 ]  [ Q x b7 ] , [ R b6 ]  White takes the pawn back. I tried to trap his queen in the corner.
 [ e x d6 ] , [ Q g5 ]  Slightly better than 25. Rg8. And after this move me and mum spin the board around.
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N d2 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f d7 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ c5 ]  [ c3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N e2 ]  [ c x d4 ] , [ c x d4 ]  Most popular line in Gameknot World Database up to this point.
 [ B c8 ] , [ R e3 ]  21. Re3?? - natural this rook lift is planning to put pressure on my [ g7 ] pawn but this little footman is to become a little blighter as far as white is concerned. My position has been like a hedgehog spikes with a soft underbelly. Here the spikes prevail as the pawn moves to [ g6 ] piling up on the pinned knight on f5. So my opponent is well and truly spiked on the hedgehog.
 [ K h8 ] , [ R f d1 ]  I didn't want to retreat so I moved my other rook to form a battery. However this opens the possibility of a backdoor mate later on which would give me a lot of trouble.
 [ e x d4 + ] , [ K x d4 ]  I am very comfortable in my position
 [ e5 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ f x e5 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ N x d5 ] , [ e x d5 ]  the much better variation for white because of:
 [ h6 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ a5 ] , [ O-O-O ]  The fastest way to get my two rooks out onto the open file beginning with an attack against the backward pawn at d6.
 [ Q x b7 ] , [ Q x d2 ]  And White resigns. Notice how White never had a real plan he was simply reacting to Black's moves.
 [ e x d4 ] , [ N f3 ]  3. [ N f3 ] - I try an unusual line here it is a gambit. This will bring about swift development at the cost of a pawn. This turns out to be a delayed Danish Gambit which is a favourite of my Expert Buddy Jim Friar (Therealjimfriar).
 [ h6 ] , [ g3 ]  creating a bishop line
 [ N f6 ] , [ N c3 ]  I respond by controlling the same square's Blacks knight did
 [ B d7 ] , [ N h5 ]  Another knight comes into play. For the moment the black [ N g6 ] is blocked along with the knight [ e7 ] defending it.
 [ B d2 ] , [ B x f3 ]  Forcing Alekhine's hand as PxN would now be answered with BxP leaving Black a pawn up.
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ h3 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ e3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ g4 ]  [ B g6 ]  [ c3 ]  [ B x b1 ] , [ Q x b1 ]  The idea of this move is to place the queen on the white diagonal. But it is questionable.
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B f4 ] , [ B f5 ]  New opening
 [ c x d4 ] , [ f x e6 ]  I can be found in the owner's circle at the Kentucky derby.
 [ e x f3 ]  [ e ]  [ p ]  [ + ] , [ K f2 ]  That's the point. My king is shielded behind the black's own pawn and if...
 [ g5 ] , [ h3 ]  ? A mistake. While it doesn't show on the analysis this is a bad move. My whole idea here was to prevent him from winning my N I figured that here he could not play ...[ g4 ] as I'd just take. However in this position he can and will play ...[ h6 ] establishing the connected pawns henceforth pawn structures and be able to do damage. Eventually this will enable him material no matter what I do. The only option here was 12.[ N d2 ] to prevent any further damage. I don't like it because it really jams in the N and crams the Q. But it's better then what black does next.

 [ K e5 ]  [ N g5 ]  [ a5 ] , [ N x h7 ]  Falls for the same trick as on move 42 but now thats on the other side of the board......
 [ N d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N c2 ]  [ d6 ]  [ g3 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ B g2 ] , [ e3 ]  I was expecting 7. ...Bf5. The biggest problem with this move isn't that it just drops a pawn for no visible compensation it's that it cedes the h1-[ a8 ] diagonal without a fight.
 [ N f3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ e3 ]  [ N b d7 ] , [ Q c2 ]  6.[ B d3 ] is more popular but I prefer to play 6.[ Q c2 ] first which forces black to come up with a useful move since now 6...[ d x c4 ] 7.[ B x c4 ] and white gains a tempo on the usual line as the bishop has only moved once to recapture on c4.
 [ R a3 a1 + ] , [ K d2 ]  quitly forced

 [ Q x d6 ] , [ N d2 ]  The last minor piece clears the rank...
 [ N a5 ] , [ d5 ]  White needs to be aware of the Knights on the same diagonal with a DSB lurking. Black chooses to keep the Bishop up the board. Also the d-pawn is vunerable and Black needs to get something for it.
 [ K f8 ] , [ N b4 ]  !
 [ R b2 ] , [ O-O ]  castle and leave the juicy pawn on [ b7 ] with Rook behind as intended.
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ d5 ]  My standard opening I know is not the best available I will try to think of a new one.
 [ K e6 ] , [ N f2 ]  The advanced Black pawn will fall.
 [ B e7 ]  [ B b5 ] , [ B d7 ]  I could have taken advantage more of your King's position by a more active move such as Bf5.
 [ R b4 ] , [ f3 ]  Here I decided not to notate further since I wanted to apply even more time pressure and I was sure that I was winning even though it is really a draw still. I will do my best to recall the moves he might have played and get to a later endgame position.
 [ Q d6 + ]  [ K c8 ] , [ R e8 # ]  like I said Black was on the ropes the moment he lost the right to castle and all White had to do is slowly gain the positional advantage before White had an attack that Black could not defend against! 1-0
 [ B x e7 ]  [ R x e7 ] , [ f5 ]  ? [ N f6 ] is better here. (Computer agrees with me)
 [ R e2 ]  [ R g7 ]  [ Q d3 ]  [ Q f8 ] , [ N b5 ]  21. Nb5! - this move floored me! My knight on [ c7 ] is en prise and if I take the [ b5 ] knight along comes that dreaded fork. If I move Glenda to defend the knight then I will still fall for the fork! I find a combo though that seems to be the least of all the evils!
 [ d5 ]  [ c4 ] , [ d x c4 ]  Up to this point the moves had already been made for the mini-tournament. Queen's Gambit Accepted. This is my first game using this opening.
 [ N h3 ]  [ N b d7 ]  [ N f4 ] , [ B g6 ]  White has a surprise. Do you see it? White's lead in development should translate to a tactical move.
 [ B g5 ] , [ Q f3 + ]  Of course I would have finished connecting my rooks if it was feasible but he is not going allow it. Therefore he decides to place me back in check and it is serious because he is going to win another free pawn. On the other hand I will get out of it by alleviating the exposure even more given that I am moving back to the first rank.
 [ b6 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ Q d7 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ h6 ]  [ O-O ] , [ O-O-O ]  Was not expecting a queen side castle.

 [ e3 ] , [ B g4 ]  Pins knight to queen
 [ N x d5 ] , [ c x d5 ]  In exchanging White attacks the Black Knight and begins preparing a pitfall.
 [ R x c2 ] , [ R h5 ]  White gets the tempo to play his intended move.
 [ B x c7 ]  [ Q x e2 + ]  [ B x e2 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O-O ] , [ R e8 ]  One of my chess mentors suggested I make sure to bring my non-castled rook into play sooner. This gives a nice excuse.
 [ b4 ]  [ N c4 ]  [ B x c4 ]  [ b x c4 ] , [ N x c6 ]  It was either lose that pawn or lose my knight for nothing. I'll be -1 for quite some time now...
 [ c5 ] , [ c3 ]  The Alapin variation. It takes Black out of the usual lines like the Najdorf and Dragon and is a positional treatment as opposed to an overtly tactical one. As long as the second player doesn't go out of his mind against it during the opening the Alapin doesn't offer any particular danger to Black. In fact my personal opinion of the Alapin is that it's sorta the "Petrov" of White's options against 1. ...c5. (Oooooh! Ouch! I know all you Alapin players out there hated hearing that!)

 [ K e2 ]  [ N b5 ] , [ R d7 + ]  A change of approach for White who now gives check for not much reason.
 [ B e3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ f3 ] , [ a6 ]  This is now played as a part of the mainline opening for B80 Sicilian Scheveningen including the english This is one of Black's most ambitious lines. This offers excellent counter attacking chances as well as scope for creativity. The pawn center of d6-[ e6 ] gives Black control of the critical [ d5 ] and [ [ e5 ] ] squares and retains flexibility to break in the center with either ...[ [ e5 ] ] or ...d5.
 [ R x f2 + ]  [ K d3 ]  [ R x d2 + ]  [ K c4 ] , [ b5 # ]  This opponent went on my "bad list" when he attempted the "Four Move Trick". That is because I took offense when he attempted this dirty trick. This is the reason that I showed my "true color".

 [ f4 ] , [ B b5 + ]  ...to attack the king.
 [ B f7 ] , [ Q d2 ]  Not only do I threaten Black's knight but also have a sneaky attack on the [ h6 ] pawn.
 [ c x d4 ]  [ B x f5 ]  [ e x f5 ] , [ c x d4 ]  Doesn´t seem white has now enough firepower to go for the king and that doubled pawn situation in "f" is not that bad after Be6.
 [ R f4 x f7 ]  [ N x g6 + ] , [ K h7 ]  
 [ f5 ] , [ N g5 ]  ...which allows this nice little outpost for the knight! The threat is [ Q [ f7 ] + ] which will allow White a protected pawn on [ f7 ] after Rxf7.
 [ Q x b5 ]  [ h6 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ Q c6 ]  [ R h d8 ] , [ R d1 ]  Black is in deep trouble he can't even exchange a pair of Rooks with 21...[ B e7 ] because that will allow [ Q c8 ] with devastating effects.
 [ B d6 ] , [ Q g4 ]  The queen must be careful but has plenty of action on the naked kingside.
 [ N c6 ]  [ N g e2 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ] , [ N x d4 ]  5. [ N x [ d4 ] ] - after my unusual [ N g e2 ] instead of [ N f3 ] the standard Sicilian moves [ d4 ] ex[ d4 ] and [ N x [ d4 ] ] takes place.
 [ d4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ e3 ] , [ c5 ]  I've been experimenting with the Franco-Benoni. In this game my opponent plays a stonewall-type setup and goes for the direct Kingside attack.
 [ e5 ] , [ N f3 ]  White knight attacks the pawn. Black has a choice to play the philidor defense or the knights game.
 [ e3 ] , [ N x g5 ]  Securing the advantage of the Bishop pair
 [ B d3 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ Q e2 ] , [ N g4 ]  There may have been a better move 14....[ d5 ] but Black saw a way of dealing with a few positonal threats ([ B g5 ] and Bd3) and equalising the game. [ e5 ] square becomes the centre of activity.
 [ d x e5 ]  [ Q x e5 + ]  [ B e7 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ B d7 ] , [ O-O-O ]  [ Q x c7 ] should yield a free pawn.
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ B b5 ]  Black to play.
 [ B d6 ] , [ B d8 ]  (Wanting to prevent 38. [ B e7 ] which would make the g-pawn advance impossible because of the hanging knight on f6.)
 [ B g5 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ b4 ] , [ B x b4 ]  further incursion thru superior planning
 [ B x d5 ]  [ Q x d5 ] , [ d3 ]  This does nothing to protect against QxPg2. Archduke notes white should have castled (7. O-O) instead.
 [ R e d3 ]  [ R e7 ]  [ N a4 ] , [ b5 ]  26. ..... [ b5 ] - I must take a little evasive action first though!
 [ R d2 d8 ] , [ Q g7 ]  A point also for 24. [ N g4 ] which also wins. What now?
 [ Q e5 ] , [ g3 ]  So I give my "King air to breathe" as Jack Stockel puts it.
 [ Q e2 ] , [ K g7 ]  But perhaps this is too defensive? White is not threatening anything any time soon.
 [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ Q x d5 ]  [ d4 ]  [ e5 ] , [ N c3 ]  Stronger for white is Nf3. The other answer is [ B b4 ] but I played...
 [ R x f5 + ]  [ g x f5 ] , [ g6 ]  beautiful ending. Threats are not only [ Q f7 ] [ Q h8 ] [ g7 ] but also Bh6!
 [ B e2 ]  [ R c8 ]  [ Q d4 ] , [ N e7 ]  ...his attack will take too long now and white will now make forcing moves. My opponent has disregarded his doubled pawn and king safety. My own king safety is not so great but his is worse.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N g5 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ N x f7 ] , [ B x f2 + ]  The Traxler Counter-Attack - one of the sharpest openings in chess. The variations are still 'unclear' in many lines - despite all the software available nowadays for analysis. It is a particularly dangerous weapon in over-the-board tournament games; provided Black is prepared to specialize in its use. I've included the game here so that I can link to it in my blog.
 [ Q b7 ] , [ R a b8 ]  Now I played the combination without seeing [ R g8 ] is defended. What a shame!
 [ Q h7 + ]  [ K f6 ] , [ f5 ]  ! White opens up files for his rook and bishop.
 [ B c4 ] , [ B c5 ]  Lange plants his own Bishop on [ B4 ] in response to Kohtz's Giuoco Piano.
 [ N x d5 ]  [ B x d5 ] , [ N d4 ]  so much so for eyeing his [ f5 ] pawn
 [ h x g6 ]  [ h x g6 ]  [ R c h1 ] , [ a3 ]  Ignoring the danger on the other side.
 [ K e7 ]  [ N x f2 ]  [ h5 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ f5 ]  [ B b4 + ]  [ c5 ]  [ N x c5 ]  [ R h6 ] , [ N x d7 + ]  He surrendered at this point. I was a bit worried at parts in the game but I managed to turn it around. Had he continued I think it would've gone Ke7-[ f7 ] Bb4-[ d2 ] Rh6-[ g6 ] Qc8-[ f8 ] for checkmate. Moving the rook in that chain would be non-ideal but it would be logical considering how my opponent plays.
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ e3 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ d x c5 ]  [ e6 ]  [ a3 ]  [ B x c5 ] , [ B d2 ]  I have never palyed this kind play here so let's go and see
 [ N x e5 ] , [ Q g5 ]  The knights are very powerful if I move to [ f6 ] then 21[ N x e5 ] Q[ f6 ] 22 [ N h5 ] [ Q e7 ] 23 [ N g6 ] and I have a problem.
 [ B h6 + ]  [ K e7 ]  [ B x g6 ]  [ f x g6 ] , [ R x g6 ]  26. [ R x g6 ] - at last I have a material advantage but I should have been reading a book by now- also black's position looks rather precarious.
 [ b6 ]  [ g3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ B g2 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B e7 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ d4 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ Q c2 ]  [ N x c3 ] , [ Q x c3 ]  I am reasonably happy with the opening so far.
 [ N f6 ]  [ g3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ B g2 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ d4 ]  [ N b d7 ] , [ Q c2 ]  I felt this to be a nice flexible move since I figured I'd likely be planning to put pressure along the c-file and I also figured black would probably want to fianchetto the LSB. Plus I wasn't 100% sure where I wanted to develop my Queen knight
 [ Q x e7 ] , [ Q e1 ]  This move pins the black Knight and tries to win material.
 [ f4 ]  [ R a7 ]  [ K f6 ] , [ R x a6 ]  Equalizing the material.
 [ f6 ] , [ R x g6 ]  33. [ R x g6 ] - black can now avoid losing his rook by [ f x e5 ] but he will be a piece and a pawn down. My opponent decided this was too much and waved the white flag. A nice ending.
 [ Q x d3 ]  [ R x e3 + ]  [ Q x e3 ] , [ B x e3 ]  And now it is just a matter of time..
 [ N d4 ]  [ N x d4 ] , [ B x d4 ]  please notice that most of the pieces have been traded off the board. Notice how powerful the bishops are. Now notice the little wimpy horse hanging out to dry all by himself!
 [ c5 ]  [ B g2 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ O-O ] , [ B g7 ]  Per the database [ N c6 ] seems like a stronger move for black though this move is the most common response.
 [ B e4 ] , [ R d5 ]  Best option to prevent outright lose the rook at a8.
 [ R d x e1 ]  [ K e7 ]  [ R x e6 + ]  [ K x e6 ] , [ R e1 + ]  While not at all happy about my blunder I did find the endgame interesting.
 [ B f1 ]  [ R e1 ] , [ R x e1 ]  Forced now White played a few more moves out of inertia.
 [ N d7 ]  [ N x d7 ] , [ Q x d7 ]  We each have 2 strong bishops: Mine: [ B2 ] His: D5.
 [ N f6 ]  [ Q e2 ]  [ O-O ] , [ O-O-O ]  Castling exposed my opponent's far left-hand pawn...
 [ Q x e2 ]  [ B x e3 ] , [ f x e3 ]  White has a very strong center and a doublie edged f semi open file.
 [ N d7 ] , [ N g5 ]  White has to carry on the plan : control as much field as possible
 [ c3 ]  [ R c4 ] , [ N c5 ]  I wanted to put my Knight in action and i felt if it gets up there it will be able to start penetrating his defensive ranks and cause trouble. Currently attacking his [ a6 ] pawn as well as [ [ e6 ] ] pawn (he can't take the Knight on [ [ e6 ] ] with the Bishop uncovering his Rd8)
 [ N x d3 ]  [ Q x e5 ] , [ N d x e5 ]  Black has gained a full piece.
 [ Q d2 ] , [ O-O-O ]  he should have taken my knight for two reasons: 1. trading a bad bishop for a knight controlling many squares 2. giving me a double pawn while the other castle is far open
 [ K f7 ] , [ K d7 ]  ...and do the same thing again. If the enemy king moves forwards (f6) I play mine to [ e8 ] if he moves backwards (f8) would I play mine to e6?
 [ f x e5 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N b d7 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ h6 ]  Black does not like the possible pin with Bg5.
 [ R x d8 ]  [ B x d8 ]  [ Q c2 ]  [ B h4 ]  [ Q x b2 ]  [ R e1 ] , [ c5 ]  game over - at the end a lucky punch.
 [ a5 ] , [ K h8 ]  "Pass." I could double the Rooks but that means giving up the open file.
 [ d6 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ N b d7 ]  [ O-O ] , [ O-O ]  We both seem to have reach an initial position in which we are somewhat comfortable. (But having been away from the board for some months I was not really comfortable with any position!)
 [ O-O ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ d4 ]  [ N d6 ]  [ B x c6 ]  [ d x c6 ] , [ d x e5 ]  Knight has two good moves more popular is [ N f5 ] but [ N e4 ] is said "!?" interesing so lets check it out ...
 [ Q x e6 + ]  [ R x e6 ] , [ B x f5 ]  Pinning the R.
 [ c x d4 ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ B e6 ] , [ R e8 ]  Pins the bishop; wins a pawn after 26. Kd2/[ K d1 ] [ R x e6 ] 27. [ K x c2 ] [ R e2 ] followed by 28...Rxg2. 26. [ R h6 ] fails to save the bishop after 26...Kg7.
 [ Q d8 ]  [ B x e6 ]  [ Q f8 ]  [ N x f6 + ]  [ K h8 ] , [ Q x f8 # ]  
 [ R x f4 + ] , [ K e2 ]  I think this is a mistake I was worried about [ K g1 ] for which I could see no effective answer.
 [ R b4 ]  [ B b5 ] , [ N d b8 ]  As any member of my school's chess club's upper echelons will agree (we play weird games) a knight is ideally developed on b8.
 [ K g2 ]  [ Q x g4 + ]  [ f x g4 ]  [ K g5 ]  [ K f3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ h3 ]  [ K f6 ] , [ K e3 ]  Now the position looks dead drawn so with the match already lost I offered the draw. He had one minute left I had 13. I was exhausted and elated at preventing the whitewash (apart from the defaulted bottom board) then slightly disappointed at having missed the win but overall a game that ran the gamut of chess emotion and thoroughly enjoyed. I hope you've enjoyed it too.
 [ K h2 ] , [ K h7 ]  28. ..... [ K h7 ] - Henry gets off the back row to avoid Fou Leblanc getting caught up in a potential pin by a move such as Qb8.
 [ Q x g4 ]  [ N x d4 ] , [ Q d1 ]  Not 9.Bxd4? [ B x d4 ] and black is clearly better due to the bishop pair and in particular the unrestricted DSB. If the white Q stays on [ g4 ] black can play ...d5! anyway due to the discovered attack.
 [ e x d4 ] , [ b4 ]  Defending knight. [ c5 ] is pretty good post here.
 [ N g3 ] , [ d5 ]  It is usually bery risky for White to try the normal Kingside attac against the Zietzef variaton. The center is still far too voltile. I decided to add some complications to slow him down.
 [ Q x b4 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ Q c5 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ Q x e7 ] , [ N e2 + ]  Black is trying hard to work the pawn in and get the queen back.
 [ N a6 + ]  [ K d7 ] , [ R c7 + ]  That's it
 [ R x f4 ] , [ g x f4 ]  This makes me some damage disrupting the kingside's pawn. Now if black gets to overcome his own pawn's chain he will crush my exposed king.
 [ Q a8 + ]  [ K b6 ]  [ Q b8 + ]  [ K c6 ]  [ Q x b3 ]  [ K x c7 ]  [ Q d5 ]  [ g5 ]  [ Q e6 ]  [ g4 ]  [ Q x f6 ]  [ g3 ]  [ Q g5 ]  [ g2 ]  [ Q x g2 ]  [ K d6 ]  [ Q g5 ]  [ K e6 ]  [ K e3 ]  [ K f7 ]  [ Q g7 + ] , [ K e6 ]  and right here i stopped notation... but it ends up a draw and i remember the spot so i'll try to get there
 [ b6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ K b7 ]  Black is moving his King to safety.
 [ Q g4 ] , [ Q x e5 + ]  If black had went [ d4 ] instead of [ d5 ] this would not be an option for white.
 [ B e6 ] , [ h5 ]  pushing further for attack
 [ f x e4 ]  [ d x e4 ] , [ d5 ]  My reason for not being too afraid of this break/check line on the d-file is my confidence in Black's ability to force simplification into a favorable pawn endgame utilizing the [ e4 ] strong point theme in the form of protected passed pawn. after ...Ke7.
 [ Q c8 ]  [ a3 ]  [ a6 ] , [ B a2 ]  10. [ B a2 ] - wanting to keep Fou Leblanc on the a1-[ g8 ] diagonal.
 [ B c4 ] , [ B e6 ]  Attackung the knight
 [ B e3 ] , [ O-O ]  Your kingside is hemmed in. White already has a major advantage in space activity and development.
 [ K e2 ] , [ B b4 ]  !? - A wrong turning. This leads nowhere.
 [ a5 ] , [ Q x d1 + ]  Check.
 [ N x e5 ] , [ Q x e5 + ]  Exchange of knights complete
 [ O-O-O ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ B x d5 ] , [ Q f6 ]  a strong shot deciding the game
 [ d x c4 ]  [ B g5 ] , [ b5 ]  Now I have an extra pawn and protected very well
 [ K c7 ]  [ g7 ] , [ B e6 ]  The g8-square is now well guarded against an intruder. What else can White try?
 [ K f5 ] , [ B a1 ]  83...[ B x g7 ] is still unplayable after 84. Kg5! and Black cannot prevent the White King from making it to the [ g6 ] square.
 [ Q x g2 ] , [ B f3 ]  Nice recovery for white.
 [ a5 ] , [ N d5 ]  This accomplishes two things. It allows Black the option of exchanging on [ e3 ] and it covers Bb6.
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ a6 ]  [ B a4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ O-O ] , [ B e7 ]  5. ......... [ B e7 ] - a conservative developing move clearing the way for kingside castling. This is the start of the Leonhardt Variation.
 [ N f d7 ]  [ B x e7 ]  [ Q x e7 ] , [ f4 ]  7. [ f4 ] - maintaining strong pawn centre.
 [ B f4 ] , [ B f8 ]  Forcing the white bishop back into a position where it is in danger of running out of room.
 [ Q x c5 ]  [ O-O-O ]  [ a4 ]  [ d4 ]  [ Q b6 ]  [ d5 ]  [ a3 ]  [ b x a3 ]  [ Q e3 + ]  [ K c2 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ B f5 + ]  [ K b2 ]  [ Q e6 ]  [ Q e1 ]  [ Q c6 ] , [ N e7 + ]  I couldn't believe my luck here...
 [ Q x c1 + ] , [ K f2 ]  White's king is opened up to attacks from black.
 [ Q e7 ]  [ a4 ]  [ a6 ] , [ B c4 ]  this move i think is actually bad it is too easy to defend [ f7 ] at the moment and it now takes the bishop two moves to get to a useful square rather than one. an imediate [ B d3 ] would have been more sound (giving the knight the option of e4)
 [ e6 ] , [ Q d2 ]  Computer prefers [ Q d3 ] still. It thinks the position is even.
 [ Q a7 ]  [ B x g7 ] , [ K x g7 ]  The King-hunt begins. Thomas can do little to stop it.
 [ c x d5 ] , [ e x d5 ]  I've accepted an isolated queen pawn position because I have made a surface study of Tarrasch-style positions.
 [ B g7 ] , [ N e5 ]  I fianchetto to be able to castle. White takes advantage of my momentary crampness and threatens my beautiful bishop pair. However in a position such as this with such long pawn chains knights might be better than bishops.
 [ R x f7 + ]  [ K x f7 ] , [ Q e6 + ]  in order to avoid losing queen to rook [ f5 ] I did not go to [ f8 ] but rather [ g7 ]  [ K g7 ]  [ Q x f5 ] , [ Q x h2 + ]  At this point I realize I have won the game.
 [ B g4 ]  [ N g3 + ]  [ K g1 ]  [ N x f1 ]  [ K x f1 ]  [ B x g4 ]  [ h x g4 ] , [ R x g4 ]  Now Black is ahead two pawns and winning the game again.
 [ g3 ]  [ d5 ] , [ B g2 ]  white and I follow book for the next several moves
 [ d6 ] , [ f3 ]  As usual I play the Sämisch Variation named after Friedrich Sämisch who developed the system in the 1920s. This often leads to very sharp play with the players castling on opposite wings and attacking each other's kings.
 [ O-O ]  [ N c6 ] , [ N b3 ]  The black pawn will eventually fall
 [ K d2 ]  [ R h2 + ]  [ K e3 ]  [ b6 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ c x d5 ] , [ N x d5 ]  And after the little pawn flurry I end up one ahead but his bishop is no longer blocked in.
 [ f4 ] , [ B d6 ]  Already we can see the problems caused by 3...c6: 1. The e-pawn can no longer be protected by playing ...Nc6. 2. If you play the natural ...[ d6 ] the bishop on [ f8 ] is blocked in. The move you have selected means that the other bishop is now blocked in and more time-consuming pawn moves will be required to free it. On the plus side you are threatening to win a pawn.
 [ g3 ]  [ Q f6 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ Q d6 ]  [ N x b4 ]  [ Q x b4 ]  [ b3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ B g2 ]  [ c6 ]  [ N e2 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B g4 ]  [ h3 ]  [ B f5 ] , [ e4 ]  Not the best move as I'm losing a pawn and bishop in the exchange
 [ N c6 ] , [ B e3 ]  This strenghtens my influence over the weak [ b3 ] square.
 [ h3 ] , [ B x f3 ]  [ B e6 ] followed by [ Q d2 ] is a more typical response.
 [ e x f5 ]  [ B x f5 ]  [ B x f5 ]  [ R x f5 ] , [ O-O ]  Unless Black manages to create some nice threats on the king-side White will enjoy good positional advantage due to the white squares weaknesses c6-d5-[ e6 ] and [ b5 ] and [ d6 ] weak pawns.
 [ e x d4 ]  [ Q x d4 ] , [ R e8 ]  Now White's center crumbles.
 [ Q x f4 ] , [ R c7 c8 ]  And now it's over but there was nothing white could do anyway.
 [ K d7 ]  [ N c5 + ]  [ K d8 ] , [ B c7 + ]  ...and he loses his Q. A short miniature.
 [ N d7 ] , [ Q d3 ]  Moving queen into play.
 [ R d2 ] , [ h4 ]  Sob my N has to leave. But the doubled pawn that will result from this will help me a bit.
 [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ N f3 ]  A lot of the time your board will look like this
 [ c6 ]  [ N g e2 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B d6 ] , [ N g3 ]  This takes us out of the gameknot database. Which only gives 8. [ d4 ] though I am sure that move is to come
 [ B x e4 ]  [ R x c8 ]  [ R x c8 ]  [ R c1 ]  [ R x c1 + ]  [ B x c1 ]  [ Q b7 ]  [ B b2 ]  [ B f6 ]  [ h3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ g4 ]  [ h6 ]  [ Q f2 ]  [ Q d5 ]  [ h4 ] , [ B d3 ]  ?! -- ...I still don't know what this move was supposed to do.
 [ B x c6 + ]  [ b x c6 ]  [ N x d4 ] , [ B b7 ]  She made this move to form a "Fianchetto" with her dominant bishop.
 [ B c6 ]  [ R b8 ]  [ R c x b8 ] , [ a x b8 = Q + ]  Black has seen the trap and gives up.. I really love this game; it shows how important it is to develop pieces and about gaining (and holding) control about open lines with your rooks.. Thanks b767-300er for the nice game.. I hope you people enjoyed this annotation ! Feedback is welcome ! :)
 [ N f3 ] , [ b6 ]  And again poor move from black. Should've probably played [ Q b2 ] after 20.[ B d3 ] [ a4 ] 21.[ K e2 ] [ a3 ] 22.[ N d2 ] [ a2 ]  [ g5 ]  [ f x g5 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ B a6 ] , [ R x g5 ]  22.[ B d1 ] was much better after 22...[ Q b2 ] 23.[ e4 ] [ a4 ] 24.[ e x d5 ] [ a3 ] 25.[ d x c6 ] [ a2 ] 26.[ B e2 ] [ B x e2 ] 27.[ K x e2 ] [ Q x c3 ] 28.[ R a1 ] [ Q x [ f3 ] + ] 29.[ K d2 ] [ Q x c6 ] 30.[ f3 ] Qxf3.
 [ N e5 ] , [ f4 ]  the fatal blow...
 [ O-O ]  [ B d6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ O-O ]  [ d3 ] , [ Q c7 ]  Putting pressure on the b8-[ h2 ] diagonal.
 [ B f5 ]  [ B a3 ] , [ e6 ]  Maybe 9 .. [ Q a5 ] was a better move the castle is lost now
 [ R a d8 ]  [ Q e2 ] , [ N d7 ]  Both sides are improving their pieces' position and Black still looks a bit better but I wasn't sure what to do. So I played this very useful multi-purpose move which achieves 3 useful things: 1) The knight is moving towards [ c5 ] where it will put pressure on white's light-squared bishop and target White's b3-pawn; 2) It unblocks Black's dark-squared bishop which can start to put pressure on the long diagonal; 3) It allows Black to play f7-[ f5 ] which will gain more space in the centre and kingside (a typical plan in the KID) as well as preventing White's knight from landing on the strong e4-square.
 [ R d e1 ] , [ R a d8 ]  and now my structure remains intact.
 [ Q x f5 ] , [ R x f5 ]  Loss of the queen prevents the checkmate but white will get back the material advantage as well as the positional one he already dominates.
 [ d7 ] , [ Q a5 + ]  ...which is exactly what happens.
 [ h x g6 ]  [ Q f6 ] , [ Q x h7 # ]  
 [ e6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ] , [ e x d5 ]  3. ..... [ e x d5 ] - this pawn trade gives this the Exchange Variation of the French Defense.
 [ f7 ]  [ K x f7 ]  [ K e5 ]  [ K e8 ] , [ K d6 ]  If the bishop wasn't on [ [ c6 ] ] white would have to give up the pawn for it or allow the black king to get to [ d7 ] with a draw in either case. With the bishop on [ [ c6 ] ] white wins.
 [ B e2 ]  [ B b4 + ]  [ B d2 ]  [ B x d2 + ] , [ Q x d2 ]  12. [ Q x d2 ] - bishop trade. I now develop my king knight to [ e7 ] and prepare for castling.
 [ h x g5 ] , [ N x g5 ]  
 [ K g7 ] , [ B x f5 ]  Despite no immediate mate I like this move a lot. As Joann is bringing in another piece into the attack.
 [ B e3 ]  [ b5 ] , [ g4 ]  11. [ d4 ] is objectively better as White comes out with more center control although Black's position is without weaknesses. As a rule a move like [ g4 ] in this position needs to be prepared a little better with moves like [ Q d2 ] and [ h3 ] completeing development and preparing to open the h-file if Black plays [ f5 ] and fg.
 [ N f4 ]  [ N d7 ] , [ R b3 ]  Now White has defended himself successfully and Black can resign. I will not do much more notes for the next moves.
 [ c4 ] , [ g6 ]  {Lagrave Nakamura - 51%} (1...[ e6 ] {Polgar - 49%}) The vote sends us into the King's Indian: fianchetto Uhlmann (Szabo) variation (ECO E62).
 [ R g1 ] , [ b5 ]  Danger eleminated at least temporary.
 [ Q e3 ]  [ N e6 ] , [ Q c3 ]  Attacking the [ e5 ] pawn now.
 [ f6 ] , [ e x f6 ]  but even a better move would not have saved the game Alternative variation: 20... [ R x c3 ] 21. [ Q x c3 ] [ Q x c3 ] 22. [ b x c3 ] [ e x f6 ] 23. [ R x d6 ] [ f x g5 ] 24. [ R x a6 ] [ R e8 ] $18
 [ B d6 ] , [ Q d2 ]  Part of the reason for my early bishop development was to allow me to castle either side depending on what's tactically better given the circumstances. This also puts the queen on an open diagonal and allows a lot more movement
 [ N c6 ] , [ N f3 ]  Like the Italian game for instance.
 [ Q c2 ] , [ B g4 ]  seeking to exchange a critical knight in whites plans.
 [ Q d5 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ f6 ] , [ R a c1 ]  room for more complications...
 [ N b d2 ]  [ h6 ]  [ B e3 ] , [ N g4 ]  His bishop is trapped unless he can spring an unseen trap
 [ f5 ] , [ K f2 ]  Time to activate...
 [ a5 ]  [ K f3 ]  [ a x b4 ] , [ a x b4 ]  After I made the exchange thinking it was safe I realized a sequence which could have caused me potentially serious problems in my rear - 37. [ a x b4 ] [ R a7 ] 38. [ R f c2 ] Ra3.
 [ Q f5 ] , [ Q b4 ]  In oder to prevent ...[ Q h3 ] White had to attack the f4-knight somehow. Geller prefers to do it in an indirect way (31... Qh3? 32.[ N f6 ] ). The other possibility is 31.[ Q d2 ] when after 31... Rc4! the threat of ...[ R x e4 ] is decisive; for instance 32.[ Q e3 ] (32.[ B x d3 ] [ R d8 ] 33.[ R e3 ] leads to familiar motifs after 33... [ R x e4 ] 34.[ f x e4 ] [ Q g5 ] 35.[ R g3 ] [ N h3 ] ! winning the queen while 32.[ R e2 ] blocks the c1-[ h6 ] diagonal allowing 32... [ Q h3 ] followed by mate) 32... [ R x e4 ] 33.[ f x e4 ] [ Q g4 ] 34.[ Q g3 ] d2! 35.[ B c2 ] [ d x e1 = Q ] 36.[ R x e1 ] [ N e2 ] winning even more material.
 [ e5 ] , [ B b5 + ]  Black looked to be heading for the Dragon then diverted with 6. e5. I leave my knight en prise to develop my bishop with check preparing to castle.
 [ Q x b2 + ] , [ K e3 ]  Forced. If [ Q c3 ] were possible mate would follow so...
 [ Q d1 + ] , [ Q e1 ]  to 38 [ K h2 ] I had plannedf 38 ... [ R e8 ] 39 [ Q h5 ] [ Q d6 + ] forcing the queening of the pawn
 [ K x f7 ]  [ R f1 + ]  [ K g7 ]  [ R x f8 ]  [ K x f8 ] , [ b8 = Q + ]  
 [ R e2 ] , [ g6 ]  25 [ B f5 ] was a threat.
 [ N c3 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ B d3 ] , [ b5 ]  This will push the cavalry back expand my presence on the Queenside and make the options for a future [ [ c4 ] ] or Bb7. The only irritation is he can play 14. [ N e5 ] but I might answer that with ...[ N d7 ] [14. [ N e5 ] [ [ c4 ] ] 15. [ B c2 ] [ B b7 ] 16. O-O].
 [ K x f6 ] , [ h4 ]  Ok I have no mate now... but the BK is on a CORNER so there are two mates easily threatened...
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B c4 ] , [ N f6 ]  Normal opening...
 [ B g3 ] , [ N e6 ]  now the [ g3 ] bishop is kind of stupid. it is really useless. black only needs to find a solution for the [ c8 ] bishop.
 [ Q c2 ] , [ R a c8 ]  Making a claim on the open file.
 [ b x c6 ] , [ Q d4 ]  Not the best position for the queen [ B e3 ] is probably better!?
 [ B g5 ] , [ B e7 ]  Backing up blacks knight. Now the knight is attacked twice and defended 3 times.
 [ N d3 + ] , [ K g3 ]  Surprised me he didn't move [ K e2 ] but I'll take it.
 [ g5 ] , [ f3 ]  trying to blockade the king side.
 [ B x b2 ]  [ R x b2 ]  [ R x a3 ] , [ K d2 ]  white have strong centre with bishops pare however black have free pawn and the question is does black mannaged to keep his matirial advantage?!
 [ R c8 ] , [ N d b5 ]  This just loses a pawn.
 [ d4 ]  [ g6 ] , [ f3 ]  My preferred move for White.
 [ f6 ] , [ d4 ]  very inaccurate...
 [ B e3 ] , [ O-O ]  Now the center is the next objective
 [ N b3 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N f6 ]  [ f4 ]  [ d6 ] , [ a4 ]  Prevents [ b5 ] and gives white the option of harrassing the queen which I had decided to play from here.
 [ c x d6 + ] , [ K c8 ]  Kc8...I don't know if I would make !! or ??.....Maybe just a Kc8!?
 [ B h4 + ] , [ g3 ]  This opens the diagonal to the Rh1.
 [ Q a7 ] , [ B x f6 ]  Black left his rook hanging. I'm not sure why because now the knight on [ e7 ] will fall too.
 [ Q e7 ] , [ N e2 ]  Stopping revealed check & losing Queen.
 [ Q e4 ] , [ N b4 ]  The knight moves towards the tempting [ c2 ] square where it can fork the king and rook. Unfortunately there is a queen protecting that spot so I shall have to move the bishop out of the way of my own queen first.
 [ d x e5 ]  [ Q x e5 + ] , [ K a8 ]  If 25. ...[ R d6 ] then 26. [ Q x d6 ] [ Q x d6 ] 27. [ N x d6 ] leaving white a piece up. If 25. ...[ K c8 ] then there is the very aesthetic 26. Na7#. [ N c7 + ] will most likely lead to a draw as the black king can shuffle between [ a6 ] [ a7 ] and [ a8 ] while the rooks and queen counterattack. With that in mind white is able to force a win in this position. Can you find it?
 [ R h1 ] , [ K e7 ]  Worse than worse.
 [ b7 ] , [ K c7 ]  The Black King has almost caught the pawn!
 [ B x g2 ]  [ K x g2 ]  [ B f6 ]  [ c3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ e4 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ B x h6 ]  [ N e7 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ Q d5 ]  [ f3 ]  [ e x f3 + ]  [ R x f3 ]  [ N g6 ]  [ h4 ]  [ Q b3 ]  [ B c1 ]  [ Q c2 + ]  [ K h3 ]  [ R a d8 ]  [ R f1 ]  [ e5 ]  [ h5 ] , [ N e7 ]  And here by the treath to [ N g6 ] did opponent missed that [ B f6 ] went unguarded by N:s moving
 [ Q f7 ] , [ N x f6 ]  Best move I think
 [ N e4 ]  [ B b6 ] , [ N d6 + ]  White sacs the knight... does it work?
 [ N x e5 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ B x e5 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ O-O-O ]  [ Q a5 ] , [ a3 ]  oh dear... bu what else?
 [ Q g5 ] , [ Q f3 + ]  (!) Hoping for 22...[ B f7 ] 23.d6! or better yet 22...Kg8?? 23.[ d6 + ] and a quick mate. Even 22...[ K e7 ] 23.[ Q g3 ] looked promising. Will Black oblige?
 [ B b4 ]  [ B x e6 ]  [ B x c3 ]  [ b x c3 ] , [ N x e4 ]  This move gets a ? - it allows both my rooks to immediately dive into heaven on the 7th rank hence the annotation title.
 [ Q h5 + ] , [ K g2 ]  To continue a little bit [ K g3 ] was necessary. Now it is clearly over.
 [ O-O ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N e2 ]  [ Q e7 ]  [ a3 ]  [ R a e8 ]  [ R a d1 ]  [ R f5 ]  [ f4 ]  [ R e f8 ]  [ b4 ]  [ Q f7 ]  [ Q d3 ] , [ N x e5 ]  Hits the Q and the [ f4 ] pawn is pinned.
 [ Q d7 ]  [ R f e1 ]  [ a4 ]  [ a3 ] , [ R f b8 ]  16. .......... [ R f b8 ] (suddenly it looks as if he wants to attack down the b file with his rook which he does eventually with disastrous results). Wayne said that on the previous move I should have moved my pawn to [ b3 ] to prevent 15. a4.
 [ O-O ] , [ N h4 ]  The obvious Kingside castle gives white an extra developmental move as middle-game gets into it's stride.
 [ N c5 ] , [ a5 ]  (?) Premature. For the moment the pawns can't move. Better might have been a move like 24.[ R d1 ] placing this rook on a more useful square - more useful as it's at the base of a half-open file and aims at the weak backward pawn at d6.
 [ K x f2 ] , [ g4 ]  I'll recover the piece for sure and white is not castled! And now [ d4 ] will become vulnerable.
 [ d x e6 ]  [ R a c1 ] , [ Q c7 ]  two on [ [ c4 ] ] and three on [ c3 ] if [ [ c4 ] ] goes back...
 [ a5 ] , [ a3 ]  ...and another one on the [ b4 ] square.
 [ N f6 ]  [ N f2 ] , [ h5 ]  Black's attack really starts to play itself here but it won't break through immediately if White just holds tight. Black will have to play [ K f7 ] [ R h8 ] and bring his major pieces to the g-file and h-file. White almost had enough time to run his king back to the Q-side.
 [ R x f7 ]  [ R x g7 ] , [ K x g7 ]  My other rook is not trapped as his.
 [ e4 ] , [ O-O ]  I am very restricted al round here..havent made the best job of my opening development. Bishop on C8 has no move...not very good from me so far..
 [ Q d6 ] , [ d4 ]  4. d4. Gaining space/control in the center and clearing a path for my dark squared bishop. Other reasonable options would be 4. [ N f3 ] (developing and controlling the center 1 move closer to kingside castle) and 4. [ B c4 ] (for the same reasons as Nf3)
 [ N d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ B x d4 ] , [ b6 ]  I was getting ready for [ c5 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ e x d3 ]  [ Q x d3 ]  [ d x c4 ] , [ b x c4 ]  Now the bishop is trapped.
 [ a x b5 ] , [ R f c1 ]  taking control of the second open file.
 [ Q b7 ] , [ B d4 ]  I pin the knight to the DSB and the rook
 [ N c6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ] , [ d5 ]  There was no right move here my two pawns are screwed but this move was particularly bad giving me the minus one disadvantage right off the bat.
 [ R f7 + ]  [ K d6 ] , [ Q x d7 # ]  nice little mate but look at the rook and knight in the corner doing nothing on their original square
 [ B e6 ]  [ R a d1 ]  [ R a d8 ] , [ Q e4 ]  Threatening mate ...
 [ e5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B b4 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ B x c3 ]  Wasn't expecting him to do this I have to double up the pawns but I'm ahead in development.
 [ B x h6 ]  [ Q x h6 ] , [ Q g7 ]  Hoping to trade queens and end the attack.
 [ K f7 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ Q f4 + ] , [ Q f6 ]  Who needs queen with advanced pawn! - Oh I forgot the white needs his queen in order to defend the promotion.
 [ B e7 ]  [ a4 ]  [ B d7 ] , [ b3 ]  [ b3 ] again another pointless move.
 [ B c4 ] , [ N c6 ]  Hmmm one reference of mine calls white's second move 2. [ B c4 ] the Bowlder Attack and another one calls it the Philidor Variation. Neither reference says much about it. At this point black is already winging it maybe getting some advice from the GK game Database. 2. ... [ N c6 ] seems reasonable since it denies white the [ d4 ] space. Any commentators care to chime in on the opening?
 [ N x e5 ] , [ N g f6 ]  Finally he is able to bring his other knight into the game.
 [ N f2 ] , [ h4 ]  ! maybe the best move I played in the game
 [ b x c4 ]  [ b6 ] , [ N d4 ]  I think Jkarp forgot that his king is still in the centre. Or he was thinking of playing [ N b4 ] defending the bishop and attack my queen.
 [ B x b5 ]  [ a x b5 ] , [ N x b5 ]  now here you will notice I am threatening to take his bishop as well as seeing a future fork on the rook and king.
 [ R g2 ] , [ R f3 ]  White moves [ g1 ] rook to [ g2 ] and I move my [ f8 ] rook to [ f3 ] attacking the DB at f2. My LB is protecting my rook at f3.
 [ h3 ] , [ N g6 ]  Striking at [ e5 ] but losing control of d5. Now it's actually favorable for White to snap on [ d5 ] creating a mobile pawn center.
 [ R a5 ]  [ R b3 + ] , [ K a6 ]  Now the pawn promotes and I win
 [ d x e4 ]  [ N g3 ] , [ f5 ]  black has a big problem. on the queen-side he is exposed in the white squares with no white squares bishop. in the center all his pawns are on the white squares with no real defense.
 [ d4 ] , [ d5 ]  Follows Fischer VS Petrosian for about six moves.
 [ b5 ]  [ B b3 ]  [ a5 ]  [ a4 ]  [ b4 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ e6 ]  [ Q f3 ]  [ f6 ]  [ N d3 ]  [ h5 ]  [ c3 ]  [ b x c3 ]  [ d x c3 ]  [ g5 ]  [ e5 ]  [ f5 ]  [ N d2 ]  [ g4 ]  [ Q e3 ]  [ B h6 ]  [ Q c5 ]  [ N a6 ]  [ Q d4 ] , [ d5 ]  And thats the move where it all goes wrong for my opponent. I'm not convinced with his pawn moves. His piece development seems very outward rather than focusing on the middle 16. And he's just offered an opportunity to tie him in knots.
 [ N f7 ] , [ a4 ]  I saw nothing better and this provided more Q side space.
 [ R e1 ] , [ d2 ]  50. ....... [ d2 ] - will my passer reach Glendadom? Read on.
 [ N d4 ]  [ Q d1 ]  [ R f d8 ]  [ N d3 ] , [ R d7 ]  21...[ R d7 ] new plan.
 [ R f5 ]  [ R d3 ]  [ R c8 ] , [ B a5 ]  If [ e5 ] I cannot answer [ d5 ] because of [ e4 ] forking with a check threat.
 [ h6 ]  [ Q f3 + ]  [ K g8 ] , [ B f4 ]  Screwing with his queen again...plus of course holding all of the claim to the [ e5 ] square
 [ a x b6 ]  [ e ]  [ p ]  [ Q x b6 ] , [ N a3 ]  ?? Big mistake--subtle as usual. Black can pick up the DSB for free now with 29...Qd8! where White can't spare time to defend his Bishop on [ d2 ] because of the threat of ...[ Q g5 + ] [ K h1 ] Qg2#.
 [ R a c1 ] , [ Q x e4 ]  Gets another pawn whilst still preventing the capture
 [ R x d1 + ] , [ R x d1 ]  But Black has just lost his lead... hasn't he?
 [ N e7 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ N g6 ] , [ R g3 ]  21. [ R g3 ] - my rook bores down to [ g7 ] x-ray style.
 [ h3 ] , [ Q h4 ]  Black decides to keep his Queen in an attacking position but he doesn't really have much.
 [ N x d4 ] , [ N x d4 ]  Allows the centralization of white's queen.
 [ N x c5 ] , [ b4 ]  10. [ Q c2 ] also prevents the knight from infiltrating at [ e4 ] on this move. I have to wonder if white saw all this when playing his 10th?
 [ Q g6 ] , [ R x a7 ]  So up four pawns instead of three. All white needs to do now is weather the upcoming black storm on white's castle.
 [ Q g6 ] , [ R e1 ]  Ready to trade Queen's if Black played Pawn-f4.
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ a6 ]  The sicilian najdorf
 [ N x d4 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ h6 ]  Black's idea is clear: he wants the annoying Bishop to go away. Now I have serious doubts where to retreat: [ [ h4 ] ] [ f4 ] or e3? During the game I had a feeling the Bishop on [ [ h4 ] ] would be more active and Black's pawn advance would only weaken square f5. It looks like I underestimated the importance of grabbing more territory. Fritz says however better would be simple 11.[ B e3 ] [ N f6 ] 12.Rad1.
 [ b6 ]  [ N b d2 ]  [ N e7 ] , [ d4 ]  13. [ d4 ] - a pawn break - will this be to my advantage? I analyse it and it looked good at the end so I decided to go for it.
 [ N c5 ] , [ N d4 ]  Centralizing my knight as well.
 [ f4 ]  [ N c5 ]  [ R c4 ]  [ N d3 ]  [ R b1 ]  [ N x b2 ] , [ R x b2 ]  25. [ R x b2 ] - mission accomplished - all minor pieces now swapped off. But a double rook ending could be very tricky.
 [ a4 ]  [ B a2 ]  [ R a5 ]  [ f4 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ O-O ] , [ R b5 ]  This is a blunder. White can win with f5!
 [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ a6 ] , [ B g5 ]  After the Open Variation is complete this is what I decide. Like my misstep against blitzkov I decide to play a line just like the Ruy Lopez. Even though it's nothing or can ever be anything like the Ruy Lopez ION in a different annotation stated "I think I can see where jkarp is coming from. He was intent upon the 1.[ e4 ] 2.[ N f3 ] 3.[ B b5 ] sequence almost regardless of what Black played." That is absolutely the case. The idea being is to experiment by playing the same type of variations that you would see in completely different openings and defenses. Afterall the same expert ionadowman added this statement "Back in schoolboy days I liked the Queen's Gambit openings in which I would play 1.[ d4 ] 2.c4. 3.[ N c3 ] 4.[ N f3 ] 5.Bg5. Then I encountered people playing the King's Indian (1...Nf6) and had no idea what to do against it. So I simply played the 5 move sequence I knew. It turned out to be a perfectly playable approach: I won quite a few games playing that" For me this is completely different and out of the ordinary making it an anomaly because I have never played this against my coach after the open variation.
 [ d3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ e4 ] , [ B d7 ]  at last black makes a different move from white.
 [ K h2 ] , [ N g6 ]  His knight threatens my noble queen!
 [ N b6 ]  [ d4 ] , [ d6 ]  A common move in Alekhine's Defence challenging White's advanced e-pawn.
 [ B x f6 ]  [ Q x f6 ]  [ O-O ] , [ Q g6 ]  12.. Qg6. This is very slow play as black is planning on 13. ..[ d6 ] 14. .. [ B [ g3 ] ] trying to pin the pawn on [ g2 ] to my king. But it is an easily preventable attack with [ g3 ] stopping it effectively. So i proceed with attacking the king side.
 [ N c4 ]  [ N x c4 ]  [ b x c4 ] , [ R f2 ]  Partly to take on [ c4 ] without allowing [ B b5 ] partly with an eye on opening the g-file. partly wondering if RR&Q on the f-file will be the way to break through.
 [ R b8 ]  [ N x e6 ] , [ B x e6 ]  Thinking that I just won back a piece I took. I forgot that my B was half pinned to my R and by playing this Nathan now gets ahead.
 [ Q b1 ] , [ Q b7 ]  Can I take the knight the next move? QxN [ Q x b6 + ] and if a[ x Q b6 ] R[ x Q a8 ] so... yes but I must know what will happen next.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ h3 ] , [ Q c7 ]  13... [ Q c7 ] I feel a weakness on white's queen side and I am trying to position myself so I can find it and tear it open. [ R e8 ] was a possibility but it felt like I'd be playing for a draw in that position. I don't want to draw. I want to win! Let's make things happen!
 [ Q d5 ]  [ f4 ]  [ Q x b5 ] , [ Q x h5 ]  here actually i wanted to play [ N e5 ] to Nd7...but i did not have support to my horse..again changed my mind and went to attack opponents queen
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B c4 ] , [ h6 ]  I'm not sure I like this move. It doesn't seem to accomplish much except keep my DSB off [ g5 ]  [ d3 ]  [ d6 ] , [ d4 ]  I know this wasn't a great move. I probably should have moved it to [ d4 ] in the first place.
 [ B d6 ] , [ N c3 ]  Both knights out.
 [ B x e4 ]  [ e x d6 ] , [ B x d6 ]  The Black Bishops are beginning to look truly powerful.
 [ B d2 ]  [ R e g1 + ]  [ K h4 ]  [ g5 + ] , [ f x g5 ]  if 27. [ K x g5 ] be7ch and white is still in big trouble.
 [ R f7 + ] , [ B d7 ]  This however is where the fun begins as Joe is going to sac his Rook for Bishop.
 [ B d3 ]  [ d x c4 ]  [ B x c4 ]  [ b5 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ a6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ c5 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ B b7 ] , [ N x f6 + ]  Everything up to this point was my opening preparation for this opponent.
 [ c x d5 ]  [ c x d5 ] , [ d4 ]  An interesting position. I have three options here. 6...[ N x e4 ] 7. [ f x e4 ] [ d x e4 ] leaves me behind slightly in material but with a passed pawn. However at this stage of the game a passed pawn isn't worth too much. 6...[ e x d4 ] 7.[ Q x d4 ] is bad I have an isolated d pawn I can't support. If I take [ d x e4 ] then after 8.[ Q x d8 ] [ K x d8 ] I've lost the right to castle and have a bad king position. If I play 6..[ d x e4 ] then it gets interesting. If 7. [ f x e4 ] [ N x e4 ] then I'm up a pawn and have a knight trained on [ f2 ] and after playing [ Q f6 ] or [ Q h4 ] I have a mating threat. On the other hand if he plays 7.dxe5...
 [ N h2 ]  [ R a d8 ]  [ N g4 ]  [ Q e7 ] , [ e5 ]  So this begins a combination to get the knight on to the [ [ e5 ] ] square. Once there with no pawns to attack it he would be a stronghold for the rest of the game. You had no DSB to try to trade off and your knight has no easy way to attack e5. Your knight is forced back to [ d7 ] to defend f6. If instead you play [ f5 ] then [ N f6 ] wins the exchange. After 24. [ [ e5 ] ] N[ d7 ] 25. [ Q h6 + ] [ K g8 ] 26. [ e x f6 ] [ N x f6 ] 27. N[ [ e5 ] ] the knight has entered your private space and he'll refuse to leave.
 [ R h8 ]  [ K g3 ]  [ K e7 ] , [ R e1 ]  White will lose his R for my pawn.
 [ O-O ]  [ R b5 ]  [ b3 ]  [ R a8 ]  [ a4 ] , [ R b6 ]  Now it follows a headache for me. [ R a2 ] in order to prepare the advance of the a pawn or g2-[ g4 ] in order to get out the knight from [ f6 ] and let me get in in [ d7 ] (but it is not clear) or [ c4 ] trying to block the doubled black pawns but losing a very good square for my both knights... ????
 [ K e1 ]  [ K f8 ] , [ K d2 ]  Or even the winning 21. [ N c4 ] blocking black's bishop
 [ e x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ] , [ N x d5 ]  Another good move was 18. [ f5 ] with a complicated position.
 [ d x e5 ]  [ N h7 ]  [ g4 ]  [ N g5 ]  [ Q e2 ] , [ b6 ]  Now that I gained a tempo I start progressing with my own attack on the queenside.
 [ h6 ] , [ B f4 ]  Then again [ h6 ] does become the scene of a later sacrifice!
 [ R x g5 ]  [ c4 ]  [ N e5 ] , [ R f2 ]  Black's close-order march is leaving no opening for White to attack.
 [ Q c7 ]  [ N b d2 ] , [ N d7 ]  White bottles up his Queen a natural supporting piece to the push to [ [ d4 ] ] behind the QN which had no other square to develop to and in the process also blocks his QB; so Black moves to make the push to [ [ d4 ] ] even less appealing. The right move was 9. [ B e3 ] continuing to put pressure on the square.
 [ e x f4 ]  [ R f1 ] , [ R x d3 + ]  That pretty little bishop was making [ K e2 ] a much more viable defence.
 [ R h e1 + ]  [ N e6 ]  [ Q x a8 + ]  [ K e7 ]  [ Q x d5 ]  [ R d8 ]  [ Q d6 + ]  [ K e8 ]  [ R x e6 + ]  [ B x e6 ] , [ Q x e6 + ]  Black resigned. thanks for reading please comment
 [ B x d6 ]  [ Q x d6 ]  [ R c2 ]  [ R c8 ] , [ R f c1 ]  Miss L. loads up on the open file.
 [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ] , [ B e7 ]  good move black developme his DSB corectly the idea of 9...[ g6 ] and bishop [ g7 ] is less effective because of the weakness of [ d6 ] pawn .
 [ B x c3 ]  [ B x c3 ]  [ R f c1 ] , [ N d4 ]  White's rook on [ c1 ] threatens black's bishp on [ c3 ] but black is again threatening the royal fork on e2.
 [ R e6 + ]  [ K g7 ] , [ g x f5 ]  50. [ g5 ] hx[ g5 ] 51. hx[ g5 ] [ R d4 ] 52. [ f3 ] is better. The text-move gives Black more control and gives Black better drawing chances.
 [ B d2 ] , [ N f6 ]  I still have control of [ d4 ] now I develop my knight with no worries from pawn to [ e5 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ] , [ h4 ]  His immediate kingside attack is met symetrically.
 [ Q g1 + ]  [ K e2 ]  [ Q h2 + ]  [ K e1 ]  [ Q g1 + ]  [ K e2 ]  [ Q h2 + ] , [ K d1 ]  It was too tempting to go on playing. I'll swap Q and see what will happen.
 [ B d3 ] , [ f5 ]  Shutting up shop unless [ e x f6 ] e.p. is played. Which must be the move otherwise he has no proscpects as black can build up his kingside play with. [ N f7 ] [ R d g1 ]  [ R h g1 ]  [ R d g8 ] , [ h4 ]  Stopping [ g5 ] but I can prepare it
 [ K g3 ]  [ R c4 ]  [ R x h6 ]  [ R c3 + ]  [ K h4 ]  [ R d3 ]  [ R e6 ]  [ K d2 ]  [ g5 ]  [ e1 = Q + ]  [ R x e1 ]  [ K x e1 ]  [ g6 ]  [ R d8 ]  [ K g5 ]  [ K e2 ]  [ g7 ]  [ R g8 ]  [ K g6 ]  [ R x g7 + ] , [ K x g7 ]  Solid play from both sides led to a drawn endgame. However White made an error by gifting me an advance into his half of the board with my king when he played 40. Rh5+?... However I replied with an error of my own on move 54 with 54... [ K e1 ] and gifted a draw to White.
 [ N e2 + ]  [ K h1 ] , [ N f4 ]  I'm not sure the knight is better here than in [ c3 ] but his king is in a tunnel and this can be important if endgame is reached.
 [ h3 ] , [ Q c4 ]  18. ....... [ Q c4 ] - and fearing that Glenda would be trapped I moved her to c5. I then offered a draw and my opponent accepted. In a post match pm Jim Friar had this to say:- "Well done. I preferred your position to his although I didn't like your last move. He can play the check to swap off queens but you have wasted a move by playing qc4....I thought g5...after check then swap queens...then [ h5 ] to open the h file... That must be better for you." Yes I did briefly consider [ g5 ] that would have made [ h6 ] available to Glenda and then she could retreat to the bottom rank if she looked in danger of being trapped. I suppose Vlado may well have exchanged queens to join his two kingside isolanis together. Ah well now that I can count on one hand how many Experts I have drawn against it is time to move up a gear and make my first Expert victory a new goal. Hope you have had a good read everyone. Bye for now. Joanne
 [ d4 ] , [ c6 ]  A mistake. Now I can take the e pawn force a queen trade and take away his castle. The big lesson to learn here is that you and your opponent can both screw up early in the game. Don't make automatic moves in the first few turns. Really study what your opponent is doing and see if you can take advantage. If you can (and it doesn't really cost you development) go on the offensive early.
 [ R a2 + ]  [ R e2 ]  [ R a3 ] , [ g6 ]  Only now do I feel confident that the win is assured. I can safely defend all threats and black is gonna be hard pressed to deal with my passer.
 [ R h7 + ] , [ B e7 ]  again what else? note how the bishop is pinned and it's my go. if i hadn't traded pawns first and just pinned him i lose a tempo. also the diagonal has been cleared for the obvious yet match winning reply to this move...
 [ R c1 ]  [ g x f3 ]  [ g x f3 ]  [ R d c8 ]  [ R a1 ]  [ R c2 ]  [ a3 ]  [ B c3 ]  [ R d1 ] , [ R g8 ]  White submits here. (forced mate in 2) Well done Zendenball ! I have to study the Caro Kann because I early in the game couldn't imagine what to do and plaid a couple of fruitless moves which let black lead a dangerous attack.
 [ Q c6 ]  [ N x e5 ] , [ B x e5 ]  Nearly forced if Black wants to retain hope of surviving in the complications.
 [ h5 ] , [ Q c2 ]  Finally developing.
 [ d6 ]  [ d4 ] , [ B g4 ]  The Wade variation an opening in which my opponent is expert in.
 [ b x c6 ] , [ N c3 ]  White finish his attack in very good position
 [ d4 ] , [ f5 ]  The Dutch! I farely face it and it is always a great think.
 [ N c3 ]  [ g4 ]  [ N h4 ]  [ B h6 ]  [ h3 ]  [ g x h3 ] , [ g x h3 ]  I kind of like [ R x h3 ] personally. White's king side pawn structure is thoroughly demolished either way.
 [ K h8 ]  [ R a4 ]  [ K h7 ]  [ R a8 ]  [ R h1 ]  [ R x a2 ]  [ R x h5 ]  [ f4 ]  [ R h1 ]  [ R a7 + ]  [ K g8 ]  [ K g6 ]  [ K f8 ]  [ f5 ]  [ R h3 ]  [ R a8 + ]  [ K e7 ]  [ f6 + ]  [ K e6 ] , [ R e8 + ]  And black resigns. Keith said afterwards " You certainly did give a good account of yourself in our game. It could easily have been played between 2 GMs or a GM and an IM and were it on ''Chessbomb'' for example there would be very few 'red' moves." Many thanks for reading. Please leave a comment or two and/or rate the annotation on the star system. Until next time dear reader!
 [ R f6 ] , [ Q h4 ]  He wants to trade queens and relieve some of the pressure. Note the useless bishop on [ b2 ] and the defensive rook on b1.
 [ B x d6 ] , [ R c6 ]  Petrosian wants to double the Rooks with tempo.
 [ d5 ]  [ c3 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ Q f1 ] , [ N c2 ]  12. ....... [ N c2 ] - Nasty nasty my QR is trapped. Can I sell him as dearly as possible? We shall see.
 [ a3 ]  [ a5 ]  [ B f3 ]  [ Q d7 ]  [ K g2 ]  [ b4 ]  [ e4 ]  [ b x c3 ]  [ b x c3 ]  [ R a b8 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ R b3 ]  [ a4 ]  [ R f b8 ]  [ f5 ] , [ h5 ]  I think that this move somehow unnecessary for black.
 [ B x c1 ]  [ R x c1 ]  [ a x b5 ] , [ N x b5 ]  Whites' Queen side pawns are loose...
 [ B x d5 ] , [ e x f6 ]  What happen? Somebody set us up the bomb!
 [ B x a1 ] , [ b5 ]  As these moves were my plan. But Carl's next move is not what I was ready for and where I realized that 22.b4?? was the losing move.
 [ R d2 ]  [ R a f8 ] , [ N d1 ]  Now the bishop must move and there is no advantage over 17.Rxh3.
 [ N b d7 ] , [ Q d2 ]  Setting up a future kingside attack and connecting the rooks.
 [ B b7 ] , [ Q e2 ]  ? Simply gives up the g-pawn--and the all-important initiative.
 [ B c4 ]  [ K h7 ]  [ B x d5 ]  [ K g6 ]  [ K e2 ]  [ K f5 ] , [ R a1 ]  I think I like [ R b1 ] or [ B b3 ] better. While black can defend both pawns from [ B c3 ] white needs to get rid of a black pawn.
 [ N b d2 ] , [ B f5 ]  Even more interesting. This guy is giving me free theory lessons!
 [ b x c4 ] , [ R x c4 ]  Black had the chance to take the white rook with 23. ... P[ x d4 ] but he chose to refuse my gift. Truth is I am not sure I get much compensation for returning the exchange so I'm fairly glad black refused the gift. As played white can retain his material advantage.
 [ d5 ] , [ a3 ]  Reinforce my first move with A3.
 [ N d b5 ]  [ d6 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ a6 ]  [ N a3 ]  [ b5 ] , [ N d5 ]  9.[ B x f6 ] [ g x f6 ] 10.[ N d5 ] used to be the Main Line. 9.[ N d5 ] is now the Main Line but it does allow Black to maintain a good kingside pawn structure.
 [ c x d4 ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ B x e5 ]  [ f x e5 ] , [ N e4 ]  10. ....... Ne4? - after a white pawn replaces a white knight on [ e5 ] black advances his knight onto my fifth rank. However this loses a pawn.
 [ c5 ]  [ g3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ B g2 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ e5 ]  [ d3 ]  [ B e7 ] , [ e4 ]  My favorite...the KIA. It isn't all that strong against Sicilians without black playing [ e6 ] but at least it is solid and avoids the 'book lines' most Sicilian players hope to reach.
 [ R f2 x f7 ]  [ R x f7 ]  [ R x f7 ] , [ B x f7 ]  27. ....... [ B x f7 ] - a double rook trade going into a bishop ending. Now the WK's centralised position and the central pawn majority is gonna be decisive in John's favour.
 [ e5 + ]  [ K e3 ] , [ K b5 ]  38. ..... [ K b5 ] - my b pawn is about to drop off and black will have a passer on the b column so I decided to wave the white flag here. Well played antagonistknight. The only plus point about this game is that at least I did get into an endgame with a near master with even material so that is a little encouraging. I hope you have all had a good read. Bye for now - Joanne
 [ K h8 ] , [ R x f7 + ]  Sawmill in action.
 [ Q g6 + ]  [ K h3 ]  [ Q h5 + ]  [ K g3 ] , [ R c4 ]  I don't really have any particular plan just trying to find a weakness.
 [ B f3 ]  [ b7 ]  [ R d7 ] , [ R d2 + ]  Got him. He can't move a piece in the way that rook is mine.
 [ d x e5 ] , [ B c4 ]  Quick recap. I have two minor pieces developed whilst Black has only his two pawns. However there are no pieces in front of the queens...
 [ B b7 ]  [ h1 = Q + ]  [ B x h1 ]  [ N x h1 ]  [ K g1 ] , [ N f2 ]  67. ........... [ N f2 ] - the knight moves and forces [ K f1 ] - it is white's only legal move. Must be careful must not allow the wrong kind of mate!
 [ N x d4 ] , [ c x d4 ]  seems like nothing lost but..
 [ R a d1 ] , [ N g4 ]  Removing the bishop or forcing it to occupy a more passive square.
 [ f x e4 ] , [ Q x e4 + ]  expected.
 [ Q x h2 ]  [ K b5 ]  [ Q f2 ]  [ g4 ]  [ Q d4 ] , [ R c4 ]  A good move here as he protects his [ [ g4 ] ] pawn and Rook at the same time after the move of ... Qd4. However I might not have taken off the [ [ g4 ] ] pawn in exchange for my pawn at [ b6 ] since his pawn isn't really a threat and I would rather keep three pawns on the board instead of just two.
 [ e4 ]  [ g5 ] , [ d4 ]  "2.[ [ d4 ] ] is whites natural developing move. He now has his [ e4 ] and [ [ d4 ] ] central pawns developed."
 [ K e6 ]  [ K e4 ] , [ R g7 ]  52... [ g x f4 ] 53. [ R x f4 ] (not Kxg4? Rg7) [ R h7 ] should be a draw as White can't afford to be left with just a rook's pawn.
 [ d x c5 ]  [ N x c5 ]  [ Q b5 ] , [ N e4 ]  All my pieces are developing onto the Kingside. We know how this is going to end right? ... or do we?
 [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ c3 ]  checking the crazy horse moves..
 [ e x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ] , [ c5 ]  Develop a pawn and chase the knight away.
 [ g6 ]  [ g4 ]  [ f x g4 ]  [ R f4 x f7 ]  [ R d2 ] , [ R f1 f2 ]  ? I am playing altogether too passively probably out of respect for my opponent. I should have been looking for more forcing moves. This is the third time I missed a better one because I was nervous of his plans. The obvious 25 e6! is much stronger here 25 e6! then if 25 .. [ R x b2 ] 26 [ e7 ] wins eg .. [ R e8 ] 27 [ R f8 + ] [ K g7 ] 28 R1[ f7 + ] 1-0 Passed pawns need to be pushed!
 [ B x c5 + ]  [ K h2 ]  [ d4 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ B d5 ]  [ N x c5 ]  [ N x c5 ] , [ B b2 ]  preparing [ b6 ] ax[ b6 ] axb6...
 [ f4 ] , [ R x h3 ]  weakening the position Alternative variation: 28... [ K h6 ] [would bring relief] 29. [ f x g5 + ] [ N x g5 ] $11
 [ h5 ]  [ N h2 ] , [ g4 ]  Threatening ...[ g3 ] winning the knight.
 [ K x f2 ]  [ Q d4 + ]  [ K f1 ] , [ Q e4 ]  Attacking the [ b1 ] rook.
 [ B a3 ]  [ R d8 ] , [ R d1 ]  im so out of position!!! im outplayed!
 [ c3 ]  [ K e2 ]  [ N b5 ]  [ K d3 ]  [ b4 ]  [ a x b4 ] , [ c x b4 ]  49. [ c x b4 ] - I now have 2 connected passers but black has a passed d pawn
 [ Q f7 ] , [ Q x e6 ]  With mate on the brain.
 [ g3 ] , [ N f6 ]  Team match and I'm playing black. My opponent is rated 2 points higher than me when the game begins. White begins with Benko's Opening. I've never seen this before so it should be fun. It ranks 5th in popularity of all of white's possible 1st moves. Interestingly enough a couple hundred years ago this opening was called The Rat. I decide to catch the rat with the Indian system.
 [ f5 ]  [ R x f5 ]  [ K d4 ]  [ R f4 + ]  [ K d5 ]  [ B e5 ]  [ K c6 ] , [ B x b2 ]  should have protected his piece
 [ d6 ]  [ N x g4 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ h5 ] , [ B h4 + ]  7. ...... [ B h4 + ] - Fou Lenoir comes into the fray. In order to avoid displacing his king white must retreat his knight to f2.
 [ R x f1 ] , [ B x f1 ]  Now comes the fun part. My two Knights vs. Blacks two Bishops. While we are equal numerically black has the advantage if his plays i correct as his bishops can control almost any square w/ this open board. Black should win imo.
 [ N x e5 ]  [ d x e5 ] , [ R c6 ]  Black is buying a move i don't want to exchange anything and already i am wishing to have taken the g pawn with the knight instead of allowing the exchange.
 [ B x b4 ]  [ c3 ] , [ B a5 ]  Other moves allow me to play [ d4 ] with an overwhelming centre.
 [ Q x e8 + ]  [ R x e8 ]  [ B x g5 ]  [ R x g5 ]  [ R x g5 ] , [ h x g5 ]  Black is left with a slightly impaired pawn structure but also a passed [ e4 ] pawn that should be useful later.
 [ B g5 ]  [ Q b6 ] , [ N c3 ]  using Queen in early stage gives me advantage of improving my weapons
 [ B x e1 ]  [ R x e1 ]  [ N c3 + ]  [ K a5 ] , [ Q b6 # ]  
 [ R d7 ] , [ K h7 ]  59. ...... [ K h7 ] - hmm so he is after my knight is he well he is welcome to it because with my rook and knight dropping off in exchange for his rook I am left with K & P v bare king. At least I know I cannot lose the game but can I win it?
 [ B x b8 ]  [ R x b8 ]  [ R d1 ] , [ R e8 ]  alight friend ill take control of the other file then! lets see where this is headed. im still not giving up given the situation lol. i got many pawns already up the board going for me is all i can say lol
 [ Q d3 ] , [ Q d2 + ]  opponents resigns. after [ Q x d2 ] [ c x d2 ] there is no way of stopping promotion. then losing his knight. This came from a few mistake by my opponent. also the opening did stop me from playing my usual game and did make me think harder than most of the games i play due to the fact i had tried a lot of new things in this game which is never a bad thing! the opening was good i perhaps did not do it justice i did find though although it prevented me from my usual game play it did give more options than my opponent on this occasion. I have not used it since.....perhaps i should. I hope you enjoy looking through my annotation and perhaps it may encourage you to try different styles.
 [ N f3 ]  [ N x e2 ]  [ K x e2 ] , [ N d5 ]  Now threatening a royal fork
 [ f6 ]  [ a4 ]  [ R b7 ]  [ R c5 ]  [ R g8 ] , [ f3 ]  Black is seeking to establish counterplay on the kingside by ...g7-[ g5 ] so White takes prophylactic measures against this. The text threatens to trap the enemy bishop after 26. [ e4 ] thus inducing the reply.
 [ h3 ] , [ h6 ]  Creating "Luft" if necessary and keeping the White Knight away from KN5.
 [ e x d4 ] , [ c3 ]  I'm in a sacrificial kind of mood:) Anyway this move allows my queen out to [ b3 ] to further increase the pressure on [ f7 ] if needed and if he takes I can recapture with my knight for a plus in development.
 [ K g4 ] , [ f5 + ]  Continuing to check the king.
 [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ R x d5 ] , [ K e6 ]  32 ........ [ K e6 ] - a couple of queenside pawns from both sides have disappeared from the board. I retain my pawn advantage.
 [ a5 ] , [ a4 ]  Standard move in these type of positions keeps Black from dominating the Queenside.
 [ h6 ] , [ Q e8 ]  Pinning the Knight from returning to the game but also threatening 25. [ Q d8 # ]  [ Q d8 + ]  [ K g7 ]  [ Q d4 + ] , [ e5 ]  27. ... [ K g8 ] 28. [ Q x e4 ] prolongs the game a bit
 [ d5 ]  [ c4 ]  [ d x c4 ] , [ e4 ]  The queens gambit is my preferred opening as white although I'm far from proficient in it. What little know I learned from Chris Ward's "Play the Queens Gambit" (Everyman). This is his suggestion for the QGA (ECO:D20).
 [ B e2 ] , [ R c7 ]  Now I have to challenge for the open file
 [ N c5 ] , [ Q f4 ]  pins the d pawn to keep it from advancing keeping it as a weakness on black's field
 [ a2 ]  [ g6 + ]  [ f x g6 + ]  [ h x g6 + ] , [ K x h6 ]  The point is that white needed to get to [ f6 ] to advance his pawn where I just queen with check. (I even thought the final position was drawn and was shocked when he resigned) So in summary: the player who's worse off should probably look to complicate things seeing as he doesn't have much to lose. But he could probably do better off by making sure he doesn't end up with a bad position in the first place. (I think what I did was look for complications in a balanced position which isn't quite right but at least I got my worse position in the end. Complications will do that!)
 [ O-O ] , [ h5 ]  This makes blacks previous move even more of a mystery to me why not 13 ... h5?
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ c6 ]  [ c3 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ B f4 ] , [ b6 ]  Weak maybe. The fianchetto is a slow plan for the black's lsb but it is coherent.
 [ R x a8 ]  [ B x a8 ] , [ N x f7 ]  ...and not only do I get the rook exchange I also steal the pawn. That pawn was stronger than the one on [ a5 ] but I go into the single-bishop (both queenside as they're both on the opposite square shade) and single-knight endgame three pawns up (the equivalent of a bishop or knight).
 [ O-O ] , [ e5 ]  !? OK but I think I would have castled here. White does have to be somewhat concerned about the tangled situation on the c- and d-files too though their unravelling is not yet urgent.
 [ e5 ]  [ f4 ]  [ e x f4 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ g5 ]  To help protect the f pawn as well as allow options for harassing my knight.
 [ N g3 ] , [ R h g8 ]  One final effort to make something happen.
 [ Q x d6 ] , [ B x d6 ]  The swap has enabled me to improve the position of the DSB and open up the e-file for my rook. My Ns are still looking threatening and relatively secure at this stage so I felt happy with my position. I had about 10 minutes in hand over my opponent at this stage.
 [ R d8 ]  [ Q e2 ]  [ R c d6 ]  [ c5 ]  [ R d6 d2 ]  [ Q b5 ]  [ Q f3 ]  [ a4 ]  [ h5 ]  [ R a e1 ]  [ h4 ]  [ R e3 ]  [ Q d5 ] , [ g x h4 ]  one up not bad.
 [ B e4 ] , [ N h4 ]  Opening up a nasty attack on the pinned bishop. Sure Black can keep from losing material but the ensuing exchanges won't help his cause...
 [ N c2 ] , [ R e7 ]  Blocking my king in now I'm in another mess.
 [ e4 ] , [ e6 ]  The French Defense. The idea is to play [ d5 ] challenging White's e-pawn. But my opponent didn't play the main variation.
 [ Q c1 + ]  [ K b3 ] , [ Q c2 # ]  
 [ h x g6 ]  [ f x g6 ] , [ Q x g6 ]  ...pawn is pinned...and material is now even...White has a very strong attack here and pieces ready to come in quickly....Black is effecgtively 2 pieces down on the queen side...
 [ K x g7 ]  [ g x h5 ] , [ R h8 ]  I'm not really playing all that well because I remember being caught off guard by this move.
 [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B c4 ] , [ B g4 ]  Game note "Open Sicilian as black 6...Bg4".
 [ N x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ] , [ Q d8 ]  And now both the [ e4 ] and [ b2 ] pawns are attacked. Black is already in big advantage.
 [ R c1 + ]  [ K d5 ]  [ d7 ] , [ K e4 ]  53. R [ a6 ] was better I still had not conceded a draw....
 [ N c3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ e4 ] , [ N x c3 ]  So here we have a Grünfeld modern exchange variation... without the exchange part... as white didn't captured back??
 [ d6 ] , [ Q h5 ]  I decided against exploiting the pin with 19. [ Q g6 ] since 19 ...[ B e6 ] would have defended forcing my Q to move again
 [ b x c5 ]  [ a3 ] , [ O-O ]  The computer is happy with these moves.
 [ R x f8 ]  [ R x f8 ] , [ a4 ]  white have a passed a pawn
 [ K e3 ]  [ Q d5 ] , [ K f2 ]  After 72. ...[ K e2 ] White forces the king in front of the pawn by 73. [ Q e4 + ] [ K f2 ] and then brings up his king.
 [ d4 ]  [ Q g6 + ]  [ K f8 ]  [ Q x h6 + ]  [ K e8 ]  [ Q x g5 ]  [ R d5 ] , [ Q f4 ]  [A very nice positional game by Komodo. Stockfish defended tenaciously but it overestimated its chances in the very end and was punished swiftly.]
 [ B e2 ]  [ N h6 ] , [ R c1 + ]  Black resigns. Mate or catastrophic material loss vis 19. ...[ K b7 ] 20. [ B f3 ] [ K [ a6 ] ] 21. Nc5ch awaits. Many poor decisions lead to this loss in 19 moves on my part and I should have had better nerves around the critical 13-14 move juncture. My "moral obligation" to keep the opening pawn was fine independently however it needed accurate follow-up. I wish I could have played 13. ...[ h6 ] and bode my time instead of rushing into complications (whilst still not fully developed) that in no way favored me. Sometimes those "rabbit ears" (...[ a6 ] & ...h6) are in fact the best moves in a defensive position. This is not a pretty game but I've taken something away from it.
 [ N f6 ] , [ B d3 ]  To develop as quickly as possible to use the initiative given by the gambit. "By our informations the adversary will set is GQ on g8. Occupate the battlefield center and aim a machine gun on his position.
 [ B x c4 ]  [ Q x c4 + ]  [ K b8 ] , [ N x e5 ]  Now I take the e-pawn.
 [ B f8 ] , [ c4 ]  Okay he wants to force the issue. I feel I've got two choices. One is to close things up with b4. My other choice is to trade on [ a4 ] and [ e1 ] and then grab the open file with Rb8. I said I was thinking of how to play smart and keep things safe so I'm leaning to b4.
 [ B e2 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ] , [ N e5 ]  We're thinking along the same lines. I figured that was coming and I'll use my other knight to trade it off. But I'm also trying to play [ N e4 ] myself -- always a strong move in the Dutch I've been told.
 [ B b7 ] , [ d4 ]  I figured that I would put more pressure on the e square by threatening him with [ d x e5 ] followed by a forced exchange but this does not happen.
 [ Q b1 ] , [ B x c3 ]  White I think missed a golden opportunity in declining what I'm beginning to think was a dubious sac by Black. Lucky me Joe declines and now his qside corner is pressured further
 [ B f3 ]  [ N d8 ] , [ Q e7 ]  Threatening mate
 [ B h2 ] , [ f3 ]  [ B x c3 ] is still out of question and by this move I win material but white has really powerful queenside play with his pawns so I must be really careful.
 [ Q b6 ] , [ R e2 e4 ]  26. [ R e4 ] - to stop a move like [ c5 ] breaking up the pawn position around Henry. That Witch still has too many helpers to rule out a queenside mating attack on the weakened position. I also need to watch out for an eventual Qf2. Thankfully that never materialises.
 [ R a8 ] , [ R d1 ]  To spare the bishops from the upcoming skewer with 32. ... Ra2.
 [ B x f6 ] , [ g x f6 ]  black's intention to open the g file has come true with a cost of a hampered king side but the white pieces are not in good position to take advantage of that
 [ B x f5 ]  [ e x f5 ] , [ Q x f5 ]  While [ B g4 ] pins the black queen against the rook [ Q g5 ] or [ Q g6 ] prevent white's bishop from moving (the pinner itself is pinned against the white king).
 [ g4 ] , [ h6 ]  against [ g5 ] also introducing Nh7...
 [ N d4 ]  [ N d5 ] , [ N x e2 + ]  Why take White's bad bishop?
 [ N x h3 ] , [ Q g3 + ]  
 [ d3 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ O-O ] , [ c3 ]  unambitious maybe better was [ N x e7 ]  [ a6 ] , [ B c4 ]  again avoiding exchanges why?
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ N f6 ]  This is unusual but playable. Black hopes to either get favorable variations of an Alekhine Defense type game or to be able to play an early ...[ d5 ] in one move.
 [ a3 ]  [ B x c3 ]  [ b x c3 ]  [ N g4 ] , [ B x g4 ]  ?! 17. h3! could be better : 17... [ N f6 ] 18. [ B x f6 ] [ R x f6 ] 19. [ B g4 ] ! +=
 [ Q b1 ] , [ B x f3 ]  Black exchanges his bishop
 [ O-O ]  [ B d3 ]  [ b6 ]  [ O-O ] , [ e5 ]  i figured here that i would like to open things up and this doesn't lose the pawn for good.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ f4 ]  [ e x f4 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ g5 ]  [ B c4 ] , [ Q e7 ]  Early Queen move. What purpose does it serve? The threat to the e pawn is easily deflected.
 [ N c6 ] , [ B b5 ]  pinning the knight and threatening to win the referred exchange...
 [ B x g5 ]  [ O-O ]  [ d4 ] , [ e x d4 ]  He probably shouldn't have done that opening the e file
 [ R a3 ]  [ h3 ]  [ R x a7 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ R e8 ] , [ f4 ]  39. [ f4 ] - trying to trick me into exf4?? dropping my rook - I am having none of it and play [ e4 ] now not only am I a clear R and P up I have two lovely passers.
 [ f x g5 ]  [ h x g2 + ]  [ K x g2 ] , [ Q x e1 ]  Lucky for me Bernard ran out of time... Black seems to have no better then eternal check after 44. Rf4! But the old warrior let his last seconds go by... He stated: "Well I was not doing too bad"... I surely had to give him that; it was a thrilling game...
 [ c4 ] , [ c6 ]  An odd move which is not even mentioned in the oddments columns of MCO14 Should be an interesting game This is where depending on sound guidelines for the opening rather than blindly following an opening book scores.
 [ N c6 ] , [ a3 ]  prophylactic: we do not need interference on b4...
 [ Q x h6 ] , [ Q x b5 ]  May as well take the loose Pawn.
 [ K g8 ]  [ Q x h5 ] , [ Q d6 ]  How to continue the attack now ?
 [ f3 ]  [ b6 ] , [ R f8 ]  (!) 'To whom that hath shall be given; to who that hath not shall be taken away.' Forget your political parables! Black abandons the h-pawn to force through the f-pawn. Black must have the advantage now!
 [ e x d5 ] , [ R g5 ]  P[ c6 ] protects P[ d5 ] at least momentarily.
 [ b x a1 = Q ]  [ e x d8 = Q ] , [ R a x d8 ]  The highly awsome queen teleport move completes and leaves me a rook up in material after the exchanges because white hasn't developed his bishop on the queenside. This shows that you should try to develop all your pieces before its too late!
 [ B x f8 ]  [ R x f8 ]  [ K h2 ]  [ Q b8 ] , [ g3 ]  Nothing to fear now from Black. Right?
 [ e x d5 ] , [ K g7 ]  Well this is now not worth commenting on to be honest and I don't mean that to be offensive. It's just chess.
 [ N f6 ] , [ N c3 ]  5. [ N c3 ] - now follows some sensible development but little do I know that I have already left it too late.
 [ R b2 ]  [ R d5 + ] , [ K e2 ]  King can't stray too far from these pawns. My idea already is that once the rooks come off I Blockade one pawn with my bishop put my pawns on light squares and then use my king to keep his king out of the position.
 [ O-O ]  [ c5 ]  [ c3 ]  [ Q b6 ]  [ N b d2 ]  [ d6 ] , [ d5 ]  9. [ d5 ] - white has a spatial advantage with this move. He also has a lead in development. I try to catch up.
 [ h3 ]  [ b5 ]  [ R c2 ] , [ K e4 ]  43. ..... [ K e4 ] - that [ c3 ] pawn is certainly doomed. I have no wish to see the Witch again so I wave the white flag. Could I have played this particular endgame better though? You the jury decide.
 [ K h8 ]  [ Q x b7 ] , [ Q b8 ]  Now I thought an attack would finish me off so I sought to swap off Queens. My only other alternative was [ Q f6 ] which probably also swaps off after [ Q f7 ] (notice the N forks winning the Q if it is on [ g5 ] or d8)
 [ B c4 ]  [ Q f6 ] , [ N x f7 ]  This capture is stronger. Now ...[ g5 ] does not work and White is threatening the rook and an attack on the King.
 [ Q f5 ] , [ B e2 ]  Trying to figure out what to do at this point
 [ c4 ] , [ N e5 ]  Strong. True is that white can threat my knight but it can takre [ c4 ] so the options are limited.
 [ Q d2 ]  [ Q f1 ]  [ c3 ]  [ Q b1 ]  [ Q e3 ] , [ Q e4 ]  -
 [ Q c3 ]  [ B x b3 ]  [ Q x g7 ] , [ R f8 ]  he is thithing up his king
 [ N e7 ] , [ a4 ]  Trying to restrain the queenside majority. [ B c4 ] may have been better to prevent both ...[ B e6 ] and ...O-O as after black's next it is no longer possible. (I may have been worried about ...[ b5 ] but after [ B b3 ] white is fine.
 [ R e5 ] , [ R f6 ]  Playing RxR gives White a passed pawn.
 [ B c6 ]  [ K e5 ]  [ K g1 ]  [ K f4 ]  [ K f2 ] , [ e3 + ]  The game is more or less over at this point but we decide to play on under the motto: "If this ends up stalemate then I got a lot of studying to do".
 [ N f3 ] , [ N h6 ]  I was thinking about 6... [ h5 ] and 7 Nh6. But this it´s too slow and weaking the kingside.
 [ B g5 ] , [ B e7 ]  Nothing to be worried about yet right?
 [ d5 ]  [ c4 ]  [ d x c4 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ h6 ]  [ e3 ]  [ B g4 ] , [ B x c4 ]  Forces black to defend vulnerable f7.
 [ R x h3 ]  [ B f4 ] , [ Q x f6 ]  If white were allowed to play [ f x g7 ] then that pawn could not be stopped from promoting to a queen so it's time to put an end to that threat while consolidating the piece advantage.
 [ d3 ] , [ N d4 ]  Further incursion into enemy territory.I should have moved Qd7-[ Q e8 ]  [ Q h5 ] , [ g4 ]  GOT YOU NOW!!We have a saying in south georgia USA"YOU DON"T FOLLOW A RATTLESNAKE IN THE BUSHES"you dont look around and see danger
 [ e6 ] , [ B d3 ]  here white has a commanding lead in development but is still down a pawn
 [ O-O ] , [ B e3 ]  keeping the bishop ready for king side attack
 [ R e1 ] , [ B d6 ]  ! And now black's development is complete! In addition he is threatening mate in one which is going to delay white's development even more because it is actually quite difficult to get out of this situation. In other words it's a complicated threat as opposed to unsound.
 [ Q b3 ] , [ b5 ]  I contemplate a general advance on the Q-side.
 [ Q x f2 + ] , [ K c3 ]  QxP[ e3 + ] forces a trade of queens. Even exchanges are generally recommended when one enjoys a six point (or seven point with Pe3) material advantage.
 [ b3 ] , [ c5 ]  i wanted to have space in the centre.
 [ N g5 ]  [ Q d7 ] , [ e x f5 ]  Usually one takes with g. In this particular case however I couldn't wait to boast my bishop with a longer diagonal. The [ N c6 ] is pinned.
 [ R c5 + ]  [ K b3 ]  [ K b6 ] , [ Q e6 + ]  I will have to work a lot to get it. I couldn't imagine this was a decisive move.
 [ Q c5 ]  [ a3 ] , [ N e5 ]  Moving my knight into the action.
 [ B x e4 ] , [ N f6 ]  Again BxB is good for me so why lose this chance?
 [ N x c3 ]  [ b x c3 ] , [ B x e4 ]  Black gains his extra pawn.
 [ c4 ]  [ N e d3 ] , [ N e2 ]  White begins to suffer from the invasion of the black cavalry!
 [ B e2 ]  [ Q g7 ]  [ K h1 ]  [ R d g8 ] , [ R f g1 ]  It is clear white is in trouble but this moves just cramps up his kings position.
 [ e5 ] , [ K f2 ]  2. Kf2?? - this move characterises the Fried Fox/Pork Chop Opening. I think it fully deserves two question marks here as you will see. Always always play Nc3! That is the Freddy way!
 [ K f7 ] , [ f5 ]  Taking away 1 more sq from the B
 [ c5 ] , [ g4 ]  I think this move is a mistake. Although the correct plan is a king's side attack as black hasn't advanced the f g or h pawns it will be hard to open a file there. I think best was to secure the d pawn with [ N e2 ] may followed by B-d2-[ c3 ] and [ R d1 ] and then use the [ N f3 ] to go back to the old plan of attacking [ h7 ] with the [ N g5 ] and queen on [ d3 ] or [ h5 ]  [ c x d4 ] , [ N x d4 ]  Now white's e pawn falls and without a solid centre her king is vunerable
 [ B x g4 ]  [ Q x g4 ]  [ Q x g4 ]  [ h x g4 ]  [ N e7 ] , [ f4 ]  I'll be getting my knight out soon. I haven't decided whether to put him on [ a3 ] (then where would he go) or [ d2 ] heading to f3. I'm not ready to block my bishop yet. In the meantime I know that I'll need to make this move so I'll go ahead and do it and see what his plans are.
 [ d x e5 ]  [ g4 ]  [ K e2 ]  [ f4 ]  [ K f2 ]  [ g3 + ]  [ K g2 ]  [ h5 ]  [ K f3 ] , [ h4 ]  Note he cannot take the f pawn because he will not be able to stop the g pawn
 [ B b2 ] , [ h4 ]  Continuing the pawn advance Shredder also plays this move}
 [ Q a8 + ]  [ K d7 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ R d6 ] , [ Q x a7 ]  this move moves queen out of play.
 [ Q x e6 ] , [ h3 ]  Major blunder. White desperately needed to play [ Q d2 ] here (which would have been followed by 22. ... Qe2) but this move seals White's doom.
 [ Q e7 ]  [ Q x e7 ]  [ R x e7 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ R x e5 ]  [ R d7 ]  [ f6 ]  [ R b1 ]  [ R g5 ]  [ a3 ]  [ a5 ]  [ h3 ]  [ h6 ]  [ R b2 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ K h2 ]  [ R e3 ]  [ a4 ]  [ R a3 ]  [ R d4 ] , [ R g g3 ]  Going for a rook exchange. The less on the board the safer.
 [ N x b5 ]  [ R x f7 + ]  [ K g8 ]  [ R e7 ]  [ N d6 ]  [ N g4 ]  [ N f7 ]  [ N f6 + ]  [ K g7 ] , [ R e8 ]  Here is mate in one if black plays the wrong move or he has to lose the rook. But he found the right one.
 [ K b4 ] , [ e4 ]  Can't get 'em both.
 [ N f6 ] , [ B x c6 ]  Now the "" The Roy Lopez...Exchange Variation"".....an --aggresive-opening--for white...!!!
 [ Q f2 ]  [ N x e5 ] , [ N x e5 ]  i wonder if he sees the mating threat?
 [ K h1 ] , [ N x h4 + ]  I take his rook with a discovered check
 [ f3 ] , [ N x g5 ]  I was hoping to attack but I think I've got too many threats lined up on h7. After 12. hxg5/[ B x g5 ] I'll play 12. ... [ Q g6 ]  [ B x g5 ]  [ Q g6 ]  [ Q x g6 ] , [ f x g6 ]  I don't want to open the h-File for White. I'm considering ... Bf5.
 [ K e7 ]  [ R a8 ] , [ R d x c6 + ]  ths for the pawn finally.
 [ a5 ]  [ b x a5 ] , [ B c5 ]  Taking care of the pawns Mafia Style. ;)
 [ f3 ] , [ B d4 + ]  Another zwischenzug. Before saving the knight let's get that biship into a more useful central location.
 [ B x e4 ] , [ R b x e2 + ]  
 [ N f6 ]  [ B e4 ]  [ N d5 ] , [ B x d5 + ]  Oops! You had a cool tactic - 39. Rxd5! [ R x d5 ] 40. Qc4! [ R d7 ] 41. Rd1! will win you a full rook here
 [ d x c5 ]  [ b x c5 ]  [ N x c5 ] , [ R e8 ]  In this position his main goal is to put pressure on my Knight but I am not going to allow that as we will see shortly.
 [ Q b1 + ]  [ K d2 ] , [ B c3 + ]  Black hopes to deflect my king to avoid more threats on the kingside.
 [ K g7 ] , [ R g8 + ]  Icing on the cake. Black must capture the white rook sooner or later. If 47. ... [ K h7 ] 48. [ R h8 + ] forces black to capture on h8. These two moves by white force the black king one step farther away from the a-file just exactly enough to ensure a quick and painless promotion rather than a longer tedious one.
 [ Q c2 ] , [ R b8 ]  Tripling and crushing positionally. This position looks quite contrived with every black piece participating harmonically in the attack on the queenside. Yet it is a textbook setup in the benko and one of the ways black converts his extra tempos into material gain. The danger to white is not black winning his pawn back but the initiative he carries. Observe at this point the risks to white. 1) After losing [ e4 ] to the black knight the [ d5 ] pawn is weak also 2) The black queen and knight are targetting the [ f2 ] square white needs to be careful
 [ B x h1 ]  [ O-O-O ] , [ N x b4 ]  Black is at +2 materially and plus something innumerable strategically. GK evaluates his advantage to +2.75 but that is definitely too low. I could just as well have resigned here as the total lack of (pawn) protection for my King coupled with those open d- and e-files and the linked queenside phalanx of pawns ensures Black an easy victory.
 [ R f7 ] , [ f4 ]  Plan B. What will the pawn advance achieve? From White's point of view this looked rather harder to deal with.
 [ R e7 + ]  [ K f6 ]  [ R h7 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ K g4 ]  [ e4 ]  [ R a7 ]  [ e3 ]  [ K f3 ] , [ K f5 ]  But he was showing where I might have been able to draw against a weaker player. That's because if black were to blunder by letting my monarch in I would've been able to take his g5. He showed me where that could happen. But against his strength it won't work. For afterwards we spent two or three more minutes studying what Jack would've done and how he would've prevented the draw. He would've brought the monarch in similar to this so that I would not get that pawn. Then he'd keep pushing his e pawn until a promotion was inevitable. After this game we spent the remainder of what I had left continuing Tom's game against Jack as Homework because of what happened in this game. Yes Tom came in a little earlier then usual. As what usually happens there was not enough time for him to finish against Jack. Tom's only advantage was being a pawn up. However it was a question of what to do with that passed pawn since they were doubled. With time running out for him Tom offered a draw which Jack accepted. So we continued and likewise he showed what the monarch can do in the endgame. And I played a move that would've lost that extra pawn. Afterwhich it would be more or less drawn. But the idea is that Jack would've gotten it back with his King. With that being said the morals are first you don't want anything tied down but especially in the endgame. What I noted on the 35th although not the losing blunder was the first of the problems being that my R+K were tied down and couldn't do as much. That enabled Jack's pieces to get more powerful. Second but more importantly came the 47th move in which my King was out of play when getting out of check. Instead of centralizing it with 47.[ K e3 ] where my e pawn would've been protected I played 47.Kg4?? which enabled Jack to win the important pawn. After that things were going to go downhill. So other lesson is that since the monarch is a powerful weapon in the end game keep where it's needed. Don't move the King away from where it's important as otherwise it's out of play. As bringing anything out of play but especially in the endgame can have devastating consequences as they did here.
 [ g4 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ N d3 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ K g2 ] , [ B b8 ]  just trying to defend now
 [ d6 ]  [ f5 ]  [ N a5 ] , [ Q f3 ]  Maybe this isn't the greatest plan since without that light-square bishop the kingside attack isn't looking as great.
 [ R c8 ] , [ R f2 ]  (!) Aimed against 13...[ B x c3 ] and the death of the infant on c3. Meanwhile 13.[ R e1 ] [ B d7 ] (also 13...O-O 14.[ [ a3 ] ] Q[ [ a3 ] ] 15.[ Q b3 ] Be7) 14.[ Q d3 ] O-O 15.[ [ a3 ] ] W[ a5 ] 16.[ B d2 ] was not likely to dampen my spirits. It appeared that we were in for along game.
 [ B d7 ]  [ d5 ] , [ N e5 ]  Black has a slight edge at this point.
 [ N f6 ] , [ B c4 ]  I really wanted to play [ e5 ] but my poor knight on [ d5 ] was unprotected.
 [ K f1 ]  [ a4 ]  [ B b2 ] , [ Q e3 ]  Hoping to maybe corner the king and win some material
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ g6 ]  Black is planning to fianchetto the bishop and then attack the white centre from the flanks.
 [ R c6 + ] , [ K d3 ]  Not bad. Check out …[ K d4 ] and then what?
 [ N c3 ]  [ R c8 ]  [ Q a5 ]  [ Q b7 ]  [ Q b5 ] , [ R b8 ]  Probably not in black's interest to allow a queen trade at this time.
 [ N b5 ]  [ b4 ]  [ d4 ] , [ R a6 ]  pins the [ c6 ] pawn so threatens [ R x b5 ]  [ K d5 ] , [ R b8 ]  If [ R x b8 ] [ a x b8 = Q ] If [ R x a7 ] [ R x b5 + ] wins the rook next move If [ N x a7 ] [ R x a8 ] enters an 2R vs N endgame
 [ R x f3 + ] , [ K e2 ]  Here I resign because [ Q g2 # ] is inevitable. Please give constructive criticism and advice. Well played bigpeta.
 [ K f6 ] , [ Q h4 + ]  !A good move forcing Black' king back.
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ c4 ]  [ c6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ e3 ]  [ N b d7 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ d x c4 ]  [ B x c4 ]  [ b5 ]  [ B d3 ] , [ B b7 ]  A main line of the semi-slav: meran system.
 [ R f8 + ]  [ K a7 ]  [ R h8 ]  [ R d5 ]  [ K f2 ] , [ R c5 ]  Rc5!? What was this move going to do?
 [ B b6 ] , [ B c4 ]  This was played to develop and to attempt some pressure on Jack which won't work.
 [ e x d3 ] , [ c x d3 ]  changed flank pawn to center one - count good
 [ B d7 ] , [ b3 ]  10. [ b3 ] prepares for [ B b2 ] fianchetto......[ N c6 ] prepares for 0-0-0.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ a6 ]  [ B a4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B e7 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ b5 ]  [ B b3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ c3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ h3 ] , [ N b8 ]  This is how the Breyer's System begins. And it is also where the voting begins. Simon: 10.[ [ [ [ d4 ] ] ] ] With the knight undeveloping itself an aggressive more into the centre seems best to me. White has opening advantage plus an extra two tempi? Joe: my vote is similar but it would be 10.[ d3 ] The idea being to prevent an exchange because if 10.[ [ [ [ d4 ] ] ] ] she can play 10...ex[ [ [ [ d4 ] ] ] ] and I'm keeping in mind what kenneth_fiore_3 told me about exchanges which is to hold off on that. And that was due to me getting impulsive and doing so whenever possible which is a big no no. ION: I'll join in... ... but for reasons of a rather erratic attention span (I've only just seen this thread though it must be three days old already) I do not wish to 'captain' the side. I reckon charleshiggie would be very suited to the role. My vote: 10.[ [ [ [ d4 ] ] ] ] Seems to me as good a time to stake a big claim on the centre and it frees the Q-side for development. Black's immediate programme will be to reorganise her Q-side. We can use that time to develop our own. Jeremy: I also vote 10.[ [ [ [ d4 ] ] ] ] It's a bit aggressive but with the position and the knight not challenging we stake a nice claim on the center open a space for our dsb to move and gets us one step closer to completing development.
 [ Q f7 ]  [ Q b1 + ]  [ K g2 ]  [ Q c2 + ]  [ K h3 ]  [ d2 ]  [ N x d2 ]  [ Q x d2 ]  [ Q x e7 ] , [ Q x d5 ]  mmm no soon as I deal with one passed d pawn another appears!
 [ R x b2 ] , [ R a8 + ]  See? With the king deprived of [ f7 ] he cannot approach the passed e-pawn to prevent it from promoting now.
 [ e4 ]  [ B b7 ] , [ R e c1 ]  Taking the important c-file.
 [ N c3 ] , [ N d4 ]  taking the post and remaining a piece down.
 [ N c3 ] , [ Q b6 ]  This was a bad move on my part but I was kind of playing the person here. I felt comfortable sacrificing the knight. I know that it was not a good move but for me I sometimes make plays based on reading the person. I felt confident in this move and felt that the knight wouldn't be an issue. My goal here was to get the queen side rook eventually. Sometimes when I play blitz games I base my moves on feel. Kind of like poker I felt confident I was reading my opponent here.
 [ N f6 ] , [ h3 ]  Likewise I don't know why Sandre played this. As noted I would've castled.
 [ K d2 ]  [ K f7 ]  [ K c2 ] , [ K e7 ]  time for the king to attack
 [ N f6 + ] , [ K g7 ]  Now what? Me stupid... and I'm still losing [ N e2 ] or Rf1. Now [ d6 ] Qx[ d6 ] was to be played first but I missed it. The plan is not [ N e8 + ] RxN [ Q x f7 + ] [ K h1 ] and white is not winning.
 [ K d6 ]  [ R x b2 ]  [ K e7 ] , [ R f2 ]  !!
 [ B b4 ] , [ f3 ]  Do you have any idea of what opening this is? I'm too lazy to look it up. :)
 [ R b1 ] , [ N b2 ]  44...[ N b2 ] blocks White's Rook and provides the possibility of attacking a2.
 [ f5 ]  [ R x g2 ]  [ N f4 ]  [ R x b2 + ]  [ N x h3 ]  [ g x f5 ]  [ N f4 ] , [ N f6 ]  34. .... [ N f6 ] - I do become 5 points up in material though. However my opponent makes me work very hard for the win.
 [ B d2 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ B c3 ] , [ B b7 ]  Eying the [ f3 ] knight. This Bishop proved to be very valuable hence the name "The Quiet Sniper"
 [ N f3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ d x c5 ] , [ Q a5 ]  ? - Ion annotated this as a bad move not sure except that white's next move forces a queen trade which perhaps Ion you did not want. The purpose of [ Q a5 ] was I think to pile up on the white [ c5 ] pawn hoping to win it next move.
 [ N x e6 + ]  [ K d7 ] , [ Q h3 ]  26. [ Q h3 ] - at last Freddy's queen goes to the kingside with devastating effect. Just for starties Freddy is threatening a nasty discovered check with his knight. Black completes his development on Move 26 would you believe but it will avail him naught.
 [ B h5 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ e6 ]  [ c3 ]  [ B d6 ] , [ N e5 ]  if [ B x e5 ] exchange is taken white will gain a material advantage so [ B x e2 ] likely here.
 [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ] , [ N x d4 ]  4. [ Q x d4 ] is played often enough but I think it isn't as challenging.
 [ Q g5 + ] , [ K f1 ]  Because he checked me with [ Q g5 + ] I am forced to play [ K f1 ] because he will checkmate me immediately with [ Q g2 # ] if I play [ K h1 ] or [ K h2 ] but I am now in trouble and cannot get out of it. That is because I am going to loose the game no matter what since it is inevitable. I was hoping that he would not play [ K f1 ] so that I could get out of danger but I knew that it was not going to happen because it would be too easy otherwise.
 [ K f4 ] , [ B g4 ]  Protect both pawns
 [ B x g7 ]  [ K x g7 ] , [ R f3 f4 ]  Pinning the Black N for the moment. All the while Black still cannot move [ f x g4 ]  [ B x f5 ] , [ R g1 ]  I was pleased I found this--With White's next move 33. [ B x e4 ] either the Q will be pinned to the K or it will be discovered check.
 [ B g3 ]  [ h5 ]  [ h3 ]  [ N h6 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ g4 ]  [ h x g4 ]  [ h x g4 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ N f5 ]  [ N x c6 ] , [ Q d7 ]  the rest of the game continued
 [ c6 ] , [ O-O ]  [ h4 ] was not a good attack option it semed to me so I can castle.
 [ d7 ]  [ f x e4 ]  [ d x c8 = N ] , [ R a x c8 ]  White lost both centre pawns for that undeveloped bishop and also gifted black a centre spot. There's also pressure on [ f2 ] from both rook and bishop. But [ e4 ] is isolated and the king-side is weak.
 [ N b4 ]  [ O-O ] , [ f6 ]  ?? With the idea of pushing the knight off of [ [ e5 ] ] and preparing a possible [ [ e5 ] ] push to lock the White bishop's diagonal down. However a huuge blunder in light of 9.[ Q h5 + ] !
 [ N d5 ]  [ f5 ]  [ c3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ e x f5 ]  [ B x f5 ]  [ N c2 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ N c e3 ]  [ N e7 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ R b8 ]  [ a4 ]  [ b x a4 ] , [ R x a4 ]  Here my predecessor (the only one left at this point and always according to the gameknot data base) played 19.) ...[ R x b2 ] 20.) [ B x a6 ] which did not show very good results. So I decide to keep my a pawn for a while and try to keep the a file closed.
 [ c3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N b d2 ] , [ B e7 ]  No hurry since black's only way to "do something" is to play [ c5 ] and he obviously doesn't want to.
 [ B f4 ] , [ O-O ]  Not a good move! He loses the pawn on h6.
 [ K a6 ] , [ R x a8 ]  Black resigned 37. ... [ K a5 ] 38. [ Q x a7 + ] [ K [ b5 ] ] 39. [ N e d4 + ] [ K c5 ] 40. [ R c8 # ] or 40. [ Q c7 # ] or 37. ...[ d5 ] 38. [ Q x a7 + ] [ K [ b5 ] ] 39. [ N e d4 + ] [ e x d4 + ] 40. [ N x d4 ] [ K c5 ] 41. [ R c8 + ] [ K d6 ] (41. ... [ K b4 ] 42. [ Q x b6 ] [ K a4 ] or [ K a3 ] 43. Ra8) 42. [ Q c7 # ] or 37. ... [ b5 ] 38. [ Q a7 # ] magics had some magi in the chess game(and in the game he played me I lost)
 [ R d d1 ]  [ K x e7 ]  [ B b8 ]  [ R a3 a2 + ]  [ K b3 ]  [ R a7 a3 + ]  [ K x b4 ] , [ R a3 a8 ]  trying to go r[ b2 ] mate!
 [ d6 ] , [ h3 ]  Why? Now I'm getting the feeling I'm too cautious again and not part of my idea of starting to play chess more aggressively and I'm quite sure I lost a tempo by doing that move. I think [ N f3 ] would have been better...
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ] , [ B b5 + ]  An alternative to the far more common 3.[ d4 ] that is becoming very popular in recent years even at the top levels of the game. World Champions M Carlsen and G. Kasparov have both played it several times.
 [ K h6 ]  [ K c2 ]  [ R c8 ]  [ R b6 ]  [ R c7 ]  [ h4 ]  [ K g7 ] , [ a4 ]  this may be the slower way to win but it is the safest. I learned for Aleckine and Petrison to methodically improve your position one move at a time. I rarely win games using flashy combos instead I am like a boa constrictor slowly squeeze the life of you
 [ N c1 ]  [ N b1 ] , [ N a2 ]  White's Knight is basically frozen in place.
 [ K e4 ]  [ b5 ]  [ a x b5 ]  [ a x b5 ]  [ K d5 ] , [ b x c6 ]  46. [ b x c6 ] - this is just sooo awful! It was about 5.45 am and I was yet to take a shower - I wish I bally well had done. I felt as sick as a parrott. If so I should have pushed my pawn up to b6. There would have been no way Danny could stop my pawn from reaching Glendadom. I analysed from here that I had nothing better than a draw so I offered it. After three agonising days wait my opponent accepted. After Danny accepted the draw offer I had a chat with him - he was really nice about it saying "these things happen". Ah well every cloud has a silver lining and that one silver lining was Danny and I being added to each others buddy list!
 [ R e6 ] , [ B h3 ]  Puts some pressure on Black's Rook forcing him back to e8.
 [ Q x g5 ]  [ B x c6 ] , [ N x c6 ]  I see threat greater threat...
 [ R a c8 ]  [ b x a5 + ]  [ K a7 ] , [ Q b3 ]  With the obvious threat of Qb6+. If Black allowed this [ Q b6 + ] [ K a8 ] [ R b1 ] would force Black to take his perpetual check to avoid mate.
 [ c4 ]  [ d x c4 ] , [ B x c4 ]  That exchange give up your center pawn formation!
 [ Q e2 ] , [ R e8 ]  preparing for [ N d5 ] and adds a defender to the [ e7 ] sqaure
 [ R f c1 ] , [ N c4 ]  !? Here it is! This protects the [ c7 ] pawn by cutting off communication between the rooks as well as attacking both undefended bishops! It certainly complicates matters but incredibly GK analysis judges the position to be dead equal!
 [ d5 ] , [ Q h6 ]  21. [ Q [ h6 ] ] - now Glenda returns to [ h6 ] where she will stay for the remainder of the game.
 [ K h2 ]  [ K x g4 ] , [ K g2 ]  White reclaims the opposition.
 [ N c e6 ]  [ B b3 ]  [ c6 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ B f6 ]  [ R a c1 ]  [ B x e5 ]  [ N x e5 ] , [ f6 ]  A move that achieves nothing. The white knight thrives on the black king's flank.
 [ B e7 ]  [ O-O ] , [ O-O ]  We've both elected to castle kingside and put development before tactics as advised in all good chess primers. However as is typical of many Sicilian variations White's pieces are better developed than Black's whose pawns have made more moves so I'd normally expect a vigorous attack from White to begin now.
 [ a5 ]  [ K g2 ]  [ K g6 ]  [ N b7 ]  [ R a8 ]  [ h4 ]  [ b3 ]  [ c x b3 ] , [ c x b3 ]  Black tries to push through the Queenside as that is really his only hope.
 [ B x e6 ] , [ f x e6 ]  After this move I had a few options but felt that the best bet was to castle kingside and see if he would go for the doubled e pawns. A queenside caste has some interesting implications but I think that a kingside castle due to his doubled pawns makes more sense long term.
 [ e x f6 ]  [ g x f6 ] , [ B x f6 ]  ?? This is a blunder on my part. What happened here is that I got distracted because I just started a consultation thread in the Alt Chess Club which is similar and the same idea as ION's Group I Consultation thread in the "Walking the Walk and Learning How to Run" forum. And some of my quizzes involved quizzes from GM Judit Polgar in which I've annotated a couple of her past games. Between this and there I got distracted and made a mistake. So black finds that error by retacking. But in a private message I used the FEN Notation to show what would have happened had I not taken.
 [ B e3 ]  [ B x e3 ]  [ Q x e3 ] , [ d5 ]  I developed my plan here I wanted to exchange pieces move out my queen and castle queenside
 [ N f5 ]  [ B b2 ] , [ N b4 ]  Though this move isn't particularly bad 11...[ B e7 ] would have been better White is cramped and Black certainly has time to castle.
 [ R e1 + ]  [ K d7 ]  [ R e7 + ] , [ Q x e7 ]  Fairly forced. Other lines lead to the shedding of the f and a pawns of dangerous mating nets for the black king.
 [ e4 ] , [ d5 ]  Scandinavian defence - For white I think the best response is 2.[ e x d5 ] and try to draw the Queen out early. A search of GK Databse showed this as the most common reply to [ e4 ] d5.
 [ N c6 ] , [ B c4 ]  Now it's mate in one if black doesn't respond correctly.
 [ R x f6 ] , [ B x f6 ]  The simplest may be just [ K f7 ] followed by Re8.
 [ N c3 ] , [ B g7 ]  The next decision point: I could have gone for the Grunfeld with 3...[ d5 ] but I only really know one line of that and it doesn't usually work out for me to well.
 [ B x g4 ]  [ R x f8 + ]  [ R x f8 ]  [ B x e7 ]  [ R h8 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ B x e2 ]  [ Q x e2 ] , [ b6 ]  this allows white to win rapidly. 29 ... [ Q f5 ] offered more resistance
 [ c x d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ B b2 ]  [ d x e3 ]  [ f x e3 ] , [ N e5 ]  The issue is that I get good activity as well. Now the c-pawn is going to be my main focus.
 [ Q x e3 ]  [ R g3 ] , [ Q f4 ]  18...Qc5?? 19. [ Q h6 ] 1-0 Morozevich - Van Wely Corus Wijk aan Zee 26.1.2002. No easy life is expecting Black anyway...
 [ h x g5 ] , [ B x f7 + ]  ! Another great strike the black king is drawn into the opening and due to control of [ g5 ] white attacks him easily.
 [ d4 ] , [ Q g6 ]  Black's queen carries itself to the wrong file.
 [ B g1 ]  [ g x h2 ]  [ B f2 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ N d2 ] , [ c5 ]  the main thinking here was to eliminate that pawn on e5.
 [ N x d5 ] , [ b5 ]  I don't understand this move but best was 15...[ Q d8 ] as white could liquidate which would be to his advantage since he's ahead.
 [ B b2 ] , [ d6 ]  Joe: I gave this some thought but this time came up with a move that I like. I want to develop my [ B f1 ] in order to castle. But where to? I was thinking of playing 8.[ B b5 ] to pin your Nc6. Of course I know you can break with 8...[ B d7 ] (which is my anticipation) but that's when I usually castle at once. Now one other thing I like the pin is because I thought of 8.[ B c4 ] but then you can attack me at will with 8...[ d5 ] and then what? So I like 8.[ B b5 ] the best so far. Ken: [ B b5 ] is a very reasonable choice study the variations after [ Q a5 + ] to make sure you have defenses before playing it Joe: I don't think I do. I only saw move after 8...[ Q a5 + ] being 9.[ N c3 ] but after 9...[ N e4 ] I'm in trouble. Therefore I can't allow 8...[ Q a5 + ] so I believe that 8.[ B c3 ] is a better move. Ken: before you commit to [ B c3 ] exam ine the positions you'd have after playing [ B d2 ] or [ B e3 ] and then decide
 [ Q h4 ] , [ Q d7 ]  [ R g1 ] [ B g4 ] and after the exchange [ Q d2 ] with winning the [ b2 ] and the [ a2 ] pawn because he cannot defend the rook on a1.
 [ R g7 ]  [ R h6 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ B g3 ] , [ R g8 ]  See comment to move 15. Ubilava steadily avoids tactics if they are unclear. As Black I would have been strongly tempted to play 38. ... g4? but it looks as if White is better after 39. f4! ef 40. [ B x f4 ] [ N e5 ] 41. Bf1! Black does not want to open the position in a way that favors the bishops.
 [ B c2 ] , [ B e5 # ]  
 [ d4 ] , [ f5 ]  Another unusal choice taking us away from the English and into the Dutch.
 [ K g2 ]  [ Q g4 + ]  [ K h1 ] , [ Q h3 ]  The threat is still "on"... white has to sac the queen but even so he will lose in few moves. Thank you for reading! By the way: white could save himself two moves back as the puzzle creator engine shows but with ruinous loss of material
 [ B x e3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ b5 ] , [ B e2 ]  White has moved the bishop to [ e2 ] twice. Each time black moves a pawn developing position. Free moves for black.
 [ g6 ] , [ N g f3 ]  the damage has being done now white return his knight to [ f3 ] for make room for the whites BSD to get out and bring the rook to the open c file and take over it .
 [ B x d6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ O-O ]  ? On the other side if I have given up the center it's my fault. So I have to cope with it.
 [ B x e4 ] , [ Q x e4 ]  He side lined me for a second with that take.
 [ e x d5 ]  [ R h2 ] , [ e4 ]  Giving up the pawn to bring the heavy artillery to bear down on the exposed king (rooks in the center queen in the center ready to jump into the king's corner).
 [ f3 ] , [ Q h3 + ]  White f pawn moves up to [ f3 ] and black response is to move queen and check king at h3.
 [ K h2 ] , [ g5 ]  Black is going to push a pawn to [ g4 ] to pin and win the knight.
 [ d4 ] , [ e5 ]  Englund Gambit. I have not played against this before. According to Wikipedia the idea is for Black to move into a tactical game and away from the closed [ d4 ] openings. I thought the game definitely had more of an [ e4 ] character so I think it succeeded at that.
 [ R a1 ]  [ R e2 + ] , [ K d1 ]  Final mistake black can chackmate the king in 4 moves better was 58.[ K c3 ] and it seems that the position is lost any way but I Had few seconds left and may be after 58.[ K c3 ] I am not sure if i have enough time to win the game :)
 [ K h7 ] , [ N g5 # ]  mate with bishop and knight is possible on any size board as long as there is a corner the same color as bishop. In Judo Chess or chess with passing it is mate on any size board in any-colored corner.
 [ Q f3 ]  [ B x c3 + ] , [ b x c3 ]  9. [ B x c3 ] - a B for N trade after white plays a very strong move.
 [ B b5 ] , [ B x d4 ]  I liked this !
 [ h4 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ h5 ] , [ h6 ]  It seems that with 12...[ h6 ] Black does not get enough compensation for the pawn...
 [ B x c4 ] , [ Q x c4 ]  Now Black's attack is as potent as White's I think.
 [ Q f5 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ Q x f6 ] , [ N e5 ]  Centralising the knight to strike into enemy territory allowing for some play with the f-pawn to further control the center. (perhaps the a2-[ c4 ] wing with a f4-[ h2 ] wing supporting the knight and rooks in the center?). The knight controls the king's potential flight square of f7.
 [ Q x f3 ]  [ Q x f3 ] , [ g x f3 ]  which happened opening up a line to the king
 [ N b d2 ] , [ N x f3 + ]  ?! But playing this made it quite easy for me. I thought he play a different in which I'd be struggling more. However I can exchange and when I do I'll be able to get my remaining piece into play at once.
 [ K c6 ]  [ R x h7 ]  [ K d6 ] , [ R h6 ]  With that I resigned here. First I'm way behind with pretty much nothing left. More importantly it's the fact that he has more time then me. So when all was said and done he had 22 minutes left which isn't a lot. But I had only 17.5 minutes left. Well first he's going to win my [ f6 ] pawn in addition to what I've already lost. However before he could continue and perhaps promote or checkmate me I'm going to lose on time. So with no way to prevent a timeout and knowing a win is not far off I threw in the towel. Tom told me that overall I played extremely well until the very end. Jack said that it was a very interesting game. But allowing Tom to break through with the pawn is what sealed my fate. Then Nathan said that this happened when I allowed him to capture en-pessant. By that he implied 23...h5?? which is indeed what sealed me fate. As after breaking through and promoting Tom was able to win too much material for me to have the slightest chance of counterplay.
 [ e3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ R c1 ] , [ c6 ]  Electing to not try for ...P-[ Q B4 ] the standard freeing move.
 [ N g3 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ N h5 ]  [ f6 ]  [ R f2 ]  [ B e8 ]  [ N g3 ]  [ B g6 ]  [ N h2 ]  [ h5 ]  [ N f5 ]  [ B x f5 ]  [ R x f5 ]  [ K g7 ]  [ R a f1 ]  [ Q e8 ] , [ h4 ]  [!]
 [ Q d3 + ]  [ K b2 ]  [ Q b5 + ] , [ K c1 ]  ??? My turn to blunder and return the courtesy "UNFORCED MISTAKE" they would say! :-)
 [ B e7 ] , [ a4 ]  I thought my opponent would like to play [ b5 ] followed by [ B b7 ] So i wanted to prevent it.
 [ g x f3 ]  [ e ] , [ p ]  Even with this I get a better pawn structure
 [ K d6 ] , [ h4 ]  29. [ h4 ] - holding back g5.
 [ Q h4 ] , [ B d7 ]  This move was a bit too passive for me. 12...[ B e6 ] seems fine and controls [ d5 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ B x e5 ] , [ N x e5 ]  ...Nxe5? Better was Qd8; giving up the e-file but keeping the one pawn advantage
 [ O-O ] , [ O-O ]  At this point the game seems to be fairly balanced. It was about here where I thought I would have preferred White's LSB to be sitting at d3.
 [ B e7 ]  [ f4 ] , [ Q d7 ]  I did think Black would have castled (K-side) instead. True after 11...0-0 12.[ e5 ] would have been an inconvenience to Black but so it will be anyway. But perhaps Black was already apprehensive of a White K-side assault and was preparing to duck over to the other wing. But check out which way White's pawns are pointing! A harbinger?
 [ K a3 ] , [ b5 ]  Threatening [ Q a4 ] mate
 [ e x d5 ] , [ N b8 ]  And now black is un-developing - all still according to the World DB. It's like this knight had anywhere better to go; it would just be driven away from [ d4 ] or [ b4 ] [ a5 ] would be useful to eliminate white's bishop at [ c4 ] but the knight can just as well make his way to [ d7 ] and then be well-centered and available for battle on either wing.
 [ a x b5 ]  [ N x b5 ]  [ B b4 + ]  [ c3 ]  [ B a5 ]  [ N c7 + ] , [ Q x c7 ]  Forced note that if 11...[ K f8 ] 12.[ N x a8 ] [ Q x a8 ] 13.Qd6+! followed by 14.[ Q a3 ] and 15.[ b4 ] will snare my bishop. I'm not so sure about 11...[ K e7 ] though if anyone has analysis that would be great.
 [ R d5 ]  [ R b6 ] , [ Q b3 ]  Its just a case of finishing me off so i will set back and let you watch.
 [ R c8 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ N b4 ]  [ N a4 ] , [ O-O ]  ..no..i dont know why i did not play Rxc2...but i sometime play moves quickly at work...
 [ N x e2 + ]  [ B x e2 ]  [ B x e2 ]  [ Q x e2 ] , [ R c8 ]  Adding pressure to my Nc3.
 [ B h6 ] , [ Q b2 + ]  Forcing the exchange of Queens.
 [ b5 ] , [ B b3 ]  Another save the piece on a bit of defence right now and if going to to be lost at least take some equal piece with it.
 [ N x e4 ] , [ B x e4 ]  OK white has let me in lets see if I can get him to take the bait I see a Queen King fork if I can get my knight to b3....will need to support that with [ R b8 ] to pin that pawn. Moving my knight he should move pawn and get the double attack on my rook and bishop.
 [ N c4 ] , [ e x f7 + ]  15.[ Q d3 ] seems to lead into transposition of the game after 15...[ Q b4 ] 16.[ R d2 ] b2.
 [ K f8 ]  [ K d4 ]  [ K e7 ]  [ K e5 ]  [ f6 + ]  [ K e4 ]  [ g6 ]  [ K d4 ] , [ K d6 ]  Black now has the opposition.
 [ R d8 ] , [ N g6 ]  white has good piece co-ordination and realises that this move takes advantage of blacks lack of piece of coordination.
 [ N f6 ]  [ B d3 ] , [ Q c7 ]  Admitting perhaps that 6...[ Q a5 ] was an error but black would have been better developing.
 [ Q x d6 ] , [ a5 ]  but it wasn't played??
 [ f6 ] , [ N c6 ]  I took a long time over this move but couldn't really see anything better. Ultimately though it allows white to occupy the hole on [ c6 ] and hopefully make black a bit uncomfortable.
 [ Q b2 ]  [ K e4 ] , [ Q x h2 ]  51. ........ [ Q x h2 ] - stage 1 - one of the kingside pawns drops.
 [ Q f2 ] , [ Q h4 ]  This leaves behind the [ c5 ] square (Hoping to exchange queens and move into a winning end game. )
 [ B c2 ]  [ K e2 ]  [ K d5 ]  [ K d2 ] , [ B a4 ]  38 ...... Ba4?? - should have dropped a piece there due to [ b3 ] but incredibly I overlook it with 39. Kd3?? - and even more incredibly I did not realise this until Coach Ion pointed it out in a post-match analysis pm - a mutual bad hair day for the pair of us!
 [ B d5 ]  [ N b4 ] , [ Q x e5 ]  and black loses his rook
 [ d x c4 ]  [ B x c4 ] , [ N f6 ]  all my pieces are now developed my king is about to castle anytime and black is not exactly coordinated. [ e5 ] is not an option to open the game... I don't see anything for them and I will restrict him other possibilities
 [ R d2 x d6 ]  [ R x d6 ] , [ R x d6 ]  I'm up one Pawn in a Rook endgame. With exact play Black can hold the position but I have a definite advantage.
 [ N x e4 ] , [ d5 ]  'course not! Black has just reintroduced me to a tactic that I had not encountered for a long long time. Personally I really hate it when this happens!
 [ N d5 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ B f6 ] , [ R e2 ]  Protects the pawn but disconnects the rooks.
 [ R d7 ]  [ K g6 ]  [ R x b7 ]  [ N c5 ]  [ R b5 ]  [ a4 ] , [ K b1 ]  31. [ K b1 ] - not 31. Ra5?? - this allows [ N b3 ] forking king and rook.
 [ h5 ]  [ N a6 ]  [ h6 ]  [ g6 ]  [ g3 ]  [ b4 ]  [ a x b4 ]  [ B x b4 ]  [ K f1 ] , [ B b7 ]  this is played with an eye to setting up operations on the longest diagonal.
 [ R e7 + ] , [ K d4 ]  Black opts not to block his pawn. He can protect it from where he is and can potentially snap up the c-pawn and make another passed pawn for himself. Black isn't too worried about facing a flurry of White checks and should eventually penetrate the White position.
 [ B f5 ]  [ f3 ]  [ h6 ] , [ g4 ]  Black's slow development leaves him open to pawn pressure which will be the theme of the game. The black bishop especially exerts no power in the game until far too late.
 [ N d6 ]  [ f4 ] , [ N x b7 ]  A move that would often be overlooked in favor of more offensive moves. This demonstrates the big difference in the way humans and computers think. Humans typically evaluate moves that fit in with their overall strategy and current plan while computers evaluate all moves. Deep Blue "sees" that Kasparov is attacking but really does not care because there is no real threat. Many humans would see black's attack and think that they were in deep s***.
 [ N x b5 ] , [ f6 ]  Ken attacks the B and I wonder what to do. Like before I would've played 15.Qxa8?! if I didn't have that dream. All I would've thought contrary to the second game with Kenneth_fiore_3 is that this puts me ahead which should be enough for the win. But I have changed at this point for good since I finally figured out what's really been affecting my thought process. And what is still there is the N visualization count. This accounts for a good amount of mobility which is going to be overwhelming. At first I'd still try to get a Rook. However there is one more variation that I looked at which appears to win the Q instead. It was after I checked that made me realize that I don't even need it as the patience is only growing here. Otherwise I would've taken with 16.[ N x a8 ] getting more then what I would've won earlier.
 [ f5 ]  [ R x f2 ] , [ f6 ]  And this very first thing that I keep in mind here is that passed pawns must be pushed. Of course Tom will deliver a series of checks but that does not bother me.
 [ g x h5 ]  [ R h1 ]  [ Q e3 + ] , [ K b1 ]  good move white must play carefully the move 22.Kb2?could give black minimum draw for example :22...Nd3+.23.cxd-(23.Kb1-Qxf3! and black won )23...Qxe2.24.Ka1-[ Q d3 + ] and black can drew this game by internal check .
 [ Q x d2 ] , [ N f5 ]  White has won material but has not yet won the game. This seems to be the best square available for the knight.
 [ Q d8 ] , [ a4 ]  If ..[ b x a4 ] 14. [ R x a4 ] white has all the options with rooks controlling two half open files bishops well placed in the middle and a better center. This has followed the game Alexey Ivanov vs Ivan Morev played in 2004 but just for a few more moves.
 [ N x e4 ]  [ B x e4 ] , [ B e6 ]  Pinning the weak pawn to the WQ and she to its defense. How undignified.
 [ a5 ]  [ O-O ]  [ Q d6 ] , [ e5 ]  Just to annoy him really. And to push back his position.
 [ N f3 ] , [ N b4 ]  Posting the knight to keep it protected
 [ e x f3 ]  [ N x f3 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ B c4 ]  maine line in order to castle an and develop h rook on f colon for later
 [ B b4 + ] , [ K f2 ]  I'm not too sure how I feel about this move. On the one hand White is anticipating the coming endgame by keeping his King centralized. It also is the least disruptive to White's current plans. On the other hand it's not the endgame *yet* by any means so Black might be able to make some tactical opportunities against the exposed centralized King. In the game I was expecting 18.Bd2.
 [ R x b3 + ]  [ K x b3 ] , [ K f6 ]  Now I just need to promote.
 [ d4 ] , [ B d7 ]  Eliminates the pawn doubling potential.
 [ e5 ]  [ B e3 ] , [ f5 ]  ...[ a6 ] would have been sounder play but even then the game would have been in favor of the first player.
 [ R g3 + ]  [ K c2 ]  [ R a3 ]  [ R f7 + ]  [ K d6 ]  [ R a7 ]  [ K d5 ]  [ K b2 ]  [ R d3 ]  [ R x a6 ] , [ R x d4 ]  The good news is it is still a draw. The bad news is now Carlsen can play for another 50 moves since a pawn exchange was made!
 [ R g8 ]  [ Q g5 ] , [ Q d8 ]  I think 28.....[ Q f8 ] would be better...
 [ R e6 + ] , [ K f3 ]  and resigns.
 [ d4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ e4 ] , [ e5 ]  Queen's pawn opening. This move is very unusual--[ d5 ] is the overwhelmingly most popular response.
 [ R d4 ] , [ R c8 + ]  I check to get my Knight out from the pin.
 [ h5 ]  [ R d2 ]  [ B d7 ] , [ N x d6 ]  I'd like to claim this was a clever trap but it wasn't. 24.Nxd6? is a mistake 24...[ B x h3 ] looks to be winning. One line could be :- 25.[ N x c8 ] [ R x d2 ] 26.[ N x e7 ] [ K x e7 ] 27.[ g x h3 ] [ N x h3 ] 28.[ K g2 ] [ N x f2 ]  [ R x d6 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ R e d1 ]  [ R x d6 ]  [ R x d6 ] , [ R c6 ]  After the dust has cleared the weak b pawns look very vulnerable.
 [ c6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ d5 ] , [ f3 ]  The fantasy variation.
 [ O-O ]  [ B c4 ]  [ d6 ] , [ d3 ]  i tried to attack the opponent queen with my bishop
 [ N c3 ]  [ b4 ]  [ a x b4 ]  [ a x b4 ]  [ N d1 ] , [ R c6 c2 ]  threating [ N e4 ] and Re2#.
 [ a6 ] , [ d4 ]  I suppose black's 2. ... [ a6 ] keeps me from transposing to the Ruy Lopez. A shame because that's what I play for when black lets me.
 [ d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ B g4 + ]  [ B e2 ]  [ B x e2 + ] , [ K x e2 ]  It's now down to the rooks
 [ f x e4 ] , [ f x e4 ]  So here it cames the "big think". The "normal" is: [ B x e4 ] [ d x e4 ] [ Q x e4 ] Qxg5. Leading to a lost endgame because of the black pawns. So my choices are: 1) Nf3. The queen must go away so to release the pin say [ Q d6 ] (threatening Qg3. How much dangerous is it?) or Qd8. Then [ B x e4 ] etc. 3) Qc1. She retires the queen and again I have to choose between try to keep the extra bishop (almost useless for now) or sac it for 2 pawns and a more free position. Essentially the question is: it is better to play a bad position with one piece for three free pawns or a better position with even material? And the answers is: it is better the former IF THE 3 pawns can be stopped or taken. And I wasn't sure. So...
 [ Q c7 ] , [ N x d4 ]  At first glance it appears that white has solved the problem but black has another tactic ready.
 [ N x d4 ]  [ B c6 ]  [ e5 ] , [ N f d5 ]  Now I have a plan if I take [ e6 ] with one knight then the other I can fork Rook and Queen.
 [ R f c1 ] , [ Q b6 ]  Black is aiming at my e-pawn..
 [ f4 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ N b3 ] , [ f6 ]  This gaurds the threat of 12.e5.
 [ a3 ]  [ N a6 ] , [ R b1 ]  White is planning a queenside attack but I'm not worried still.
 [ N d4 ]  [ B x e2 ]  [ N x e2 ]  [ R d2 ] , [ e6 ]  [ R d5 ] and I can start writing this game epitaph...
 [ R x f7 ] , [ R h4 + ]  45. ..... [ R h4 + ] - I wanna get my rook to [ h2 ] to get among white's remaining pawns but first I want to drive back the WK. If the WK moves to [ f5 ] however I can always force a K & P ending with Rf4+.
 [ f x g5 ]  [ N c5 ] , [ B f7 ]  I am skeptical of this move. My idea was that Ipatov was trying to exchange rooks with Re8+. However with white having doubled pawns it might not be too difficult to get a draw if that was the case. Maybe white wanted to try [ g6 ] in an attempt to un-double his pawns.
 [ N x g5 ]  [ h x g5 ] , [ f4 ]  try to weaken his king side and obstacles on kiing side
 [ R e8 ]  [ B b5 ] , [ R e6 ]  ether 23...[ R e5 ] didnt help so much to Kasparov after 24.Bd6!-Rexb5.25.Nxb5-Rxb5.26.Ra8-Nb7.27.Bc7! and win .
 [ Q g5 ]  [ Q c7 ] , [ O-O ]  !? True castling on an opened column but I bet white is in no position to exploit.
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ e6 ] , [ e3 ]  Unusual but very solid. [ c4 ] is more popular
 [ Q x d8 ] , [ Q h5 ]  many threats... looking for forks and mate...
 [ K f2 ] , [ K f4 ]  Keeping White's attention here.
 [ N x e4 ]  [ f x e4 ] , [ N d2 ]  So overall now I am slightly ahead in development black has doubled pawns on e which could result in a closed centre.
 [ b x c6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B e7 ]  [ B e3 ] , [ O-O ]  Both sides have made natural developing moves. White's best is now [ K h1 ] or [ f4 ] hitting black's pawn centre before he gets the chance of advancing in the centre.
 [ N x e5 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ B x e5 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ B g7 ]  ?! My immediate reaction when Mike showed us this game was that this was an inaccuracy. Black should play 27. … Bf6. We have all been conditioned by experience to put the bishop on [ g7 ] because we have seen so many thousands of fianchettoed bishops. By contrast the bishop on [ f6 ] looks a little bit loose and strange. But you have to play the concrete position in front of you. The point of 27. … B[ f6 ] is to throw a monkey wrench into White’s plans on the kingside. If 28. [ N g5 ] Black can play 28. … [ B x g5 ] 29. [ Q x g5 ] [ B x e4 ] 30. [ R x e4 ] [ R d5 ] 31. [ Q h6 ] [ R h5 ] with advantage according to Rybka.
 [ f6 ]  [ R h f8 ]  [ f7 ] , [ R e7 ]  I thought that Plan B was the "impossible plan by now and that C was too risky and it gets me into traps. This move was not necessary. 31...Rxe6! is what I missed. 32.[ R x e6 ] [ Q d5 + ] would prove that plan B was still alive.
 [ g4 ]  [ Q b6 ] , [ b3 ]  Allows the castle and the another rook enter in the game but this move puts my pawns in ligth squares and difficult the endgame. It`s a weak move best are 15 [ B x f6 ] [ B x f6 ] 16 gxh5. Permite el enroque entrando la otra torre em juego pero coloca a mis peones en casillas blancas dificultando el final. Es un movimiento débil mejor era 15 A[ x f6 ] A[ x f6 ] 16 gxh5.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ c3 ]  [ c3 ] is a very interesting move I used to play it myself a bit because it was in the first opening book I ever read. Igor Nikolayev the strongest player in Rochester also plays the move.
 [ R x d4 ]  [ R x b7 ]  [ N e7 ]  [ b4 ]  [ R d2 ]  [ a4 ]  [ R b2 ] , [ N x a6 ]  This is The end Beautiful friend This is the end My only friend the end...
 [ N g6 ]  [ R f7 ]  [ N x f8 ]  [ R x f8 ]  [ Q g4 ]  [ N b6 x d5 ] , [ Q e6 + ]  27. [ Q e6 ] ......... The killer - I cannot avoid losing a piece for a pawn and on analysis after seeing the resulting position I decided not to continue the game especially as my opponent is a 2300 strong MASTER!!
 [ B c4 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ B d2 ]  So far we're still in GK's database with a 53%-40% edge to White. Nothing out of the ordinary yet seemingly standard developing moves.
 [ N c3 ] , [ d5 ]  ?! Not a great pawn sac. Maybe [ N x c3 ] should have been considered?
 [ B c4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ O-O ] , [ N x e4 ]  going to need to trick them into moving their pieces
 [ K h3 ] , [ R g7 ]  There is nothing White can do now...
 [ K h8 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N b d7 ] , [ f3 ]  Wasn't quite sure what to do here. I like the formation pretty much as it is and I'm slowly learning about letting threats hang rather than charge in for swapsies. So this is a bit of a nothing move to try and add to the central domination.
 [ R f7 ]  [ f3 ]  [ R a f8 ]  [ Q d3 ]  [ N d7 ] , [ B e3 ]  25. [ B e3 ] - after a load of prophylaxis ([ f3 ] to ensure Julia's heavies are biting on granite) I complete my development on move 25.
 [ B c5 ]  [ N x c6 ] , [ Q f6 ]  Avoids doubled pawns but somewhat exposes the queen.
 [ Q x c5 ]  [ B x c5 + ] , [ K e1 ]  What else? But now... can you see? [ c3 ] has no defence and the rook is trapped by the knight and a bishop can go to d4. This means white will lose a piece as a minimum. But I have the knight's problem to solve. How?
 [ B f4 ] , [ N b4 ]  But no sense in just letting the knight sit on the edge forever. So will he use [ N c3 ] to get the knight out and protect the pawn or will he retreat the bishop to c4? The good thing about [ N c3 ] for me is that my knight becomes safe from pawns. I'm looking at [ B f5 ] to put more pressure on his c-pawn and it gives my pawn on [ d6 ] more protection. If he plays [ N c3 ] I wonder if I can risk [ a6 ] and cut off my knight's retreat and then b5. I haven't looked at that in depth yet but it looks like to win the pawn on [ b5 ] (attacked by the pawn on [ a4 ] a knight and a bishop) I would get the pawn on d5. Lots of possibilities.
 [ b6 ] , [ N b4 ]  Yes the knight is being pinned to the rook but it is easy to get out of.
 [ d x e5 ]  [ d x e5 ] , [ N d5 ]  Good move but I needed to open the game a little.
 [ O-O ] , [ d6 ]  5. .......... [ d6 ] - opens up the c8-[ h3 ] diagonal for Frere Leblanc.
 [ B x g4 ]  [ e5 ] , [ N c3 ]  White has to mobilize his pieces and create an attack as quickly as possible while constraining Black or White gives away the advantage.
 [ K c3 ]  [ Q x g1 ] , [ N d2 ]  Ooh ooh Nd1+! Followed by NxQ or QxQ.
 [ d x e5 ] , [ f x e5 ]  5..... [ d x e5 ] 6. [ f x e5 ] exchange of centre pawns and now Black has two options to attack the White centre 6....[ [ c5 ] ] OR 6....[ N c6 ] If first option then best play and response is considered 6.....[ [ c5 ] ] 7. [ d5 ] [ e6 ] 8. [ N c3 ] ex[ d5 ] 9. cx[ d5 ] [ c4 ] 10. [ N f3 ] [ B g4 ] 11. [ Q d4 ] [ b x f3 ] 12 [ g x f3 ] [ B b4 ] 13 Bx[ c4 ] 0-0 14 Bh6.... Black's alternative's leave White in advantage (14....[ g x h6 ] 14..... Nx[ c4 ] 14....N8d7)
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N g5 ]  [ B c5 ] , [ N x f7 ]  As ever the game starts in this thematic position...
 [ N b d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ] , [ Q b6 ]  Black put a preasure on [ d4 ] and in-direct on [ f2 ] and [ b2 ] I would say that black have a small advantage white pices are almost all on the first line.
 [ B c6 ]  [ R f3 f4 ]  [ R a8 ] , [ Q h5 ]  Tripling pieces against Blacks f-pawn.
 [ B e5 ]  [ N x c6 ]  [ B x b2 ]  [ N b4 ]  [ R x a5 ] , [ g3 ]  another inaccuracy... better [ d4 ] [ B x a3 ] [ N d3 ] [ B e6 ] g3...
 [ B x c3 ]  [ N x c3 ] , [ N x c3 ]  Black decided to remove the knights... But the advantage for White grew with...
 [ N f6 ] , [ d3 ]  Can't trap the LSB behind the white pawns so 5. [ d3 ] does an excellent job of defending e4.
 [ N f6 + ]  [ K c6 ] , [ N x d5 ]  It's unclear to me why White did not nab the rook.
 [ g6 ]  [ d3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ B e3 ] , [ b6 ]  I think [ d6 ] is a bit better...
 [ a5 ]  [ Q g4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ B x d4 ]  [ B x d4 + ]  [ K g2 ] , [ c5 ]  no use in [ B x b2 ] Rb1: but this is even worse...
 [ B b4 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ B e7 ] , [ a6 ]  a very nice move. the idea is to break pawn structure in black's queen side.
 [ R a6 ] , [ K g2 ]  avoiding ...[ Q b6 ] with a pin on f2.
 [ K g2 ]  [ R a d8 ]  [ Q a3 ]  [ R d8 d2 ]  [ Q x a7 ]  [ R a1 ]  [ Q b8 + ]  [ K h7 ] , [ Q f8 ]  drawn by agreement both players had less than 5 mins remaining.
 [ N c6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B f5 ] , [ B a3 ]  i didn't see active positions on the c1-[ h6 ] diagonal for my DSB therefore i developed my DSB to [ a3 ] which pines the [ e7 ] pawn and doesn't give black to close my LSB however maybe better was 13.[ a4 ] first so if will be [ N a5 ] so i will able to move [ B a2 ] and stay on the diagonal a2-[ g8 ] .
 [ Q b6 ] , [ R e1 + ]  His king gonna be in a bad position too.
 [ Q b3 ] , [ B x c3 + ]  The first intermezzo...
 [ R e8 e7 ]  [ Q h5 ] , [ Q d7 ]  35. ….. [ Q d7 ] - and Glenda yet again earns her sobriquet Glenda the Defender. But hopefully not too long!
 [ R e d8 ] , [ B x a6 ]  not q[ x b6 ] because [ b x a6 ] is safer move
 [ d x c6 ] , [ K h1 ]  White's idea is to go with [ f4 ] and [ [ e5 ] ] and advance on the kingside.However this move should not be played because it does not develop the queen or help with the opening goals in a position that could become open. To be most active the white bishop can go to [ g5 ] and the rooks can be developed to the open files. Black suffers no problems here because he will be able to play [ [ e5 ] ] and develop nicely as well.
 [ b4 ]  [ R x a4 ]  [ R x a4 ]  [ B x a4 ]  [ N x e6 ]  [ R f5 ]  [ N x g7 ] , [ K x g7 ]  Maybe [ K d4 ] is better. Or [ R d4 ] before f4. I don't know. But the real winning move here is another. I didn't play it.
 [ K h2 ]  [ Q x a4 ] , [ Q e4 ]  this is the awfull BIG blunder i did on this game i should loose my queen ([ B d4 ] g1+...Qa4xQe4). I dont now wy maybe duarte wanted to give me a chance ?
 [ N x c3 ] , [ d x c3 ]  6. [ d x c3 ] - Dave captures with the d pawn rather than the b pawn. Dave is planning to put his queen the Wicked Witch of the West on [ d5 ] and so this pawn recapture opens up the d file for that purpose.
 [ R b4 ]  [ K d5 ] , [ a4 ]  Taking the [ b5 ] square. [ a4 ] doesn't work as well because the rook is put in an awkward spot.
 [ Q e7 ] , [ B x g5 ]  The bishop is immune due to the pin.
 [ K g8 ] , [ N x e5 ]  Now the final warrior from the other side has been vanquished but I know Jeff too well to let up. He will not quit until every chance at a victory or a stalemate has been exhausted.
 [ b4 ]  [ a3 ]  [ a5 ]  [ R e4 ]  [ R a b8 ] , [ a4 ]  Didn't like this move. Thought it better to keep tension on black's game. This move frees the [ b8 ] rook from it's defensive duties.
 [ d5 ]  [ e3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ d x c4 ]  [ B x c4 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ Q f3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ N g e7 ] , [ e4 ]  an early mistake that dropes a pawn after ...[ B b6 ] 8. [ B e3 ] [ a6 ] 9.[ B a4 ] [ b5 ] 10. [ B b3 ] Nxd4.
 [ R x f7 ] , [ Q e6 ]  I will maintain intense pressure on [ f7 ] until I not only regain all of my lost material but gain more than I had before I started sacking. The knight on [ g5 ] ensures the threat is great enough to stop him simply giving me back the material and equalizing.
 [ B f4 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ g4 ]  [ N h4 ]  [ N x h4 ] , [ B x h4 ]  oh oh . . .Bishop is now trapped with g5!
 [ N x c8 ]  [ R a x c8 ] , [ Q c2 ]  Reinforcing the pawn?
 [ Q x e2 ] , [ N d4 ]  The only play that saves the knight and still pressures white.
 [ N x g5 ]  [ h x g5 ] , [ f x g5 ]  forced...
 [ N c3 ] , [ b5 ]  threatening ...[ b4 ]  [ R e8 ] , [ R d e1 ]  support [ e4 ] and x-raying the black queen.
 [ N e4 ] , [ h4 ]  ? Opening up squares for black to take advantage of.
 [ Q g3 ] , [ Q b6 ]  Threatening [ c4 + ] winning the bishop. Putting more pressure on the white king.
 [ d5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ B g5 ]  My favorite French trick though I never get to pull it off is to follow 4. [ B g5 ] with 5. [ e5 ] and win a knight. Black never seems to let me do it though. I blame the GK DB... Nevertheless it's a good way to develop a piece with a threat and it nearly forces black's reply.
 [ R x e7 ] , [ K f8 ]  This wasn't played simply to attack the Rook. Instead I remember what happened in my most recent loss against Fred as we're in a similar situation believe it or not. I almost surpassed 25 moves but made one mistake by leaving my monarch pinned since the Rook did not move off of where it should've been. Although we can't depend on my inactive [ R h8 ] the same thing applies but even more so here. They're threatening an immediate mating net because of white's Ng5. So if this weren't played the next move would be 24.[ R d8 # ] Like that other game I wouldn't have lasted 25 moves so the idea was to learn from the mistake and prevent history from repeating itself. That is despite being in a lost position as unlike before I've marked down the 25 move mark.
 [ R b3 ] , [ Q f6 ]  (WH) Objectively 30... Q-[ N4 ] immediately is better but I hoped for the continuation 31 KR-[ N1 ] N-[ K7 ] ch! 32 NxN PxN 33 P-[ B3 ] QxP! 34 RxQ RxR 35 QxR ch K-[ R3 ] and White's extra Queen doesn't help.
 [ N h5 ]  [ R x h5 ]  [ R f g8 ]  [ R h1 ]  [ d5 ] , [ N e4 ]  The [ d5 ] pawn is pinned to his queen. He has to defend against the mother of all forks when I play Nf6. He could continue with [ R e6 ] and eventually give up that rook but at this point Aleks sees the writing on the wall and resigns.
 [ B x a3 ]  [ Q a1 ]  [ f6 ] , [ g4 ]  Black blocks my powerful diagonal so I play for g2-g4-[ g5 ] to try to dislodge that pesky f6-pawn.
 [ f x e5 ] , [ K x e5 ]  White has unstoppable pawns well supported by the king. Black has no counter threats.
 [ h x g5 ] , [ Q g6 + ]  If he had taken with [ f x g5 ] that would merely change this move to checkmate.
 [ N e4 ]  [ Q x c2 ]  [ B x c2 ]  [ R c8 ]  [ N x f6 + ] , [ B x f6 ]  BxN exerts pressure along the long diagonal and pins white's DSB momentarily while black's rook still threatens white's LSB
 [ d3 ]  [ N b d7 ]  [ N b d2 ]  [ e5 ] , [ c4 ]  Interesting.
 [ e5 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ c4 ]  [ N b6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ d6 ] , [ B d3 ]  unusual only one game on the database and that was a draw.
 [ Q a5 ]  [ Q d2 ] , [ N d7 ]  With White moving his queen from the d1-[ h5 ] diagonal it would have been an opportune time to play N[ h5 ] to attack the DSB and remove it from the game. This board will favor bishops and it would be worth the effort to offer an exchange. The [ d6 ] pawn is very weak and needs some protection.
 [ Q x f7 ]  [ R h f8 ]  [ Q x h7 ]  [ R f2 ]  [ Q x g6 ]  [ Q x e2 + ]  [ K c1 ] , [ Q x c2 # ]  
 [ N e4 ] , [ N e5 ]  Black gets a knight and pawn for a knight or bishop. Not a great trade. White also loses control over the center.
 [ e x d4 ] , [ B f4 ]  8. [ B f4 ] - develops and attacks the Wicked Witch. Notice how Fou Lenoir is defended by the knight on d5!
 [ O-O ] , [ R d5 ]  Bringing my rook into the game
 [ N d7 ] , [ Q f3 ]  Knight is withdrawn to one of its two safe squares and my Queen is ready to advance into the fray threatening to get to [ h3 ] then the pounce on h7.
 [ R a1 ]  [ Q g7 + ]  [ K h5 ] , [ Q x h7 # ]  And Graeme sportingly allows me to play the final move in one of my most hard-fought victories ever. Cheers mate I'm sure I'll pay for that win with many more defeats in the future.
 [ Q e3 + ]  [ K h1 ]  [ Q f2 ]  [ R c1 ] , [ R e3 ]  29. ..... [ R e3 ] - suddenly Henry is starting to feel a little cold. Hello is that chessic Grim Reaper Old Matey coming to pay him a visit? We shall soon see.
 [ B e6 ]  [ Q e5 + ]  [ K e7 ]  [ Q g7 + ]  [ K d6 ]  [ Q x b7 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ e5 + ]  [ K e7 ]  [ N f4 ]  [ Q g8 ] , [ N d5 + ]  
 [ N d2 ]  [ B e6 ] , [ c4 ]  Another white blunder? P[ d4 ] is vulnerable with that idle threat.
 [ Q x d5 ] , [ N x d5 ]  puts my knight in a more dangerous position
 [ R h3 ] , [ K c8 ]  Black attempts to dodge the incoming artillery. I think 17...[ B d6 ] would have been much better; he desperately needs to get his last two pieces out.
 [ R e1 + ] , [ K f8 ]  Another difficult decision. On 15... N-[ K2 ] 16 N-[ B4 ] O-O-O 17 Q-[ R4 ] White's attack comes first.
 [ R d8 ]  [ Q c7 + ] , [ R d7 ]  WT resigns!
 [ c x d4 ] , [ e x d4 ]  Any doubt this is the best way to take?
 [ Q d2 ] , [ K h8 ]  Where else can the knight escape to? possibly 8...f5.
 [ N e5 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ Q x e5 ] , [ N e4 ]  Black knight is trying to get back. Here better cut the Knight then Black Pawns will be doubled in the e file. May be bit advantage for the White side.
 [ Q e2 ] , [ a5 ]  Well if he doesn't go for the queenside I will. Of course I should have developed but... castling under the open g column? No thank you.
 [ B x d6 ]  [ c x d6 ]  [ R e8 + ]  [ B f8 ]  [ Q d4 ] , [ N a6 ]  Alternative variation: $7 22... [ N d3 ] 23. [ Q x d3 ] [ B d7 ] 24. [ R x b8 ] [ Q x b8 ] 25. [ N d4 ]  [ Q c3 ]  [ Q x c3 ]  [ b x c3 ]  [ N x c4 ]  [ N d3 + ]  [ K g3 ]  [ N x c1 ]  [ R x c1 ] , [ R d8 ]  Cool!
 [ B x c4 ] , [ e6 ]  [ e6 ] to open the bishop.....
 [ N x e7 + ]  [ N x e7 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ B x e4 ] , [ R e1 ]  I completely did NOT see that coming. I spent a good 2 minutes of my clock trying to see a way out here.
 [ K g3 ]  [ N g6 ]  [ R x h5 ]  [ a x b4 ]  [ R a h1 ] , [ b x a3 ]  now the matting combo is like : 34. [ B x g6 ] [ f x g6 ] 35. [ R h8 + ] [ K [ f7 ] ] 36. R1[ h7 + ] [ K e6 ] 37. [ R x d8 ] [ K f5 ] 38. [ f7 ] [ K x g5 ] 39. [ R x d5 + ] [ K f6 ] 40. [ f8 = Q + ] [ K e6 ] 41. [ R e5 # ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ N f6 ]  3. ...... [ N f6 ] - a perfectly quiet normal Four Knights Opening but next move that is gonna change!
 [ f4 ]  [ K b2 ] , [ g5 ]  47. [ g5 ] - up they go 3 more squares to Glendadom!
 [ c x d5 ] , [ e x d5 ]  This was played so far with ease.
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ c4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ c6 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ e3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B d3 ]  [ d x c4 ]  [ B x c4 ]  [ N b d7 ]  [ O-O ] , [ c5 ]  Now the Houdini chess engine thinks white should play [ d x c5 ] [ N x c5 ] [ Q c2 ] with a slightly bigger edge but this is hard to understand why white has any advantage at all.
 [ B b3 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N f6 ] , [ d4 ]  7. [ d3 ] is the more conservative move but I think this move puts a bit more pressure on. If 7...[ e x d4 ] then 8. [ e5 ] causes trouble. If 8...n[ e4 ] then 9. Bd5! Threatening n[ x d4 ] regaining the pawn with lots of threats. If instead 8...n[ g4 ] 9. [ R e1 ] followed by [ h3 ] and black is struggling to hold on to everything. Better for black is the game continuation getting things developed and ignoring free pawns!
 [ K e1 ]  [ Q x g5 ] , [ h3 ]  [ h4 ] would have been the better threat. Or Be2?
 [ R x b3 ]  [ R x d7 ] , [ Q b8 ]  Desperate... but abandoning the bishop to its fate was unnecessary. This is the first move actually called a mistake by the GK engine. Although 25...[ Q e8 ] looked horribly passive it is not so easy for White to find a convincing follow up. I would just about have to find 26.[ B c1 ] to guarantee the lives of my extra pawns and then unravel the rest of my pieces and that move had not yet crossed my mind.. At the time I was imagining I'd play 26.[ Q c7 ] but after 26...[ B d8 ] 27.[ Q d6 ] [ R x b2 ] Black would have been well back in the game despite the pawn less. Her superior bishop and active rook would have been enough to stay at least roughly on terms.
 [ B x f3 ]  [ R f e8 ]  [ Q e3 ] , [ a5 ]  ? [ R b d8 ] was probably better (see the follow up of the game)
 [ d5 ]  [ c4 ] , [ e6 ]  Queen's gambit declined. Doesn't work out for black so often on the game DB here but I believe it to be more than solid.
 [ K e3 ] , [ N g2 + ]  White resigned.
 [ O-O ]  [ b4 ]  [ B d7 ] , [ B b2 ]  Fianchetto the bishop along the main diagonal.
 [ N b d2 ] , [ e4 ]  This advance is not good for black until he doesn't threat [ f2 ] seriously. It is better for him to keep the central tension and control.
 [ N c4 ]  [ Q e7 ]  [ d6 ]  [ c x d6 ]  [ Q x d6 ]  [ Q x d6 ] , [ N x d6 ]  White has won the opening...
 [ c x d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N g e7 ] , [ c3 ]  white doesnt grab the pawn because 11.[ Q x g7 ] [ R g8 ] 12.[ Q x h7 ] [ N x d4 ] 13.[ N x d4 ] [ Q c3 ] check dropping the rook.
 [ e4 ] , [ d6 ]  The Pirc. I had played against this opening only once in a long game. As a consequence I only knew 5 moves of theory (at least in this variation).
 [ R a e1 ]  [ a4 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ B x e5 ]  [ B x e5 ]  [ N x e5 ] , [ B b7 ]  Black is lost but this hastens his downfall. If he is going to surrender the queen he may as well pick off the Bb3.
 [ d x e4 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ N e3 ]  [ N x b4 ]  [ R b1 ]  [ a5 ]  [ B a3 ]  [ N c7 ]  [ B x b4 ]  [ a x b4 ]  [ R x b4 ] , [ B h6 ]  Botvinnik relies on active defense. he hopes to meet 19. [ R x b7 ] with 19..[ B x e3 ] 20. [ f x e3 ] [ N a6 ] followed by ...[ N c5 ]  [ B x e3 ]  [ f x e3 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ R x d6 ]  [ Q e8 ] , [ R e1 ]  whites material advantage is of little importance as black can easily regain his pawn.
 [ O-O ] , [ O-O-O ]  Both sides castle. I knew that since loosing my Queen I had one shot at winning this game and it was to bombard the King side.
 [ f x g5 ] , [ R g8 ]  The computer prefers an immediate 20...[ Q e8 ]  [ R f1 ]  [ Q e8 ] , [ N b6 ]  Now preferable was 22. [ B f4 + ]  [ N x b6 ] , [ B f4 + ]  Less powerful than last move.
 [ R c1 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ e3 ] , [ O-O ]  =
 [ c6 ] , [ Q e2 ]  [ c x d5 ] to break up his pawns?
 [ K h1 ] , [ N f2 + ]  !
 [ R h4 ] , [ B x f2 ]  !!! he resigns because if rook takes then 26. [ B x f3 # ] else 26. [ Q e1 ] followed by 27. [ N g1 ] and 27. [ Q x g1 # ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ c x d4 ] , [ B b4 + ]  This is the only move which leads to equallity for black out of the opening. The other lesser alternative is 6.[ B b6 ] which gives White a slight edge.
 [ B d3 ]  [ c6 ] , [ O-O ]  White has caught up in development and with the extra pawn has the advantage.
 [ K f1 ] , [ N x f2 ]  Anything just to bring the Q there.
 [ e4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ c4 ]  My preffered line of the scandinavian
 [ N x d3 ]  [ Q x d3 ] , [ R d8 ]  Defending the passed pawn. At around this move I saw that White could force a draw but I didn't think much of it.
 [ b5 ]  [ b3 ]  [ b4 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ a5 ] , [ a4 ]  Another tactic of the english opening is to trade the black bishop for the knight on F6.
 [ c4 ]  [ b6 ]  [ c x d5 ] , [ c x d5 ]  Voluntarily going for the isolani
 [ Q b7 ]  [ R a b1 ]  [ Q c8 ]  [ Q b3 ]  [ f6 ] , [ Q b8 ]  Queen trade anyway
 [ N f3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ e3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ b3 ]  [ N e4 ] , [ B b2 ]  And now it becomes Franketort (I believe it's called) which is what I was taught by GM Susan.
 [ Q b3 ]  [ b x c5 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ c x d4 ] , [ Q b7 ]  An apparently powerful move trying to pick up material on Black's queenside. However despite White's seemingly strong continuations I believe that Black can still gain a superior position. I am planning to play ...[ c5 ] and ...[ e5 ] grabbing a huge share of the centre and exploiting White's lost d- and c-pawns - products of his poor 4th move.
 [ Q c2 ] , [ b4 ]  ...and this makes almost useless his attack on b5/[ a5 ]  [ Q c6 ] , [ R f g1 ]  The "natural" move but it has a downside:
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d4 ] , [ B g4 ]  As in the famous Morphy - Duke of Brunswick and Cout Isouard. This move is actually bad.
 [ Q c2 ]  [ B x e2 ]  [ Q x e2 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ Q b2 ]  [ Q f6 ] , [ h3 ]  an error. Maybe [ K g2 ] was better?
 [ d x c5 ]  [ b x c5 ]  [ B x c5 ]  [ N x c5 ]  [ R e2 x e6 ]  [ N x e6 ] , [ R x e6 ]  White's rook is much better placed than Black's.
 [ N x d2 ] , [ N f6 ]  preparing to castle.....
 [ Q x f6 ] , [ g x f6 ]  An immediate [ N d5 ] was probably better than [ Q x f6 ] as now I've removed an attacking piece for a defending one. Still I get to grab another pawn.
 [ a x b6 ]  [ a3 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ B f6 + ]  [ K h7 ] , [ R f d1 ]  Grabbing the open d-file.
 [ N c6 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ a6 ] , [ B x c6 + ]  Here the first of only four checks in the game (including mate) a point piece swap off. My normal retaliation to this attack by Mattcarr is to take back with a pawn which results in me having doubled up pawns. Today I had the Queen available to ensure the pawns didn't become doubled up unless absolutely necessary which I did.
 [ R f c8 ]  [ B e3 ] , [ Q d8 ]  I decided the dark-square bishops had to go otherwise thanks to my lame ...[ a6 ] move I'd be saddled defending the Q-side dark squares the rest of the game.
 [ d x e5 ] , [ R a d1 + ]  I once heard when deciding which rook to move look at the one in the best position and move the other one. I think I moved the right one?
 [ a x b5 ] , [ a x b5 ]  Threatening Ra8#.
 [ b x c3 ]  [ B x c3 ] , [ R e7 + ]  This move is very important it allows white to trap the king on the ole 8' and allow white's king a free hand against those pawns.
 [ a6 ] , [ b3 ]  waiting moves...
 [ f x g3 ] , [ B e1 ]  Another passive move attacking a easily defended pawn. The exchange [ B x g5 ] [ B x g5 ] frees a piece of the queen's path towards [ h4 ] where it would be lethal!
 [ B c4 ]  [ c6 ] , [ N h4 ]  !? The idea is threaten [ N f5 ] pressing [ d6 ] / NxB / Nxg2+. His move is [ g6 ] but he likes his castling fortress because on the Qside is far from become free for castling.
 [ K f3 ] , [ Q e1 ]  ...but my opponent decides that enough is enough by resigning. I would have so liked to have four queens to get a checkmate.
 [ Q g4 ]  [ g6 ] , [ h4 ]  Building pressure on the king-side all in keeping with White's usual play in these lines.
 [ Q b6 ] , [ Q d3 ]  18. [ Q d3 ] - now he defends his [ b5 ] pawn.
 [ N c6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ Q d6 ]  [ h3 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ B x d4 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ Q b3 ]  [ e5 ]  [ B d2 ]  [ h6 ]  [ R a d1 ]  [ e4 ]  [ N e1 ] , [ d4 ]  the smoke is clearing; in exchange for the c-and f-pawn black has it all...
 [ N c6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ d3 ]  why not d4? it seems white is afraid from the main lines here.
 [ R c3 ] , [ B c8 ]  And now the pawn isint going to become queen right away.
 [ R f e8 ]  [ Q d2 ] , [ b6 ]  to prevent my N coming to [ c5 ] I think.
 [ B x d3 ]  [ Q x d3 ]  [ Q c3 ]  [ R d1 ] , [ R e8 ]  During this game the exchanges and several other plays were setup as conditional moves. Black setup a series from this position expecting me to take his [ d4 ] pawn. I had also calculated several different possibilities and had expected the moves to take a certain course. As you may expect from this comment one of us missed a move. Try to spot it during the next exchange.
 [ R b x h1 ]  [ B x h1 ]  [ R x h1 ]  [ b7 ]  [ R b1 ]  [ c5 ]  [ d x c5 ]  [ d6 ]  [ R x b7 ]  [ K e2 ] , [ R d7 ]  and I resigned
 [ R x g7 ] , [ K e7 ]  logical as we enter an early endgame
 [ R x c2 ]  [ R x b4 ]  [ R a2 ]  [ R b5 + ]  [ K g6 ]  [ R b6 + ]  [ K f5 ] , [ a6 ]  White needs to watch out for cheap stalemate ideas like 40...[ g4 ] 41.hx[ g4 ] [ K g5 ] 42.Rc6?? [ R a1 ] 43. [ K h1 ] [ R h1 ] !! 44.[ K x h1 ] stalemate
 [ R d7 ] , [ B x e4 ]  This is why...
 [ B c4 ]  [ R c8 ]  [ e5 ] , [ f x e5 ]  Gaining a small material advantage. Now my job is to swap off some of the pieces. The more wood leaves the board the bigger the advantage of one Pawn looms.
 [ R x e8 + ] , [ Q x e8 ]  Black is only too glad to trade and now glad of the two knight defenders on d5. Even though white has more attackers than there are black defenders two of the attackers are major pieces so white will lose material capturing on d5. It seems after all the exchanges that white will end up with a queen on [ d5 ] forking the black king and the black bishop on [ c5 ] but after black moves out of check white cannot play Qxc5??? or he will lose immediately to black's Qe1#.
 [ B e3 ]  [ N d7 ] , [ B d2 ]  This looked like alot of messing
 [ d x c6 ]  [ Q x d8 ]  [ R x d8 ] , [ R a d1 ]  13.[ R a d1 ] maybe this was a bad idea. I have too many pawns hanging. His 13…[ B a6 ] proves this because now my LSB is protecting a pawn.
 [ c4 ] , [ B e7 ]  we now have transposed into the QGD mainline with Be7.
 [ b x c4 ]  [ e4 ]  [ Q f8 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ K d8 ]  [ Q f3 ]  [ Q x h8 ]  [ N x f6 ] , [ g x f6 ]  and now we even
 [ K f1 ]  [ R c4 ]  [ R a2 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ g3 ] , [ f3 ]  Also a good move avoiding the trade restricting movement of his king and keeping the king at bay with my rook controlling the e-file.
 [ R x d1 + ]  [ B x d1 ] , [ B x f2 ]  No Dragon player likes giving up this bishop but the important thing is that it wrecks white's bishop pair.
 [ d5 ] , [ f4 ]  Unusual but not bad. It is one way of developing a Stonewall formation (with [ e3 ] and [ c3 ] to come). Black throws in a distraction.
 [ c x d3 ] , [ a x b5 ]  Now a pawn.Here I saw the Idea of 21.[ N c3 ] [ B b3 ] 22.[ K d2 ] [ N c5 ] 23.[ R g1 ] [ B a4 ] 25.[ N x a4 ] [ N x a4 ] 26.Rg-c1...I didn't like the line...
 [ c3 ]  [ B b6 ]  [ Q h5 ] , [ B e6 ]  I cut off the attack on [ K B2 ] at once.
 [ R b6 ]  [ h5 ] , [ g5 ]  A crucial idea. Black intends to blockade along the dark squares when White has a difficult time breaking through and the White queen will remain offside on [ h6 ] after Black's .. .f6.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ] , [ B c4 ]  Played mostly to avoid the Petroff.
 [ B b3 ] , [ B d7 ]  Completing his development.
 [ R c1 ]  [ Q b6 ]  [ Q d2 ] , [ R b c8 ]  Contesting the open file.
 [ K b7 ]  [ a5 ] , [ R g6 ]  THE END IS NEAR!
 [ N f6 ]  [ c3 ] , [ g4 ]  no need to switch so i will move my Pawns forward..
 [ Q x b5 ] , [ c4 ]  The fourth.
 [ N f3 ] , [ K h8 ]  This seems pointless to me the only idea that comes to mind is that jester may be trying to move his rook to the g-file but that would weaken the f7-pawn. I recommend 13.[ N x b3 ] immediatly as white can move his bishop flawing the plan of jester to exchange one of my bishop pair.
 [ R f d1 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ R a c1 ] , [ B e6 ]  Very good. Now I must give up the bishop pair or retreat.
 [ K b6 ]  [ N c4 + ] , [ K b5 ]  At this point jstevens offered a draw. Over the last couple of moves I had spent hours looking into all sorts of possibilities. [ e4 ] is a nice spot for my knight but any threats could be eliminated with Bxe4. [ B e2 ] looks lovely but that bishop is tied to protection of the [ e6 ] knight. I considered simply castling but decided it would take too long to get that new rook into any meaningful position. I even considered [ a4 ] to either restrict Henry further or induce him to capture thus bringing him closer and opening another line for the rook. In the end considering the strength of my opponent I decided to grab the offered draw! Thanks for the game Joanne.
 [ N c5 ] , [ b4 ]  This move may be too weakening for white.
 [ N c6 ] , [ B g2 ]  Oh dear... white has developed really well. Has stake over the center ready to castle and all set for an attack on my poorly developed king side. Or maybe i'm getting too far ahead of myself...
 [ b x a6 ]  [ d6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ B x a6 ]  [ B x a6 ] , [ N x a6 ]  A fairly standard sequence of exchanges for this opening.
 [ R x b2 + ] , [ R e2 ]  He pins his rook for me. Phew.
 [ K d1 ]  [ Q x g2 ]  [ Q f5 + ]  [ K e8 ]  [ R e1 + ] , [ B e7 ]  While I am ahead in material I don't really like my position.
 [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ] , [ d3 ]  opening the bishops diagnol
 [ B x c6 ]  [ b x c6 ] , [ N e5 ]  his knight finds a nice home
 [ K x f7 ]  [ Q f3 + ] , [ K e6 ]  hard to believe: but this is the best reply...
 [ N f3 ] , [ c5 ]  Threatening to trade my pawn for a more central one.
 [ N d4 ] , [ N h5 ]  If 23…[ Q d7 ] 24.[ N x f6 + ] [ g x f6 ] 25.[ N f5 ] White threatens mate in 2 and black can’t do anything to stop it besides giving up his queen.
 [ c5 ]  [ c3 ] , [ N c6 ]  More aggressive is 2...[ d5 ] with very slight edge for White. But this is perfectly playable.
 [ f x e5 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ B f4 ] , [ B d6 ]  As said before black get's the center with the [ d5 ] and [ c5 ] pawn and gets a space advantage too.
 [ R x a2 ] , [ K b1 ]  interesting but imprudent move.
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ g6 ]  not the best line but playable.
 [ e x f4 ] , [ B c4 ]  This was the starting point in the mini-tournament.
 [ b5 ] , [ N b6 ]  22. [ N b6 ] - this looks nasty but somehow I wriggle out of the mess.
 [ B e1 ]  [ Q f1 + ]  [ R g1 ]  [ Q f3 + ]  [ R g2 ]  [ N g5 ]  [ R b1 ]  [ N x h3 ]  [ B d2 ]  [ f4 ]  [ R b8 + ]  [ K f7 ]  [ R b1 ]  [ Q d3 ]  [ R a1 ]  [ f3 ]  [ R g3 ]  [ N f2 + ]  [ K g1 ]  [ Q e2 ]  [ h4 ]  [ N d1 ]  [ R x f3 + ]  [ Q x f3 ]  [ B e1 ]  [ Q e3 + ]  [ K f1 ]  [ Q d3 + ]  [ K g1 ]  [ Q d4 + ]  [ K f1 ] , [ Q x a1 ]  
 [ K f2 ]  [ K e7 ]  [ R d2 ]  [ K e6 ]  [ h4 ] , [ g x h4 ]  to simplify the situation and to reduce the white pawn in the king side because it's higher in number
 [ d5 ]  [ c4 ]  [ c6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ e6 ]  The starting position.
 [ Q x e8 ] , [ Q e3 ]  a good move if black plays the expected 18. ...[ Q x e3 ] which will help support [ d4 ] and 18. [ Q x e8 ] just loses the e-file
 [ Q d4 + ]  [ K g8 ]  [ R a e1 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ R f3 ] , [ N d7 ]  27. ......................... [ N d7 ] - black develops his final piece.
 [ N e4 ] , [ R f e1 ]  X-ray attack - Knight and Pawn both in jeopardy.
 [ Q b4 + ]  [ K e6 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ K x e5 ]  [ Q e7 + ]  [ K f5 ]  [ Q h7 + ]  [ K e5 ]  [ Q h2 + ]  [ K e4 ]  [ Q g2 + ] , [ K d3 ]  With white's help I am approaching the other pawn...
 [ Q x f2 + ]  [ K h1 ] , [ R x a2 ]  the beginning of the end...
 [ Q a3 ]  [ N e2 ]  [ Q c5 ]  [ B d4 ]  [ Q a5 + ]  [ B c3 ]  [ B b4 ]  [ h5 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ h6 ]  [ R f d8 ]  [ e4 ]  [ B x c4 ]  [ g6 ]  [ f x g6 ]  [ h x g7 ]  [ B x c3 + ]  [ R g x c3 ]  [ b5 ]  [ K f2 ]  [ K x g7 ]  [ N f4 ]  [ Q b6 + ]  [ K g3 ]  [ R d2 ]  [ R f3 ]  [ Q d6 ]  [ R h1 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ Q h4 ]  [ h5 ]  [ R e3 ]  [ Q e5 ]  [ R c1 ]  [ g5 ]  [ R c7 + ] , [ K g8 ]  
 [ B x g7 ]  [ K x g7 ] , [ a3 ]  Trying to trap the queen
 [ R c a7 ]  [ K f1 ]  [ K f7 ]  [ K e1 ]  [ K e7 ]  [ R x d7 + ]  [ R x d7 ] , [ K d2 ]  and black resigns.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ f4 ] , [ d5 ]  This is a response that I like as black. It seems to help black stay active and not be too passive in trying to hang onto an extra pawn.
 [ R e2 e4 ]  [ h3 ] , [ B c4 ]  Get yo headless chickens undoubled on the file!
 [ Q h3 + ]  [ K e2 ]  [ Q h6 ]  [ Q x h6 + ]  [ K x h6 ]  [ R h2 + ]  [ K g5 ] , [ B e4 ]  And now I start to play my easy endgame...
 [ N g e2 ] , [ N h6 ]  Not a great place for a knight but I'm looking at [ f7 ] as a home for it and meanwhile it still contributes to the pressure at f5.
 [ R x e7 ]  [ Q e2 ]  [ R x e2 + ]  [ N x e2 ]  [ B x b2 ]  [ R a2 ]  [ B d4 ]  [ h5 ]  [ B e5 ] , [ R a5 ]  another bad move
 [ h4 ] , [ B c4 ]  Black now brings LSB to [ c4 ] attacking Rook on f1.
 [ c3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ a4 ]  [ h6 ] , [ d4 ]  Tore attempts to claim the center.
 [ R x e8 + ]  [ R x e8 ]  [ g4 ] , [ B h7 ]  Black wants to keep as many squares for his knight as possible but this allows the bishop to be shut in with f4-[ f5 ] and for what it's worth reintroduces back rank ideas for White. Anyway I was expecting 30...Bc2.
 [ K b6 ] , [ Q x h5 ]  Black resigned.
 [ b5 ]  [ N d4 ] , [ N x e5 ]  ...that wins a Pawn.
 [ R x d4 ] , [ c x d4 ]  Of the three possible re-captures this looks best as it gives me the passed pawn covered by the Rook and the discovered attack on Black's Rook next move. With this and a piece down White concedes
 [ B e3 ] , [ B x f3 ]  [ b4 ] [ N c e4 ] was a better try...
 [ N c4 ] , [ K a7 ]  Advancing the king to disturb the knight a final attempt of counterplay.
 [ e4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ d4 ] , [ d5 ]  Selman decides on a French Defense hoping to play a slow positional game. Beware what you wish for -- you might get it.
 [ N f5 + ] , [ K h3 ]  Here comes sacrificial offering no.3!
 [ Q f6 + ] , [ Q g6 ]  Maybe Black thinks I'm after the draw and tries this which hands me a big advantage...
 [ B b2 ]  [ f4 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ f3 ]  [ e x d6 ]  [ f x e2 ] , [ B x g7 + ]  What I was trying to do here was to get the black king a bit more exposed.
 [ K h1 ] , [ B x f4 ]  nothing can protect my little castle....
 [ K h7 ] , [ K h1 ]  Again unsure of what to do. Looking back this was the best response I think given the position.
 [ R e4 + ]  [ R f3 f4 ]  [ N f5 + ]  [ K h3 ] , [ R x f4 ]  Finally the exchange :D
 [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ Q x d5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ O-O-O ] , [ c4 ]  This was the attacking opportunity I was looking for...so far so good.
 [ N d5 ] , [ R c4 ]  as you were ...
 [ B h2 ]  [ N f4 ]  [ B x f4 ] , [ e x f4 ]  opens the a1-[ h8 ] diagonal for the bishop
 [ Q g6 ]  [ R g5 ] , [ Q h6 ]  17.......[ Q f7 ] may be better
 [ R d8 d6 ]  [ K f2 ] , [ Q d7 ]  ...and it gave him an extra turn to line up...
 [ N c6 ]  [ f3 ] , [ B d7 ]  7. ...... [ B d7 ] - a somewhat conservative developing move. I think this is to prevent the black pawns from becoming separated should I choose to exchange knights on [ c6 ] at an appropriate moment.
 [ K f6 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ R x d4 ] , [ R e e7 ]  Now Black has some ugly choices left.
 [ B x f6 ] , [ g x f6 ]  I'm not going to castle kingside :)
 [ h6 ] , [ h3 ]  Completing the wall.
 [ K d2 ] , [ B x f3 ]  And here is the exchange.
 [ B f5 ] , [ Q c1 ]  The thread is still on
 [ c x d4 ]  [ N b5 ] , [ a6 ]  ? Figuring that I had gained tempo however I attack. But I overlooked his next move however as this move gives him back the pawn. Best was 6...e5. In capturing however I will retake. This forces him to play 8.[ Q x d4 ] to avoid losing a piece. Normally we just expect it and doesn't seem important. But there's more to it then meets the eye as it is significant.
 [ Q g5 + ]  [ K h8 ]  [ Q f6 + ]  [ K g8 ] , [ R x f5 ]  Threatening 27 [ R g5 + ] leading to mate.
 [ R a6 ] , [ R c8 ]  White has 3 options (a) [ Q a1 ] (b) [ B f2 ] (c) g4. (a) [ Q a1 ] is to attack the pawn at a7. But Black will defend the pawn with [ R c7 ] which is also protecting the pawn at c4. (b) [ B f2 ] brings the Bishop to safety. (c) [ [ g4 ] ] increases the pressure on f5. Move # 25. 25. [ Q a1 ] [ R c7 ] 26. [ B d2 ] [ Q d7 ] 27. [ Q b2 ] [ f6 ] 25. [ B f2 ] [ Q d7 ] 26. [ Q a1 ] [ R c7 ] 27.[ R c1 ] [ B f8 ] 25. [ [ g4 ] ] fx[ [ g4 ] ] 26. Qx[ [ g4 ] ] [ R c7 ] 27. [ R f a1 ] [ c3 ]  [ g3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ B g2 ] , [ d6 ]  Thus far pretty typical moves for Black.
 [ N x a4 ] , [ R a b1 ]  White now needs good activity if he is to compensate for the loss of material. It's fair to say that this should be over if Black gets his pieces together.
 [ K h3 ]  [ R e c8 ]  [ g4 ]  [ R c4 c5 ] , [ R x c5 ]  again exchage when losing... But two rooks overpower one rook easily
 [ K h1 ] , [ B d4 ]  Regaining the pawn but allowing my rook to enter the seventh rank.
 [ Q a7 ]  [ N a5 ]  [ B b4 ]  [ N c4 ]  [ B d7 ] , [ N d5 ]  Threatening to win the Exchange with Kt-B7.
 [ g5 ] , [ R e2 ]  31. [ R e2 ] - to get first grab of the open e file.
 [ a x b4 ]  [ a x b4 ]  [ R x a1 ] , [ Q x a1 ]  Now my Q is dislodged but HIS Qside is weak...
 [ Q x c4 ] , [ K b2 ]  needed to prevent [ Q a2 ]  [ R a1 ] , [ R a c8 ]  increasing pressure over [ c3 ]  [ a4 ] , [ R c7 ]  creating space for [ R f c8 ]  [ R x a5 ] , [ R b8 + ]  and white is doomed
 [ Q x f3 ]  [ N b d7 ]  [ Q e2 ]  [ R e8 ] , [ Q e6 + ]  black was finally ready for the pawn thrust so this was an excellent way to postpone it even further and keep the black position cramped up.
 [ B d5 ] , [ c6 ]  This was to be expected.
 [ B x b7 ]  [ Q h4 ] , [ B e3 ]  I was hoping that fianchetto52 would not make this move but alas! He's a strong player.
 [ B e2 ]  [ B d7 ] , [ O-O ]  9. 0-0 - Freddy also hides his king on the kingside.
 [ K g5 ]  [ B d4 ] , [ K h4 ]  !
 [ K g6 ]  [ R g1 ] , [ a5 ]  It may have been better to lose the doubled c pawn with [ a6 ] and 46...[ N c7 ] rather than trading these two pawns for the one white pawn. When I first made this move I was thinking 46. [ b x a5 ] [ b x a5 ] 47. [ R a1 ] [ g4 ] 48. [ R x a5 ] [ g3 ] 49. [ R a1 ] [ K g5 ] 50. [ R g1 ] K[ g4 ] which I believe is winning for black. From this point Toga evaluated the position at 0.00 except when white made errors.
 [ h x g6 ]  [ Q x g6 + ]  [ K f8 ]  [ N g8 + ]  [ Q f7 ] , [ Q x f7 # ]  And black perishes very simply. One of the greatest lessons I've taken out of playing this knight sacrifice the Perenyi is to forget about the supposed "piece values" (e.g. knight ~ 3 rook ~5). If you think of each piece's usefulness in terms of the current position it really helps develop your tactical skills among other things! Anyway I hoped you enjoyed the game and I would really recommend similar lines of the Sicilian for anyone having trouble against it.
 [ Q x c4 ]  [ R a d8 ]  [ N e2 ]  [ Q d6 ] , [ N c3 ]  Black was preparing to move his two rooks behind his queen and sacrifice the queen on d1. 25. ... [ Q d1 + ] 26. [ R x d1 ] [ R x d1 # ] is prevented after White moves his knight to c3.
 [ B x d6 ]  [ Q x d6 ]  [ c5 ]  [ Q e7 ]  [ B b5 + ]  [ N c6 ] , [ N f3 ]  I like the development of my pieces so far.
 [ Q g3 ] , [ B x e5 ]  I decide to trade off that knight. It is a good idea to trade off pieces if you are up in material as the difference in material is more important in the endgame.
 [ e x d4 ] , [ N f3 ]  [ Q x d4 ] was main line. Black has two options now. Save the pawn. Don't save the pawn. There is no any reason/threat to not save the pawn. But Question is How i save my soldier? if 3. ... [ c5 ] then [ c3 ] dx[ c3 ] Nx[ c3 ] and Black got backward d pawn weak Q-side pawn structure back in development ... ([ N c6 ] will transpose to Scotch Game)
 [ h4 ] , [ f5 ]  Neglecting the first rule of endgames: the player with a disadvantage should keep the game closed not open it up.
 [ R h1 ]  [ R x h1 ]  [ K x h1 ]  [ Q x g4 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ Q h5 + ]  [ K g2 ]  [ Q h8 ]  [ R h3 ]  [ Q f8 ]  [ Q b4 ]  [ b6 ]  [ Q x d6 + ] , [ Q f6 ]  this is exactly the exesive trust in the queen that lost the game for my opponent.
 [ O-O-O ]  [ a6 ]  [ g4 ] , [ N x d4 ]  Strange move after moving the Rook from [ f8 ] to [ e8 ] there is no need to break up the Queen and bishop battery [ N e5 ] would have been better in my opinion if black was planing b5.
 [ R d6 d8 ]  [ R f f8 ]  [ R x e8 ]  [ R x e8 ] , [ N d6 ]  Black resigns white threats [ N f5 ] next attacks the rook on the same time and in the end will win a piece for free 28.Nd6-Rf8.29.Nxc8.... if 29...Rxc8.30.Nf5+and the black queen dies . 29.[ N d f5 + ] Rxf5.30.Nxf5+Bxf5.31.[ Q x f5 ] -Kg8... is also very good option black have no choise but to resigh.
 [ g x f6 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ h5 ]  [ O-O ]  [ Q c5 ]  [ Q x c5 ]  [ R x c5 ] , [ f5 ]  Here is that game I mentioned at the beginning re Krupa Dominik (2091) vs. Bylino Oleg (2255) 1. [ e4 ] [ c5 ] 2. [ N f3 ] [ d6 ] 3. [ d4 ] cx[ d4 ] 4. Nx[ d4 ] [ N f6 ] 5. [ N c3 ] [ N c6 ] 6. [ B g5 ] [ B d7 ] 7. [ Q d2 ] Nx[ d4 ] 8. Qx[ d4 ] [ Q [ a5 ] ] 9. [ f4 ] [ R c8 ] 10. [ B x f6 ] [ g x f6 ] 11. [ B e2 ] [ h5 ] 12. O-O Q[ c5 ] 13. Qx[ c5 ] Rx[ c5 ] 14. [ R a d1 ] [ f5 ] 15. [ R d5 ] [ B g7 ] 16. Rx[ c5 ] B[ d4 ] 17. [ K h1 ] dx[ c5 ] 18. [ e5 ] [ h4 ] 19. [ B b5 ] [ B x c3 ] 20.

[ R x e7 ] [ a4 ] 29. [ R x f7 ] [ a3 ] 30. [ R f8 ] [ a2 ] 31. [ R a8 ] [ R c1 ] 32. [ K f2 ] [ a1 = Q ] 33. [ R x a1 ] [ R x a1 ] 34. [ h3 ] K[ c5 ] 35. [ g4 ] [ h x g3 ] e.p. 36. [ K x g3 ] [ K d5 ] 37. K[ h4 ] [ R g1 ] 38. K[ h5 ] K[ e4 ] In this game white's queenside pawn structure got busted. I tried to avoid it but to no avail. Here in this game white resigned on the grounds of ruinous loss of material - I would have resigned at move 33. At least my game lasted longer!
 [ N e6 ] , [ N x f6 + ]  with my space advantage going up in smoke I wanted to exchange some of black's most active pieces.
 [ K a1 ] , [ R c1 # ]  When you are up points you have to have sure that it is beneficial. Otherwise a draw or even a losing position can occur. It is not best to judge a win by material and this is why. This game is an example where I ignored some potentially dangerous threats. Be on the lookout for any immediate threats tactics etc. because when performed they haunt you for the rest of the game.
 [ f4 ] , [ b5 ]  Finally.
 [ d6 ] , [ d3 ]  Prepares another line of attack on the Q
 [ N f4 ]  [ B x f4 ]  [ Q x f4 ]  [ N h3 ] , [ Q e5 ]  White will have a hard time driving me from this dominating square.
 [ B x d6 ]  [ B f8 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ N e6 ]  [ e5 ]  [ f5 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ B x e2 ]  [ R x e2 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ R f2 ]  [ B h6 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ N e7 ]  [ R g2 ]  [ N e6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N x f4 ] , [ R d2 ]  Whoa I like N[ x N f4 ] much better. Here black can move [ N f4 ] and pin the white rook. N[ x N d5 ] for example.
 [ K g7 ]  [ N x d4 ] , [ K x g6 ]  The Bishop is far too dangerous to live especially when the alternative is taking a Knight with a pawn that would become entirely indefensible. Black's strong center pawn chain is the only possible shelter for his King right now.
 [ f3 ]  [ a6 ] , [ N b5 ]  Trying to stop white's pawn.
 [ Q c2 ] , [ N e f6 ]  here we are back to the position from 2 moves ago except black's good bishop is toast. Another tempo lost
 [ B h3 ]  [ R a a8 ]  [ N f d2 ]  [ K g8 ]  [ R f e2 ]  [ R e7 ]  [ R f1 ] , [ R f8 ]  I've recovered enough time to get my QR over behind the pawns and now there's no threat to them in the near future.
 [ Q e5 + ] , [ K d7 ]  Surely black has wriggled out of the danger zone.
 [ a4 ] , [ R a5 ]  He would love a4[ x b3 ] this would allow a2[ x b3 ] and pair his rooks up on my flank with almost certain checkmate
 [ B c5 ]  [ R x c5 ]  [ Q x e4 + ]  [ Q x e4 ]  [ R x e4 ] , [ B a3 ]  Forces the exchange of queens. Now being up the exchange should be easy.
 [ K h4 ]  [ Q f2 + ] , [ K h3 ]  In this square I have no inmediate threat but...
 [ R e1 ] , [ N e7 ]  8. ..... [ N e7 ] - no she develops another piece and is ready to castle.
 [ N x b2 ]  [ R x c6 ]  [ K g7 ]  [ N c5 ]  [ a5 ]  [ g3 ]  [ N c4 ]  [ R e6 ]  [ R x e6 ] , [ B x e6 ]  Material is still even but the game has been simplified.
 [ Q x b1 ]  [ R x c5 ]  [ Q x a2 ]  [ R c2 ] , [ Q a1 ]  Black's choices were limited!
 [ Q g3 + ]  [ K f1 ] , [ R e3 e1 + ]  Queen is lost
 [ N e2 ] , [ a6 ]  Ok so I didn't expect that...no problem though. Also I don't normally leave the e-pawn exposed but I was thinking of moving my pawn to c3.
 [ R d8 ] , [ R d7 ]  ?! My idea was liquidating since I am ahead. However better would've been 53.[ c7 ] Even stronger was 53.[ K c5 ] which guarantees the promotion. As afterwards there's so much I can do with it whilst supporting that pawn. And black would be helpless against that. The bad part is that it didn't come into consideration. But K against the pawn like that is a known win. With that being said this is the move that throws away the win. The important thing to remember is what role the K plays in the endgame. I know but underestimate the amount of power the monarch contains at that phase.
 [ a3 ] , [ a6 ]  Locking up the queenside.
 [ e x d4 ]  [ R x d4 ] , [ R a d8 ]  Kosteniuk misses a mating combination here!
 [ c4 ] , [ f6 ]  Carrying on with the plan to advance everything together gradually the bishops mobility isn't great at the moment but that won't be a permanent situation.
 [ N c3 ]  [ B d4 ]  [ Q d2 ] , [ f5 ]  Black now has a K-side attack brewing with both B's pointed at white's K.
 [ g6 ]  [ Q g5 ] , [ Q d5 ]  Threatening [ Q d2 + ] so I can't move my [ N e2 ] or it will be severe.
 [ Q d6 ] , [ B b5 ]  This was actually a stupid move on my part. My knight is now unprotected and Black is free to take it with the queen.
 [ O-O-O ] , [ e6 ]  preparing development of bishop
 [ R h3 + ]  [ K g7 ]  [ K d3 ]  [ K f6 ]  [ R h6 ]  [ K g5 ]  [ R h3 ]  [ K g4 ]  [ R h6 ] , [ g5 ]  All pieces protected. Continue the advance.
 [ N g5 ]  [ R c5 ]  [ d4 ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ N f7 ] , [ Q x f7 ]  I regretted this capture wishing I had used the bishop. I had to return the Queen later.
 [ N c2 + ] , [ K f1 ]  White has no choice
 [ R a2 a1 ]  [ R x a1 ]  [ R x a1 + ]  [ K h2 ]  [ B f1 ]  [ R b4 ]  [ R a2 + ]  [ K g1 ]  [ B g2 ]  [ R c4 ]  [ c6 ]  [ R b4 ]  [ b5 ] , [ K h2 ]  ruachessnut2 (1505) on 28-Feb-09: 40...[ c5 ] forcing the rook to a light square. ... And then the bishop moves putting the king in check and takes the rook on the next turn! Brilliant! Wish I had thought of that.
 [ B x a6 ] , [ R x a6 ]  If 13. [ c3 ] [ b5 ] 14. [ d x c5 ] [ B x c5 ] and black is ready for the b5-[ b4 ] break and White lacks the power for a kingside attack.
 [ N x b3 ]  [ c x b3 ] , [ Q x b3 ]  Now Rook [ a2 ] is lost!
 [ Q b4 + ] , [ N c3 ]  After a lot of thought I decided that this was the best alternative. I thought at the time before this move that if 9...[ B x d4 ] then 10. [ a3 ] and I might recapture the bishop with my queen but then there's [ Q c5 ] or [ Q b6 ] which will make my position all the more worse. Other moves I considered were [ B b5 + ] and [ B d2 ] but for the latter after 9...[ Q x d4 ] I thought of playing [ B e3 ] but then there's 10. [ Q x d1 + ] [ K x d1 ] [ B x e3 ] [ f x e3 ] which isn't any better.
 [ e x f5 ] , [ N x f5 ]  well i play probably to much "automatically" i newer had an idea of placing queen on [ [ g5 ] ] and take that pawn with gxf5.. now when i thick about it.. Q on [ [ g5 ] ] (or [ h4 ] for that mater) N on [ d4 ] ("semi - dominating" on white queen) if [ f2 ] pawn moves (or disappears) some discover tactic possible. f pawn ready to march on a king side backed up by a rook.. a crap :) why did i take the pawn with night..
 [ K f2 ] , [ e3 + ]  
 [ B h5 ]  [ e4 ]  [ B g6 ]  [ Q d3 ]  [ R a d8 ]  [ Q c4 ]  [ R f e8 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ b5 ]  [ Q x b5 ]  [ R d b8 ]  [ Q c4 ]  [ R x b2 ]  [ N d2 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ Q d3 ]  [ h6 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B x e5 ]  [ R x e5 ]  [ c4 ]  [ Q a5 ]  [ R f2 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ B f3 ]  [ R x a2 ]  [ R x a2 ] , [ Q x a2 ]  so whilst I'm busy trying to push my d pawn black is creating his own passed pawn on the a file
 [ K x e2 ]  [ K e6 ]  [ K e3 ]  [ K d5 ]  [ K d3 ]  [ f5 ] , [ h3 ]  Black's king is active but it is not very useful. White's idea now is to fix the black pawns on the dark squares.
 [ g6 ]  [ f4 ]  [ b6 ] , [ d4 ]  It looks like we both have different kinds of pawn defenses in mind.
 [ Q x d6 ]  [ B f4 ] , [ Q d4 ]  ? A good answer would have been: Ng-e5. White can recover the piece eventually provided he manages to play [ d4 ] but his attack will be controlled. It was too complex for a blitz so I tried this one.
 [ K d4 ] , [ R g f6 ]  Uniting my rooks.
 [ R e3 ]  [ R d c5 ]  [ K e1 ]  [ R c5 x c3 ]  [ R x c3 ]  [ R x c3 ] , [ K d2 ]  I can't see the benefit... well.. material is even.
 [ e6 ] , [ N c3 ]  White is ahead in development but Black has a solid pawn structure
 [ b3 ]  [ K c5 ] , [ K e3 ]  Good! The white king must stay in the centre
 [ K g2 ]  [ N x g5 ]  [ B x g5 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ B e3 ] , [ B x e3 ]  33....... BxB removing all major resistance
 [ B x f2 + ] , [ K h2 ]  ?? But after he played this I said The other option was 9...[ K h1 ] Actually that's what I anticipated. I hate to tell you this but there's pretty much no good moves left at this point. Had you played 9.[ K h1 ] I'd take. But by moving here I can hold off on that. The idea behind this statement is that the Rook is now free whereas if I take now he'll get a bishop in return. The idea being is as kenneth_fiore_3 said "In chess you have to be cruel." I agree with that because linency equals teaching chess in a simpler form when in reality it's a complex game. If you make things more difficult the student will learn more.
 [ B d3 ]  [ N x d3 + ]  [ c x d3 ] , [ B x d5 ]  very simple
 [ R f2 + ]  [ K h3 ]  [ Q g2 + ]  [ K h4 ]  [ Q x h2 + ]  [ K g5 ] , [ B f6 # ]  1001 ways to finish the game but this was the fastest.
 [ c4 ]  [ N f4 ]  [ R d2 ] , [ Q c7 ]  ? A move which fails to see the winning move.
 [ e5 ]  [ N d5 ] , [ d4 ]  preparing [ N f3 ] the Flohr approach; we keep an eventual [ c4 ] for later use...
 [ K x d5 ]  [ K c3 ]  [ K c5 ]  [ K x b3 ] , [ e4 ]  The passed pawns are unstoppable. Once I'm able to push [ b4 ] to get to the a pawn the game is over.
 [ g5 ] , [ g3 ]  Must slow down Black's K side Pawns.
 [ g4 ]  [ f x g4 ]  [ B c6 ]  [ B d1 ]  [ B x e4 ]  [ B f3 ]  [ a6 ]  [ a4 ] , [ a5 ]  Now white is in Zugzwang. Every move loses: K move (or BxB) allows the black king to infiltrate on [ d4 ] or [ e4 ] B move loses [ g2 ] pawn and moving either g-pawn loses material.
 [ R e1 ] , [ O-O-O ]  Castling kingside would be hard to do because of my strong light bishop. But now I have a target on the queenside.
 [ R e6 ]  [ f4 ] , [ R d e8 ]  answering the frontal assault by doubling his rooks
 [ B d3 ]  [ R g1 + ] , [ B f1 ]  Still thinkins I can hold: If [ B g2 ] [ K e2 ] and I can move.
 [ K e5 ]  [ K d3 ]  [ K f4 ]  [ K c4 ] , [ K g3 ]  I move my king to attack my opponent's queenside pawns while he moves his to help his kingside pawn...
 [ R e1 ]  [ d6 ] , [ N d5 ]  Naturally the rook Whites rook tucks in on the e file exerting pressure on Blacks queen. White follows 9....[ d6 ] ( which I think is a little late) with 10. Nd5! And black has to be careful now with the threat of Nc3+! Forks are good right? At this point black decides to log out and take a break.
 [ B e3 ] , [ Q b7 ]  Rook is now protect oh well.
 [ Q g3 ]  [ B x d4 + ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ Q x d4 + ]  [ K h1 ] , [ B e6 ]  I elected to finalize my development and connect my rooks on the back rank. In retrospect [ R e6 ] or [ R e2 ] could have been more fun.
 [ h6 ]  [ B h4 ]  [ N c5 ]  [ N e d2 ]  [ Q d7 ]  [ O-O ] , [ Q d3 ]  ? Because Shredder’s rating is set at 2220 not full strength (2600) it will make an occasional inaccuracy. This move is a very human-like mistake. Black has two key moves … [ Q d3 ] and … [ [ g5 ] ] but Shredder makes them in the wrong order. After 18. … g5! Black would stand better because sacrificing on [ [ g5 ] ] would be unsound for White.
 [ R f1 + ]  [ K e7 ] , [ Q g5 # ]  At my age I dont have time to read basics and openings etc which is why my rating is stuck at 1600. But I have read a few exciting things and sometimes get a chance to practice them. This is chess for fun hope you enjoyed. Pl comment freely and pl rate
 [ Q x a2 ] , [ Q c1 ]  I anticipated this move but only under the technicality that he is protecting b2. However there is much more to this then meets the eye as we're about to see.
 [ K g4 ]  [ h5 ]  [ f3 ]  [ h6 ]  [ K f4 ]  [ N d2 ]  [ R g6 ]  [ h7 ]  [ R h6 ]  [ h8 = Q ] , [ R x h8 ]  Topalov wins after a beautiful display of positional prowess.
 [ R x d7 ] , [ R b f8 ]  But black doubles up and is prepared to do damage here.
 [ a6 ] , [ N x c6 ]  with doubled pawns perhaps black is going to be less eager to close the center....
 [ B c3 + ]  [ K f4 ]  [ B d4 ]  [ B x d4 ]  [ K x d4 ]  [ K g3 ]  [ c5 ]  [ b x c5 + ]  [ b x c5 ] , [ f4 ]  48.… Kxh4? lets White promote a full move before Black can.
 [ e5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ a3 ]  Showing intentions but effectively depriving my dsb from outer action.
 [ f6 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ O-O ] , [ B x e7 ]  Free knight almost. Still must protect the queen before you can retract the bishop.
 [ R g3 ] , [ Q d7 ]  (?!) Either Black failed to notice that the knight was insufficiently defended or he decided that keeping the g-file closed was more important -- which would actually be an understandable reason for this move. Either way things look bleak for Black.
 [ h4 ]  [ R x d1 + ]  [ R x d1 ] , [ B x h4 ]  Now that the bishop has been induced away from the c1-[ h6 ] diagonal onto [ h4 ] White launches a final attack.
 [ c5 ]  [ d x c5 ]  [ N x c5 ]  [ B x g7 ]  [ K x g7 ]  [ R g1 ] , [ N c x e4 ]  ------Bundler alert---------- nice try to win pawn..... but it will result in a material loss. Black stopped deep analisys just one move too earl
 [ R x b3 ]  [ R d6 ] , [ a5 ]  you cna have him but you will not catch me
 [ Q x g3 + ]  [ K h1 ] , [ Q g2 # ]  18. .......... [ Q g2 # ] - which Glenda duly delivers! I know I often use her in a defensive role and she is not called Glenda the Defender for nothing but underestimate her at your peril - she has struck quite a few times since my return from Devon in early September!
 [ N f6 ] , [ e5 ]  That is until he played this.
 [ R x h2 ]  [ N e2 ]  [ N d4 ] , [ N x d4 ]  Oh my God! [ R h1 + ] is so obvious! I feel sorry for the white rook.
 [ R f5 + ]  [ K g3 ] , [ K h5 ]  I think that this is too late.
 [ g6 ]  [ N b5 ] , [ Q g5 ]  Preventing [ Q g3 ] and eyeing the [ d2 ] square.
 [ N d2 ] , [ N x f5 ]  A mistake as Black can simply play RxN and still has my Rooks forked with his own Knight.
 [ K c6 ]  [ K a6 ]  [ K c7 ]  [ K b5 ]  [ K d6 ]  [ K b6 ]  [ K d7 ]  [ K c5 ]  [ K e6 ]  [ K c6 ]  [ K e7 ] , [ K x d5 ]  Beautifully executed.
 [ B h5 + ]  [ K d8 ] , [ B g6 ]  now black has a problem with the king in center and the rook cant go to e8.
 [ O-O ]  [ R x b2 ] , [ Q c1 ]  ? Surprised me I expected [ Q x b2 ] [ B x c3 ] to skewer the rook
 [ N x e6 + ]  [ B x e6 ]  [ R x e6 ]  [ K d7 ]  [ R d6 + ]  [ K c7 ]  [ R x d5 ]  [ R f3 ]  [ R d3 ]  [ R h3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ R h8 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ R d7 + ]  [ K c6 ]  [ R f7 ]  [ K d6 ]  [ R x f5 ]  [ b5 ]  [ R d5 + ]  [ K c7 ]  [ R x c5 + ]  [ K b6 ]  [ R x b5 + ]  [ K c6 ] , [ R x a5 ]  
 [ R a2 ]  [ a5 ]  [ h6 ]  [ R a8 + ]  [ K h7 ]  [ a6 ]  [ K g6 ]  [ a7 ]  [ K g5 ]  [ K g2 ] , [ K h4 ]  31. ...... [ K h4 ] - the black king moves towards the enemy pawns so that if the white king goes over to help the passed white pawn the king will gobble them up!
 [ K c7 ]  [ Q d7 + ]  [ K b6 ] , [ R e6 + ]  Bringing my other rook in for support.
 [ B d7 ] , [ B b2 ]  Trying again but this time with a little extra.
 [ Q x e5 ] , [ N x f7 + ]  Black has to return the Queen or else he gets mated. A knock-out punch from the Knight who was waiting for the perfect time to deliver a killer blow. I hope you enjoyed this game as much as I did.
 [ O-O ]  [ N d3 ]  [ B b6 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N e8 ] , [ N d5 ]  9. [ N d5 ] - this is recommended in the World DB but it does violate opening principles of moving the same piece twice.
 [ N d5 ] , [ N x c6 + ]  Oddly enough he still attempts to attack my king perhaps to stall for a better shot at defending himself. Alas...
 [ Q c2 ]  [ Q f7 ] , [ Q b2 ]  Planning to play [ Q a3 ] to tap the d6-pawn.
 [ d6 ]  [ R d7 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ B c3 ]  [ R e7 ]  [ R x e7 ]  [ d x e7 ]  [ R e8 ] , [ R b8 ]  Brings down the curtain. But Black needs a little more convincing.
 [ R f d8 ]  [ B x c8 ]  [ R x c8 ]  [ R f d1 ]  [ K h7 ] , [ Q c3 ]  Black resigned the position is lost
 [ O-O ]  [ O-O ] , [ Q b3 ]  11. [ Q b3 ] - Glenda hits out at [ d4 ] and [ b7 ] both squares are protected at the moment but somehow Glenda is in the mood to put those squares under some pressure.
 [ B x d2 + ] , [ N x d2 ]  ?! I felt the knight was in more of a fighting position here. Probably also subconscious from queen pins in the past.
 [ N f6 ]  [ g3 ]  [ B b4 ]  [ B g2 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ h6 ]  [ N h3 ]  [ K h7 ] , [ N f4 ]  Knight is back to active.
 [ K h2 ]  [ K e2 ] , [ K g1 ]  
 [ R f c8 ]  [ R f d1 ]  [ d6 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ R c5 ]  [ N c e2 ] , [ R a c8 ]  The rooks are doubled up on an open file.
 [ R h3 ]  [ K g6 ] , [ K c6 ]  Black realises that White's Rook can stop his pawn so tries to get the king in.
 [ B d2 + ]  [ K e2 ]  [ B f4 + ]  [ K e1 ]  [ B g3 + ]  [ K f1 ] , [ Q f2 # ]  Checkmate! I think this is a game to be proud of it! Still I made some mistakes by example 12.Qc7?
 [ B g5 ]  [ e6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ Q f3 ] , [ Q a5 ]  This feels like a weird move. But it puts the white bishop way over on [ g5 ] en prise and it pins the white knight on [ c3 ] too.
 [ K h7 ]  [ N d6 ]  [ R f8 ] , [ f4 ]  I strengthen my Pawn-chain.
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ] , [ d4 ]  Smith mora gambit
 [ B e5 ]  [ f4 ]  [ f5 ]  [ Q e2 ]  [ B f6 ] , [ h3 ]  at this point the game is still fairly equal; but Black is starting to suffer a lack of play and safe moves while White is preparing g4...
 [ N b4 ] , [ B d2 ]  developing and chasing away the knight
 [ N c4 ]  [ b3 ]  [ N d2 ]  [ b2 ]  [ N b1 ]  [ N b6 ]  [ K f2 ]  [ a4 ]  [ K e2 ] , [ N c4 ]  Key move at this point allowing the a-pawn to move up. Game over now.
 [ B b4 ] , [ K h8 ]  A bad move for black as he should be doing [ K f8 ] to free up his movement options or attempting to resolve the pin that I have made. Meanwhile I am free to use the pin to my advantage using my bishop.
 [ K g7 ] , [ Q h8 + ]  this was near checkmate because king has only 1 square to move [ g6 ] then i simply move my queen to [ h6 ] and there u go a checkmate! Great game!
 [ e4 ] , [ N g1 ]  Chess analysts who have studied the Verponian chess 'corner-fort defense' have discovered that even though it is strong it is flawed by the necessity for the king to remain in 1 position for a long time. Ancient heroes of Verponian chess were successful for their great king maneuverability - the king being a valuable weapon in Verponian chess
 [ K g7 ]  [ R b6 ]  [ Q e4 ]  [ K h2 ]  [ K h7 ]  [ R d6 ]  [ Q e5 ]  [ N f7 ]  [ Q x b2 + ]  [ K h3 ] , [ Q g7 ]  
 [ Q x a7 ]  [ c6 ] , [ B e3 ]  Threatening [ B b6 ] winning at least an exchange.
 [ R e5 ]  [ R d8 ]  [ R x c5 ] , [ R x d6 ]  30. ..... [ R x d6 ] - pawn trade. Note that if Chris gets greedy and plays Rxb5?? he will cop Old Matey on the back row!
 [ f x e5 ] , [ B a4 ]  Avoiding the threat of 23. [ Q f6 ] forking the bishop and f pawn.
 [ R d8 ] , [ d6 ]  He has 2 rooks lining up my [ [ g6 ] ] pawn and my [ f7 ] pawn is pinned onto the king. Thankfully when I take his pawn my rook is backing up that [ [ g6 ] ] square.
 [ B d5 ]  [ Q c3 ]  [ Q x c3 ]  [ b x c3 ]  [ N f4 ] , [ R e1 ]  it was this or [ B x f4 ] but I preferred to undouble my pawns
 [ e x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N x c6 ]  [ b x c6 ] , [ Q g4 ]  at this point I first sensed that White was not comfortable in this opening: this early outbreak of the Queen does not look very promising; I expected [ N d2 ] [ R b8 ] [ Q g4 ] [ e5 ] [ Q g3 ] at least...
 [ g4 ]  [ B x c2 ] , [ Q x c2 ]  White has an easy game. A lot of firepower directed at the black King and the White King although exposed is safe.
 [ R c7 + ]  [ K d6 ]  [ R h7 ]  [ R f4 ]  [ R h6 + ]  [ K e5 ]  [ R h5 + ]  [ R f5 ] , [ R h4 ]  This is to stop the king crossing the fourth rank should my king be forced back.
 [ d3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B g2 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ N e1 ]  This move is virtually thematic with me from this and any closely resembling "White Dragon" pawn formation. The Knight is off to [ c2 ] where it helps support the center and a Q-side pawn expansion. The move also uncovers the long diagonal for White's King's Bishop another de rigueur theme for White in the fianchettoed English.
 [ g x h6 ]  [ Q x h6 ] , [ B f8 ]  anything else loses on the spot
 [ B f6 ]  [ Q e1 ] , [ R a e8 ]  not paying attention probably out of being bored to death... immediately [ B x h4 ] [ g x h4 ] Nf4! [ K h1 ] [ K h8 ] is winning on the spot...
 [ B d6 ] , [ d4 ]  The [ d2 ] pawn is in the way so let's move it with tempo since black will recapture. Sacrifice #1.
 [ Q b3 ] , [ B x c3 ]  I take the knight as I planned and of course white will take the bishop but the computer analysis views this as a inaccuracy. I can not really see the reason why but since it's only an inaccuracy it would not give black a bad disadvantage. The best move was a5. True for then both the pawn and the bishop would of protected each other and white would not attack with one of their powerful pieces.
 [ e x d4 ] , [ Q x d4 ]  Bringing out a queen aint good for development because the oponent use it against you to develop his own pieces like maddie will do now...
 [ g2 ]  [ N e2 ]  [ R h1 ]  [ R d2 ]  [ R e1 ] , [ N g1 ]  Only move!
 [ h5 ] , [ B d3 ]  taking the pawn leads to weak isolated pawn on h file.
 [ e x d5 ]  [ Q x d5 ] , [ N c3 ]  Best move.This move follows all the opening principles
 [ R c8 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ K f7 ] , [ e5 ]  I made sure pawn cannot move. [Computer: 20. [ [ f5 ] ] [ K g7 ] 21. [ f x e6 ] [ d x e6 ] 22. [ e5 ] Nx[ e5 ] 23. Nx[ e5 ] [ R h d8 ] 24. [ N d3 ] [ Q d7 ] 25. [ Q b2 ] Nf5.... 20. [ [ f5 ] ] gx[ [ f5 ] ] is even worst for black]
 [ O-O ]  [ b x a4 ] , [ e x f6 ]  Black must take with the rook and it will be vulnerable
 [ Q g3 ]  [ Q e7 ]  [ N d2 ]  [ d6 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ N g5 ]  Again quite happy to try and move the h pawn to g and free up my rook
 [ B f5 ]  [ Q b2 ]  [ R a b8 ] , [ R a d1 ]  And now Black can't play ...[ B e6 ] anymore because of the supported pawn-push to d5.
 [ f x e4 + ]  [ N x e4 ] , [ N x e4 ]  ?? Omg it is so rare that I miss a kill shot but yep I did. 30. [ B f5 ] wins the knight. Now all my hard work of pushing white back has gone up in smoke. Not to take anything away for Caveman but I think it was 3:30 am here and I was in between my 4th or 5th glass of scotch Alternative variation: 30... [ B f5 ] 31. [ B f3 ] [ g5 ] 32. [ b3 ] [ g4 ] 33. [ K e3 ] [ g x f3 ] 34. [ N x d6 ] [ f x g2 ] 35. [ K f2 ] [ B h3 ] 36. [ K g1 ] [ K e7 ] 37. [ N e4 ]  [ K x e4 ] , [ B f5 + ]  With four bishops and a balanced pawn structure the position is dead.
 [ c x d4 ] , [ c x d4 ]  Now White also has a passed pawn in the center
 [ R d e1 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ Q h5 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ Q x h6 ]  [ Q g6 ] , [ N g4 ]  Coaxing the black knight away from [ e5 ] as 36. ...[ Q x h6 ] 37.[ N x h6 ] followed by 38.[ N f5 ] would be awkward for black.
 [ R x a1 ] , [ Q b6 ]  Eyeballing the fork of king and rook with 18. ... Qxb2. If white protects [ b2 ] by playing 18. [ Q x e5 ] black responds with 18. ... [ B d4 ] blocking the queen's defense and attacking the queen. White cannot both save the queen and prevent the fork.
 [ N c3 ] , [ g6 ]  White now develops his knight to [ c3 ] and I prepare to fianchetto my DB with g6.
 [ d5 ]  [ N b6 ]  [ R b8 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ Q f8 ] , [ N e7 + ]  This is a nice move that wins significant material again because the Rooks are not linked.
 [ N g f3 ] , [ B d6 ]  White develops to the Kingside – but the threat is on the Queenside [ N e3 ] (with the aim of Nc3) is better. [ B d6 ] does create a strong threat on the Kingside but again this was too passive [ N b4 ] would have been better.
 [ N d2 + ]  [ K b4 ]  [ h4 ]  [ a5 ] , [ N e4 ]  Black already has problems in keeping my a-pawn from promoting.
 [ Q e7 ] , [ d5 ]  ahh now he does it. a little late.
 [ B x g5 ]  [ B x g5 ] , [ h6 ]  Black is rather behind in development and would therefore probably be better off by getting his knights into play.
 [ K e6 ] , [ Q d5 + ]  ...so the queen...
 [ B x a2 ]  [ Q x c7 + ]  [ R d7 ]  [ Q x b6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ Q b8 ] , [ B x b5 ]  ? Mistake on my part! I thought that after [ Q g8 ] i had [ B c4 ] but i forgot that it was hanging. I think [ N x b5 ] is better.
 [ B b3 ]  [ B d7 ] , [ O-O-O ]  I was already having doubts about my strategy as Black was obviously going to exploit the half-open c-file and eventually create further threats with his fianchettoed B but at this stage I thought he was equally well placed to attack a kingside castled position and I could soon launch my kingside attack.
 [ e5 ] , [ R a e1 ]  Setting up control of d-f line of board.
 [ R x a3 ] , [ N d7 ]  No use to try to save [ b5 ] for sure. I better put some patchs on my position: now [ R a1 ] is defended.
 [ R g8 ] , [ Q b3 ]  I do not know what this is going to accomplish. For some reason she wants to check me again. I think that she is trying to use a "Scare Tactic" but I do not get overwhelmed easily.
 [ R d1 ] , [ a5 ]  Now I'm playing changing plans: I thought that after [ a4 ] the knight have to fly and my rook can go to c1. To change plans in the middle of one of them is always dangerous (if not bad).
 [ N f5 ] , [ R e e8 ]  [ R e6 ] would stop the tactical trick temporarily but white can play [ d5 ] and still win the pawn.
 [ c5 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ] , [ c3 ]  The Smith Morra for fun
 [ f x e5 ] , [ N c3 + ]  (!) More problems are rising in White's disintegrating position.
 [ f6 ] , [ B a2 ]  Now White is thinking about the skewer against my King. Instead of allowing the exchange to happen on [ e6 ] I would move it back f7. But first I would have to deal with the attack on my Rook.
 [ a6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ c5 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ O-O-O ]  Developing moves by both sides.
 [ b x c4 ]  [ N c2 ]  [ R x d8 + ]  [ R x d8 ]  [ R e6 ] , [ R d6 ]  Am a little worried at this point (her knight will soon go into play). I'm banking on my ability to hold her king back after the rook exchange while capturing her c-pawn with an eventual push for an a or b file queen. Should she choose not to perform the rook exchange I have reasonable confidence I can ensure the loss of her very important c-pawn.
 [ R x f4 ]  [ Q x h3 ] , [ Q e7 ]  prepare to brng my a rook : allowing free passage for the rook i hav to move the king to [ d7 ] so first i have to move the knight to [ f8 ] or maybe [ [ f6 ] ] if i move first the f pawn to [ [ f6 ] ] ...too complicated but i dot have the choice this will make me loosing a lot of time and will give to the white the initiative.
 [ h2 ]  [ K e2 ]  [ h1 = B ] , [ K d3 ]  Shredder: 65. [ f6 ] lose in 19 BEST 65. [ K d3 ] lose in 18
 [ O-O ] , [ B g5 ]  But funnily enough Matt reiterated that when he had played this he felt that he was drifting into a bad position at this point. I was already concerned about how I would complete my development. Putting my B on [ d7 ] would cut my Q off from [ d4 ] and [ d5 ] and potentially if the Q went to [ c7 ] as it often does it would cut it off from the defence of e7. Moving the b pawn to allow the B to [ b7 ] leaves the [ N c6 ] undefended. If I don't get the B off the back rank soon I'm going to have trouble connecting my rooks. This becomes thematic in the denouement.
 [ N d6 ] , [ Q c2 ]  Another piece on the c-file! It seems so simple doesn't it? Sometimes I wish chess were always this easy then I could actually be good at it....
 [ N f3 ] , [ R x f4 ]  0-1 26. [ g x h3 ] [ B x f3 + ] 27. [ Q x f3 ] [ R x f3 ] and I am up a Rook Bishop and Knight.
 [ N g8 ] , [ N e4 ]  the black king is wick. there many options to sacrifice a tool on [ g5 ] and afterwards [ f7 ] will fall too.
 [ Q x f4 ]  [ g x f4 ] , [ R f8 ]  white has no way to protect the pawn island.
 [ N c5 ]  [ B g5 ] , [ Q h5 ]  Seeing a mate pattern whites queen on the place of blacks [ e8 ] rook will be victorious
 [ B e6 ] , [ K b1 ]  White protects the pawn and gets the king out of the shadow of black queen.
 [ K c5 ] , [ B d7 ]  Guarding the Knight... still anyone's game.
 [ Q c2 ] , [ N f6 ]  His knight is forced to retreat
 [ a3 ]  [ N h6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ N f5 ]  [ B d3 ] , [ O-O ]  [ Q b6 ] [ a5 ] [ c4 ] and [ N c6 ] are viable alternatives.
 [ Q x a8 ] , [ h5 ]  Trying to give himself some room to move.
 [ c x d5 ]  [ B x d5 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N e5 ] , [ f6 ]  trying to attack the knight
 [ e4 ] , [ e6 ]  Rocason and I started playing fast games playing French defense which we both like.
 [ Q x a2 ] , [ R e1 ]  But after his last move I was thinking about ways that Carl could still go wrong. What I'm keeping in mind is that my R was attacked and that he had a lot more time then me. Now that normally makes me nervous as well and in my first tournament game caused me to resign. But that's not so here because even though I'm not quite sure I estimate that Carl has 40 minutes against my 20 or 25. And if that's so Carl only took like 10 minutes. At the time I didn't think it was possible to make 20 or 25 moves in only 10 minutes. But this opponent has surprised me with his speed. With that being said if and when he moves too fast I'll be prepared to use it against him which will eventually happen. And that's by thinking and talking about conditional moves. And it's worth noting that with Tom it's like a regular OTB games with which I don't speak of them as Joe posted in the thread. In fact after my third tournament which was against him a week later Jack said something about Carl moving too quickly. With that being said I start here by preparing to exchange pawns which isn't liquidation since the idea is "exchange pawns not pieces" especially when behind.
 [ N d7 ]  [ B e3 ] , [ B c5 ]  By exchanging my bishop for the white's one I get the advantage because his lsb has no action right now.
 [ R x h7 ]  [ Q x d4 ] , [ B d6 ]  I try to make a pressure on h2.
 [ B x h7 + ] , [ K h8 ]  Unexpected
 [ B b5 ]  [ e6 ] , [ B x c6 ]  sacrificed my knight for horse
 [ e4 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ B g4 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ Q d2 ]  Not a normal opening for me but fairly standard looking development.
 [ N c6 ]  [ R x b3 ] , [ N d4 ]  He can save from the fork though.
 [ K d8 ] , [ R a b1 ]  Black's reply abandons the pawn on b7. White could take it immediately but I spotted a little trap and preferred to bait the hook to see if black would nibble. So white deliberately leaves his pawn at [ [ d5 ] ] undefended (19. [ Q x b7 ] wins a pawn but it also defends [ [ d5 ] ] which I didn't want to do just yet). Probably not white's best course of action. If black declines the trap with 19. ... [ b6 ] white loses the opportunity to gain that pawn (and in the process passing his own pawn on a2). But black already snatched at one baited trap so white hopes for another.
 [ g3 ] , [ g6 ]  I don't like to commit to [ g6 ] when white hasn't committed to a queen pawn opening but I decide to mirror white to take them into less familiar territory.
 [ N f3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ Q b6 ]  [ d3 ]  [ h6 ] , [ B e3 ]  pins the pawn to the queen to discourage [ c4 ]  [ N d4 ] , [ O-O ]  this is a blunder as it loses material
 [ a3 ] , [ K f2 ]  The end is looking near and my options are limited.
 [ R x a8 ]  [ Q x a8 ] , [ B x b5 ]  The computer suggested [ B x f6 ]  [ B x b5 ] , [ N x b5 ]  I now threaten [ N c7 ] a royal fork
 [ a4 ] , [ c6 ]  better than 5...a6? 6.[ a x b5 ] and 6...axb5?? hangs the rook after 7.[ R x a8 ]  [ a x b5 ]  [ c x b5 ] , [ b3 ]  The logical follow-up to 6.axb5.White wins the pawn back.
 [ Q d2 ] , [ B g3 + ]  Oh no you di-in't put your lady in my lady's face! But I didn't come alone! I got friends! My kingdom for a horse! He says but his horse can't even help him! He's hopeless!
 [ a3 ]  [ b5 ]  [ B a2 ]  [ d6 ]  [ b4 ]  [ B b6 ]  [ Q e2 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ B x f3 ]  [ g x f3 ]  [ N e7 ] , [ K d2 ]  Can't rem why I did that instead of castling.
 [ O-O-O ]  [ B d3 ]  [ B x d3 ] , [ Q x d3 ]  Wanting to attack now before black arranges his defense to suit his king.
 [ B e5 ] , [ B g7 ]  Interesting. I wonder if he'll trade. 2. [ B e4 ] violates one of the minor opening principles that suggests not moving bishops until after moving their adjacent knights. 3. [ B e5 ] violates another opening principle that it's generally unwise to move a piece a second time until you've developed the rest of your pieces.
 [ c4 ] , [ e5 ]  In two previous games he opened with an early b5. I won one and he the other. In the game I won I immediately replied 2.[ g3 ] and he played mechanically dropping the [ a8 ] rook. When he won his play was far beyond my own. I don't know what happens sometimes. I feel bulletproof but then along comes a player who sees the swiss cheese in my position. I usually get dominated in the GK rated games and not in faster over the board play. It does happen but less frequently.
 [ b6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ e6 ] , [ O-O ]  White has 4 pieces developed to Black's 3 pieces. White is castled as well.
 [ N c6 ] , [ a3 ]  A precautionary move against [ N b4 ] although i don't see [ d4 ] lasting much longer...
 [ K f6 ]  [ K b6 ]  [ K e6 ]  [ a4 ] , [ K d6 ]  Does his knight have time to come over and grab these pawns?
 [ Q x d5 ]  [ c6 ]  [ Q f3 ] , [ Q h6 ]  Possibly better to try and maintain the attack was 16...Rae8.
 [ d4 ]  [ d6 ] , [ e4 ]  Im playing as white and i open with my Queens Pawn. He decides to open with the queens defense. As you can see by my games I am a very aggresive player even when playing the queens gambit. I am happy with where I am right now.
 [ Q a5 + ]  [ K e2 ]  [ Q b4 ]  [ R b1 ]  [ c x d5 ] , [ N c2 ]  '?!' - An inaccuracy in a hopeless position. More tenacious was 12.[ h3 ] to eradicate the pin on [ N f3 ] that paralyzes White's position.
 [ d x c4 ]  [ d x c4 ] , [ B d6 ]  Attacks the Knight and clears the e-file.
 [ R e1 ] , [ N c4 ]  Planting the Knight where it can't be removed.
 [ N e5 ] , [ Q g2 ]  27. [ a5 ] was an option...
 [ R x c3 ] , [ B b3 ]  Everything just holds for White.
 [ Q x d7 ] , [ O-O ]  I was aware that this could be risky if Black continued to pile pressure on [ d4 ] with a pin (...Bb6) but worked out that I could cope.
 [ K d7 ]  [ N x h5 ] , [ R d4 ]  But as the others must fall I resign. Curious that the move the computer has as Black's first error was actually the move that won the game! Beware the computer analysis!
 [ B x g3 ]  [ h x g3 ]  [ R f d8 ] , [ Q e5 ]  The arising endgame is good for black so maybe was not the right time to trade queens.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ B b5 ]  The Ruy Lopez opening which has been heavily analyzed for over 100 years.
 [ R x e7 ]  [ N x e7 ] , [ K d4 ]  38. [ K d4 ] - white's active king is gonna prove decisive in this knight endgame.
 [ K h7 ] , [ a4 ]  I could push [ Q e1 ] check and with tempo move the pawn [ d2 ] [ d1 ] and swop queens but there is better forced mate in 2
 [ N c5 ]  [ B x c5 ] , [ b4 ]  However I thought that I could win something back after he decided to take. But that is not the case because he finds a place to retreat his B. Of course I will try just about anything because I am aware that he has a winning edge.
 [ K g6 ] , [ b3 ]  I move up my queenside knight's pawn to attack the remaining pawn on that side...
 [ K f8 ]  [ B c6 ]  [ K e7 ]  [ K f3 ]  [ B d7 ] , [ B b7 ]  39. [ B b7 ] - eschews bishop swap - if you go into K & P ending a pawn down you go into a losing ending - must be avoided like the plague!
 [ e x d5 ] , [ Q x d5 ]  ...which we exchange bringing my queen into play.
 [ R a b1 ] , [ B b6 ]  Black has multiple weaknesses in his defense. It is imperative that he hold onto his pawns so that White will be forced to sac key pieces in order to reach the king. Black is in a completely defensive state with little thought of attacking White.
 [ e1 = Q ]  [ R x e1 ]  [ R x e1 ]  [ K f3 ] , [ B g1 ]  the idea is to keep control over [ [ e3 ] ] and play next [ R [ e3 ] + ] and if white exchanges or tries to gain a quality on [ [ e3 ] ] to give discovered check fx[ [ e3 ] ] with another promotion to follow soon after
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ e3 ] , [ N f6 ]  I prefer in this position to play c5. I guess that [ N f6 ] is good eanogh as well.
 [ Q d8 + ]  [ K e5 ]  [ N f3 + ]  [ K e4 ] , [ e7 ]  The pawn cannot be stopped. There was probably a quicker forced mate but I wasn't going to try to find it under time pressure.
 [ O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ B g3 ] , [ Q a8 ]  no rocket science involved here...
 [ B x g4 ]  [ B x g4 ] , [ B e3 ]  Black's bishop pair is almost as bad as his rook pair. White's plan continues unrestrained. Black is a little shorter on time than White but nothing to worry about.
 [ R f d8 ]  [ N f1 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ N e2 ]  [ N d6 ]  [ N f g3 ] , [ Q f7 ]  24. ........ [ Q f7 ] - the Wicked Witch of the West foils my plan however. Black now has a good pawn centre and a passed d pawn and a strong lsb. Offset against it is a black isolani on [ a7 ] - also Glenda has a clear line from b1-[ h7 ] - I would lurve Frere Leblanc to be on the board here but unfortunately he ain't so I must think of another way.
 [ B d7 ] , [ Q a4 ]  Maybe not the best but sharpest.
 [ R b8 ] , [ R d6 + ]  Now im smelling a possible mating attack
 [ B d4 + ]  [ K h1 ] , [ Q h4 ]  ? the idea is to hit on [ f2 ] but that is well covered. Alternative variation:[better is] 18... [ N d7 ] 19. [ g3 ] [ N g f6 ] 20. [ Q b3 ] [ Q d8 ] [leaves black in charge]
 [ B d7 ]  [ Q x f5 ]  [ e x f5 ] , [ N f4 ]  I think this is a devent move it doesnt really threaten anything but it gives me some footing Im starting to notice the e file which is quite dangerous for my stuck king
 [ h4 ] , [ Q e1 ]  ! This short move activates the queen in suprisingly way. Now ...[ h x g3 ] is answered with [ Q x g3 ] activating queen and white has ideas with [ g x h4 ]  [ Q e7 ] , [ a4 ]  Finally white can start his attack on the queenside.
 [ B d7 ] , [ Q c1 ]  20. [ Q c1 ] - preparing a possible Bh6.
 [ B d7 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ Q d6 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ O-O-O ]  [ N g5 ] , [ B e6 ]  I'm trying to attack somehow as the pawns in the centre were missing...
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ e3 ] , [ b6 ]  A Queen's pawn game.
 [ Q f2 + ]  [ K d1 ] , [ Q d2 # ]  
 [ K g8 ]  [ N d8 ]  [ h x g5 ]  [ N x e6 ]  [ g x f4 ]  [ N x f4 ]  [ B x e5 ]  [ N g2 ] , [ R g4 ]  White has cleared all of Blacks' pawns but he did not come out unscaved either: he's gotten himself into a nasty pin with mate perspectives; Blacks' DSB is a real killer...
 [ h4 ]  [ K f6 ]  [ K g2 ]  [ N d6 ]  [ h5 ] , [ N e4 ]  The only choice here for Black is 36...[ K g7 ] to slow the advancing h-pawn and look for a chance to blockade the pawn roller. But these four connected passed pawns are a terror for Black in this game.
 [ K c6 ] , [ R d5 ]  Being banished from the 7th rank the rook finds another nice place where it also cuts off the Black king from the action.
 [ N f3 ] , [ e4 ]  Oops pushed your luck with the pawn a bit too far. It is unprotected and the attack on my knight is only for show. Better would have been 10...[ d6 ] freeing up both your queen side knight and bishop.
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ Q x d4 ] , [ c5 ]  I can usually cope with firestorm games. I'm aware they aren't the most technical or accurate of games but I like them. Usually.
 [ N x b8 ]  [ f4 ]  [ K f8 ] , [ f5 ]  For the sake of a pleasant interlude to this intense annotation it may be of interest to know the origin of the expression 'grophworthy' - a term derived from the Gopite/Draphenium hybrid mineral 'Grophenite'; now and again Wackyworld's clouds turn a yolky colour due to an infection from a vapour-eating parasite known as Loshtophitus. Fortunately a government-paid agency known as 'A Whiter Wackyworld' are responsible for directly administering 'Grophenite' into clouds when symptoms first emerge and the parasite is rapidly dissolved. For as long as 80 years common citizens from the Graw City would point a finger to the sky at a yellow cloud remarking 'that cloud's grophworty' over the years the expression was adopted in many sports including cloud-surfing cloud-skiing cloud-jesting cloud-chestnuting cloud-chess and eventually chess.
 [ N h5 ] , [ B x e4 ]  Now black feels safe taking the bishop.
 [ N x c4 ]  [ B x c4 ] , [ a6 ]  preparing a pawn thrust on the queenside trying to make use of the majority.
 [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ N c6 ]  have to save my queen i ran back
 [ a5 ] , [ g3 ]  28. [ g3 ] - trying to hold up the pawn roll but would [ h3 ] have been an improvement?
 [ K f8 ] , [ K e4 ]  Well if I can move my King far enough I can take the f-pawn since my h-pawn will take the g-pawn if it attempts to protect it. But how to get his King away?
 [ B f1 ] , [ g5 ]  this was enough: White resigned...
 [ g6 ]  [ e4 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B d3 ]  [ c6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ e5 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ N b d7 ]  [ N x d7 ]  [ B x d7 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ N g4 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ f5 ]  [ Q h4 ]  [ h3 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ f x g6 ]  [ h x g6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ B x h3 ]  [ B x f7 + ]  [ N x f7 ]  [ g x h3 ]  [ Q x h3 ]  [ Q f3 ]  [ Q x f3 ]  [ R x f3 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ R f4 ]  [ b6 ]  [ B d4 ]  [ R a d8 ]  [ B x e5 ]  [ B x e5 ] , [ R g4 ]  The best move here in my opinion was [ R f3 ] so that if Black does [ B x c3 ] White will have [ R x c3 ] and then has [ R x c6 ] if Black would do Rxe4.
 [ R c c1 ] , [ B d6 ]  Avoiding 33...[ R h1 # ] if the Bishop doesn't move.
 [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ O-O ]  Both sides just developing pieces
 [ Q x g5 ] , [ e4 ]  A blunder perhaps the losing move of the game. Better was 0-0-0 while there was time. This move fails due to the checking move available by black.
 [ K d3 ]  [ N c1 + ]  [ K d2 ]  [ N b3 + ]  [ K e3 ]  [ N c1 ]  [ K d2 ]  [ N b3 + ]  [ K e3 ]  [ N c1 ] , [ K d2 ]  
 [ f4 ] , [ e x f4 ]  Naturally I must accept the gambit! It is the honorable thing to do.
 [ O-O ] , [ h5 ]  8.O-O [ h5 ] I castle to defend my King. Black threatens my Kingside with his h-file pawn.
 [ B e6 ] , [ c4 ]  Finally.
 [ g6 ] , [ R a d1 ]  Preparing to relieve my Bishop of the defence of the d pawn. I planned in a Petrosianesque way to bring both my Bishops back to [ c2 ] and [ c1 ] where they are ont hey're most agressive diagonals without obstructing the other pieces.
 [ R x f2 ] , [ R c1 ]  I guess he's prepared for a check. But that doesn't bother me.
 [ R x e5 ] , [ R x e5 ]  Mistake as mentioned. Black can now go 23... [ N f7 ] 24. [ R e2 ] (quickly supporting c2) [ Q d6 ] and white will lose the a-pawn: 25. Qc1? is useless overloading herself.
 [ N x f3 ] , [ N g6 ]  here I've considered also [ g4 ] but I preferred to protect [ h4 ] first
 [ b x c6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ N g4 ] , [ N x e5 ]  My Knight is now ready.
 [ K h2 ] , [ Q c2 ]  I can't take it because I lose the e-pawn and the a-pawn is attacked too.
 [ N x e6 + ]  [ f x e6 ]  [ R g3 ] , [ N x h3 ]  I was starting to get low on time. I did this simply because I thought it could lead to something. I was wrong.
 [ R g1 ]  [ R h3 ]  [ R d1 ] , [ R d h8 ]  Again threatening the rook exchange by ...[ R h1 ] and ...R8h2.
 [ R b3 ]  [ a x b6 ]  [ Q x b6 ]  [ Q a7 ]  [ a6 ]  [ K f7 ] , [ Q x a7 ]  More than a simple exchange White has removed Black's best defender.
 [ B x e7 ] , [ Q x e7 ]  ...so we trade bishops...
 [ h x g4 ]  [ R x h1 ] , [ K c2 ]  ! Protects the Knight avails the rook avoids a check and finds safety. A fine move. Note the key [ h2 ] square is very well protected so White will retain the initiative unchecked beginning with a fork on c7. That open h-file is not intimidating at all -- Black is not sufficiently developed to exploit it.
 [ N x d4 ]  [ c x d4 ] , [ B g8 ]  Unlike before I do not know why Ken played this.
 [ e4 ] , [ b6 ]  1.......... [ b6 ] - this is Owen's Defense the purpose of this move is for the black lsb to be fianchettoed on [ b7 ] hitting out at [ e4 ] and ultimately [ g2 ] and a1. So there is a counter in the centre that way. I am warning you guys and dolls that I will be on the wrong end of a rout here but as Owen's Defense is not well known then I hope this game will enlighten you!
 [ K d3 ] , [ B c3 ]  looks risky because of the threat of double attacks on N and B by K or R
 [ a5 ]  [ a6 ] , [ B g4 ]  An open e-file and a probable bishop trade.
 [ K c2 ]  [ c4 ] , [ e3 ]  giving some space to my pieces let's start to play seriously now
 [ O-O ] , [ B e7 ]  An interesting line is 5..[ N x e4 ] 6. [ d4 ] [ b5 ] 7. [ B b3 ] [ d5 ] 8. dxe5. I don't like it as black because the pawn on [ e5 ] really cramps blacks position but it is more open and interesting to try if you're interested in that type of position.
 [ N f4 ] , [ R h e1 ]  I'm thinking my G pawn is not as important as black e Pawn if the exchange takes place i'll have a powerful e file
 [ K f1 ] , [ K g8 + ]  only one place to run
 [ a x b2 + ] , [ K b1 ]  Like the line I gave this is still forced but now there is no mate in sight.
 [ R f3 ]  [ R h2 ]  [ R g3 ]  [ h4 ] , [ R g4 ]  This square movement that I just made with the rook may not appear to make too much sense but it works out very well. After the king moves to [ c5 ] there is absolutely nothing that white can do other than move the rook back and forth along the h file to continue to protect the h pawn. This will give me all the time in the world to bring my king over to [ g7 ] after which I can follow that up with pawn to [ h6 ] to force a pawn exchange which will allow my king to attack the h pawn as well.
 [ Q d7 ]  [ R a3 ] , [ a x b5 ]  Great move.
 [ N x g6 ] , [ Q d6 ]  The black king is weak and black is in late of material. The 2 good things are that black has a better control on the center and can quickly bring all his reserves to protect the king.
 [ K g8 ] , [ R d3 ]  I think my intention was to double the rooks for an attack. It also brings some defensive capabilities to the g file should I need some.
 [ K c4 ]  [ K a2 ] , [ K c3 ]  
 [ Q c7 ]  [ Q x c7 + ]  [ K x c7 ] , [ K c4 ]  but no enough difference.
 [ Q x c2 + ] , [ R x c2 ]  Balance is even. I made mistakes but I managed to came out of the danger without mayor losses. My opponent is really tough.
 [ K g6 + ]  [ K g8 ] , [ B d6 ]  This is a very important position of this endgame and remembering the concepts is complicated like in the key position but the key position is more likely to occur. This position is rare but if you remember it then you can automatically know you're winning if you reach this position on your opponent's turn. The special thing about this position is that the player to move decides the game. This position (and mirror images of it) aren't hard positions to memorize but you don't even need to memorize it if you can logically see how both sides would be in zugswang if it was their turn to move. If it was Black's move here then the position is drawn because Black cannot make a move without disrupting his formation. No matter where Black moves he'll be allowing the White rook access to a square that was guarded before. In this case White is the one in zugswang since it is White to move here. No matter where White moves he will unguard a critical square or set of squares. 47.[ R f3 ] would take away the [ R g2 ] potential checking idea so Black can play [ R c1 ] with unstoppable mate since the rook no longer has a check. 47.[ R f7 ] would take away the [ K f7 ] potential escape path so play could continue [ K h6 ] [ K h8 ] [ B e5 ] 47.[ K h8 ] would also take away the [ K f7 ] potential escaping route so play could continue [ R e1 ] (threatening mate) [ R g2 ] [ K h6 ] [ K g8 ] [ R f1 ] (threatening unstoppable mate) To avoid these quick mates the rook must move along the 2nd rank allowing the Black king access to the f-file.
 [ B e8 ] , [ Q e7 ]  Inviting my enemy to give the check! but assuring the next move will be lethal.
 [ R a7 ]  [ R x d6 ]  [ K e7 ]  [ R x b6 ] , [ R b7 ]  Good try but not good enough.
 [ N x a6 ] , [ Q d3 ]  Back on [ d3 ]  [ Q x e6 + ] , [ N x e6 ]  Until know white's center holds.
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B f4 ] , [ N h5 ]  Strange. I am used to play with the dsb exchanged with this N. [ B g5 ] [ h6 ] [ B h4 ] is not an option if black really wants to exchange the B. [ B d2 ] would be entering a scheme that I don't know well so...
 [ Q f5 ]  [ d4 ]  [ B x f1 ] , [ Q x f1 ]  I need development so I sacrificed 2 points.
 [ R c d1 ]  [ R x c6 ] , [ K e2 ]  Eh I honestly can't tell you what I was thinking here. Best was probably [ h4 ] to try and exchange as many pawns as I can. This basically asks for black to play [ R c2 + ] which forces an exchange of rooks.
 [ Q b6 ]  [ R c7 ]  [ R f8 ]  [ Q c4 + ]  [ K h8 ]  [ R c8 ]  [ Q f6 ]  [ R x f8 + ]  [ Q x f8 ] , [ Q x e4 ]  And now a sure loss... no worth trying.
 [ K f5 ]  [ K b4 ]  [ K g6 ]  [ K x b3 ]  [ K x g7 ]  [ K x a4 ]  [ K x h6 ] , [ b5 ]  4th rank vs. 3rd rank. I should promote first.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ Q e7 ]  This is known as the Gunderam defense.
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ d6 ]  Here playing black with the Sicilian defense. It's a blitz game.
 [ R x f2 ] , [ N e7 ]  The knight heads off to [ g6 ] to play for the arabian mate there doesn't look to be much defence for black now it will take too long to pick off all the white pawns.
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ g3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ B g2 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ d3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ f4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N g e7 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ N e2 ]  [ R b8 ]  [ c3 ] , [ b5 ]  This is a classic Closed Sicilian structure where White attacks on the King-side whereas Black launches an attack down the Queen-side.Black is hoping to soften White on the dark squares.
 [ N c7 + ]  [ K f8 ] , [ Q x g6 ]  I still have a spare move after black's check and I use it this way. Black has mate in one and there is nothing he can do to avoid it. My opponene resigned here I show the continuation.
 [ K h1 ]  [ R f3 f1 + ]  [ K h2 ] , [ R f1 f2 ]  0-1. A solid victory from a shattered opening. Even minor pieces and rooks can work together to overcome royalty. What did we learn? If you have a high advantage in material stay in the game you may have not won just yet...
 [ Q h3 + ]  [ K g8 ]  [ f6 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ f x g7 ]  [ b3 ]  [ Q h8 + ]  [ K f7 ] , [ B h5 # ]  
 [ f4 ] , [ N x e3 ]  this move gives up my knight for a pulverized game.
 [ B x c4 ]  [ R x c4 ] , [ N d e2 ]  Preferable to retreating the other N as the [ N d4 ] would have been vulnerable to attack by ...[ e5 ] diverting the N from defence of c2.
 [ c6 ]  [ c x d5 ] , [ c x d5 ]  So far standard opening. I was going for a Slav defense since that seems to be a less played game around here and it takes some people by surprise. Exchange variation.
 [ R x d6 ]  [ Q x d6 ]  [ c5 ] , [ Q e6 ]  Perhaps going to [ e2 ] would have protected the pawn without allowing an exchange but by now I am reconciled to it...
 [ a x b5 ]  [ N x b5 ]  [ Q b8 ]  [ N x d6 + ]  [ K e7 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ Q a7 ]  [ N b5 ]  [ Q a4 ]  [ B d6 + ]  [ K d8 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N e8 ]  [ b3 ]  [ Q e4 ]  [ B f3 ]  [ Q f5 ]  [ B x c6 ]  [ b x c6 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ Q g6 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ B a6 ]  [ N x c6 + ]  [ K c7 ]  [ N e7 ]  [ Q g5 ]  [ Q d4 ]  [ R b8 ]  [ B d6 + ]  [ N x d6 ]  [ Q x d6 + ]  [ K b7 ]  [ Q x d7 + ]  [ K a8 ]  [ Q c6 + ]  [ R b7 ]  [ Q x a6 + ]  [ R a7 ]  [ Q c6 + ]  [ R b7 ]  [ N c8 ]  [ Q x e5 ] , [ N d6 ]  
 [ c6 ]  [ R a6 ]  [ c5 ]  [ R c6 ]  [ a2 ]  [ R x c5 ] , [ R d3 ]  He should have gone r[ b1 ] because I wouldn't be able to stop [ a2 ] promoting.
 [ e6 ]  [ B g2 ] , [ b6 ]  According to the computer analysis this is the first inaccuracy it prefers … [ N c6 ] 8. O-O [ R e8 ] 9. [ R e1 ] [ h6 ] 10. [ R b1 ] [ g5 ] 11. [ h3 ] [ e5 ] 12. [ d5 ] [ N b4 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B b7 ]  [ e5 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ N f d7 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ Q e8 ] , [ R e1 ]  lining up against the black queen.
 [ K c2 ] , [ N a5 ]  Restricting the king from b3. This time if Black keeps heading toward the queenside with [ K b2 ] then [ K d3 ] [ K a3 ] [ K c3 ] [ K a4 ] [ N b7 ] and the king will be pushed back toward White's territory and then pushed to the kingside. The reason the king needs to be pushed toward the pawn is because White has a knight sacrifice tactic later. where White mates with a lone knight.
 [ N x d7 ] , [ K e6 ]  stopping that knight move for myself and I was planning to resume my checkmate strategy but...
 [ Q e2 ] , [ R d8 ]  And that's why Ju is trying to put pressure on white.
 [ B b4 + ]  [ N c3 ] , [ N e4 ]  Here if [ B d2 ] [ Q x d4 ] threatening mate on [ f2 ]  [ Q c2 ] , [ N x c3 ]  White loses this knight or the Rook [ a1 ] after Bxc3+.
 [ Q x e5 + ] , [ B e2 ]  Doomed.
 [ R a8 ]  [ R a1 ]  [ d5 ] , [ R x b4 ]  38. [ R x [ b4 ] ] - my rook coralls the [ b4 ] pawn and now material equality has been restored but I feel here that black has a positional edge.
 [ B x e4 ] , [ N e5 ]  [ B d3 ] was good enough. Exchanging the lsb leaves me without any "good" piece.
 [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ] , [ B x d4 ]  White is two pawns down but way ahead in development. My kind of opening!
 [ R h g1 + ] , [ R g7 ]  still have my eyes on the knight thinking white won't give away this exchange.
 [ N e6 ] , [ Q b6 ]  just want to get her out of there.
 [ K x f2 ]  [ N g4 + ]  [ K e1 ] , [ Q x g5 ]  I am back at even now...
 [ K f7 ]  [ K e5 ]  [ g4 ]  [ Q d7 + ]  [ K g6 ]  [ Q e7 ] , [ K h5 ]  ? Mate in 1.
 [ R x d8 ] , [ g x f3 ]  +2
 [ d x c5 ] , [ N c6 ]  black is developing steadily
 [ g6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B g7 ] , [ B f4 ]  Rossolimo sticks to the accepted line.
 [ Q c2 ] , [ B h5 ]  Of course note 29. Qxc2? Alternative variation: 29. [ Q x c2 ] [ B x c2 ] 30. [ c x d6 ] [ c x d6 ] 31. [ R c1 ] [ B e4 ] [ with a small possibility of a hard long fight to a draw for black.]
 [ g6 ] , [ Q f3 ]  Mate thread on b7.
 [ Q c2 ]  [ c5 ]  [ e5 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ d x e5 ] , [ N g4 ]  When considering moving a piece to a certain square ask yourself "Can this piece be chased if I go here? If it is chased away where can it go? When it goes to that 2nd spot can it be chased? If so where can it go?" and so on... So this knight in moving to [ g4 ] started a frantic escape attempt which ended with him throwing himself on the sword. He was sitting on [ h6 ] being attacked and no where to go. The better option instead of 12. ... N[ g4 ] would have been [ N d7 ] where he attacks the [ e5 ] pawn. You could then quietly develop an attack on that pawn by [ Q c7 ] and Nc6.
 [ R e1 ] , [ B h3 # ]  A slightly disappointing but very relieving end of this good and somewhat scary game.
 [ Q h5 ] , [ Q x f5 ]  White advances toward black's vulerable king just the thing I had feared. But I see a winning combination and I go for it starting with 35. ... Qxf5.
 [ N e7 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ Q x d6 ]  [ Q x d6 ]  [ e x d6 ] , [ B x a1 ]  let him have it for a while...
 [ b3 ] , [ c3 ]  I don't think it likely that I can promote this Pawn but at least White has another threat to deal with.
 [ B d3 ]  [ K e7 ]  [ f3 ] , [ K d7 ]  29. …… [ K d7 ] - closer and closer!
 [ d5 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ c5 ]  [ b x c5 ] , [ b x c5 ]  42. [ b x c5 ] - not much left of it now!
 [ R x a6 ]  [ c x d2 ]  [ R x f6 ]  [ d x c1 = Q + ]  [ K x c1 ]  [ R x f6 ]  [ R d1 ]  [ Q c6 ]  [ K b1 ]  [ N x a4 ]  [ Q x c6 ] , [ R x c6 ]  Cashing out into a difficult endgame. White's exposed king is telling as he will have trouble participating safely in defending the White pawns. It's not so useful to examine the endgame here so the rest is without notes. Black will use his rook to keep the White king away from the kingside pawns while manuevering his knight and king into winning position. Not as easy as it sounds.
 [ R a4 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ R x b4 ]  [ B x b4 ] , [ Q x e5 ]  now I will retain a very large material advantage because I am threatning mate on c7.
 [ Q x e6 + ]  [ Q e7 ]  [ Q c4 ]  [ b5 ]  [ Q b4 ] , [ c6 ]  Black might have preferred not to move that pawn but the knight there instead. This would develop a better piece and release the rook while pushing the white queen.
 [ N d3 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ B d5 + ]  [ K g3 ]  [ c1 = Q ]  [ Q x c1 ]  [ Q x c1 ]  [ N x g6 ]  [ N x g6 ]  [ K f2 ]  [ Q d2 + ]  [ K g3 ]  [ Q e3 + ]  [ K h2 ] , [ Q f2 # ]  Thanks again to janek66 for the game! This game was mine to lose I think and lose it I did. A little patience would have gone a long way for me here but I chose Total War and it really didn't work out for me ;) Comments on the analysis or the game itself are much appreciated. If you leave a rating please also comment letting me know what you liked or what I can improve on. Thanks for reading!
 [ B x d2 ]  [ R x d2 ]  [ Q b8 + ]  [ K f7 ] , [ Q f4 + ]  And black resigns. Let me know what you think especially about the annotation since this was my first and I surely have much to learn about it.
 [ B x h3 ] , [ Q x f3 ]  Black's capture of the pawn is just an easy way to get to [ g3 ] - a mating square.
 [ R d6 + ]  [ K e7 ]  [ R a6 ] , [ R h5 ]  Heading for d5.
 [ K c6 ]  [ R f5 ] , [ R f7 ]  Naturally 47... [ R x b6 ] 48. [ R x f5 ] is game over and 47... [ K x b6 ] 48. [ R x f5 ] isn't much better.
 [ B c8 ] , [ B g4 ]  double attacking the weak e6-pawn.
 [ Q a5 ]  [ B d2 ] , [ Q c7 ]  Black loses tempoes relocating his queen. But this is now in the right square.
 [ O-O-O + ]  [ K c3 ] , [ R h e8 ]  ...but now I set another treat and I get a wonderful center occupation.
 [ K e7 ]  [ K c3 ]  [ K f6 ]  [ K b3 ]  [ K e5 ] , [ c4 ]  I also advance my bishop's pawn to protect my pawns on [ [ b5 ] ] and [ d5 ] and it is now protected by my bishop. His king cannot penetrate as I control the [ c3 ] [ e3 ] and [ g3 ] squares with my pawns and [ d3 ] and [ f3 ] with my bishop which also controls [ c4 ] while the pawn there controls [ [ b5 ] ] and d5...
 [ N f3 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ d5 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ Q x e5 ]  [ B d3 ] , [ B f5 ]  He desperately hold on
 [ K x g6 ]  [ R f4 x f6 + ]  [ R x f6 ] , [ R x f6 + ]  and black resigned! why? white is up and also has a pass pawn! hope that you liked the game please comment and rate it on the star system thanks!!
 [ f x e5 ]  [ a5 ] , [ N f4 ]  and now black is looking very strong. i'm very surprised white has allowed me to block his f-pawns without resistance. i'd have played [ f4 ] long ago.
 [ h3 ]  [ B x f3 ] , [ B x f3 ]  10.Qxf3?! [ N f d7 ] followed by 11...[ [ c5 ] ] is fine for black for example 10.[ Q x f3 ] [ N f d7 ] 11.[ B e3 ] [ [ c5 ] ] 12.[ d5 ] [ N e5 ] 13.[ Q d2 ] [ Q b4 ] with good play for the black pieces.
 [ h x g4 ]  [ h x g3 ]  [ f x g3 ] , [ Q d7 ]  The kings position shattered I prepare to castle queenside and bring my queen's rook and queen into the attack.
 [ c3 ] , [ Q b6 ]  Threatening to win white's queen with 25. ... Nxe4+.
 [ R e6 ] , [ f5 ]  (!)
 [ B f4 + ] , [ N e2 ]  I would have used the bishop. You could move the knight later.
 [ R x f3 ]  [ g x f3 ]  [ g x h4 ]  [ B h2 ]  [ Q g5 + ]  [ K h1 ]  [ N d3 ]  [ N b3 ]  [ N f4 ]  [ R f g1 ]  [ Q f6 ]  [ c5 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N a5 ]  [ N h3 ]  [ R g f1 ] , [ Q x f3 # ]  
 [ N x d7 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ c5 ]  [ K f7 ]  [ h3 ]  [ N c4 ]  [ B c1 ]  [ K e6 ]  [ K f2 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ N c4 ]  [ B c1 ]  [ N e5 ] , [ a4 ]  now why did i do that?
 [ K b5 ]  [ h4 ]  [ b3 ]  [ K d4 ]  [ R c2 ]  [ K d3 ]  [ K b4 ]  [ R b7 + ]  [ K a3 ]  [ h5 ] , [ R c8 ]  guard [ h8 ] and keep the king off the c-file
 [ Q a2 + ] , [ K g7 ]  The long range check is only a minor inconvenience now that the white bishop is gone from [ a6 ] and White's rook is still en prise on f1.
 [ N c6 ] , [ K h1 ]  Proceed with attack.
 [ K x h3 ] , [ R a3 + ]  [ Q h1 + ] is a way to win the Rook but this checkmate is forced and faster too.
 [ K f2 ]  [ K g6 ]  [ B h4 ]  [ K g7 ]  [ R a7 ]  [ R h8 ]  [ R e7 ]  [ K f8 ]  [ R x e6 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ R e7 ]  [ B e8 ]  [ R c7 ]  [ K g8 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ K g7 ]  [ N h4 ]  [ N h6 ]  [ B d6 + ]  [ K g8 ]  [ K g3 ]  [ R h7 ]  [ R c8 ]  [ K f7 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ R g7 + ]  [ K f4 ]  [ R g8 ]  [ N e5 + ]  [ K e6 ]  [ N x c6 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ R x g8 ]  [ N x g8 ]  [ N d8 + ]  [ K f6 ]  [ c6 ]  [ B c8 ]  [ g4 ]  [ f x g4 ]  [ h x g4 ]  [ K g6 ]  [ g5 ]  [ B a6 ]  [ c7 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ g x f6 ]  black resigns because he can not stop the pawn storm.
 [ O-O-O ]  [ Q c7 ] , [ B d3 ]  10.[ g4 ] is more popular.
 [ Q d6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ c5 ]  [ d x c5 ]  [ Q x c5 ]  [ Q b3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ Q x f7 ] , [ R h f8 ]  I in turn threaten obee's queen; at worst he exchanges his queen for my rook.
 [ B f5 ] , [ N e4 ]  Now ...[ N g3 + ] or ...[ N d2 + ] and the pawn will queen.
 [ B x e3 + ]  [ K h1 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ N x e4 ] , [ Q d5 ]  Mistake gives back a pawn for free after 15...Nc6!.16.N4c3-NB4.17.Bxh7+Kh8.18.Qb1-Qh4.19.Bf5-Bxd4.20.Bg4.... with big advantage for black .
 [ B x d1 ]  [ Q x d1 ]  [ N e1 ] , [ c6 ]  What a brilliant game ! I've learned a lot trying to anotate it. Thanks to both players
 [ O-O ]  [ K h1 ]  [ h6 ] , [ f4 ]  I was too late but there is still hope. I don't have to capture f4.
 [ f x e6 ]  [ Q x a5 ]  [ R b a8 ] , [ Q c3 ]  Going back once again! Anyways the a pawn is a passed pawn so white should try to push it up the board. Therefore [ Q c3 ] is the best move. Now if black is not careful white will put the rooks behind the a pawnand one to pressure [ e6 ] and push it up.
 [ B b6 ]  [ a4 ]  [ b x a4 ] , [ Q x a4 ]  White is trying his best to uncramp his position...
 [ N f6 ]  [ B c4 ] , [ d5 ]  6. ..... [ d5 ] - to block out the white lsb's attack on f7.
 [ g x f6 ]  [ N x f6 + ]  [ K f7 ]  [ N x d7 ]  [ Q x d7 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ K g7 ] , [ B e2 ]  better was [ N c3 ] preparing to swing the troops for a k-side attack
 [ a x b5 ]  [ B x b5 + ]  [ B d7 ]  [ B x d7 + ] , [ N x d7 ]  Now Black's position looks very odd: wide open spaces on the Q-side and a completely undeveloped kingside. I had to think hard over the next few moves to manage my development while avoiding threats and traps.
 [ R d8 ]  [ K h2 ] , [ R d4 ]  forking two pawns and skewering one of them to a bishop but White can break the skewer with check.
 [ B x c3 ]  [ b x c3 ]  [ R x e4 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ R a b1 ]  [ N x c3 ]  [ R b3 ]  [ b4 ]  [ a3 ]  [ B x f1 ] , [ K x f1 ]  Considering White is a whole rook down most would have resigned by now but the next few moves turn the tables dramatically.
 [ B d6 ]  [ f4 ]  [ K x c6 ]  [ f3 ] , [ d5 ]  !??
 [ K e7 ]  [ B c7 ] , [ R d g8 ]  Very good! White can't take the pawn because of [ g3 ] but it is useless against...
 [ R f4 ]  [ h3 ] , [ R e f8 ]  the best according to the computer was here to take the knight and the bishop for a rook.
 [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ b6 ]  [ g3 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ B g2 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ N c3 ] , [ B b4 ]  All the opening moves are played for the Queens Indian Defence (as per game title) to whites move 7. and we begin to make our moves now. Black to start and he opens with DB to [ b4 ] attacking my knight.
 [ a3 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ N b4 ]  [ Q d6 ]  [ N c2 ]  [ K h7 ]  [ R b4 ]  [ Q x g3 ] , [ K g1 ]  He prefers move the K than capture d4.
 [ K e6 ]  [ R x f7 ] , [ K x f7 ]  ...so we do a rook-for-rook exchange.
 [ h5 ]  [ b5 ]  [ c x b5 ] , [ Q x b5 ]  black tries a sly trap
 [ K g4 ] , [ e5 + ]  I can win back my queen with this pretty skewer...
 [ f x e4 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ B f5 ] , [ N e g5 ]  With the treat of a possible fork on e6.
 [ K d3 ] , [ h4 ]  This was a mistake but I was with no plan.
 [ N d6 ]  [ K g7 ] , [ R e4 ]  to be honest I was lost for a better move here: I did not trust [ N e5 ] [ B e6 ] maybe unjust; I would follow this up with [ R a e1 ] and see where it leads us...
 [ N x b5 ] , [ Q b6 ]  Threatens the white knight while adding a defender to the black knight. White can move his knight but then the black queen is free to rampage at b2.
 [ c6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ c5 ] , [ B f4 ]  I've been in this position (or a variation of this position) in many of my recent matches mainly to see how people choose to defend the fork.
 [ N x f4 ] , [ B x b3 ]  Grabbing a pawn to help compensate for the eventual loss of my a and b pawns. I couldn't find a better move for the discovered attack and wanted to do something before it disappeared. Again [ b6 ] is probably better.
 [ R x f5 ]  [ R x f5 ]  [ e3 ]  [ R f1 ] , [ e2 ]  This is a mistake not seeing the game continuation. I think better is 30. ... [ B c3 ] 31. [ R [ a3 ] ] [ d4 ] 32. [ B c5 ] [ e2 ] 33. [ R x c3 ] [ d x c3 ] 34. [ R e1 ] [ a3 ] and winning for Black. This is not forced and there are other choices.
 [ N f3 ] , [ B g4 ]  black seems to make all the right moves but lets wait and see
 [ d6 + ]  [ c x d6 ]  [ Q x b7 + ] , [ N d7 ]  Now Marshall's connected Rooks can be activated.
 [ K x f7 ]  [ Q f3 + ] , [ K e8 ]  If I interpose Q then free N ... As it stands however my N is probably gone anyway.
 [ R a d8 ]  [ f4 ] , [ R x d1 ]  Exchanging rooks will ease the defensive task and additional exchanges will eventually lead to a winning endgame.
 [ N x f4 ] , [ N x d3 + ]  And again! Simply taking on [ d1 ] achieves very little but with another bold move White's position is stormed through the front gate.
 [ B e7 ] , [ e3 ]  Well the black bishop is locked in
 [ d4 ]  [ B b6 ]  [ B x f4 ] , [ d5 ]  White hunts the bishop and enables itself to retake the pawn on [ f4 ] (I'm pretty sure this has some name I think I've seen this quite often).
 [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ g6 ]  The Dragon Variation not something I know much about though I am doing alright in a tourney devoted to it on Gameknot at present.
 [ B x d4 ]  [ B x d4 ]  [ Q x d4 ] , [ Q f6 ]  Maybe here 7. ...[ Q g5 ] followed by [ N e7 ] 0-0 and [ d6 ] would have had better chances. (DR)
 [ Q g6 ]  [ b6 ]  [ B f7 ]  [ R f8 ]  [ B x c5 ]  [ b x c5 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ Q e7 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ K c7 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ R a d8 ]  [ a3 ]  [ R d7 ]  [ c3 ] , [ R f d8 ]  Lining up the battery for strong attack.
 [ N x g5 ]  [ B f6 ] , [ h4 ]  Keeping the knight at its active post.
 [ d x e5 ] , [ R c c2 ]  
 [ R d d1 ] , [ K f5 ]  Continuing to activate my King because [ R d2 ] draws similarly to last move variations.
 [ Q x e5 ] , [ B x c5 ]  I had wondered if black may have seen the trap and decided it was worth exchanging an active bishop for an inactive rook.
 [ Q f3 + ]  [ K g1 ]  [ R e8 ] , [ a x b6 ]  Come on pawn! promote!
 [ N x e5 ]  [ N x e2 ] , [ Q c4 ]  Threatening mate on f7.
 [ B x e4 ] , [ B x e4 ]  and I take back
 [ R b5 + ]  [ K e4 ]  [ K g2 ]  [ f4 ]  [ K f2 ]  [ R a2 + ]  [ K e1 ]  [ K e3 ]  [ R e5 + ]  [ K f3 ]  [ R f5 ]  [ a4 ]  [ R a5 ]  [ a3 ]  [ R a4 ] , [ R e2 + ]  Alternative variation: [a lot easier to win the full point was] 77... [ R a1 + ] 78. [ K d2 ] [ a2 ] 79. [ R a3 + ] [ K g4 ] 80. [ K c2 ] [ R g1 ] 81. [ K b2 ] (81. Rx[ a2 ] [ R g2 + ] 82. [ K b1 ] Rx[ a2 ] 83. Kx[ a2 ] [ [ f3 ] ] $19) 81... [ a1 = Q + ] 82. [ R x a1 ] [ R x a1 ] 83. [ K x a1 ] [ [ f3 ] ] $19
 [ N x c4 ]  [ B x c4 ]  [ b x c4 ]  [ h x g6 ]  [ f x g6 ]  [ g4 ] , [ c6 ]  This is better than 15 ... Nd7?? 16. Ne6! 1-0 as actually occurred in Stake Larsen vs. Sorseth (Gausdal 1999). Nevertheless ... [ g5 ] is much better. Black does not seem to understand what trouble he is in.
 [ B e3 ] , [ K d8 ]  Bringing my king into the defence of the c column overlooking...
 [ R x b5 ]  [ K e6 ] , [ R b4 ]  He has to retreat or lose the pawns.
 [ B f4 ]  [ B x f4 ]  [ N x f4 ] , [ Q x d4 ]  Two pawns up! Now develop!!!
 [ b3 ] , [ Q b4 ]  The same move that I noticed too late on the 19th move wins. 21.[ N f5 ] was necessary (and this is what I expected). My back rank is sufficiently protected (in case of 22.Qe2) and White has no way of saving both the rook and the knight.
 [ e x d4 ] , [ Q x d4 ]  he is weak in development so the queen might be useful
 [ N c3 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ Q b3 ]  [ Q d7 ]  [ B d2 ]  [ h6 ] , [ R a c1 ]  White appears to be very strong and stable...
 [ B d2 ]  [ f5 ]  [ B b1 ] , [ K f7 ]  Now my Rooks are connected and I can activate my KR plus my K is in as safe a position as exists on my side of the board.
 [ B g2 ]  [ f5 ]  [ N g5 ]  [ B x g2 + ]  [ K x g2 ]  [ f6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N x f3 ]  [ Q x f3 ] , [ f4 ]  Everything was just about forced up to this point (with the exchanges and all). Time to materialize those pawns. I didn't want to [ Q x h4 ] because of Rh1! and following that up with Rxh7+.
 [ f4 ]  [ h4 ]  [ f x g3 ]  [ f x g3 ] , [ K f5 ]  
 [ N x f7 ]  [ Q a5 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ B d4 + ]  [ K h1 ]  [ K x f7 ] , [ N c7 ]  forking the rooks
 [ R e1 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ N g5 + ]  [ K f8 ] , [ f4 ]  Still looking to crash into black's position I decide to attack rather than trade my knight for his bishop.
 [ Q x d7 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ e x d4 ] , [ Q x d4 ]  White seems to have gotten the better of the exchanges with two pieces developed strongly in the center. White also prevents black from castling by threatening the pawn on a7.
 [ e3 ]  [ R x e6 ]  [ R d5 ]  [ N a6 ]  [ R x a4 ]  [ b6 ]  [ R a1 + ]  [ K h2 ]  [ R b5 ]  [ R x e3 ]  [ R x b6 ]  [ N c7 ]  [ a4 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ R b3 ]  [ R e8 + ]  [ K h7 ]  [ R a8 ]  [ a3 ]  [ N f4 ]  [ a2 ]  [ N e2 ]  [ R b2 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ R c2 ]  [ R a3 ] , [ R x c3 ]  Alternative variation: 57... [ R x c3 ] 58. [ R x c3 ] [ R h1 + ] 59. [ K x h1 ] [ a1 = Q + ]  [ d5 ]  [ c4 ] , [ d x c4 ]  2. ..... [ d x c4 ] - the Queen's Gambit Accepted.
 [ K g3 ] , [ B h5 ]  Then I was hit by a brilliant Rook winning combination!
 [ c4 ]  [ R c3 ]  [ N d2 ] , [ B b4 ]  I am now taking advantage of the fact that after the Rook moves away the Knight will be pinned to the King. I exploit this by. . .
 [ a6 ] , [ b4 ]  ?! Good idea in principle but premature. The [ B c3 ] bishop is now at the base of a pawn chain on an open file and vulnerable as a backward pawn is vulnerable though more costly to lose. (Fritz: -0.37)
 [ c5 ]  [ f4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ N g5 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ Q x g4 ]  [ N x g4 ]  [ B x f7 + ]  [ K d7 ]  [ B e6 + ]  [ K c6 ]  [ B x g4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N a6 ]  [ a3 ]  [ Q f6 ] , [ O-O ]  White needs to defend f4.
 [ Q e7 ] , [ B g5 ]  Harassing the queen
 [ b x c3 ]  [ N x c3 ] , [ Q d4 ]  see the idea knight take bishop queen takes bishop and attack queen
 [ B f4 ] , [ g6 ]  The Trompowski Opening would suggest 2. Bg5. By comparison 2. [ B f4 ] seems a bit mild and not part of any line I have found against the Indian system.
 [ d6 ]  [ g5 ] , [ g4 ]  Rice resigns. One of Zuckertort's Pawns will inevitably become a Queen.
 [ Q c4 + ] , [ K h7 ]  the King is safe here...
 [ K e3 ] , [ Q a7 + ]  My very patient Queen gets fed at last!!! Here are the messages from my opponent.. Moves Chat (3) Notes michael60: you had better moves which would have helped you to beat me michael60: And this move I haven't noticed and it's very good
 [ Q x g7 ] , [ R h6 ]  19. [ f4 ] Gives white the best chance to attack the kingside.
 [ R b5 ]  [ R x c3 ]  [ R x d5 ] , [ K f8 ]  34. ....... [ K f8 ] - Henry decided to come out and join the fray my opponent decided to wave the white flag. Gameknot gave the score as: +3.25 in my favour here. So a good victory over Class B opposition.
 [ N f3 ] , [ N f6 ]  Standard of the Slav
 [ f5 ] , [ N c5 + ]  I expected the exchange regretting I didn't take before the [ N g6 ] - N[ x B f8 ] - train which would have left me with good control of black's squares from [ g3 ] - e5...
 [ O-O ]  [ B h4 ]  [ R e8 ] , [ B d3 ]  Now white is playing for a buildup of forces aimed at black's kingside and so I start to get defensive.
 [ B x d7 ]  [ B c5 ] , [ Q a5 ]  This is a poor move since white now has a decisive way to end black's counterplay.
 [ Q x e2 + ]  [ K x e2 ]  [ B x f1 + ] , [ K x f1 ]  I have a Rook for two Pawns my opponent has no developed pieces and my King is more centralized in the endgame that has arisen. White's best move here is "resigns".
 [ c4 ]  [ d6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ N b d7 ]  6. ........ [ N b d7 ] - a suggested move in the database but it does have its downside shutting in Fou Leblanc which means I may have to develop him by playing [ b6 ] followed by Bb7.
 [ B x d7 + ] , [ Q x d7 ]  This move was forced. As -chess- would say "no options". If I had played 8...Rc7! 9.[ B x d7 + ] would not have been feasible or 9...[ R x d7 ] loosing his LSB. However he is going to win another free pawn due to this check after 10.Qxa6. That is what makes this check serious. Remember: I am behind so it is especially bad when I inadvertently give away material. As Jack Stockel would say "Don't give things away".
 [ Q e6 ]  [ R a c1 ] , [ Q g4 ]  Black wants to exchange some pieces as this decreases some pressure.
 [ g4 ]  [ B g6 ]  [ h4 ] , [ c5 ]  No P[ [ h5 ] ] takes black's bishop. Black P[ [ h5 ] ] instead protects against NxPf7.
 [ K x c2 ]  [ K g6 ]  [ K b3 ]  [ K f6 ] , [ B c4 ]  Step 1: clean up black's remaining pawns to shut down any shenanigans.
 [ Q e7 ]  [ N c5 ]  [ N f4 ] , [ B a6 ]  I moved the bishop here so I could move the knight to [ b7 ] and fork the two rooks.
 [ R b8 ]  [ g6 ]  [ N f5 ]  [ R h3 ]  [ N h6 ] , [ K h1 ]  I felt like the pin on [ e3 ] was annoying and stopping me from using the black bishop. The engines recommend moving [ Q h2 ] instead which is much better. Alternative variation: 23.[ Q h2 ] [ N c5 ] 24.[ N g5 ] [ N e4 ] 25.[ B x e4 ] [ d x e4 ] 26.[ N h7 ] [ Q c7 ] ( 26...[ R d8 ] [If you wanted to know why black did not move the rook when attacked by the knight follow this variation through.] 27.[ R x h6 ] [ R d1 + ] 28.[ K g2 ] [ Q d8 ] 29.[ N f6 + ] [ K f8 ] 30.[ R h8 + ] [ K e7 ] 31.[ Q h4 ] [ R d2 + ] 32.[ B x d2 ] [ b6 ] 33.[ a4 ] [ Q x d2 + ] 34.[ K h1 ] [ Q e1 + ] 35.[ R x e1 ] [ B b7 ] 36.[ R x b8 ] [ B c8 ] 37.[ R x c8 ] [ g x f6 ] 38.[ Q h7 # ] ) 27.[ N x f8 ] [ Q d8 ] 28.[ R x h6 ] [ Q g5 + ] 29.[ K f2 ] [ Q x h6 ] 30.[ Q x h6 ] [ g x h6 ] 31.[ N h7 ] [At this point white is a knight up but what a boring continuation.]
 [ N x f5 ] , [ Q x f5 ]  This could get wild in a hurry. I've never had anyone trade on [ f5 ] before. I wonder if he's planning to follow up with [ B d3 ] and threaten Bxh7. But after [ B d3 ] I'm going to move [ Q d5 ] with my attack on g2.
 [ R f4 ] , [ N e5 ]  again improving the N this time also threatening White's d pawn and a skewer of Q and R
 [ B x c3 ] , [ N x c3 ]  Obviously not [ b x c3 ] [ N e2 ]  [ N x b2 ]  [ R f e1 ] , [ B d7 ]  Preventing [ B h7 + ]  [ B c6 ] , [ B x c6 ]  I had convinced myself that the [ c6 ] pawn would be weak when deep down I knew that this was completely untrue due to their being no imminent means of attacking it and in fact control over [ d5 ] and [ b5 ] is significantly more relevant.
 [ b6 ] , [ e5 ]  The early break is recommended by Dzindzi and gives White a healthy initiative sometimes at the expense of a pawn. Alburt and Chernin indicate that White is not ready for this break in their comprehensive work on the Pirc "Pirc Alert" however new analysis by Dzindi and practical games at master level call into question this analysis.
 [ K e6 ] , [ Q h6 + ]  I cannot see the purpose of this check.
 [ B a6 ]  [ N b6 ]  [ N x b6 ]  [ Q x b6 ]  [ B x f1 ] , [ K x f1 ]  37. [ K x f1 ] - I think this is the decisive Mistake: +5.47 » 37. [ K x f1 ] [ [ a3 ] ] 38. Bx[ [ a3 ] ] Qx[ [ a3 ] ] 39. [ Q b3 ] [ Q a6 + ] 40. [ Q b5 ] [ R c1 + ] 41. [ K e2 ] [ Q [ a2 ] + ] 42. [ R b2 ] [ R c2 + ] 43. [ R x c2 ] [ Q x c2 + ] 44. [ K f3 ] [ Q h2 ] 45. [ Q e2 ] [ Q x h3 + ] 46. [ K f2 ] [ B h4 + ] 47. [ K g1 ] Best: +3.42 » 37. [ R x f1 ] [ [ a3 ] ] 38. [ B a1 ] [ a2 ] 39. [ Q b3 ] [ Q a6 ] 40. [ Q b2 ] [ B g5 ] 41. [ R e1 ] [ Q a4 ] 42. [ K f1 ] [ B h4 ] 43. [ Q b7 ] [ Q c4 + ] 44. [ R e2 ] [ Q c1 + ] 45. [ K g2 ] [ Q x a1 ] 46. [ Q x c8 + ] [ B d8 ] If white had recaptured with the rook his dsb would not have found himself in a decisive pin.
 [ N f6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N x e4 ] , [ R e1 ]  Krstic has sacrificed two Pawns but has the open file and a powerful pin.
 [ N x e5 ]  [ f4 ]  [ h6 ]  [ R x e5 ]  [ h x g5 ]  [ Q d4 ]  [ K f7 ]  [ f x g5 ] , [ R f h8 ]  Black has solved all the threats: White is running out of play...
 [ N e2 + ]  [ K h1 ] , [ Q x f1 # ]  ...which leads to the checkmate.
 [ Q e2 ] , [ B g4 ]  Thanks to the protection from my knight on [ f6 ] [ e3 ] is almost ready if he plays Q[ e3 ] I can counter with [ B b5 ] which will drive the queen away.
 [ K x b2 ]  [ Q b7 + ] , [ K c2 ]  ...so what? My king rather incredibly is safe and I am one move from [ R d7 ] and mate.
 [ B d7 ] , [ Q e2 ]  Nothing is protecting [ e5 ] so I could just take it.
 [ B g4 ] , [ a3 ]  the real reason for 29. [ R e3 ] ... 30. [ a3 ]  [ R b d8 ]  [ R d3 ]  [ c6 ] , [ B x c6 ]  target of opportunity: another free pawn
 [ O-O ] , [ B a3 ]  Reconfiguring my DSB. Forget about what happened in my game against bhidragon. In that game it was a mistake because it weakened my K side since he had threats. But in the context of how this game is developing it's not. First black does not have any immediate K side attacks on me. Second but more importantly her [ R f8 ] is attacked and is thus forced to defend first. After which I'll use spend that time to advance my c pawn as this will enable me to safely play [ N c3 ] later on. That is especially once we exchange pawns where that pawn comes off the board.
 [ N e5 ] , [ N d4 ]  This was the point to move my knight to what I thought was a commanding square and so be able to develop my Bf1.
 [ B b4 + ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ f6 ]  [ e x f6 ] , [ Q x f6 ]  Better is 7... [ B x c3 + ] first. Then 8. [ b x c3 ] [ Q f6 ] 9. [ Q d2 ] and White is doing well.
 [ R e5 ]  [ Q f2 ] , [ Q x a3 + ]  Let the dance begin
 [ N c2 + ]  [ K e2 ]  [ N x a1 ] , [ N c3 ]  The houdini chess engine thinks that [ Q d3 ] is the better move. He should not fear [ Q x a2 ] because of [ Q b5 + ] [ K c8 ] ([ K c7 ] Nc5!) (Kd8? Ne5! [ d x e5 ] Nc5!) [ B e3 ] [ Q a6 ] [ R c1 + ] [ K d8 ] [ Q x a6 ] [ b x a6 ] Rxa1.
 [ R b6 ]  [ R x b6 ]  [ a x b6 ]  [ R b7 ]  [ K e3 ]  [ K d7 ]  [ R a1 ]  [ N x h4 ] , [ K e2 ]  Avoiding [ N f5 ] forking King and Bishop and taking the b pawn shortly after. I have avoided occupying [ [ g6 ] ] with my pawn because it allows my N to use it but also to protect it from f5. On [ [ g6 ] ] it is more vulnerable to white's rook.
 [ Q d3 ] , [ B e8 ]  Aiming for g6. Once again I would have been more worried about the knight and would have played Nc7.
 [ N d8 ] , [ Q x b4 ]  White makes a gain in material but it's a false lead. 17...[ c6 ] 18.[ B a3 ] [ N d5 ] 19.[ Q b2 ] [ c x b5 ] would've left Black in a very favourable position.
 [ B b4 ] , [ c3 ]  White insists on dislodging the dark square bishop from its pleasant home on b4.
 [ N c3 ]  [ Q d6 ]  [ N b5 ]  [ Q e7 ] , [ N e5 ]  Now the two white knights are advancing on black too.
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ d6 ]  Philidor's defense. Sound but pretty passive. I decide to go for quick development and hope to blow open black's king's defenses in short order.
 [ B e2 ] , [ B e8 ]  Now black is forced to accept that his thinking has been far from ideal and attempts to relocate the knight. It's not same anymore as the white LSB is great with it's defensive duties and controls the essential [ c4 ] and [ g4 ] squares. I was still feeling optimistic however as I thought the loss of time was not very important as white has no obvious plans to activate his forces.
 [ O-O-O ] , [ b4 ]  Now it was my turn to launch a pawn storm :-)
 [ d4 ] , [ R e5 ]  maybe one of white best ideas in the game.
 [ B e2 ] , [ O-O ]  there's the castle
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ c4 ]  [ c6 ]  [ e3 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ O-O ] , [ h6 ]  perhaps played with a view to ... [ B h7 ] if [ N h4 ] by white
 [ e4 ] , [ e6 ]  recognize this? this is a opening for black in a game i also annotated
 [ g6 ]  [ B d5 ]  [ f6 ]  [ K d7 ]  [ f7 ]  [ K c6 ]  [ f8 = Q ]  [ K b5 ] , [ K f6 ]  And black graciously resigned. What a wonderful endgame! Many thanks to everlast75 for the pleasurable game. I hope you enjoyed it:) - Thomas
 [ Q c3 ]  [ Q e2 ] , [ b4 ]  this pawn advance does the trick
 [ K c4 ]  [ Q c2 + ]  [ K b5 ]  [ Q b3 + ]  [ K c5 ]  [ Q c3 + ]  [ K b6 ]  [ Q b3 + ]  [ K c6 ] , [ Q e6 + ]  It almost felt that the black king was trying to visit every single square on the board. In fact [ Q e6 ] was a mistake and technically changed a drawing position into a lost position for white. I was tiring at the time. Unfortunately for her and fortunately for me she couldn't take adavantage of it before the 50 move rule kicked in.
 [ K x f7 ]  [ Q f3 + ] , [ K e6 ]  Now this is forced as otherwise Black loses the d5-knight and is left a pawn down in a wrecked position.
 [ Q e1 ]  [ Q x e1 + ]  [ K g2 ] , [ Q x c1 ]  Poor white King ! Left only one small square.
 [ B e3 ]  [ b6 ]  [ a3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ R x d5 ]  [ Q e2 ]  [ R b5 ]  [ O-O-O ]  [ R e8 ]  [ R h e1 ]  [ Q f6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ R d5 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ R x d1 + ]  [ Q x d1 ]  [ R x e5 ]  [ c3 ]  [ Q f7 ]  [ Q f3 ]  [ Q x f3 ]  [ g x f3 ]  [ R f5 ]  [ f4 ]  [ N e7 ]  [ R g1 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ R g4 ]  [ N x e3 ]  [ f x e3 ]  [ R f7 ]  [ e4 ]  [ K d7 ]  [ K d2 ]  [ h5 ]  [ R g3 ]  [ R x f4 ]  [ R x g7 + ]  [ K c6 ]  [ K e3 ]  [ R h4 ]  [ R g3 ]  [ K d6 ]  [ b4 ]  [ K e5 ]  [ R g5 + ]  [ K f6 ]  [ R f5 + ]  [ K e6 ]  [ R f3 ]  [ K e5 ]  [ R f5 + ] , [ K e6 ]  A cycle of a few moves. Neither side wanting to give a pawn
 [ R x c6 ]  [ R f6 x f3 ] , [ N d5 ]  finally [ N d5 ] comes into play: covering [ c2 ] and preparing to dislodge the Black rooks...
 [ N b3 ] , [ Q a7 ]  Black turns attention to the f pawn
 [ N f7 ]  [ N e4 ] , [ N d6 ]  Challencing the knight right away.
 [ N b8 ]  [ g4 ] , [ N c6 + ]  Crafty; the Knight isn't confined to covering the Queening square. It can help drive my King back.
 [ N e7 + ]  [ K h7 ]  [ h4 ] , [ N x c1 ]  And now promotion is getting ever nearer but first I have a nice little plan if only I can pull it off
 [ O-O ]  [ B d7 ] , [ B x b7 ]  Thanks to dbreli
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ N c6 ]  I've never quite understood the Sicilian this second move least of all. The Knight prevents the e-pawn from advancing as does 2...[ d6 ] but cries out to be attacked.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B b4 ]  [ B g5 ] , [ O-O ]  Instead of castling black should definitely protect the pawn. White's bishop is pinning black's knight against his queen.
 [ c x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ] , [ b4 ]  Pushing back my knight...
 [ g4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ B g2 ]  [ B x g4 ]  [ c4 ]  [ c6 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ Q b3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ Q x b7 ]  [ N b d7 ]  [ N b5 ] , [ R c8 ]  The starting position for all the games.
 [ Q x f5 ] , [ g x f5 ]  !? With an aim of attack.
 [ a4 ] , [ O-O-O ]  I continue to develop and I threats the knight on d2.
 [ Q d4 ] , [ Q g4 + ]  The checks begin.
 [ N f6 ] , [ f4 ]  This is one the main lines of the opening an other is Bc4?
 [ N f6 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ d4 ]  [ N b6 ] , [ c4 ]  4. [ c4 ] - standard pawn moves in the Alekhine.
 [ N x d4 ] , [ N c6 ]  inviting white to exchange knights after which I would have a nice pawn centre
 [ Q h6 ]  [ B g8 ]  [ Q g5 ]  [ Q g7 ]  [ Q x g7 + ]  [ K x g7 ]  [ B c6 ]  [ N a3 ] , [ R a c1 ]  White could have played 35. [ c3 ] without the prepatory move: Black has no way to stop the c-file from opening.
 [ Q f6 ]  [ B c6 ]  [ d7 + ]  [ B x d7 ]  [ c6 ]  [ B x c6 ]  [ R c1 ]  [ R x g2 + ]  [ K h1 ] , [ R c2 + ]  ...and this was enough for him. White is lost. Thank you for reading and please point out mistakes and omissions at will.
 [ Q c1 ] , [ B x b2 ]  Eliminating the potentially dangerous bishop.
 [ a4 ] , [ c5 ]  White attacks! Black's central pawns are feeling a little fragile.
 [ R x f4 ] , [ K b3 ]  I thought my opponent was planning to play 44. [ K a4 ] but I soon realised I was wrong.
 [ R c d4 ]  [ R g5 ]  [ K f2 ]  [ h5 ]  [ R a6 ]  [ N g4 + ]  [ K f3 ]  [ R f5 + ]  [ R f4 ]  [ R d5 ]  [ R h6 ]  [ R d3 + ]  [ K e2 ]  [ R g3 ]  [ R x h5 ]  [ R x g2 + ]  [ K f3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ R e5 + ]  [ K d6 ]  [ R a5 ]  [ R g6 ]  [ R a6 + ] , [ K e7 ]  It is clear that white is unsure how to proceed but black deserves credit for avoiding trouble and not making it easy
 [ N c6 ] , [ B e3 ]  [ B e3 ] followed up by [ c3 ] and Nd2. I get a great center.
 [ B h6 ]  [ Q d7 ]  [ B x g7 ]  [ K x g7 ]  [ g4 ]  [ B e6 ] , [ R c5 ]  Black is in a minor bind.
 [ e x d3 ]  [ B f3 ]  [ N x f3 ]  [ Q x f3 ]  [ N c2 ]  [ R a2 ] , [ N e3 + ]  ?? Erika thought that the N was attacked and felt the need to protect. But paradoxically it was protected where it was with the [ d3 ] pawn. With this move James will win back a piece here. So this was a turning point in the game where Erika goes from a big advantage to a near even game.
 [ N f3 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ N c3 ]  normally i would have got the lsb out first in kings gambit but his knight move forces me to protect my e pawn
 [ Q f8 ] , [ R g6 ]  Not really sure about this move. I just wanted to create pressure but I confess that my attack was under a "?"
 [ R e1 ]  [ N a5 ] , [ N e5 ]  stuped me!
 [ O-O ] , [ B c5 ]  Pinning f pawn and further controlling [ d4 ] sq.
 [ e x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ] , [ N x d4 ]  14... Nxd4? Black should've played more aggressively instead of the passive knight-trade. I would be in trouble with [ Q g5 ] (If 15. [ B c1 ] then Qg6)
 [ f x e4 ]  [ f x e4 ] , [ R c f8 ]  ICC: now the rook on [ a3 ] isn't so stupid. ICC: [ N x g2 ] is not a threat with the R[ a3 ] covering h3. ICC: I prefer White. Black has two bad bishops.
 [ R f6 ]  [ Q x h7 + ]  [ K f8 ] , [ B h6 + ]  Time to get the bishop in on the action.
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ N f6 ]  I REALLY hate the Petroff. It is a great defense for black because they can actually just trade off and keep the position pretty much equal if played correctly. In this game you will see how when one breaks from book...then tactics can shatter the Petrof drawing dream.
 [ B x f3 ]  [ Q x f3 ] , [ Q x f3 ]  Exchanging off material.
 [ c6 ]  [ d4 ] , [ g6 ]  Some sort of Caro-Pirc? I'm already out of theory. I usually play Alekhine Defense against e4.
 [ K x h2 ]  [ R h6 + ]  [ K g1 ]  [ R c8 ]  [ B a4 ]  [ Q h4 ]  [ B b3 + ]  [ K h8 ]  [ f4 ]  [ Q h2 + ]  [ K f2 ]  [ R h3 ]  [ Q x a7 ]  [ R f3 + ]  [ K e1 ]  [ Q g3 + ]  [ R f2 ]  [ Q x f2 + ]  [ K d1 ]  [ Q f1 + ]  [ K d2 ] , [ R f2 # ]  Checkmate in a different style
 [ B x e5 ] , [ R a7 ]  ?? I still have no idea why that roque came here !?!
 [ N b d7 ]  [ Q c6 ] , [ e5 ]  Opening lines to take advantage of the uncastled king.
 [ N c6 ] , [ c3 ]  This move is a favourite of mine although it does impede the Q-knights development a little it bolsters my claims to the center of the board and also [ c2 ] can serve as a nice spot for the queen to conduct the battle from for a while if the need arises...
 [ B x g5 ]  [ f x g5 ] , [ B a6 ]  pinning my Queen to the [ d3 ] pawn although [ B f5 ] or [ B e6 ] may have been better in the circumstances....
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ] , [ f4 ]  Ah the King's Gambit! Favoured by those dashing 19th Century players who love to swamp their opponents with attacking play. I have come unstuck against this opening to my frustration and bafflement so many times. But happily not here.
 [ R d7 d8 ] , [ Q e6 + ]  ...and I force a draw. But it was my opponent's turn to blunder.
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ B g5 ]  Initiates the Trompowsky Attack. While I've gotten rolled up by very strong players who sally this opening against me the move itself has never impressed me as a particularly strong one; and of course I'd expect a very strong player to roll me up anyway now matter whether they play this move or not and no matter what my reply to 2. [ B g5 ] might be.
 [ c3 ] , [ b3 ]  Perhaps Rab6. Ion: 25...b3?! Probably this isn't all that bad really but it seems more in White's than Black's interest that the Q-side be closed in this way. 25...[ d x c3 ] and Black still has a fine game. Black's still OK for the moment but...
 [ R f1 ] , [ e3 ]  i should have left it
 [ R c8 ]  [ c3 ]  [ K g6 ] , [ R d7 ]  Back in heaven.
 [ d4 ] , [ O-O ]  I used the opportunity to tuck my K away into safety. Conversely my opponents K was still in the center allowing his N's to remain pinned.
 [ B x c6 ] , [ Q e1 ]  After 14. ... [ Q x c6 ] 15. Nfg5! [ B x g5 ] (0-0? [ Q h5 ] [ h6 ] Rf6; [ f6 ] exf6; [ R f8 ] [ N x h7 ] [ R h8 ] [ Q h5 ] threatening Nf6+) 16. [ B x g5 ] [ R f8 ] (Qc7? Rxf7!! [ Q x e5 ] (Kxf7?? Qh5+) Rf2) 17. [ Q h5 ] [ Q c7 ] 18. [ Q x h7 ] [ Q x e5 ] 19. [ R a e1 ] black is overpowered... After 14. ... [ b x c6 ] 15. Be3! threatening capture of [ c5 ] followed by [ b4 ] and [ d4 ] soon... Black is completely tied up... White is preparing [ Q g3 ] to start an attack against blacks kingside now; still on schedule...
 [ R e8 ] , [ d3 ]  Worried about combos that open me up.
 [ K e8 ] , [ N d6 + ]  forcing the king to one spot and the checkmate threat
 [ c x d5 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ R c1 ]  [ Q d6 ]  [ Q c2 ] , [ B d8 ]  Played to prevent the White queen coming in at [ c7 ] but can it really be good to break the link between the rooks? Of course if I had played the bishop to [ d6 ] on move 8 this would not have been a problem.
 [ B x e5 ] , [ d x e5 ]  This cramps both of us but I think it is better that a lot of exchanges and loss of tension.
 [ Q e4 ] , [ Q x b7 ]  I can't see anything else to do anything I think about allows him in.
 [ d3 ] , [ N e7 ]  WTF?????????????????????????????????????? Who does that? You lose a pawn.
 [ K b8 ] , [ N e5 ]  Only place to save the knight.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ B b5 ]  This opening is the Ruy Lopez which is most popular.
 [ N x e3 + ] , [ Q x e3 ]  I actually have a threat in this position to win a pawn with [ e x d5 ] [ Q x f5 ] dxc6. Note [ e x d5 ] Qxd5?? Rxh6+!! [ K g8 ] [ Q g5 ] wins.
 [ c3 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ B g5 ] , [ f6 ]  Have to play this. leaves me open to [ B x g8 ] [ R x g8 ] [ Q x h7 ] 0-0-0. But I think black is fine there.
 [ K f1 ] , [ R x h2 ]  Black doesn't really want this pawn. It's harmless. But black really wants to play [ R h1 ] and the pawn was in the way. White is already out of options. 40. Kg1??? and 40. Re2??? and 40. Be2??? all lose instantly to 40. ... Rh1#. 40. [ R c1 ] 40. [ R b1 ] and 40. [ R a1 ] lose the rook to 40. ... Rh1. And 40. [ R d1 ] or any other pawn or bishop move are met with the actual continuation as played in the game.
 [ K f4 ] , [ K d4 ]  Attacking the rook again and again preparing to drive the white king back.
 [ B x e2 ]  [ R e x e2 ]  [ f x g3 ]  [ f x g3 ]  [ R g5 x g3 + ]  [ R e g2 ]  [ R g3 x g2 + ]  [ R x g2 ]  [ R x g2 + ] , [ K x g2 ]  33. [ K x g2 ] - after another plethora of exchanges after Mike pins my knight to my rook I have a BvN endgame two pawns down. Does Henry have a prayer? Well so long as I keep my mitts off the resign button he does because there may be some divine intervention on the way.
 [ R f a8 ]  [ R x a4 ]  [ R x a4 ]  [ K b3 ]  [ g5 ]  [ h4 ]  [ f6 ]  [ h x g5 ]  [ h x g5 ] , [ c4 ]  Aim to force the rook away
 [ R c d8 ]  [ R a b5 ]  [ h6 ]  [ R b5 b3 ]  [ Q f5 ]  [ K g2 ]  [ R e4 ]  [ Q b6 ]  [ R d e8 ] , [ R f3 ]  This rook will guard the [ f2 ] pawn while also taking aim at Black’s vulnerable [ f7 ] pawn. This efficient combination of attack and defense assures me a draw.
 [ N g f6 ] , [ N x f6 + ]  I practice I have to exchange the knights anyway. For example 6. [ B d3 ] [ N x e4 ] 7. [ B x e4 ] [ N f6 ] 8. [ B d3 ] etc.
 [ e4 ] , [ N f6 ]  1. ........ [ N f6 ] - the Alekhine's Defense. The purpose of this is to attack the e pawn from the outset and develop a piece. The usual move for white is to then advance the e pawn to [ e5 ] and back it up next move with [ d4 ] which is what I do.
 [ d x e5 ] , [ f x e5 ]  This rules out [ d5 ] - for black - and we leave the Sicilian Defense strategy... A lot more problems for white poses 8. ... [ N g4 ] attacking e5... 9. [ N g5 ] [ N h6 ] 10. [ Q h5 ] 0-0 11. [ e x d6 ] [ B x d6 ] grinds to a halt soon for white so does 10. [ e x d6 ] Bxd6... After 9. [ h3 ] [ N h6 ] 10. [ e x d6 ] [ B x d6 ] 11. [ N e4 ] Be7... Now after 9. ... [ N g4 ] 10. [ Q e2 ] keeping an eye on Ng4...
 [ R d1 + ]  [ K e8 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B b7 ] , [ R d3 ]  very useful position for rook open file ready to be backed up by rook on [ a1 ] and defends the knight
 [ a6 ]  [ f4 ] , [ e5 ]  This is unusual. 10...[ Q c7 ] 10...[ N x d4 ] 10...[ B d7 ] 10...[ N d7 ] are the typical choices. I do not have access to the opening database but I do not recall seeing this move before at this exact order. If Black chooses to play [ e5 ] it is usually done right away instead of [ e6 ] first then e5.
 [ K c8 ]  [ K d5 ]  [ K d7 ] , [ K e5 ]  This is where I change my mind and go for the [ f5 ] and [ g7 ] pawns and then I want to queen.
 [ c x b4 ] , [ N e7 ]  preparing castling and d7-d5...
 [ K g6 ]  [ Q g8 + ]  [ K h5 ] , [ B c1 ]  (!) Very strong...
 [ a x b5 ] , [ a x b5 ]  now black has 2 weak pawns.
 [ Q b2 ]  [ R c4 ] , [ g3 ]  Another mistake.
 [ N c3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ d5 ]  Strange usually this is played before [ B g7 ] but this will likely transpose into a normal Grunfeld.
 [ Q d3 ]  [ N x e3 ]  [ Q x e3 ] , [ B e6 ]  The immediate 14...[ Q a5 ] was better as the Knight has to remain on [ c3 ] to protect a2. Now it can jump to [ d5 ] with a slight advantage for White according to Fritz.
 [ Q d1 + ]  [ K g2 ]  [ Q f3 + ]  [ K f1 ]  [ Q d1 + ]  [ K g2 ] , [ Q d5 ]  !?
 [ R h g1 ]  [ B b7 ] , [ B h6 ]  trying to remove fianchettoed bish
 [ N x b5 ]  [ N x b5 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d3 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ N c3 ]  Truely White must have something better! That is what many players think and just skip to [ Q e1 ] but this was the right move.
 [ d5 ]  [ c4 ]  [ d x c4 ] , [ e3 ]  Yeah yeah some people play [ N c3 ] but I do this.
 [ d4 ] , [ f4 ]  No I didn't expect that one. I don't feel that I can afford to let him trade on e3. I'm going to have trouble defending that pawn. I almost have to take his pawn.
 [ N f3 ] , [ c5 ]  The Sicilian is usually played 1. [ e4 ] [ c5 ] however i was thinking of playing the french when I started the match.
 [ B e4 ]  [ R h2 ]  [ N g6 ]  [ N d2 ]  [ N d7 ] , [ N x e4 ]  White gains the Bishop pair but the position is closed so knights are preferred here.
 [ a x b4 ] , [ a x b4 ]  ? Anand has lost all his sense of danger- a very foolish attitude towards a brilliant tactician as Kasparov! 29. [ N x b4 ] was necessary but Black would be in the driving seat.
 [ K d6 ]  [ a5 ]  [ b x a5 ] , [ b x a5 ]  The a- and e-pawns are far enough apart that black's king cannot stop both of them. White won't even have to move his king to defend the promoting pawn: 44. ... [ K c6 ] 45. [ a6 ] [ K b6 ] 46. [ e5 ] Kx[ a6 ] 47. [ e6 ] [ K b6 ] 48. [ e7 ] [ K c6 ] 49. e8=Q+. Seeing this black resigned. Rafabio and I split our two matches four games 3-1 yet he won more rating points for his one victory than I won for my three. Well played by my opponent.
 [ K d4 ]  [ B b2 + ]  [ K e4 ]  [ B a1 ]  [ K f3 ] , [ K e5 ]  Objective 1 achieved!
 [ N x c5 ] , [ N x c5 ]  ...black will win the pawn on a & b but this only activates my position more. [ N f3 ] and 0-0 and black will be in trouble win all my pieces quickly in game there in....
 [ b5 ] , [ a4 ]  Of course. Now I have to improvise.
 [ B b3 ] , [ Q x g5 ]  Finally... Sheeesh!
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ d5 ]  this brave scout seems to loose contact with his own forces. (this move makes the diagonal for my fianchettoed bishop even juicier)
 [ K b1 ] , [ Q b8 ]  Devoted to a future attack.
 [ Q a5 ]  [ O-O-O ] , [ R d8 ]  Had to defend against an attack on my weak pawn.
 [ O-O ]  [ B g2 ]  [ N b d7 ] , [ N g e2 ]  this is it! this does not block the f pawn so i can guard my king better!!
 [ N e4 ] , [ Q e7 ]  ?? [ Q e8 ] or [ N e7 ] would have been better. [ d4 ] was an option but after [ B b5 ] my attack goes on.
 [ R x e7 ]  [ R x e7 + ]  [ K f6 ] , [ R x c7 ]  Although there was nothing against taking the e-pawn I would also have chosen as White has to set up the Q-side pawn majority for White.
 [ N d2 ]  [ a5 ]  [ h3 ] , [ b5 ]  Black has nothing on the Queenside.
 [ B f4 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ c6 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ N b d7 ] , [ g4 ]  I'm not sure about this move it seems weakening. The pin was annoying and white decided to break it.
 [ B h3 ] , [ g5 ]  Thinking of attacking [ g2 ] square. So I needed to prepare good protection for my f pawn.
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ B c4 ] , [ g6 ]  Starting position
 [ N d3 + ] , [ K f1 ]  Not 15.[ K d1 ] a mate in 5 that even I was able to work out (although I missed a delaying interposition and thought it was mate in 4). And not 15.[ K d2 ] either in which case I figured 15...[ N x f2 + ] was good due to either 16.[ K c2 ] [ N x h1 ] or 16.[ K e1 ] Qxg3. How to respond to this move however I was less clear on although I still thought [ N x f2 ] was good. It was but not for the reasons I foresaw.
 [ K h3 ] , [ Q d2 ]  Again threatening the rook.
 [ N c6 ] , [ Q a4 ]  ? Drops material. [ Q f4 ] is better and not [ Q e3 ] Ng4! 6. [ Q f4 ] forces black to move the Knight on [ f6 ] back to the lonely [ g8 ] square. The best continuation which gives white a nice spacial advantage and a temporary lead in development while Black has the plan of attacking the [ e5 ] pawn and harassing the white Queen.
 [ B d2 ] , [ d5 ]  The first error from Sting. This move loses a Pawn without significant compensation.
 [ N h5 ] , [ Q g4 ]  Now ... Rxe5?? loses after 25. [ N x e5 ] [ Q x e5 ] 26. [ Q x c8 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ Q f3 ] , [ h6 ]  Forced against the threat of [ f5 ] (after which ... [ R x e5 ] loses to Bf4)
 [ R f e8 ] , [ g4 ]  looking to trap the knight but really losing another pawn since black can punch right back with his own little trick
 [ e x d6 ]  [ e ]  [ p ]  [ B x d6 ] , [ d4 ]  Trying to stake claim to the center.
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ e3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ c5 ]  [ b3 ] , [ b6 ]  This is not very much played in practice. Nevertheless SF5 considers it perfectly justified.
 [ R f e8 ]  [ Q x e8 + ]  [ R x e8 ]  [ R x e8 + ]  [ K h7 ]  [ R e2 ] , [ B d4 ]  Both minor pieces now have good squares.
 [ N x d4 ] , [ N f6 ]  Black develops king side knight with tempo against e4...
 [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ] , [ N x d4 ]  4. [ N x d4 ] - the standard pawn trade.
 [ R f e8 ]  [ B c3 ] , [ N d7 ]  ...[ B f8 ] permits [ B x f6 ] [ g x f6 ] destroying the King's safety.
 [ B x e5 ]  [ R x e5 ]  [ R x d6 ]  [ R e7 ]  [ R d7 ]  [ R x d7 ]  [ N x d7 ] , [ B g4 ]  Botvinnik: A pointless move since White cannot go into the lost Rook and Pawn ending.
 [ K d6 ]  [ Q f8 + ]  [ K e5 ]  [ Q e7 + ]  [ K d4 ]  [ Q e3 + ]  [ K c4 ]  [ Q c3 + ]  [ K b5 ]  [ N c7 + ]  [ K a4 ] , [ B b3 # ]  That's it in 27 moves.
 [ Q f1 ] , [ B x d2 ]  should I take the knight? It would take 1 more move to free his bishop & rook but I liked the idea of simplification.
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N b d2 ] , [ c5 ]  Finally I find the challenging line. This is the one black has to play. Exchanging is to set free his dsb not doing it is allowing cxd [ N x d4 ] [ N c6 ] Nb5! and a known line black can get out from easily [ c3 ] and e3...
 [ c3 ] , [ Q h3 ]  20. ..... [ Q h3 ] - Glenda moves very close to the WK and I now threaten to win the [ g3 ] pawn.
 [ Q g3 ] , [ Q x g2 + ]  39. ..... [ Q x [ g2 ] + ] - Bob tries to duck the exchange but I exchange anyway even though Fou Leblanc will be given up for the [ g2 ] pawn. This leaves Bob with just his king and bishop and three pawns. I have a rook and four pawns at my disposal. White is lost and can only try for a stalemate.
 [ f6 ] , [ g6 ]  18. g6!! - this little pawn move hammers the final nail in the BK's coffin. Whatever black does he is gonna get Freddied next turn. The rest is silence.
 [ K e3 ]  [ h5 ] , [ K f2 ]  No choice
 [ h4 ] , [ d6 ]  [ [ [ h4 ] ] ] here really threw me off. I don't like [ [ [ h4 ] ] ] personally... especially in this situation. [ N c3 ] [ N [ f3 ] ] or even [ c4 ] would probably be a much better response here. I'll sometimes play [ [ [ h4 ] ] ] if I fianchetto king side (usually in a KIA) but thats usually much later in the opening. I'm really not sure what he was trying to do here. Maybe n[ f3 ] n[ g5 ] attacking the [ f7 ] square? I played [ d7 ] defending the center and allowing for development into either a Kings Indian Fianchetto Variation or maybe a Sicillian Dragon. To be honest I play the position I try not to pay too much attention to the openings names. I am citing them here simply because it may help others look into what I'm playing here.
 [ f6 ]  [ f4 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ N c6 ]  The d-pawn must feel very threatened and yet protected at the same time.
 [ K x h6 ]  [ Q x f8 + ] , [ K h5 ]  Now I've seen it myself. Pretty amazing mate in 11 right from where he took on g7. so if you think about it. I'm lost as soon as he plays g4.
 [ N c6 ]  [ N g f3 ] , [ f6 ]  Let's take a look to the position: white has the two central pawns under attack and right now they are very poorly defended. The knight [ d2 ] is pinned and closes the way to the bishop. Black has knights in good positions and looks very solid. However he has the bishops closed by the pawn an their develop will be very slow. For this reason I think that here was better for black to move a pawn in order to open a diagonal for a bishop like [ d6 ] or g5. The move played in the game is slow and is not a real menace for white center. Now I found the right strategy for this position that is to try to have a rapid development and to open the central columns to take advantage of the better bishop's position.
 [ K d1 ] , [ h3 ]  now i have to pawns about to promote !
 [ K f8 ] , [ N x a7 ]  Knight's on the rim are dim but I just wanted to resit trying. Anyway I'm 17 points up.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ f4 ] , [ B c5 ]  the king's gambit declined. i personally think this is the best response to the king's gambit because it turns the tables on white because white now has a very annoying dark square bishop which he has to deal with before he can launch his attack on the weak [ f7 ] pawn!!
 [ R d1 ]  [ R x e2 + ]  [ K x b3 ]  [ R x h2 ] , [ a4 ]  This was as far as I'd gone with my analysis of 39. [ N e3 ] and I knew that the passed pawns supported by the King were much more dangerous that Black's pawns. In fact I am almost playing a piece up because my King is taking part in the game whilst Black's isn't doing anything.
 [ B b7 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ e6 ]  A natural move. It supports [ c5 ] if Black wants to attack the centre and the DSB has several options.
 [ R d x c8 ]  [ b x c8 = Q ]  [ R x c8 ]  [ R x c8 + ]  [ Q x c8 ] , [ N d2 ]  now up a queen a minor and a pawn this game is over for white. I'm up 13 points and have taken two queens away from white leaving him a night and a corner.
 [ e2 ]  [ R f e1 ]  [ Q e3 + ]  [ K g2 ]  [ K d5 ] , [ a4 ]  This was literally the only way white could save himself from checkmate.
 [ N x e5 ]  [ N x e5 ] , [ R x e5 ]  Now White has a ironfisted grip on the center with a Rook in the center and the Knight ready to move to e4. But White isn't dead quite yet. Not until he overlooks Rxh5.
 [ Q d2 ]  [ b5 ]  [ N g e2 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ O-O ]  [ e6 ] , [ b4 ]  [ a3 ] more safe line . I figured the following sacrifice would be more interesting actually. The sacrifice doesnt have anything immediate threats but they will slowly arise in pretty forcing measures. Black bishop is also pretty strong in this kind of opening so I didnt think it was that bad after all.
 [ N f6 ] , [ B g5 ]  I had numerous alternatives here but decided to start the tactics early.
 [ N b6 ]  [ O-O ] , [ R e8 ]  And albertwall goes for it by centralizing his R which is also a good way to develop your game as I have learned from elyhim.
 [ c x b4 ] , [ c5 ]  Black is in trouble.
 [ R b8 + ]  [ K g7 ]  [ R g5 + ] , [ K h6 ]  Black wants to get his king to [ g6 ] where white's rook on the 5th rank cannot give check.
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ c4 ] , [ N f6 ]  This move has been played against me a few times however I don't believe that it is the strongest response in this line. Much better is to defend the d pawn by either [ c6 ] or e6.
 [ N e5 ] , [ N x d4 ]  Yes dude it's a free pawn but your knight is completely unprotected.
 [ R c d1 ]  [ B d2 ]  [ Q b3 ]  [ Q d7 ]  [ a3 ] , [ R c5 ]  22... [ R f d8 ] Is also good. Black probably had lots of good choices here.
 [ N f3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ g3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ B g2 ]  [ c6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B f5 ]  [ b3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ B b2 ]  [ h6 ]  [ d3 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ e3 ]  [ B h7 ]  [ Q e2 ]  [ a5 ]  [ a4 ]  [ N a6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N c5 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ O-O ]  [ f4 ]  [ N f d7 ]  [ N x d7 ]  [ Q x d7 ]  [ e4 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ R f d8 ]  [ R a d1 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ K h1 ]  [ R x d1 ]  [ R x d1 ]  [ R d8 ]  [ B f3 ]  [ R x d1 + ]  [ Q x d1 ]  [ Q d8 ]  [ Q x d8 + ] , [ B x d8 ]  At a casual glance the position looks dead drawn and it is indeed hard to believe that anyone could win such a position against a world-class grandmaster such as Polugaevsky. However this is one of the reasons why I have selected it for inclusion in the present book. Quite apart from Larsen's superb handling of the ending especially in the latter phase the game is instructive in demonstrating that even apparently drawish positions can be won with only the smallest error from the opponent if one has the determination to try. In the first instance the latter is the key. If one asks "How does one win such a position against a strong opponent?" the first stage of the answer is "By not agreeing a draw!" . In playing on White does have a couple of small straws from which to weave his basket. Firstly the black bishop on [ h7 ] is currently shut out of play by the white e4-pawn and will take some time to emerge into play. Secondly White has a space advantage thanks to his pawns on [ e4 ] and f4.
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ b3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ B b2 ]  [ d5 ] , [ a3 ]  [ a3 ] is important to keep the B from landing on b4.
 [ R e6 ] , [ N d4 ]  (!?) Why play ...[ N d4 ] now and not two moves ago? The difference is that the White rook is on [ e6 ] and not [ e7 ] allowing the Black King to reach f7. I must admit I didn't particularly notice this "change of mind" at the time...
 [ Q x b2 ]  [ N g5 ] , [ B e6 ]  After 14.. [ g6 ] 15. [ B x f7 + ] Kg7. 16. [ B x e8 ] Qe5. 17. [ Q c3 ] Kd4. 18. [ f4 ] very nice :)
 [ Q h4 ] , [ Q c6 ]  White dealt with the [ N x h3 + ] threat but Black decides to play for a [ g2 ] checkmate. [ N e2 + ] wins the exchange and recovers some of the material deficit.
 [ Q g7 ] , [ e4 ]  hmmm... pretty sure I have to take it but from which side? I choose [ d x e4 ] because I want my f pawn to stay where it is. This gives away my pawn on [ c5 ] though... However - he has a real problem when I play [ N e4 ] that forks his queen and knight pinned on c3.
 [ K d3 ]  [ h4 ] , [ K c3 ]  At this point I felt I should get away from that area. There aren't really any good moves for white now.
 [ N h5 ] , [ e3 ]  I lose my strong lsb but I create a center that I hope won't be easy to undermine.
 [ N x e2 + ] , [ K h1 ]  only move
 [ B x c5 ]  [ d4 ]  [ B c6 ] , [ d x c5 ]  to me bishops are more valuable than knights.
 [ d x e5 ]  [ d x e5 ] , [ N c5 ]  At this point I had it figured that I was going to win a pawn. Obviously Black cannot move 18...[ [ b6 ] ] Alternatively 18...[ c6 ] 19. bx[ c6 ] [ [ b6 ] ] 20. [ c7 ] loses the exchange
 [ h5 ]  [ g5 ]  [ R d g1 ]  [ h6 ] , [ N g3 ]  Bringing another piece into the attack
 [ B a5 ] , [ O-O ]  Ahead in development not a bad time to castle.
 [ R x d8 ] , [ B x c6 ]  bishop for knight
 [ Q e7 ] , [ B x g6 ]  [ c6 ] here would be black's best try. But major loss of material including the black queen is imminent.
 [ h6 ]  [ B h4 ]  [ g5 ] , [ B g3 ]  I knew that all of that was coming. But I guess that this is a better place for the DSB then on d2.
 [ Q x d4 ] , [ Q c7 ]  So his Queen comes to [ c7 ] which would be better if she came the move earlier. Attacking c pawn.
 [ d6 ] , [ N x c6 ]  after narrowly making a cock up by taking knight on [ g4 ] soon realised and exchanged knights this way
 [ O-O ] , [ N x d4 ]  But can now ;-)
 [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ e x d4 ] , [ B c4 ]  So the game is a Scotch Gambit. Although the computer doesn't like it it is probably the perfect choice against a human player-Gains activity early on which is definitely the right idea and totally solid fundamentally. Even at the expert level this is a great choice.
 [ Q f8 + ] , [ K h7 ]  avoiding the check
 [ B x e5 ] , [ R x e5 ]  ...and this time I get the exchange.
 [ B x f5 ] , [ Q f4 ]  ?! Placing the queen there on the open f-file is not a good idea. The immediate Qg4-[ g3 ] is indicated.
 [ O-O ]  [ B g4 ] , [ a3 ]  a crap.. now i noticed the pawn move b4.. well probably [ a5 ] on the next move will deal with it..
 [ N c6 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ d4 ] , [ B x c6 + ]  Not sure about my decision to capture. Since my pawns were all jagged I figured a knight might be more valuable to him. In addition he would double a pawn and that might be an advantage.
 [ g4 ]  [ Q d7 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ B x e5 ]  [ R x e5 ]  [ B x g4 ]  [ Q g3 ]  [ R a c8 ]  [ R f e1 ]  [ B e6 ] , [ R h5 ]  You do a pretty good job of trying to muddy the waters here but my material proves too much with a little accuracy
 [ a5 ] , [ K e2 ]  Mate in 4 moves now. I did all the possible conditional moves here and logged in an hour later to see an automated congratulation message.
 [ e5 ]  [ R x e5 ]  [ R x e5 ]  [ d x e5 ] , [ a3 ]  It was right about here that my opponent complimented my play thus far in the game. It always nice when someone 300+ points better than you tells you that you are playing a good game. She also told me that I had a draw on my hands if I played correctly. I've never drawn against a 2000+ opponent so of course I felt the pressure. I deliberated several days over the next sequence of moves. I don't know if I would have worked so hard at it if my opponent had not told me that a draw was possible. At any rate I worked out the correct moves but move 41 will undo it all.
 [ R h3 x h7 ] , [ R a e8 ]  Feeling like I've achieved my goal I double up and threaten to take on e3. However it's irrelevant because of what's about to unfold.
 [ f6 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ Q d6 ]  [ Q c2 ]  [ N b6 ] , [ B x h7 + ]  I gain a second Pawn.
 [ a4 ]  [ R b8 ]  [ a x b5 ]  [ a x b5 ] , [ B b2 ]  9. Bb2? 9. [ [ d4 ] ] would've been a better move in the long run. But Black would allow [ [ d4 ] ] in the next move with his passive 10..[ g6 ]  [ g6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ e5 ] , [ e4 ]  14.[ [ e4 ] ] The pawn push of 13..[ e5 ] has no immediate threat so White continues with 14.[ [ e4 ] ] challenging Black's intentions.
 [ B c3 ]  [ R x h4 ]  [ K d1 ]  [ R h1 + ]  [ K d2 ]  [ R h2 ] , [ K e1 ]  39. [ K e1 ] - forced - the f pawn must be defended.
 [ N g f6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O-O ] , [ b4 ]  11. [ b4 ] starts the attack on black's position.
 [ R d1 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ R d5 ] , [ a4 ]  ! Always push a pass pawn!
 [ c6 ]  [ f5 ]  [ K b7 ] , [ K f8 ]  Black cracks finally. More resliant is 50. ... [ R b3 + ] 51. [ K c8 ] [ R c3 ] 52. [ K d7 ] [ K f7 ]  [ R b3 + ]  [ K a6 ]  [ R a3 + ]  [ K b6 ]  [ R b3 + ]  [ K c5 ]  [ R c3 + ]  [ K d5 ] , [ R d3 + ]  After 55. ... [ f4 ] of course [ c7 ] ... [ c8 Q + ] [ R x c8 ] Rh8+... But this accelerates whites attack again...
 [ N c3 ] , [ h6 ]  [ g5 ] looks too tempting for either white bishop or knight so let's keep them both off of it.
 [ B x d4 + ]  [ R x d4 ]  [ N e6 ]  [ R d2 ]  [ c6 ]  [ N e3 ]  [ N c5 ]  [ N c4 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ f5 ]  [ B x c4 ]  [ B x c4 ]  [ Q b6 ] , [ K h1 ]  of course. it is unpleasent to play well and then to miss Nxe4.
 [ O-O ]  [ B g7 ] , [ B g5 ]  I didnt want him to play [ e6 ] which strenghts [ f7 ] square.Also i thought i might want to change my Bishop on [ g5 ] with his Knight on [ f6 ] in the thought of controling the light squares.
 [ R f g1 ] , [ B g4 ]  White's rook at [ f1 ] was probably not the best move as I was blocking the file at [ f3 ] and his DB was also on the file at f2. So white moves the rook across to [ g1 ] and I immediately move across to block the file again at g4.
 [ f6 ]  [ B h4 ]  [ g5 ]  [ B g3 ]  [ N h6 ] , [ e3 ]  had to bring the other bishop out
 [ R e1 ]  [ R f6 ]  [ Q f3 ]  [ R h6 ]  [ Q g3 ] , [ R c8 ]  White threatened to win the Exchange with N-[ B7 ] or N-N4.
 [ O-O-O ] , [ N b8 d7 ]  finally black starts developing his pieces blacks knights start there journey towards c4.
 [ B e3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ K f1 ]  [ R f d8 ]  [ K e2 ]  [ f5 ]  [ R d1 ]  [ R d7 x d1 ]  [ N x d1 ] , [ R e8 ]  Endgame with two minors vs. Rook. White have also a pawn more. Interesting!
 [ a3 ] , [ B e7 ]  Felt a bit behind so decided to try and simplify the board in a better position.
 [ B x f3 ]  [ B e5 ]  [ B f4 ] , [ N c6 ]  Oh I think P[ f6 ] would have been better.
 [ R x b5 ]  [ K x b5 ]  [ K c3 ] , [ d5 ]  ! I hadn't seen this. It creates a dangerous protected passed pawn whatever White does. It looks like a sacrifice but isn't.
 [ B d5 ] , [ B c4 ]  19. Bc4! is a good move. If the Black Queen takes the rook at [ a1 ] [ B x d5 + ] and checkmate in three moves
 [ K h7 ] , [ K d2 ]  ?? I missed the winning move!
 [ B e6 ] , [ B c4 ]  Controlling the center
 [ R d e1 ]  [ R h e8 ]  [ h x g6 ] , [ B x g6 ]  a strange move. After the natural [ h x g6 ] [ e5 ] will come next with pressure for black
 [ N e2 ]  [ N g4 ]  [ d4 ] , [ B x d4 ]  ..this looks like a useful offer..
 [ R x e1 + ]  [ Q x e1 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ Q x d4 ] , [ R b1 ]  19. [ R b1 ] attacks b7. I think about moving my king to [ f1 ] but with the queens on the board is this wise?
 [ Q h6 ]  [ B x g3 + ]  [ N x g3 ]  [ Q x g3 + ]  [ K f1 ]  [ B x g2 + ]  [ K e2 ]  [ B f3 + ]  [ K d2 ]  [ Q f2 + ]  [ K c1 ] , [ R x g1 # ]  White did not have enough time to start an attack of own
 [ B b7 ] , [ h4 ]  Threatening [ h5 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ b x c3 ]  [ b x c3 ]  [ N h5 ]  [ B h2 ] , [ N a5 ]  A k"night" on the edge is dim. Both Black's knights are dim.
 [ B e7 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ c6 ]  a sound continuation leading to a typical Slav-type position. I'm not sure exactly which one... nuntar to the rescue?
 [ Q x e7 ]  [ N f5 ]  [ Q e6 ] , [ Q d4 ]  Threatening mate in one on [ g7 ] but this is easily parried by Black.
 [ B c5 ]  [ d3 ]  [ O-O ] , [ N x e5 ]  White eventually tires of looking at my hanging pawn hoping I'll take the Gambit and simply takes it himself
 [ b5 ] , [ e4 ]  More usual is 10. [ R d1 ] or 10. [ a4 ] either securing the d-pawn or creating weaknesses in blacks queenside before opening the center.
 [ d6 ] , [ N f5 ]  Here I offer another draw. He declines again.
 [ B g3 ]  [ B x g3 ] , [ h x g3 ]  And black repeated the scheme.
 [ f6 ] , [ N x c6 ]  I don't like [ N d3 ] because after the exchange my knight is easily kicked out.
 [ B e3 ]  [ N e c6 ]  [ R b1 ]  [ b5 ]  [ Q d2 ] , [ f5 ]  here i was up to propose the draw; i forgot to do it... and then...
 [ R f b1 ]  [ K e7 ]  [ a4 ]  [ R d8 ]  [ a5 ]  [ R d8 x d7 ]  [ R x d7 + ] , [ K x d7 ]  A echange of rooks
 [ B g5 ] , [ B e7 ]  White moved to attack knight at [ f3 ] and I moved DB to protect the knight.
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ g3 ] , [ c5 ]  I like to strike in the center early and make the game dynamic right away especially with black.
 [ N x f6 ]  [ Q x f6 + ]  [ K e8 ] , [ O-O-O ]  A strange castling situation for White but logical all the same - threatens the knight and puts the rook on the same file as Black's queen
 [ B x f4 ]  [ N d7 ] , [ B f3 ]  nothing left there to do ...
 [ d5 ]  [ c4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ c6 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ h6 ]  [ B h4 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ e3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ Q c2 ]  [ N b d7 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ a6 ]  [ a4 ]  [ N g4 ]  [ B g3 ]  [ f5 ]  [ h3 ]  [ N g f6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N e4 ]  [ B h2 ]  [ b6 ] , [ N e2 ]  This is moment when my troubles began. Haapala's knight begins to roam noticing considerable gaps in my pawn structure nice holes to place a knight.
 [ B g4 ]  [ B g2 ]  [ e6 ]  [ O-O ] , [ B x f3 ]  with black doing this he allows me the bishop pair.
 [ Q x b1 ]  [ c3 ]  [ B e4 ]  [ f5 ]  [ B d3 ] , [ Q d5 ]  Of the 38 moves in the game move 18 [ Q d5 ] is the one that should have ultimately cost black the game.
 [ d5 ] , [ K d4 ]  40. Kd4? Playing into the following Zuggie!
 [ f5 ] , [ N x c6 ]  I follow through with my plan.
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ] , [ Q x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ] is more common however the [ Q x d4 ] is not a bad move. According to the GameKnot game database both have the same win percentage although the knight take is played 40 times as much.
 [ R e8 ] , [ B x d6 ]  Black escapes the fork but it cost him his knight.
 [ B d7 ]  [ R c1 ] , [ Q b7 ]  17. ..... [ Q b7 ] - still in book. Glenda is to support a rook move from [ f8 ] to c8.
 [ R x c4 ]  [ d x c4 ] , [ d5 ]  It's all downhill from here for White
 [ K d6 ] , [ K d4 ]  Well this looks good for white. his king is more centralized than black's king and it is a strong blockader of the passed pawn on d5. Yes blockading a passed pawn could be considered passive but black will need to defend the passed pawn somehow and since it's isolated his king will also be passive.
 [ B b2 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ e3 ]  Again a move i regularly play in my english games not sure if it's that good vs Leningrad. Maybe [ d5 ] or N[ d5 ] would've been better. N[ d5 ] looks like a sweet outpost
 [ h4 ]  [ B g2 ] , [ K b8 ]  Black moves his King off the diagonal of the White Bishop.
 [ e6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B b4 ]  [ e3 ]  [ b6 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ Q c2 ]  [ f5 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B x c3 ]  [ b x c3 ] , [ O-O ]  The previous moves have all followed opening theory (4.[ b6 ] variation of the Rubinstein Nimzo-Indian if you want to be precise) up to this point. I shall take a moment to outline the plans for both sides. For white he must try to take advantage of the imbalance in the position of the two bishops by opening up the position by virtue of a pawn break (such as c5/d5) or retreating the knight and playing [ f3 ] preparing to set up a big centre. Black on the other hand must seek to keep the position closed which will favour his knights and try to combine the mobile kingside pawns the potential attacking formation of swinging the rook across ([ f6 ] - g6/h6) combined with the ls bishop could put white in trouble.
 [ h6 ]  [ B g2 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ a6 ] , [ d4 ]  I decided to open up the middle - with unexpected outcome
 [ N e3 + ] , [ K d2 ]  Feeling more and more confident I bring my K right here. In fact Jack said "You nasty man. It's a good move. I cannot defend it." I don't agree with this because there's no immediate win of material but the idea is becoming a "Mr. tough guy" as Jack implied with his first sentence on this move. Sooner or later I was planning to bring it up move a rook over and then bring it back down. As then it's the equivalent of castling. So by checking me the way that he did I add an attacker to put more pressure on him. It doesn't work. I did anticipate him bringing it back but didn't realize that it was right in a spot where my Queen is reattacked.
 [ R f x c3 ]  [ R x c3 ]  [ R x c3 ] , [ c x b7 ]  It's now the endgame. Black has won back his piece but white is still winning.
 [ N c3 ] , [ d6 ]  We're in main line Robatsch theory up to this point. In the Robatsch Black delays or totally omits [ N f6 ] in to maintain direct control over the long diagonal restraining White's aggressive [ e5 ] push and keeping [ f5 ] available. Risky perhaps because White is free to develop a strong centre at leisure and severly cramp Black's play. My opponent must be a Romulan...
 [ N x d5 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ B x d5 ]  [ B h3 + ] , [ K g1 ]  I would be wrong to move my rook off the 1st rank. He knows that a checkmate would follow.
 [ d6 ] , [ e x d6 ]  Begins an exchange sequence that will isolate a pawn on [ d6 ] for black.
 [ O-O ] , [ O-O ]  Castle early castle often. Famous advice and adhered to here although my castle is more a natural development of my position white's castling is part of a greater scheme..
 [ Q d4 ] , [ Q g5 ]  ???? ( includes next few moves)
 [ h x g4 ] , [ R c1 ]  Interesting. Attacking on the opposite side is a golden rule in chess. After [ g x f3 ] [ B x f3 ] gives good chances to white (I'd say the game). Now the plan is either the mentioned [ R h7 ] (and hopefully along the Queen) or Q to the "h" file. It may take too long though. Maybe [ R e1 ] would be a releasing one better than Rc1.
 [ K a3 ]  [ R a8 ]  [ R h2 ] , [ K c6 ]  With every move the initiative is moving back towards Black. White has made no progress against the solid granite of Black's knights and pawns the bishops cannot attack anything and the king is misplaced.
 [ N c6 ] , [ g5 ]  I want my Q out so I have to kick the N.
 [ Q h7 ]  [ N f7 ] , [ Q h5 ]  Or Qg6. I dreamed with my lsb on [ g6 ] but it never happened.
 [ Q x b4 + ]  [ Q d6 ] , [ Q x d6 # ]  
 [ g4 ] , [ N e5 ]  5. [ N e5 ] - I thought he might go [ N g5 ] which is the Allgaier Gambit sacrificing N for P in order to bring Henry out into the centre but he chooses the Kiezeritzky Gambit instead which can get really wild.
 [ B b5 + ] , [ B d7 ]  just helping me in the end.. trade off pieces
 [ Q h7 ]  [ Q x f8 + ]  [ Q g8 ] , [ Q x g8 # ]  So as black be aware of this kind of attack (you will face probably sooner or later) and as white "be nastier than normal" when attacking: don't stick to the more obvious moves always look for more moves. You will find some useful surprise like this one I found on the way.
 [ N x e4 ]  [ B x e4 ]  [ f5 ]  [ B d3 ] , [ e5 ]  Black will trade knights and chases the bishop away then proceeds to make the move to [ e5 ] bidding for control of the center himself.
 [ d x c5 ] , [ R c2 ]  Either this or [ R c1 ] as otherwise ...[ [ e6 ] ] is embarrassing for the N. ****** EDIT ****** After further analysis it looks like white can also play in the center here with 25.e5!? the point being that 25...[ B x e5 ] is answered with 26.Bd3! and all of a sudden the errant pawn on [ h6 ] becomes a huge asset for white! Also 25.e5!? [ [ e6 ] ] 26.[ N c3 ] [ B x e5 ] 27.[ N b4 ] and white has some activity for the pawn though I don't know if it's enough compensation.
 [ Q x a4 ]  [ R x a4 ]  [ b3 ]  [ R b1 ]  [ R a b8 ] , [ N c6 ]  Now the correct move is 24... Ra8.
 [ Q e7 ]  [ Q x f5 ]  [ g6 ]  [ Q g5 ]  [ Q x e4 + ]  [ B e3 ]  [ f6 ] , [ Q d5 + ]  Forcing the exchange was good otherwise NxB PxN QxP+ leaves black up a pawn and white particularly vulnerable.
 [ N x d5 ] , [ B e8 ]  Just like with Knights my plan was to get my Bishop to a better outpost. The plan involves 15...[ f6 ] and then 16...[ B f7 ] or 16...Bg5. I think it would've been [ g5 ] since I like bringing them to good spots and I am thinking of strategy similar to what Susan Polgar emphasized with the Knights which you saw in one of her games and an OTB WTW Game against Bernie.
 [ K e2 ] , [ b6 ]  hinders mobility of the white bishop places the pawn on a safer square and opens the a6-[ f1 ] diagonal for the light bishop.
 [ d5 ]  [ c4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ c x d5 ]  I think this is bad because it releases my bishop. The concept of keeping pieces trapped is what practically gives me victory.
 [ g x h5 ] , [ R h g1 ]  Using the open file to attack the king side
 [ f x e5 ] , [ d x e5 ]  Exchanges abound.
 [ K x f4 ]  [ K d7 ]  [ K g4 ]  [ K c7 ]  [ K x h4 ]  [ R x b7 ]  [ R x b7 + ]  [ K x b7 ] , [ K g5 ]  1-0. The BK cannot reach the h-file in time and Black resigns. I hope this game proved valuable to someone; I think it shows well the strength of simply outlining plans as each new stage of the game approaches and then following through. White never did anything spectacular here just played consistently and with clear goals. Thanks for reading!
 [ d x c4 ] , [ g6 ]  dragon.. need my other bishop out
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B e7 ] , [ B c4 ]  More usual and possibly better is 6.Be2; here the Bishop can be attacked by advancing pawns. It also gives Black the option of 6...[ N x e4 ] though after 7.[ N x e4 ] [ d5 ] 8.[ B d3 ] [ d x e4 ] 9.[ B x e4 ] White is better placed according to the computer.
 [ B c4 ]  [ g3 + ] , [ K g2 ]  15. [ K g2 ] - King Ben takes refuge behind my [ g3 ] passer now I have to deal with the thread of a nasty discovered check.
 [ Q b6 ] , [ N f5 ]  The Knight was attacked so White needed to do something. This moves the knight to safety and threatens Black's Kingside. e.g. [ N e7 ] could now win Black's bishop and Black must defend carefully - there are chances to go wrong. (e.g. 15. [ N d5 ] [ N c6 ] 16. [ N x h6 + ] [ g x h6 ] 17. [ Q x h6 ] and Black is in real trouble!).
 [ Q d3 ] , [ g x f6 ]  I did not like the look of 18...Kxf6?! 19.[ Q f5 + ] [ K e7 ] [ R f e1 + ] or 19...[ K g8 ] where the king as trapped in a potentially very dangerous place.
 [ N x f5 ]  [ K g8 ] , [ N x g7 ]  Of course. Black resigns.
 [ Q x d7 ]  [ N x d7 ]  [ R x d5 ] , [ N c5 ]  Now black needs to find yet again a plan to penetrate. I admit that at this point I didn't give this game too much attention thinking it to be winning and not bother to find the best plan and just plan and then move when I have to... Very unhealthy approach.
 [ Q h7 ]  [ Q e4 ]  [ Q g8 + ]  [ K e7 ] , [ Q x g7 ]  Just in time! Black was threatening [ Q x c2 ] followed by [ Q x b2 ] mate.
 [ b3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ R e1 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ B d3 ] , [ Q c7 ]  Moving the queen out to start an attack.
 [ N f3 ]  [ B f5 ] , [ e x d6 ]  boring moves of development
 [ B g6 + ]  [ K g8 ]  [ B x f7 + ]  [ N x f7 ]  [ Q x f7 + ]  [ K h8 ] , [ N d x e6 ]  He resigned...
 [ Q d3 ] , [ c6 ]  Black releases the pin on his Pawn at b7.
 [ e4 ] , [ b4 ]  Although I am giving White's knight the c4-square to help fight for an e5-boost an e5-boost isn't very dangerous for me. If White plays [ a3 ] stopping me from completing my pawn chain then it will take me a lot longer to make progress on the queenside. I will have to complete development with [ B d7 ] and try maneuvering my kingside knight to the queenside with Ne8-c7-[ b5 ]  [ N c4 ] , [ a3 ]  If [ b x a3 ] then I play [ b x c3 ] with a lot of pressure on the dark squares and I still have the idea of maneuvering my [ f6 ] knight to b5.
 [ Q x b3 ] , [ a x b3 ]  Black is down a clear pawn with little prospect of ever getting it back. Whites two pairs of doubled pawns give some drawing hopes however and there is quite a bit of play left in the game.
 [ K h1 ]  [ R x a2 ]  [ R b d1 ] , [ K g8 ]  In return for giving up her QRP Menchik now controls the only fully open file. However Colle has the first passed Pawn of the game.
 [ B x f6 ] , [ N x e2 + ]  To eliminate the pair bishop I suppose but queen on [ e2 ] is not bad for white : semi open file in front of the black king joining the rooks
 [ K h2 ]  [ R g x h3 + ]  [ K g1 ]  [ R h1 + ]  [ K f2 ]  [ R h2 + ]  [ K e1 ]  [ Q e4 + ]  [ Q e2 ] , [ Q x e2 # ]  
 [ B x d4 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B x g7 ]  [ K x g7 ] , [ R a d1 ]  I get my Rook behind the Queen and those dark squares beckon especially d6.
 [ Q h7 ]  [ N x f8 ] , [ K x f8 ]  The downside of this tactic is that I cannot save my bishop.
 [ B b4 ] , [ N f3 ]  Continuing my development and protecting my investment at e5.
 [ R e1 ] , [ Q b6 ]  Puts immediate pressure on [ b2 ] and prepares to triple up on the b-file but the Q and rear rook are in the wrong formation for maximum effect.
 [ h x g4 ]  [ K e6 ]  [ K g3 ]  [ K d5 ]  [ K f4 ]  [ K c4 ] , [ g5 ]  (?) This blocks the only route White has to take [ h7 ] in three moves. After 44. [ K [ g5 ] ] [ K x b4 ] 45. [ K h6 ] [ c5 ] 46. Kx[ h7 ] [ c4 ] 47. [ g5 ] [ c3 ] 48. [ g6 ] [ c2 ] 49. [ g7 ] [ c1 Q ] 50. [ g8 Q ] [ Q h1 + ] 51. K[ g7 ] [ Q g1 + ] Black wins -- this is the endgame I calculated before accepting the exchange of rooks -- but giving up tempi can only make it easier.
 [ N g x f7 ] , [ a5 ]  Black's king position is falling apart [ R e7 ] would be better.
 [ K h2 ]  [ K e3 ]  [ K x h3 ]  [ K d4 ]  [ K g3 ]  [ K x c4 ]  [ K f3 ]  [ K d3 ]  [ K f4 ]  [ B b4 ]  [ K f3 ]  [ c4 ]  [ K f2 ] , [ K d2 ]  White resigns
 [ B x h6 ]  [ R f7 ]  [ B x f8 ]  [ R x f8 ]  [ B x d5 ]  [ c6 ] , [ Q g6 + ]  And yes I know its a bit brutal but he gets his revenge trust me!
 [ Q h2 + ]  [ K f1 ]  [ Q h1 + ]  [ K e2 ] , [ Q x g2 ]  Having got this far it was time for me to take my lumps.
 [ R e8 + ]  [ K f1 ] , [ N e6 ]  Black's blunder. After 36. [ R x e6 ] Black cannot retake White's Rook since 37. [ R x a8 ] will lead to Checkmate.
 [ N x d5 ]  [ R x d5 ] , [ c4 ]  Not much but better than nothing.
 [ Q h5 ] , [ g6 ]  Now I can make him worry a bit with...
 [ Q d7 ] , [ K b1 ]  [The last word of theory. Several moves have been tried here with pretty good success for white. The theory of this line is still developing so I will just mention a few recent games that are relevant for the 9…[ Q d6 ] line. The reader is free to explore them more deeply at his leasure.] [11.[ [ f4 ] ] [ Q e6 ] 12.[ N c3 ] [ N c4 ] 13.[ Q e2 ] [ N x e3 ] 14.[ Q x e3 ] [ N b4 ] 15.[ K b1 ] [ c6 ] 16.[ N f3 ] Nd5! 17.[ N x d5 ] [ c x d5 ] 18.[ [ e5 ] ] and black was doing ok in a game that was played just a few days ago: Bachmann A (2589)-Kovchan A (2558) Zalakaros HUN 2014 0–1 (36) although he won the game only after his opponent blundered.; 11.[ B h6 ] [ B x h6 ] 12.[ Q x h6 ] [ a6 ] 13.[ N c3 ] [ N x d4 ] 14.[ [ f4 ] ] [ f6 ] 15.[ N f3 ] [ [ e5 ] ] 16.fx[ [ e5 ] ] fx[ [ e5 ] ] 17.Nx[ [ e5 ] ] [ Q d6 ] 18.[ N f3 ] [ c5 ] 19.[ B d3 ] [ Q f4 + ] 20.Qx[ [ f4 ] ] Rx[ [ f4 ] ] 21.[ N x d4 ] [ c x d4 ] and players reached a drawish endgame in Sadler M (2646)-Svidler P (2758) London ENG 2013 1/2 (44).]
 [ O-O ]  [ O-O ] , [ N e4 ]  Jumping onto his natural post straight away and preparing a cute little tactic that I failed to see.
 [ K x g8 ] , [ N d5 ]  Now [ N d5 ] attacking black's queen also with the intention to play Nf6+.
 [ B x d5 ] , [ c x d5 ]  White eliminates the powerful knight and takes support away from the [ b5 ] pawn.
 [ d3 ]  [ Q f6 ] , [ N b d2 ]  8. [ N b d2 ] - I concentrate on developing my queenside for the nonce.
 [ c2 ] , [ B g3 ]  Jabborg too pawn-determined to worry about anything else. Safeway's moves had become strange.
 [ N f6 ]  [ N c4 ]  [ g6 ]  [ d4 ] , [ B g7 ]  Black tries to fianchetto. Fortunately I use my defending skills to defend.
 [ B x f4 ]  [ N x f4 ]  [ g5 ]  [ N h5 ]  [ d4 + ]  [ f3 ] , [ d x e3 ]  this leads to an ending where black has an advantage.
 [ h7 ]  [ g5 ]  [ h8 = Q ]  [ g4 ]  [ Q h7 + ]  [ K b8 ]  [ Q x f5 ]  [ g x f3 ]  [ g x f3 ] , [ K a7 ]  Black tries to hide behind the pawns but to no avail
 [ N f x d6 + ]  [ B x d6 ]  [ N x d6 + ]  [ K e7 ] , [ N x e8 ]  That leaves me 6 points up in material and I have a 3rd plan (this is really the first game where after my first plan fails I materialised another one or two I'm really really happy (with the expcetion of move 7) of how I played this game. Whats important to me is that after my gameplan failed due to a mistake of mine I was able to make the best of it and pull back before attacking again. The 3rd plan will come to light on move 21 or 22 but I told my opponent I wanted to annotate this game so he may be reading this hehe...
 [ b5 ] , [ B e2 ]  Again probably not the best developing move. What's the purpose of the bishop going to be? Ask yourselves these questions before moving. Strong was 6. a4! noticing the weak light squared pawns that your opponent has created and attacking them. Also good was 6. Nf3! when after .. [ N g6 ] 7. [ B e3 ] or 6.. [ N x f3 ] [ Q x f3 ] leaves you with much much better development and center control.
 [ O-O ] , [ Q c2 ]  This move allows the next move with two threats. May be better are [ N g e2 ] with castle. Este movimiento permite la siguiente maniobra con fuerza mejor seguramente era desarrollar el caballo rey y enrocar.
 [ B d3 ] , [ B g6 ]  after [ B x g6 ] always [ h x g6 ] opening up the h-file...
 [ e6 ]  [ f x e6 ]  [ N g5 ]  [ N g f6 ] , [ B f3 ]  or [ B h5 + ] [ g6 ] Bf3...
 [ N x c4 ] , [ B c1 ]  saving the bishop and defending the king whilst keeping an eye on the kingside pawns
 [ N x f6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ b6 ] , [ c x d5 ]  I wanted to clarify the position so I could get a better look at it. One possibility here is that black will be saddled with floating pawns on [ c5 ] and d5. Cxd also opened up the possibility of bishop [ b5 + ] although in this position it does not appear advantageous.
 [ R h e1 ]  [ R a7 ] , [ N g3 ]  The knight has done its job on hs. Now that the black pawn has advanced to [ h6 ] it is a bigger target than the f6- pawn so Carlsen prepares to redeploy his knight to fs.
 [ Q x a7 ] , [ B a8 ]  Of course black must save the bishop.
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ N f6 ]  The Petrov not a defense I face often or enjoy facing either I decide to see if my opponent will enter a more passive three or four knights game.
 [ d6 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ Q f6 ]  [ B e4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ Q x f4 ]  [ Q d1 ]  [ a x b5 ]  [ B x b5 ] , [ c5 ]  If white takes black can play [ Q e5 + ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ R c8 ] , [ O-O ]  Now black can take on [ h4 ] but there is no need to hurry.
 [ R b4 ]  [ R c6 ]  [ R b2 ]  [ R a c8 ]  [ R b c2 ]  [ K f7 ] , [ N h3 ]  A strange move! Surely this knight belongs over the other side of the board.
 [ h6 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ N x f6 ] , [ Q e2 ]  The thing is that this move doesn't develop as the Q is out sooner then other pieces. And since he's training it's not a good idea to deviate as noted unless you must. But this is not one of those times. Better was to develop his N or LSB and prepare to castle. However I wasn't going to fault him for this move because he is still going to castle which is a good idea to do. Come to think of it I really should've though since castling is going to be a blunder. Yet I decided to emphasize the most important because as I've learned from ION sometimes too much coaching can also be problematic and can cause the student to make a mistake which you don't want. So it's about finding the happy medium and knowing when to and not to give to do it.
 [ e6 ] , [ d5 ]  Now the point is that if [ e x d5 ] after [ R e1 ] white has so many threats over black's position that I just consider that it is not a desirable game for black. [ N x d5 ] [ c x d5 ] [ B b5 + + ] and only a miracle can save black. Similar destiny happened after cxd5. Now I had to opt among several moves considering both white pawns' take on the next move...
 [ Q x e5 ] , [ Q b3 + ]  If [ K h8 ] I'll set a trap for myself with a weak defence. Note that [ B f7 ] is impossible due to [ Q b8 + ] QxQ RxQ+ and black must lose the B to avoid mate.
 [ d x e5 ] , [ d x e5 ]  [ B x e5 ] wouldn't work because of [ f6 ] so this is the correct way to recapture. Now the queens are staring at each other.
 [ Q e8 ] , [ e x f6 ]  Again if 34. ... ~ 35. [ B x g7 ] wins.
 [ N x g5 ] , [ B h2 + ]  I called a check. Making sure if I move my queen. His king won't escape.
 [ B e4 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ B x b7 ] , [ Q x b7 ]  With the disappearance of Gruenfeld's last Bishop Alekhine now has an edge in mobility. His B can zip across the board faster than Gruenfeld's Knights can traipse.
 [ N h f4 ] , [ N x c2 + ]  I was also considering 20...[ [ g5 ] ] but decided that I shouldn't complicate the position. (And I was right according to the computer [ [ g5 ] ] is an inferior move.)
 [ R b8 ] , [ B c6 + ]  Obviously Hort reckons that his Bishop is a target so he aims to exchange it off. However it looks like an extreme loss of tempo when a bishop that has already moved five times (soon six) has to be exchanged off for one that will only have moved once! White could still play 9.[ Q x d4 ] here but would need to play [ a3 ] to have an escape hole for his bishop (9...[ B d7 ] or 9...[ N e7 ] and the Noah's Ark trap is renewed with [ c6 ] [ c5 ] and c4)
 [ Q f6 ] , [ a5 ]  Kind of wierd. Maybe looking to get the rook out [ Q f4 ] looking to park on b file maybe
 [ N x c1 ] , [ R x c1 ]  He's now in the most horrid of positions nearly all of which end in a checkmate. Once I move my knight out of the way that opens for a loss of rook and a check in one swoop.
 [ N g3 ]  [ Q f6 ]  [ N h5 ] , [ Q e7 ]  The manouver went ok but the target (to fork the black R on f7) was not reached. Nothing better than retire sigh!!!
 [ N b c6 ] , [ b4 ]  Have a look at Alekhine's aggression!! His pawns ride so quickly won't they? It clearly depicts his keenness for a rapid victory!!
 [ h3 ]  [ B x f3 ] , [ g x f3 ]  Why not Qxf3? The doubled pawn is weak.
 [ K c1 ]  [ Q e3 + ]  [ K b2 ]  [ R x e2 ]  [ R a3 ]  [ Q f2 ]  [ R a d3 ]  [ R e4 ]  [ R f1 ]  [ Q h2 ]  [ R h1 ]  [ Q d6 ]  [ c3 ]  [ R e2 + ]  [ K a1 ]  [ e5 ]  [ R h d1 ]  [ e4 ]  [ R d3 d2 ]  [ R x d2 ]  [ R x d2 ]  [ e3 ]  [ R e2 ]  [ Q g3 ]  [ Q f1 ]  [ R h8 ]  [ Q c1 ]  [ f4 ]  [ c4 ]  [ Q f3 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ R h2 ]  [ R f1 ]  [ Q g2 ]  [ Q b1 ]  [ e2 ]  [ R g1 ]  [ Q f2 ]  [ d5 ] , [ Q d4 + ]  
 [ d5 ] , [ c x d5 ]  In the style of Petrosain I opt to release the tension in the centre immedaitely.
 [ B x f5 ]  [ Q d2 ] , [ R e3 ]  ! Not wasting time. The two bishop have the strenght to keep the pawn if white take the rook. White will have a hard time to remove that pawn out of the way and to keep his structure.
 [ O-O ]  [ O-O ] , [ R e1 ]  I also considered 8.[ B g5 ] but it's not pinned. More importantly though is that I'm thinking along a long plan. And that's the potential for my [ e4 ] pawn to become a passer which is why I decided to centralize my Rook. Might not happen but what if this worked? Then I'd have a Rook behind a passed pawn which is very useful in the endgame and that is what I'm picturing here.
 [ N x e5 ] , [ N d7 ]  After the N's Exchange [ g4 ] will fall but is this a disadvantage for me or for my opponent?
 [ B x c3 + ] , [ b x c3 ]  Mission accomplished.
 [ B e7 ]  [ K h3 ]  [ K g7 ]  [ K g4 ]  [ K g6 ]  [ K h3 ]  [ K g5 ]  [ K g2 ]  [ K g4 ]  [ K h2 ]  [ B d6 + ]  [ K g2 ]  [ h3 + ]  [ K h1 ]  [ K f3 ]  [ K g1 ]  [ K e2 ]  [ K h1 ]  [ h2 ]  [ K g2 ]  [ K e3 ]  [ K h1 ]  [ B g3 ]  [ K g2 ]  [ K e4 ] , [ K h1 ]  
 [ b x c3 ] , [ R x b7 ]  Also captured the bishop but still seriously down on pieces.
 [ O-O-O ] , [ b4 ]  again to get more space on the queen side
 [ N f6 ]  [ B b2 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ B g2 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ Q c1 ]  [ Q d7 ]  [ d3 ]  [ R f e8 ]  [ N d2 ]  [ B c5 ] , [ N b5 ]  Despite White's odd opening favoring his bishops this is the first piece he's put across the board in the game.
 [ B e6 ] , [ B b6 ]  This move has considerable less sting now.
 [ d5 ] , [ f5 ]  2. …… [ f5 ] - curiouser and curiouser.
 [ K d2 ] , [ B x d3 ]  Another discovered attack is ready...
 [ B h4 ] , [ e5 ]  9. ..... [ e5 ] - at last a pawn break in the centre.
 [ N d5 + ]  [ K d7 ]  [ N f6 + ] , [ K e6 ]  No queens no open lines no white's dsb... I can play moves like this.
 [ B f5 ]  [ d3 ]  [ K d7 ]  [ R e1 ] , [ c5 ]  I was unsure what move to make before I settled on this. I want to bring my king to the queen side of the board where white has more pawns. I was worried at first but then noticed that after 17 [ N x c5 ] [ B x c5 ] 18 [ R x e5 ] [ R h e8 ] ensures that black cannot capture a bishop due to back rank mate.
 [ K d3 ]  [ K f7 ]  [ K e3 ]  [ K e7 ]  [ h4 ] , [ N c7 ]  36. ...... [ N c7 ] - supporting a possible pawn push to d5.
 [ R c8 ] , [ Q a4 ]  The Queen is misplaced here giving Black a strong advantage. Much better is 17. Qe4.
 [ Q e8 ]  [ B x b8 ]  [ R a x b8 ]  [ Q c5 ] , [ f6 ]  The next blunder... I thought i Take the Bishop and then I'll have a forkat C6... but this fork is no real fork sind black can escape while checking...
 [ d x c3 ]  [ b x c3 ]  [ B x c3 ] , [ R a d1 ]  After which my Knight is still under attack but my Rook is now attacked by the exact same piece. However this fork is just a nuisance as I now defend both with this move. The problem however is that I gave something away due to miscalculation.
 [ e x d4 ]  [ B x d4 ] , [ R b d8 ]  I thought that after the exchange I'll have [ K c3 ] to defend d4. But black was more poisoned.
 [ Q x d6 ] , [ Q g4 ]  A stupid move.. It leads to nothing. Better was 18. [ Q e2 ] followed by 19. Rf-c1.
 [ O-O ]  [ B g2 ] , [ d6 ]  An interesting move by Black as it stops White's knight on [ f3 ] coming to [ e5 ] but White can play [ d5 ] if he chooses to creating a powerful pawn near Black's territory. Of course Black could always move a pawn forward to challenge it but in this game we'll see that White does eventually move his pawn there but it will stay there for the better part of the game.
 [ N d6 ]  [ B c6 ]  [ N f7 ]  [ K h3 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ B d5 ]  [ N g6 ]  [ f3 ]  [ N f4 + ]  [ K g4 ]  [ N g6 ] , [ K h3 ]  Now I am thinking about getting my King to the queenside via the first rank.
 [ N x g6 ]  [ h x g6 ] , [ c3 ]  I play [ c3 ] to prevent the knight from advancing and to follow up with a gradual queen side attack.
 [ Q x f3 ]  [ N x d5 ] , [ Q x d5 ]  [ B x e7 ] might have been better leaving black with a knight rather than a bishop although being behind 2 pawns perhaps white should have pulled the bishop back rather than exchaning pieces.
 [ O-O ]  [ h6 ]  [ Q h3 ]  [ Q x h3 ]  [ N x h3 ]  [ N b d7 ]  [ f4 ]  [ K d8 ]  [ f5 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N d2 ]  [ B c5 + ]  [ K h1 ]  [ N g4 ]  [ N b3 ]  [ B b6 ]  [ c3 ] , [ N d f6 ]  17. At this time I decided that I want to keep my kn near the center of the broad and work them in combination with many options in the center of the broad. My opponent kn are to the side.
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e6 ] , [ N c3 ]  4.[ N f3 ] is also playable but gives black a chance to play the sharp Blumenfeld Gambit 4...b5!? I prefer the white side of the Benoni to the white side of the Blumenfeld.
 [ B x e4 ] , [ B x e4 ]  Black is a piece up
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ] , [ g6 ]  The king's indian defence. I've recently started playing [ d4 ] in most of my games as white and this opening sequence seems to be the most popular response on gameknot. It usually provides a tough and tactical game which is probably why I've lost so many of my recent games as white!!
 [ B x c6 ]  [ R b8 ] , [ b3 ]  not allowing any attacking chances to my opponent
 [ Q f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d3 ]  [ B g4 ] , [ B g5 ]  Maybe [ h3 ] was better but thought the Q was too advanced.
 [ K g7 ]  [ R b8 ] , [ N f4 ]  Another blow for White. Now [ N d3 ] is a deadly threat much more important than a pawn Queening.
 [ K g8 ]  [ N x f8 ]  [ c2 ] , [ R f1 ]  Oho it's going to be like that is it? Well can't let him have his queen that won't do.
 [ B f6 ] , [ a4 + ]  Merely postponing the inevitable.
 [ O-O ] , [ h4 ]  I do not like the idea of h4. If white plays [ h5 ] black can respond with h6. The gain of space is also fictional white pawns on the kingside are too weak to control anything.
 [ B x d4 ] , [ Q f3 ]  This is another mistake losing a pawn. It seems my opponent is starting to slip.
 [ N x e5 ]  [ d x e4 ] , [ d x e4 ]  Center domination for White.
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ] , [ c4 ]  I didn't expect this move. I think it would be better to get King's pawn 3 ... de
 [ B e4 ] , [ B d3 ]  trading and getting my queen to a better square
 [ B x g7 ] , [ R d1 + ]  At this position this is what i saw after much concentration.If i would do open check to [ B f6 + ] i would have solved f5.This was a discovery got excited with.I also knew black was putting his Q in a white square to avoid discovered check
 [ R x f8 + ]  [ K h7 ]  [ R x f7 ]  [ Q x e5 ] , [ B c3 ]  this should do the trick...
 [ h5 ] , [ g x h5 ]  Think this is the best move as I can defend the [ h7 ] pawn quite well and after [ Q x h5 ] I can pick up his d-pawn
 [ R a1 ] , [ Q e4 ]  Later mozart 28 said "In the previous game I felt that you should have won the game. I thought your mistake was at move 35 when I had to offer the Queen swap. I thought you had a superior position if you had taken my Queen then. But hey hind sight is always 20/20!"
 [ Q d2 ]  [ Q c8 ] , [ R a c1 ]  Perhaps the other rook is better since it gives opportunities to play [ a4 ] still. But I was worried about the bishop eying [ a1 ] and thought this was the time to move it anyway
 [ N x g3 ]  [ Q h4 ]  [ N f5 + ]  [ K d7 ]  [ N x h4 ]  [ R x h4 ]  [ g3 ]  [ R h3 ] , [ Q g4 + ]  1-0
 [ B x c4 ] , [ a6 ]  Preventing the advancing of my knight but Ive got a plan to offer some bait that will eventuate with black losing his rook with 11.[ Q a4 ] [ b5 ] 12.Bx[ b5 ] ax[ b5 ] 13.Qxa1.
 [ N e5 + ]  [ K c7 ] , [ B x e7 ]  [ Q a7 + ] instead forces the king back to the 8th rank where RxP6 eliminates the threat to the knight.
 [ R h g8 ]  [ f x g5 ]  [ B x g5 ] , [ N x g5 ]  I realized that I had to exchange the bishop first but I didn't realize that...
 [ b3 ]  [ R h2 ] , [ B b5 # ]  CHECKMATE
 [ B c2 ]  [ R e8 ] , [ R c1 ]  Both sides have mobilised a rook onto half-open files - Black has his on the e-file and White on the c-file.
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ c4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ N b d7 ]  [ e3 ]  [ c6 ]  [ a3 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B d3 ]  [ d x c4 ]  [ B x c4 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ B x e7 ]  [ Q x e7 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ N d5 f6 ]  [ N g3 ]  [ c5 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N b6 ]  [ B a2 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ g6 ]  [ R c1 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ Q e2 ]  [ R a c8 ]  [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ K g7 ]  [ h3 ]  [ h6 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ B x e6 ]  [ Q x e6 ]  [ Q a5 ]  [ N c4 ]  [ Q x a7 ]  [ N x b2 ]  [ R x c8 ]  [ R x c8 ]  [ Q x b7 ]  [ N c4 ]  [ Q b4 ]  [ R a8 ]  [ R a1 ]  [ Q c6 ]  [ a4 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ Q d6 ]  [ Q x c4 ]  [ Q x e5 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ N d6 ]  [ Q c1 ]  [ Q f6 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ R x e4 ]  [ R b8 ]  [ R e2 ]  [ R a8 ]  [ R a2 ]  [ R a5 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ Q a6 ]  [ Q c3 + ]  [ K h7 ]  [ R d2 ]  [ Q b6 ]  [ R d7 ]  [ Q b1 + ]  [ K h2 ]  [ Q b8 + ]  [ g3 ]  [ R f5 ]  [ Q d4 ]  [ Q e8 ]  [ R d5 ]  [ R f3 ]  [ h4 ]  [ Q h8 ]  [ Q b6 ]  [ Q a1 ]  [ K g2 ]  [ R f6 ]  [ Q d4 ]  [ Q x d4 ]  [ R x d4 ]  [ K g7 ]  [ a5 ]  [ R a6 ]  [ R d5 ]  [ R f6 ]  [ R d4 ] , [ R a6 ]  This is the textbook demonstration of how to exploit an extra outside passed pawn in a rook ending with the stronger side's rook behind the passed pawn. If the white rook were on [ a6 ] and the black rook on [ a4 ] the game would be a draw although it is not as easy to defend as once thought as mentioned in the next example but as it is White is winning by force. The ending is also of great historical significance because this was game 34 of the AlekhineCapablanca world championship match. Alekhine led 5-3 in decisive games needing six wins to take the world title so this was the endgame which dethroned the great "invincible" Cuban and gave the chess world its fourth world champion.
 [ Q f8 + ]  [ K h7 ] , [ Q c5 ]  You WON't exchange would you? :-)
 [ N f6 ]  [ g3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ B g2 ] , [ N c6 ]  Here Black is threatening the central boost [ e5 ] so I had to think about if I wanted to allow it and castle or if I should play [ d4 ] and stop it.
 [ N c6 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ a6 ] , [ B x c6 + ]  Forced to capture. If I retreat back toward [ f1 ] I lose the queen. If I retreat to [ a4 ] black plays 6. ... [ b5 ] and now I have to decide whether to lose bishop or queen.
 [ B a5 + ]  [ b6 ] , [ B x b6 + ]  trying to break into his undeveloped areas
 [ R f b1 ]  [ N x e4 + ]  [ d x e4 ] , [ R f d8 + ]  Black had to sacrifice a knight to create the escape route but it looks like this worked.
 [ d x e5 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ N g4 ]  [ B g5 ] , [ f6 ]  I think [ N e7 ] or [ Q c8 ] would have been better here. The computer sees nothing wrong with this move though it gives white a slight advantage.
 [ N c3 ] , [ N x c3 ]  An earlier exchange on [ c3 ] with the black bishop would have been silly as this piece is very powerful for black and would give white the bishop pair. Now however Black can exchange the knight which while a powerful centralized piece exchanges away one of the few developed white pieces and doubles up White's pawns. White's position is in trouble now.
 [ B e7 ] , [ B x f6 ]  do you think capturing with pawn [ g x f6 ] for the exchange is better?
 [ K h1 ]  [ K f2 ]  [ K h2 ]  [ g4 ] , [ K h1 ]  Now if Black is careless ...[ g3 ] gives stalemate so...
 [ B x b2 ]  [ e5 ] , [ B x e5 ]  I'm still not sure why he did that but OK.
 [ N g5 ] , [ N x f4 ]  Or so I thought. Well if I can't drive it away I can drive it all the way to the discarded piece pile. Now black's knight on [ g5 ] is en prise and must be saved.
 [ c5 ]  [ e3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ d x c5 ]  [ e6 ]  [ b4 ]  [ a5 ] , [ c3 ]  ! The best move in my opinion.
 [ N a6 ] , [ a3 ]  15. [ a3 ] - preventing Nb4.
 [ B g2 ] , [ d5 ]  Ok Black could have played [ [ d5 ] ] or d6. Now he have played [ [ d5 ] ] it's a full Stone Wall defense which I do know from before matches.
 [ h5 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ h x g6 + ]  [ h x g6 ] , [ K d2 ]  The game is very even.
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ B f4 ]  Makes he think. [ N h5 ] right away is good for black and if white retires black too and nothing happened. If [ B g3 ] NxB hxN the loss of the dsb is compensated by the h semi-open column.
 [ K h4 ] , [ R g4 + ]  I'm just following the king.
 [ N c6 ] , [ a3 ]  white is playing in a defensive posture at this point
 [ e x f6 ]  [ N x f6 ] , [ B g5 ]  With ideas of Nd5.
 [ R b2 + ]  [ K c5 ] , [ R f7 ]  A mistake which saves me from checkmate.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ N g e7 ]  !? Simple development... apart from this move! I don't know whether [ N f6 ] may have been better here but if I had played that it would have looked like a 'boring' Four Knights opening from my side of the board. [ N e7 ] is passive but solid enough to be playable and there's always the [ g6 ] square to move to!
 [ h x g4 ]  [ R e4 ]  [ R x h2 ] , [ K g1 ]  If 34. [ R x g4 ] [ R h1 + ] 35. [ K f2 ] [ R b1 ] and White must defend his Q-side pawns.
 [ K c1 ]  [ Q x e7 ] , [ R x b5 ]  Again going after material instead of playing good offense (or defense). [ N d2 ] or even [ c3 ] would have probably held the game and the advantage for white. Instead he takes the knight and goes back up by 8 "points" (but of course chess is not a game of points is it?). BTW white was smart in capturing with the rook because [ Q x b5 ] would have allowed [ Q e1 ] mate. Hmm. What's going to happen? Here's where it gets REALLY interesting. I have the initiative so I have to take it.
 [ R d5 d6 + ]  [ R x d6 ]  [ R x d6 + ]  [ K x d6 ]  [ f4 ]  [ K e6 ]  [ K f2 ]  [ K f5 ]  [ K f3 ]  [ a5 ]  [ g4 + ]  [ K f6 ] , [ c3 ]  Black resigned.
 [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ B b5 + ]  [ N c6 ]  [ c3 ]  [ a6 ] , [ B a4 ]  White normally exchanges the bishop the retreat allows black to expand on the queenside with tempo...
 [ K f7 ]  [ K d1 ]  [ R h8 ]  [ R x b2 ]  [ c x b2 ]  [ R b1 ] , [ R x h3 ]  according to the computer this is a blunder. Better was to play [ R b8 ] and preserve the [ b2 ] pawn. I agree.
 [ B x c6 ] , [ K x c6 ]  33. .... [ K x d6 ] - so white trades but I now have a K & P ending one pawn to the good and now Henry is Moving on Up!
 [ K g7 ]  [ c3 ] , [ b5 ]  taking space away from the LSB
 [ R x f8 ] , [ N f3 ]  I use the tempo to get my knight to a better square. I want my rook on [ f1 ] and have time to get there without worsening my pawn structure on the queenside when the black a pawn takes my b pawn.
 [ B x c3 ] , [ b x c3 ]  Double up finally happens.
 [ O-O ]  [ B e3 ]  [ N b d7 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ e5 ]  [ O-O-O ] , [ e x d4 ]  The main idea here was to create an open line for my bishop. I knew the opponent was going to exploit it too but I thought my defense where more resilient.
 [ g4 ]  [ g5 ] , [ B x g5 ]  ...but what was I thinking there...?
 [ c6 ]  [ e4 ]  [ O-O ] , [ N e1 ]  I was unsure of White's reason for this move. But the wasted tempo gives Black the chance to gain space.
 [ B h1 ]  [ N x g4 ]  [ h x g4 ] , [ Q x g4 + ]  Not overly sure I like this tactic. Black gives up his Knight for two Pawns and a strong attack on the White King. However it did have the desired affect. I panicked.
 [ d6 ] , [ R d8 ]  Game note: "35...[ R d8 ] then get the B down to g6-[ e7 ] or something like that"
 [ K c3 ]  [ e5 ]  [ d x e5 ] , [ f x e5 ]  35. ....... [ f x e5 ] - and now another forced pawn trade.
 [ R x e6 ] , [ Q f5 + ]  ...only to be blindsided by this move winning the Rook.
 [ R d2 x d8 ]  [ R x d8 ]  [ R x d8 ]  [ K x d8 ] , [ f3 ]  Which allows Carl to open up one of his pawns.
 [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ d x e6 ]  [ f x e6 ]  [ e3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ B x e7 ]  [ Q x e7 ]  [ a3 ]  [ O-O ] , [ B d3 ]  not bad position + initiative !
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B b4 ] , [ e3 ]  I think this is the soundest continuation for white. The older 4. [ Q c2 ] prematurely activates the queen. 4. [ B d2 ] is too defensive and places the bishop on a poor square. 4. [ a3 ] forces a retreat or exchange but neglects development.
 [ N x g4 + ]  [ K d4 ]  [ a5 ]  [ e5 ] , [ K f5 ]  ?? -- Amazingly this rather natural-looking move almost loses by force. The correct move was 35. ...Nh6.
 [ Q x d6 ]  [ e5 ]  [ Q x d5 ]  [ e x f6 ]  [ Q d4 + ] , [ K h1 ]  13 mins. remaining.
 [ Q e4 ] , [ c5 ]  Regrettably 15...[ N b8 ] looked like the only way to save the pawn. 16. [ N x f7 ] Rxf7; 17. [ B x b8 ] leaves the knight on [ g4 ] hanging so 17...Nf6; 18. [ Q x e6 ] [ B c8 ] is necessary (otherwise 19. Ne5.); 19. [ Q d6 ] [ R d7 ] and the position looks complicated but it also looks pretty equal.
 [ f3 ]  [ g x f3 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ B c4 + ]  [ K g7 ]  [ Q e2 ] , [ B x h4 + ]  10. [ B x h4 + ] - black is doing pretty well here. He is still 3 points up in material and now Henry must give up the right to castle.
 [ e5 ]  [ Q b3 ] , [ b5 ]  ha! he thinks I'm after his queen side
 [ N f6 ] , [ K h1 ]  The pawn is immune in this position due to the knight pin that would result. So I take the time to get my king off the black bishop's dark squares. So far so good. An immediate [ R e1 ] might have been better here.
 [ R c1 ]  [ R a b3 ]  [ R x c6 ]  [ R b3 x b2 ]  [ R c c2 ]  [ R x c2 ]  [ R x c2 ]  [ R b1 + ]  [ K h2 ]  [ R d1 ]  [ R a2 ]  [ R x d4 ] , [ R x a6 ]  We've reached an equal endgame here. I was so relieved to get level that I offered my opponent a draw. My draw offer was rejected.
 [ B e6 + ] , [ K b8 ]  White re-positions bishop to [ e6 ]  [ O-O ] , [ N d7 ]  White castles. Black retreats [ N d7 ]  [ N d5 ] , [ N d e5 ]  White moves [ N d5 ] Black moves [ N e5 ]  [ Q d4 ] , [ h5 ]  White queen repositions black advances pawn to H5
 [ d6 ]  [ Q g8 + ]  [ K d7 ] , [ Q x f7 + ]  Finally black loses the rook and remains with a clearly lost position.
 [ N f6 ]  [ e3 ] , [ Q e5 ]  Pushed the Queen back a little but I don't have much of a plan. Considering putting the white bishop into the field to open the bottom rank for castling.
 [ N f3 ] , [ b6 ]  Unlike normal I go with pushing out a pawn on the side.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ B c4 ]  Personally I prefer 3. [ B b5 ] for more of a Ruy Lopez approach but this is a good alternative and accomplishes the same goal: develops the piece and prepares for castle. As Hicks points out and as I tell my over-the-board students: the best opening moves accomplish multiple goals!
 [ N f3 ] , [ R g8 ]  Now my [ f7 ] pawn is hanging and after Bx[ f7 ] my rook on [ g8 ] will be under attack. But he saw the threat Bxh3.
 [ N b5 ] , [ N c5 ]  18....[ N c5 ] should lose. On 19. [ B g3 ] B has [ Q g5 ] hitting the loose R and then after W's move [ B e5 ] to guard the diagonal and the threatened fork on d6. But I think B is lost after 19. Q x [ [ [ c3 ] ] ] Q x [ [ [ c3 ] ] ] 19. N x [ [ [ c3 ] ] ] N x [ b3 ] then a rook move to break the pin. B can either capture the N or move his own now threatened N. Either way he ends up losing a piece for 2 pawns. W's dark-squared B is very strong almost as strong as B's rooks and B should prevail without much difficulty. 19.[ Q e3 ] ends all of these complications and B is just better.
 [ R x a4 ] , [ N d7 ]  Your Rook is hanging too. It is over.
 [ f6 + ]  [ K c7 ]  [ N e x g5 ] , [ h x g5 ]  So far the game was going according to my "plan" when I sacrificed the exchange on move 27. I had the idea of g5-[ g4 ] on the next move. The next move for white made things easy.
 [ R x e1 ]  [ N x b5 ]  [ R e2 + ]  [ K b3 ] , [ R x b2 + ]  I enjoyed this game because of the great comeback and it also taught me to stay away from the queen gambit. A thanks to my opponent for this thrilling game.
 [ R x f4 ]  [ R x f4 ] , [ Q h5 ]  Critically clearing the way for the [ R a1 ] to get into action but this Queen is actually on really thin ice--she must be exceptionally careful not to get stuck on Black's side of the board with nowhere to go.
 [ K a7 ] , [ R e8 ]  Not sure why I did this; I was thinking that Black would take the bait and exchange rooks so that there wouldn't be any more protection for the king in that area.
 [ R x e7 ] , [ g6 ]  Naturally - this pawn is now protected by the bishop and is immune to my rook. It does have its use on the seventh rank in that it ties down Henry and if my own king can get over there material equality and even mate could follow! (King on [ d6 ] rook on [ e8 ] and no [ f6 ] knight for example)
 [ c3 ] , [ d4 ]  Now I simultaneously attack two pawns...
 [ K x g7 ] , [ N f5 + ]  Game officially over. I thought the events leading to this royal fork were quite interesting; as this was definitely a rollercoaster chess game and if not for a few blunders on my opponent's behalf I would have been made into minced-meat. But such is the unpredictable beauty of our glorious game. We played on for another move or so.
 [ N x d3 ]  [ Q x d3 ]  [ Q a1 + ]  [ K h2 ] , [ Q g7 ]  Back to defend the rook and pawn.
 [ N c3 ]  [ e6 ] , [ f4 ]  [ N c3 ] indicated a Closed varaition but after [ f4 ] I'm already looking to exploit the weakened King position.
 [ B e4 ] , [ R h2 ]  A key square for my rook as you will see.
 [ B h5 + ] , [ K f8 ]  Of course 6...[ g6 ] falls flat dropping an extra pawn for no benefit. The text invites White to win an exchange with the fork on [ f7 ] at the cost of development and tempo.
 [ e x f3 ]  [ e ]  [ p ] , [ + ]  !!!
 [ B e6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ Q d7 ] , [ d3 ]  This is most ideal situation for black as his entire development except castling is complete. At present their is no threat to Black's king and hence Black has an option to develop the game further and do the castling either at Kingside or Queen side depending on situation. White's Bishop and Knight at [ c1 ] and [ b1 ] are not yet developed. In fact white always need to maintain the first move advantage.
 [ Q x e8 ] , [ Q g7 # ]  
 [ R x e8 ]  [ B x e8 ] , [ N c4 ]  ! Forcing the bishop to go to [ c1 ] white's attack is completely annihilated.
 [ Q x c6 ]  [ e5 ] , [ N d7 ]  Further cramping black's position although I still haven't found a way to realise a material advantage. Any comments on where I could have done better thus far would be appreciated.
 [ a x b5 ]  [ R x c4 ]  [ R f3 ] , [ K g6 ]  Blk improves his pos
 [ K e6 ] , [ R x f3 ]  settling the score...
 [ K d4 ]  [ c4 ]  [ K c3 ] , [ K a4 ]  ...and Black resigned here knowing he couldn't stop all my pawns.
 [ N b4 ]  [ B f3 ] , [ K c7 ]  17. ..... [ K c7 ] - Henry steps out of the concealed line of Bob's lsb on f3.
 [ B g3 ] , [ Q c5 ]  The final nail in black's coffin. Black tries to gain some play on the queenside but the queen is needed for the king's defence. Probably the best idea here is ...[ R a e8 ] putting some more pressure on e4.
 [ R d c1 ]  [ R x c4 ]  [ Q x c4 ]  [ Q e8 ]  [ e4 ]  [ N e7 ]  [ K g2 ]  [ Q b5 ]  [ f3 ] , [ Q x c4 ]  Continuously working toward a Queenside that required Whites Kings assistance. At this point in time I thought there would be a game of cat-and-mouse between Blacks Knight and Rook and Whites Bishop Rook and King. I didn't know who would win that battle and didn't know if Black would be able to take control of the Kingside as a result of it.
 [ g3 ] , [ B f6 ]  White does not exchange. A clear error in judgement I think. Black moves his DSB back to safety
 [ c x d6 ] , [ N c4 ]  attacking the pawn pretty obvious
 [ Q d2 ] , [ B b7 ]  Black gained another tempo when White declined to exchange Qs.
 [ R a4 ] , [ R e6 + ]  this was a fun combination-- if king goes to [ d7 ] trying to stay in the center I get Bb5! if [ K c7 ] I can march my king to [ c5 ] protecting my pawn.
 [ a x b6 ]  [ b x a6 ]  [ R x a6 ] , [ R c8 ]  only move because of otherwise Ra8+!
 [ e3 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ B d3 ]  the risk is [ d4 ] [ d5 ]  [ B b4 ]  [ c3 ] , [ B d6 ]  now he can move [ c3 ] [ c4 ] but it whould mean a lost time for him while i had develop my bishop...will he do it ?
 [ f x g5 ]  [ R x f2 ]  [ K x f2 ] , [ Q h4 + ]  Avoiding [ Q x g5 ] [ R g1 ] winning the queen.
 [ R e3 ] , [ h5 ]  Somehow I thought this was a simple choice but I was wrong.
 [ f x e3 ] , [ Q x e3 ]  black wins a pawn and has a queen on e3! seems very serious. White has deployed his pieces a little more though.
 [ B x f6 ]  [ N x f6 ]  [ a3 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ Q b3 ] , [ B e7 ]  (JC) This is not the logical place for the B which should have been posted at Q3.
 [ a4 ]  [ R d b7 ] , [ e4 ]  Not a particularly good move but then the position is such it's difficult to see the best plan for Black
 [ N x d4 ]  [ g x h5 ]  [ R e3 ] , [ B x e5 ]  Wasting whites tempo but giving up my important DSB.
 [ N x d6 ]  [ Q x d6 ] , [ Q e2 ]  clearing the back rank and not giving away where he will castle
 [ B d4 ]  [ B e1 ] , [ Q d5 ]  31. [ Q d5 ] White's N is pinned Black is freeing up his pieces and gray clouds are forming.
 [ e3 ] , [ d5 ]  Advancing a center pawn. Black's aim is to obviously control the center.
 [ d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ N b d7 ]  3. ....... [ N b d7 ] - this move is the start of the Lion.
 [ B e2 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ O-O ] , [ O-O ]  Black appears slightly ahead on development at this stage thanks to White's exposed Q having moved twice and all other Q-side pieces still on their home squares. However Black has made one extra pawn move and not yet developed his Q. Neither side has any significant weaknesses at present though Black has the possibility of getting a fork on [ c2 ] and White may be able to exploit the weakness on b6.
 [ K d7 ]  [ K f3 ]  [ K e8 ]  [ K g4 ] , [ K f7 ]  81. ...... [ K f7 ] - Henry will certainly stop the enemy king in his tracks.
 [ d x e5 ]  [ f x e5 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ N e4 ] , [ N x f3 ]  There were a few options to take here For whatever reason I cant remember I went with this one.
 [ Q x d7 ]  [ Q x g2 ] , [ R f1 ]  forced...
 [ d5 ]  [ c4 ] , [ d x c4 ]  I've noticed recently that many players offer this pawn. I have taken it each time without hesitation and am yet to regret it. I'm sure there is a by the book reason but I try to stay away from the book. I know it won't be long and a player will teach me why this move is not preferred.
 [ h3 ]  [ Q e5 ] , [ K h2 ]  kh2? Moving from one unsafe diagonal to another.
 [ B x b5 ] , [ Q c7 ]  White cannot caslte since [ R a1 ] and his queen is trapped.
 [ K e7 ] , [ Q x g7 ]  Is a nice ending what a rook loop!!!
 [ R x d4 ]  [ N x d5 + ]  [ R x d5 ]  [ R x f7 + ]  [ R d7 ]  [ R x d7 + ] , [ K x d7 ]  22. ...... [ K x d7 ] - ..... after the smoke has cleared I find myself down a piece for a pawn. I could resign here but my eyes keep focussed on that 2 - 1 kingside pawn majority. Maybe if I could create a passer over there I might stand some ghost of a chance. Firstly some king safety I create a luft for Henry on [ a2 ] which is a square not controlled by dmaestro's dsb.
 [ N x e2 + ] , [ N x e2 ]  ! The correct move bringing the knight over to the kingside even though Shredder prefers Qxe2.
 [ N x a5 + ] , [ K c3 ]  Blunder (which of course I didn't see). [ h4 ] 65. [ K x b2 ] [ h3 ] 66. [ K d1 ] [ K f4 ] 67. [ B h5 ] [ h2 ] and thanks to the 'd' pawn 0-1.
 [ e5 ]  [ d x e5 ] , [ N x e5 ]  16. Nxe5? - This was the losing move. Marin stated in a pm in response to my resignation note that I should have taken with the f pawn. I did consider it but it would have left the f pawn an isolani so I thought that it was better to keep my pawn structure together. Unfortunately after Marin's next move the irony is that pawn is to fall anyway together with a whole lot more.
 [ c3 ] , [ N f6 ]  I belatedly provide some support to my [ d4 ] pawn and bring out pawn to c3. Black now develops his g knight to f6.
 [ e x d6 ]  [ e ]  [ p ]  [ Q x d6 ] , [ B d3 ]  This is a good diagonal for my bishop since it aims toward the kingside for when Black castles kingside. If Black decides to castle queenside then it's suicide since there are two open files on the queenside.
 [ R d7 ]  [ R h8 + ] , [ R d8 ]  I'm still angry about this move. Not as angry as 23... Rd8?? but [ K c7 ] or [ K b7 ] were both superior plays since this move guarantees the loss of the a pawn.
 [ Q x c5 ]  [ B x c5 ]  [ f x e6 ]  [ f x e6 ]  [ B g2 ] , [ N x e5 ]  an oversight by White? Giving up a central pawn is becoming a worse and worse idea the more I play chess. If anything one on the flank would be sacrifice to save the center.
 [ Q x f3 ]  [ Q x f3 ] , [ g x f3 ]  Incidentally doubles another pawn.
 [ N c7 ] , [ B c6 ]  White should take [ N x b5 ] but he is scared about his king behind so...
 [ R e8 ]  [ R f c7 + ]  [ K b8 ] , [ g3 ]  against [ R e1 ] and mate...
 [ c3 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ b4 ]  [ B e7 ] , [ B b5 ]  Back black off then position my bishop on b5.
 [ Q c2 ]  [ Q e6 + ]  [ Q e2 ]  [ Q d5 ]  [ R c8 + ]  [ K h7 ]  [ Q c2 + ]  [ g6 ] , [ Q c3 ]  threatening Q/R-[ h8 ] but what has White overlooked?
 [ R d8 ] , [ f3 ]  white is attacking Black's last center pawn. imho. white is to be preferred. the rook will have an open line once White castles. but White does not need to castle anymore. very strange position.
 [ B e3 ]  [ B g7 ] , [ f3 ]  7. [ f3 ] Preventing [ N g4 ] and an odd exchange between Knight and Bishop on e3. White wants to eliminate the [ g7 ] black Bishop and he needs his dark-square Bishop.
 [ Q f5 ] , [ Q d6 ]  The end of Black's combination. Basically I'm trading 2 pawns for a piece but by doing so I'm exposing my King. That means it should be a while before I can begin to convert my slight material advantage into a full point.
 [ N f6 ] , [ B d5 ]  (?) Just a waste of time.
 [ N x f3 ]  [ Q x f3 ]  [ b6 ]  [ N a3 ]  [ R d8 ]  [ R a d1 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ N c4 ]  [ Q c5 ]  [ N x e3 ] , [ f x e3 ]  That I hadn't thought through properly either.
 [ h x g6 ]  [ K f6 ]  [ K x a3 ]  [ K x g6 ]  [ a5 ]  [ K f6 ]  [ K b3 ]  [ K e7 ]  [ a4 ]  [ K d8 ]  [ a3 ]  [ c8 = Q ]  [ B x c8 ]  [ K x c8 ] , [ a2 ]  white resigned
 [ Q x c3 ]  [ B x c6 ]  [ N e2 ]  [ Q h4 ] , [ Q g3 ]  Qg3!? I think white can be more ambitious here because after the recapture he has a pawn on [ e5 ] and nothing else.
 [ R g x g7 + ]  [ K f8 ]  [ R d x b7 ] , [ R x b7 ]  
 [ N f6 ] , [ R f b1 ]  21. [ R f b1 ] - lining up against the BK - I now have the idea of breaking up the black pawn shield around the BK and let him have it with both cannons!
 [ e4 ] , [ N f6 ]  the Alekhine defense: not something you want to present me on a hot Friday afternoon; especially not with a couple of beers in my system...
 [ e4 ]  [ B x c1 ]  [ R x c1 ] , [ c6 ]  creating yet another weak square! its [ d6 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ b6 ]  ? again a waste of time
 [ Q b3 ] , [ R a b8 ]  13. ....... [ R a b8 ] - to defend hanging b pawn.
 [ R x c6 ] , [ b x c6 ]  I bring flank pawn closer to center improving its value
 [ R g2 ]  [ B f3 ]  [ h4 ]  [ B x g2 + ]  [ K h2 ] , [ N g4 # ]  
 [ c4 ]  [ g6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ B g7 ]  The King's Indian is a hypermodern opening where Black deliberately allows White control of the centre with his pawns with the view to subsequently challenge it with the moves ...[ e5 ] or ...c5. Until the mid-1930s it was generally regarded as highly suspect but the analysis and play of three strong Soviet players in particular—Alexander Konstantinopolsky Isaac Boleslavsky and David Bronstein—helped to make the defence much more respected and popular. It is a dynamic opening exceptionally complex and a favourite of former world champions Garry Kasparov Bobby Fischer and Mikhail Tal with prominent grandmasters Viktor Korchnoi Miguel Najdorf Efim Geller John Nunn Svetozar Gligorić Wolfgang Uhlmann and Ilya Smirin having also contributed much to the theory and practice of this opening. In the early 2000s the opening's popularity suffered after Vladimir Kramnik scored excellent results against it so much so that even Kasparov gave up the opening after relentless losses to Kramnik. However Kramnik himself won a fine game on the black side of the KID in 2012 and current top players Hikaru Nakamura Teimour Radjabov and Ding Liren all play the opening.
 [ K h1 ]  [ Q x c4 ]  [ Q f5 ]  [ Q b4 ]  [ Q f2 ]  [ Q d6 ]  [ Q f5 ] , [ b5 ]  An ambitious move which looks good OTB but if he had time to think about it [ e5 ] would of been more then enough compensation for the exchange.
 [ K g1 ] , [ R h5 ]  Target: Two rook in the h-column threatening the bishop winning time. Con un objetivo: Doblar las torres en h ganando el tiempo con el ataque al alfil indefenso.
 [ h5 ] , [ h4 ]  Relieving the pressure.
 [ e5 ]  [ d5 ] , [ N e7 ]  In fact here spider777 seems to be getting impatient and trying to force something into happening. I know the feeling and I used to be the same way especially when the center of the board is all congested. Just trying to chip away at something. Mame something happen. These days I tend to find it is not the end of the world to let a congested board hang around for a while.
 [ R c7 ] , [ f6 ]  32. ...... [ f6 ] - Bob pushes the f pawn out of the way but his [ e6 ] pawn will be hanging once the h pawn drops off.
 [ h4 ] , [ f4 ]  Wastes a move.
 [ Q x b5 ] , [ R a b8 ]  Defends the bishop and threatens a discovered attack with Bxg2.
 [ N x c6 ] , [ B x c6 ]  recaptures with bishop a goood move.
 [ a6 ] , [ B a4 ]  Capture would be stronger as it allows me to develpe. Also a second bishop move in the first 4 moves.
 [ Q x e5 ] , [ h4 ]  h4?? is also bad rook attacked you see it??
 [ N c3 ] , [ N f6 ]  i thought this was weak because it allows [ e4 ] which removes the knight and blocks the bishop in
 [ d x e4 ] , [ N x e4 ]  Looking to force some exchanges.
 [ B c5 ] , [ N b d2 ]  i would have preferred [ N c3 ]  [ N d5 ] , [ Q e2 ]  more protection on the e pawn
 [ K h7 ] , [ h5 ]  And that's why despite not losing a pawn Goryachkina as I described earlier is breaking through. It's of even more use now then earlier as this is similar to how charleshiggie won a tournament game against brigadecommander which I annotated a couple of years back. In fact that's the reason why Janet ultimately resigned.
 [ R e2 ]  [ f x e4 ]  [ R x e4 ]  [ Q c6 ]  [ g4 ] , [ B f5 ]  ??? Just a dumb mistake - I failed to notice that the queen would have a check available (thus saving the rook from eminent death).............I'm just conceding a portion of my advantage for very little gain here.
 [ B g2 ]  [ d6 ] , [ N e2 ]  Consistently carrying out his plan of development. But Black takes the opportunity here for an early strike in the centre - before completing his K-side development.
 [ d6 ]  [ Q c8 ] , [ c4 ]  29. ...... [ c4 ] - preparing a Q invasion on d5.
 [ B a2 ] , [ h5 ]  I move to get my rook into position NOTE: at this point the game is paused for a few hours due to white going offline
 [ N x e5 ] , [ Q e7 ]  This is where things change a little.
 [ B d3 ] , [ B x d3 ]  Better BxN I hoped to be able to take [ g x f3 ] in order to open some potentially useful lines. Wihtout much hope to be truthful...
 [ B h4 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ N e5 ] , [ N b d7 ]  P-[ a6 ] with the idea of c6-[ c5 ] or B-[ h7 ] are plans that need to be looked at.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ] , [ d4 ]  Centre counter should give white open lines to attack with and better centre control
 [ K x d2 ]  [ Q x f2 + ] , [ K d1 ]  Only thing: I must be careful he cannot fork K and [ f4 ] unles my Q can interpose safely. I don't know if it was possible at all but surely not with this move!
 [ R h b1 ]  [ b5 ]  [ a4 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ a x b5 ] , [ a x b5 ]  23. ...... [ a x b5 ] - Afro gets rid of his weakie a pawn and I now have two weakie pawns on the d column and the b column giving Fou Leblanc a lot of work to do. Fou Leblanc therefore becomes a "bad" bishop tied to defending pawns on his own squares.
 [ R h3 ]  [ h6 ] , [ g5 ]  Alternative variation: 22. [ B x g6 ] [Doesn't wo rk as well because it gives black time to play [ Q d5 + ] and [ Q d7 ] which helps defend [ g7 ] now that the [ f7 ] pawn has moved. After this black can try for [ c4 ] to try to trade off the dark square bishop that can be used in the attack.]
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ] , [ N f3 ]  King's Knight Opening.
 [ R x d8 ]  [ R x d8 + ]  [ K h7 ] , [ K f2 ]  You needed to play [ R d1 ] to stop ther advancing [ c3 ]  [ c2 ] , [ K g3 ]  This is not going anywhere. If you are to delay mate you should consider what is coming now [ c1 = Q ] and [ Q g5 ] and [ R h4 ]  [ c1 = Q ]  [ K x h3 ]  [ Q g5 ]  [ f4 ]  [ R x f4 ]  [ R h8 + ] , [ K x h8 ]  Thank you for the game. I hope you found the comments helpful. Did you check my annotation of the game ? You did not ask any questions as we played but feel free to check back over the game and ask any question. Going forward I strongly recommend a few points to you. 1. Try to play one recognised opening all the time. Get to know the reason for those moves recognise the positions that arise understand the strength and weakness of those positions. This will help you play to a plan through the opening and into the middle game. 2. Write down the moves you are considering. Note the good/bad points you see for each move. Turn the board and look at each move from the other side. Most important double check your move is not a blunder BEFORE you submit it. 3. Stop moving pawns unless/until there is a definite advantage on offer. Think of your pawns as a power unit much stronger side-by-side a team that offer mutual support weak when isolated or forward. When you are tempted to move a pawn now look hard at piece moves that strengthen your position look for weaknesses on the otherside that you can exploit even indirectly. Pay attention to your overall position. 4. Give more time and concentration to your moves. In practice you may need to analyse with particular care and depth at particular times in every game. For example at the end of a familiar opening sequence when your opponent makes an unexpected move when you make a mistake if you get a sense that there is an opportunity or challenge and of course when you are not sure what to do.
 [ e4 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ d4 ] , [ e5 ]  White opened with King's pawn and I responded with Nc3.
 [ R x a2 ]  [ K g3 ]  [ R g2 + ]  [ K f3 ]  [ R f2 + ]  [ K e4 ]  [ R a2 ]  [ R b3 ]  [ R e2 + ] , [ R e3 ]  and Jose's falg fell when he took more than 3 seconds to play his next move that never was... I was only hoping that he would take [ R x e3 ] and then black would win easily the pawn ending by recapturing Kxe3! This game was a nerve wrecking experience for both of us. We fought like true warriors from beginning to end and Jose didn't deserve to lose in such way but at the end justice was done since black had a big advantage for most of the rook ending. This is also the longest game we have ever played against each other. 84 moves is our new record. Also this game marked the first occasion in this year when one of us won two games in a row for the first time but more importantly my victory was very significant for me since by only 2 days short of a one year anniversary from winning a game against Jose with the black pieces. I just hope that I won't have to wait another year to complete such a difficult task again. Thank you for the game my friend. I'm sure that by beating you this time and in this way I had only provoked you into fighting out even more resiliently the next time. Let's keep on fighting!! -Paco Vela.
 [ O-O ]  [ R d1 ]  [ R e8 + ] , [ K f1 ]  14. Kf1. I did consider [ B e3 ] but then I was worried about [ N g5 ] piling up on the pinned prelate.
 [ R c8 ] , [ f4 ]  Threatening mayhem by taking on [ e5 ] and threatening the Q at the same time
 [ R e7 + ]  [ K c8 ] , [ R x f7 ]  26. [ R x f7 ] - and this is just for starters!
 [ B x f3 ]  [ B x f3 ]  [ g5 ] , [ Q e2 ]  White does his best to inhibit the next advance.
 [ N x d5 ] , [ c x d5 ]  Fritz recommends 15. [ c x d5 ] (0.08) Obligatory.
 [ g4 ]  [ B h7 ] , [ g5 ]  Now what to do better? Very complicated (pending)
 [ N c3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ B e7 ] , [ e3 ]  here i first should have gotten my dsb out.
 [ N f3 ]  [ N x b3 ]  [ a x b3 ] , [ R c8 ]  [ c2 ] is seems to be weak.
 [ N f6 ] , [ N d2 ]  Better than [ N [ f3 ] ] just to leave black without [ B g4 ] inviting [ f3 ] which blinds me.
 [ B b2 ] , [ K f7 ]  2. .... [ K f7 ] - interesting - this is very much like my 2 unsuccessful Fried Fox Pork Chop Openings that I tried against the Master Mater and dmaestro and in both Henry came to grief. Can I punish black in the same way? We shall see.
 [ N x d4 ] , [ N f6 ]  Meanwhile being way behind in that department I continue with my development.
 [ B c5 ]  [ N g7 + ] , [ K e7 ]  not 16...Kf8.17.Bh6-Kg8.18.[ Q b3 ] with massive attack.
 [ Q x d4 ]  [ Q x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ h6 ] , [ B e3 ]  8. [ B [ e3 ] ] - the queens have been exchanged and although the white dsb has been driven back to [ e3 ] white has a lead in development.
 [ d5 ]  [ e3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ a3 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N e2 ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ] , [ N x d4 ]  i dont usually like trade offs but i wanted to keep my bishop on [ f5 ]  [ Q x d4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ Q e5 + ]  [ N e7 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ f6 ]  [ Q g3 ]  [ d4 ] , [ N e2 ]  i was expecting [ e x d4 ] here and to my surprise he went
 [ Q d2 ] , [ N g4 ]  Black opts not to capture the bishop on [ d3 ] which may have been the strongest move instead advancing the knight to g4.
 [ B f4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ g6 ] , [ e3 ]  I can advance inmediately this pawn because if [ N h5 ] Be5. If [ B g7 ] I exchange bishops and the game can go on. If [ N g7 ] my bishop will be pushed away eventually with [ d6 ] but black development will also resent. Interesting but I think it is playable. If [ R g8 ] I made him loose the castilng rights for the kingside.
 [ B x g5 ] , [ B x c6 + ]  ... no choice really -p doomed
 [ K x d7 ] , [ N a3 ]  Looking back at it I see that moving the knight out then and there was probably a wasted move. As are a number of moves after this. I think I wasn't paying attention at this point in the match. This goes to show that you should not play chess when watching football. I think I lose a ton of momentum in thes next few moves.
 [ d5 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f d7 ]  [ d4 ] , [ e6 ]  The Sicilian turned into some sort of weird French. with an f3. o.o
 [ Q g4 ] , [ Q c2 ]  I bring my Q to an open area and attack the R.
 [ a4 ]  [ N a3 ]  [ R b8 ]  [ K e2 ]  [ R a1 ]  [ N c4 ]  [ a3 ] , [ K d3 ]  Yet again he chooses not to take the a pawn
 [ d x c5 ] , [ B x c5 ]  At least his last piece is up and about.
 [ R x d5 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ R x f8 ]  [ R x f8 + ] , [ K x f8 ]  Zuckertort's advanced central Pawns now prove decisive.
 [ R d7 ]  [ R c3 ] , [ h5 ]  Black goes into the King-side attack
 [ N f5 ]  [ K h7 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ R c8 ]  [ h3 ]  [ R a c7 ] , [ N f5 ]  I'm struggling to form a good plan.
 [ N c7 ] , [ K x c7 ]  The rest is silence. That indeed was a lot of hard work folks!
 [ Q b3 ]  [ O-O ] , [ B g5 ]  11. [ B g5 ] - pin but it can be broken by [ B e7 ] and black plays it.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N g5 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ N a5 ]  [ B b5 + ]  [ c6 ]  [ d x c6 ]  [ b x c6 ] , [ Q f3 ]  As always the Blackburne variation...
 [ Q x f6 + ] , [ R g7 ]  White will soon run out of checks
 [ R x e4 ]  [ R x a1 ] , [ R e8 ]  ! The whole reason 33... [ R x e4 + ] loses
 [ Q f3 ]  [ B b4 + ]  [ c3 ] , [ R b8 ]  Why?? I guess he didn't see the mate.
 [ N b d7 ] , [ N d2 ]  The moves I initially considered here were [ [ [ a4 ] ] ] and Bd3. 13. [ [ [ a4 ] ] ] to play [ B a3 ] and perhaps [ a5 ] later to clear the isolated pawn. 13. [ B d3 ] to contest [ [ [ [ e4 ] ] ] ] and potentially push the e-pawn which would open the c1-[ h6 ] diagonal and if Black tried to pressure the d-pawn with [ [ e5 ] ] I could push to [ d5 ] with the support of [ [ [ [ e4 ] ] ] ] and create a passed pawn. The first plan seemed rather limited so I looked at the second. I thought Black might reply in one of three ways: [ R f e8 ] N[ [ [ [ e4 ] ] ] ] and e5. I decided I could handle [ [ e5 ] ] although worried about one variation that ended with [ f3 ] being forced on White creating ugliness around the king. [ R f e8 ] also ultimately did not discourage me either. N[ [ [ [ e4 ] ] ] ] looked tough. It would force [ B b2 ] or Bx[ [ [ [ e4 ] ] ] ] and I liked neither. So I started looking at [ [ [ a4 ] ] ] again and realized Black's best move was 13... N[ [ [ [ e4 ] ] ] ] and I couldn't effectively stop it! I began looking at Nd2. It also eyes [ [ [ [ e4 ] ] ] ] and if 13... N[ [ [ [ e4 ] ] ] ] then 14. [ N x d2 ] Bx[ [ [ [ e4 ] ] ] ] looked okay. It was a knight on [ [ [ [ e4 ] ] ] ] I didn't want and in this situation Black needed three moves ([ B b7 ] [ N f6 ] Ne4) to get back there while White could then play [ B d3 ] and e4. After all this it was clear this was my toughest opponent yet. I played [ N d2 ] and hoped my reasoning was sound.
 [ Q h4 + ]  [ g3 ]  [ Q x e4 + ]  [ Q e2 ] , [ Q x h1 ]  Now I'm in a very shitty position.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B b5 ] , [ f5 ]  The Schliemann Defence never encountered it before in all my Ruy Lopezing not even sure if I've spelt it right! An interesting reply but seems destined to lose to White by force. Let's see....
 [ N x e5 ] , [ B f4 ]  I had thought this move would be really quite clever but it turns out it doesn't gain much at all.
 [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ B c4 ]  After placing her bishop on [ d3 ] I explain it blocks in the d-pawn and she moves it one square further.
 [ N f3 ] , [ B c5 ]  Going for the cheap mate threat on [ f2 ] no doubt. At this point [ N d5 ] looks good since once the queen addresses the threat on c7...
 [ N x f3 + ]  [ g x f3 ] , [ B d4 ]  17. [ d4 ] is better but black is winning by miles here
 [ R x a8 ]  [ b x a8 = Q + ]  [ K x h7 ] , [ Q e4 + ]  Black resigns.
 [ N e4 ]  [ f3 ]  [ N c3 + ]  [ K d3 ] , [ e5 ]  Really starting to like my position now!
 [ d3 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ N g5 ]  [ f6 ] , [ N e4 ]  I think that's a good place for a knight so far 1 pawn down but decent development.
 [ R a d1 ]  [ B x f3 ]  [ N x f3 ] , [ Q x a3 ]  Another pawn opponent lost at
 [ R d1 + ]  [ K e7 ]  [ f4 ]  [ B f6 ]  [ K f2 ]  [ K f7 ]  [ B e3 ] , [ R d8 ]  knowing that [ b6 ] would fail to protect all the pawns from [ R d7 + ] I decide to trade rooks and leave [ a7 ] as a trap pawn.
 [ O-O ] , [ a6 ]  Immediate 16.... Ra-d8!? but here I prefer to drive off the B before challenging the open d-file
 [ N x c6 ]  [ B x c6 ]  [ Q d4 ]  [ N e4 ] , [ Q x g7 + ]  Even though I was down one the queen trade seemed to be the best option. But now how to deal with the knight? I would like to get my king out of the middle sometime in the near future but I don't see how when the attacks keep coming. The white bishop seems almost useless.
 [ N g x e4 ]  [ N x e3 ] , [ Q x e3 ]  Now I realize the error in my ways but it is far too late to go back now. The bishop pair and the backward d-pawn make me feel like I have compensation for the lost pawn. My analysis was excellent but my evaluation was terrible. Analysis is calculating all the possible lines and captures. I am pleased looking back to see that aspect of the game was correct for me. Evaluation is looking at the position after the captures are over to see who stands better. If you told me I was going to be down a pawn but have the bishop pair and the opponent has a backward pawn on an open file I would say I like my chances. The problem is in this position I would rather have the knights. I didn't see it this way during the game but my opponent easily turns this position into a win for him. What I failed to recognize is that the holes in black's position ([ f6 ] and [ d6 ] are the worst ones) and the white knight's ability to access them give white all the play. I saw 22. [ N f6 + ] but that gives me back the pawn so I didn't worry about it. I failed to see 22. N[ d6 ] completely dominating the game.
 [ Q x e6 + ]  [ K h8 ] , [ N f7 + ]  1-0 the finish is a standard smothered mate 23...[ K g8 ] 24.[ N h6 ] [ K h8 ] 25.Qg8! [ R x g8 ] 26.[ N f7 # ]  [ e4 ]  [ c5 ] , [ B c4 ]  Sicilian Defence Bowlder Attack
 [ N x g2 ] , [ K x g2 ]  Black had little other choice (if 24. [ N x f3 ] [ Q x f3 ] menacing check)
 [ R a d1 ] , [ N x e4 ]  The attack commences.
 [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ e5 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ a6 ] , [ O-O ]  Normal developing moves up to this point.
 [ c5 ] , [ h4 ]  He want to trap my bishop. That was the plan and now I am a move too late to prevent it. Will I be able to do it?
 [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ d5 ] , [ N b4 ]  5...Nb4. Probably 5...[ N e7 ] is better since it does not induce the Q-side pawn push that W now conducts. However 5...[ N e7 ] would slow B's K-side assault later. This Knight will develop into a major hindrance to B for much of this game.
 [ N x c4 ]  [ N b4 ]  [ B x b4 ]  [ a x b4 ] , [ N x b2 ]  26. ....... [ N x b2 ] - I got rid of Freddy's dsb but I still dropped a pawn now Freddy is gonna make it decisive.
 [ N x e5 ] , [ a x b4 ]  Predict Black's Next Move.
 [ c x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ] , [ d x c5 ]  This move has little purpose. The white bishops sit an stare at the movement!
 [ B x a8 ]  [ Q x a8 ]  [ Q b3 + ]  [ d5 ]  [ g3 ]  [ B h6 ] , [ N e5 ]  Moving my knight into the fray
 [ N g4 ] , [ e5 ]  Maybe ...[ Q c6 ] was good here as well.
 [ R h1 ] , [ Q x e4 ]  Taking White's unprotected knight (not sure why White didn't try and protect it or move it away)
 [ d x e5 ] , [ B e2 ]  Developing and preparing 0-0.
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ a6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B b4 ]  [ B d3 ] , [ Q c7 ]  Both white and black are performing their 3 opening goals in these moves and the next so everything is going fine. Black plays to prevent white's [ e5 ] thrust which would disrupt black's game.
 [ R f2 + ]  [ K e3 ]  [ B x c7 ] , [ R e8 + ]  I am more than happy to exchange due to my material advantage
 [ K e5 ]  [ B d5 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B f3 ]  [ N e8 ] , [ K d7 ]  Accordingly this is an inaccuracy but I don't agree with that. The idea being: 48.[ N g7 ] [ K c7 ] 49.[ N [ [ f5 ] ] ] [ [ h3 ] ] 50.[ N d4 ] [ B c6 ] 51.[ N x c6 ] [ K x c6 ] 52.[ [ f5 ] ] [ K d7 ] 53.[ K d5 ] [ K e7 ] 54.[ K c6 ] [ K f6 ] 55.[ K x [ b5 ] ] Kx[ [ f5 ] ] 56.[ K c5 ] [ K e5 ] 57.[ b5 ] [ [ f5 ] ] That leaves with the best move being 47...[ B e2 ] as then 48.[ N f6 ] [ B d3 ] 49.[ N e4 ] [ B x e4 ] 50.[ K x e4 ] [ K d6 ] 51.K[ [ f5 ] ] [ K d5 ] 52.[ K f6 ] [ K e4 ] 53.[ K x f7 ] [ K x f4 ] 54.[ K e6 ] [ K e4 ] 55.[ K d6 ] [ K d4 ] 56.[ K c6 ] [ K c4 ] 57.[ [ h3 ] ] [ K c3 ] And I absolutely agree with that because as the analysis in the long run 47...[ K d7 ] is what will help black to achieve the opposition when we reach the endgame. As I've learned from Jack in the endgame you generally want to strive for the opposition as it will give you a stronger position.
 [ h6 ]  [ B h4 ]  [ O-O ]  [ R c1 ]  [ c6 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ N b d7 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d x c4 ]  [ B x c4 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ B g3 ]  [ N x c3 ] , [ b x c3 ]  =/
 [ O-O ] , [ h3 ]  Another unnecessary move that again restricts movement of my knight. Advancement of the king's protective pawns weakens the castled king.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B c4 ] , [ N f6 ]  I usually like to play aggressively and so we started this game with a Two Knight defense opening.
 [ Q x g4 + ]  [ K f7 ]  [ Q h5 + ] , [ K e6 ]  This looks odd but 11 ... [ K e7 ] loses the rook after 12. [ Q e5 + ] and the placement of the queen now prevents any hope of safety in the kingside corner. I thought I had to try to hide in the other corner and hope I didn't have to give up huge amounts of material to save my tired king.
 [ R e1 ]  [ Q f5 ]  [ B f1 ] , [ B e6 ]  19. ..... [ B e6 ] - clearing the decks.
 [ B b7 ] , [ N x f6 + ]  Black's best reply is 9... BxN preserving the opportunity to castle behind a solid Pawn barrier.
 [ R e1 ]  [ c x d5 ] , [ e x d6 ]  Now black must dispose of the pawn or a potential fork or promotion can take place...
 [ K e5 ] , [ K e3 ]  At this point I decide to put pressure on the bishop. The [ d3 ] square gives him too much control of the board.
 [ c5 ]  [ c3 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N h5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ B e3 ] , [ Q a5 ]  10...[ N c6 ] 11.[ d5 ] [ N b4 ] 12.0-0 slight advantage to Black because he is about to have the Bishop pair
 [ R d8 ]  [ K e3 ] , [ f6 ]  30. ....... f6! - good move forces an exchange which draws the enemy king into my position.
 [ N x c3 ]  [ b x c3 ]  [ B x c3 ]  [ R b1 ] , [ Q c8 ]  if 10 ... o-o 11 [ Q d3 ] [ B a5 ] 12 [ Q b5 ] [ B x f3 ] 13 [ B x f3 ] [ B b6 ] 14 [ B x b7 ] and black loses rook in compensation for bishop
 [ R b8 ] , [ c6 ]  ! This is where I threaten to get a passed pawn. It's better then I realize.
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ c3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ d3 ]  [ d6 ] , [ N g5 ]  White wastes a move. Castling was best; and either 6. [ B e3 ] or 6. [ d4 ] was better than the text move.
 [ B x d3 ] , [ R f d2 ]  White played this instead of 36 [ R x d3 ] to put pressure on black's queen.
 [ K h8 ] , [ g4 ]  Oh my so desperate was I to attack that I forgot about the queen's escape square!
 [ N x g3 ]  [ K x g3 ] , [ K g5 ]  45. ..... [ K g5 ] - the importance of the opposition can be worth an extra queen in the ending! Now King Chris must retreat.
 [ a3 ] , [ B e7 ]  so i may look very shy to some of you
 [ B f3 + ] , [ K d6 ]  Black cleverly avoids the mating net on the queenside by returning to the centre. Now the white knight has to move.
 [ N f3 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ h6 ]  [ e5 ] , [ B b4 + ]  Ahead by a pawn Castro can afford to be aggressive.
 [ K e8 ] , [ R g8 # ]  Handshaking and time for both players to think things over.
 [ b5 ]  [ a x b5 ] , [ B x b5 ]  This is the diagonal I had planned for my light squared bishop back on move 17 as it keeps the white king locked up and can become dangerous to White's rooks.
 [ d x c6 + ] , [ K e6 ]  the nexht moves are forced
 [ h x g5 ]  [ R x g5 ]  [ R x g5 ] , [ h x g5 ]  36. ...... [ h x g5 ] - over the last few moves my mits have been hovering over the Offer Draw button. However after the recent trades I now consider myself effectively a pawn up. I remembered my Expert Lesson in Pawn endings from Paolo about 5 years back when material was even but one side was left with doubletons. That time it was me and I learned never to trade down to a pure king ending with the doubleton. In this case it is Chris with the doubleton and if he exchanges down to that king ending well .......

I never thought we'd get to the end of that!!
 [ N x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ O-O-O ]  [ c4 ]  [ d x c4 ]  [ b x c4 ]  [ Q e3 ] , [ a5 ]  Here i don't know what i was thinking i did not pay any attention to the pressure on e7. Gladly i got out of the fork and everything went better than expected.
 [ K b2 ] , [ R d e8 ]  preparing for advance
 [ d4 ]  [ e x d4 ] , [ Q x d4 ]  Taking advantage of the pinned knight to bring the queen out.
 [ K c4 ]  [ b6 ]  [ R b3 ]  [ K g6 ]  [ K d5 ]  [ K f7 ]  [ K e5 ] , [ g5 ]  attack from both sides :)
 [ B f3 ] , [ Q d7 ]  Computer likes 15. [ B f3 ] but prefers Black to drop the queen back to d6. I'm not sure it makes much difference.
 [ B b3 ] , [ R g7 ]  ?A mistake White should trade rooks and have good chances of drawing the Opposite color Bishop endgme.
 [ R h2 ]  [ d5 ] , [ R x e5 ]  Totally blanked on that. I resigned at this point. Every single piece he has backs up and/or supports the rest of his pieces. I had trouble attacking when I was even. Being 3 points down is a sure loss versus this guy. In conclusion I got some good practice with the Sicilian. I was fighting for advantage the entire time up to the end instead of being on the defensive but his wierd early kingside pawn push caught me off guard and I didn't handle it as well as I could have obviously.
 [ B g7 ]  [ O-O ] , [ e6 ]  black has now "holes" in his black squares...
 [ N c2 + ]  [ K d2 ]  [ K x f2 ]  [ K x c2 ] , [ e3 ]  Black is destined to promote a pawn...White resigns.
 [ R g1 ] , [ B g3 ]  as planed now the idea is to play [ B f2 ]  [ R x g2 ] , [ c6 ]  preventing [ N d5 ] and freeing [ c7 ] for my king when he does march towards the centre of the board
 [ N c6 ]  [ f3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ e3 ]  [ Q d6 ] , [ B b5 ]  needed to get opponents knights off the board
 [ O-O-O ] , [ R c8 ]  Both sides try to co-ordinate their pieces
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N g5 ] , [ B c5 ]  The thematic position.
 [ f3 ]  [ g x f3 ]  [ B f4 + ]  [ K h1 ] , [ B h3 ]  I've equalized but my f pawn is in possible danger
 [ Q g3 ]  [ B x f1 ]  [ K x f1 ]  [ e6 ]  [ h4 ] , [ Q a5 ]  A lame attack against a2. I didn't see anything better. Black is ahead by the exchange but with all the pawns on the board well placed there seems to be little either side can do to gain a useful attack.
 [ Q x h5 ]  [ R c1 ]  [ Q f7 ] , [ Q x e5 ]  I lose reguardless of how impressive my other moves are. I decided to play it through though.
 [ B d5 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ B x b7 ]  [ Q x b7 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ R e e8 ] , [ Q e2 ]  To connect rooks.
 [ Q c2 ]  [ Q g5 + ]  [ K h7 ]  [ e7 ] , [ Q h2 + ]  Another check
 [ B d2 ]  [ B c5 ] , [ B c1 ]  willing for a draw but black does not want one! (smart idea)
 [ R e8 ]  [ d5 ]  [ R x e1 + ]  [ Q x e1 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ c x d5 ] , [ Q c5 + ]  27. ......... [ Q c5 ] - ganging up on the passed c pawn. For once I decline an invitation to swap queens!!!
 [ K f2 ]  [ f x e4 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ a4 ]  [ Q b6 ]  [ B d8 ] , [ N x d6 ]  This position is tricky for me. I had one minor piece advantage in this game but maybe black had better solution.
 [ g5 ] , [ R c4 ]  Looking to push his king away with [ c6 ] possibly gaining another pawn
 [ Q e7 ] , [ d4 ]  finally a fight for the center but so many pawn moves they do not go back.
 [ Q d2 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ K g2 ] , [ R e7 ]  With the aim of bolstering by moving the other rook to e8.
 [ B x e7 ]  [ Q x e7 ]  [ Q x b7 ]  [ R f b8 ] , [ Q x d5 ]  Taking advantage of the x-ray on [ e6 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ R x e7 ] , [ B e6 ]  White is 2 pawns up and has a rook on the 7th rank on the only fully open file things are looking quite solid
 [ B x d3 ]  [ Q x d3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ R a d1 ] , [ Q d5 ]  ! do not let white to play d5.
 [ N x g6 ]  [ K f7 ]  [ N e5 + ]  [ K f6 ]  [ h4 ] , [ N c8 ]  No fork in sight so I can give my knight his most value.
 [ K x g5 ] , [ N x a4 ]  Resigning seeing no hope for me once he promotes. Bye!
 [ e x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ] , [ B b5 + ]  However they're the ones that gain time. I knew that this would be played sooner or later and was waiting for it.
 [ R d c8 ] , [ f5 ]  White slowly increases the pressure
 [ N d4 ] , [ N d3 ]  I know he can exchange it and probably he will get the pawn too but it is still better than lose the knight stupidly.
 [ Q e3 ] , [ B b7 ]  Black is trying to develop some counter-pressure but does nothing about the safety of his King.
 [ d x e4 ]  [ Q x d2 ] , [ R f d1 ]  No time though need to run again. :-)
 [ N d5 ]  [ B e2 ] , [ B x a3 ]  My bishop is perfectly placed at the moment Here i can win the [ g7 ] pawn And blacks dark squared bishop While keeping my dark squared bishop perfectly placed.
 [ N f6 + ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ Q x f6 ]  [ Q c7 ] , [ O-O-O ]  another inspired move to cover for c2; [ B h5 ] is met with [ d5 ] and probable (?) drawing chances and [ B x b5 ] costs a piece after Qa5+... all other moves give Black the chance to regroup...
 [ g x h7 + ] , [ N x h7 ]  A very bad move..only possible move to avoid mate was 29. .. [ K h8 ] 30.[ B f5 ] losing the knight
 [ N x c3 ] , [ B b4 ]  Doing what I can to catch up on development I pin which works. But against Nathan it's almost too late and he's already slightly better off. That's not to mention that things will get better for him as he's about to castle.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ] , [ d4 ]  Black chose the Philidor's Defense. So I attack it to break it up.
 [ e6 ]  [ B b3 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ f4 ]  [ O-O ] , [ Q f3 ]  White plays this to prepare [ f5 ] if black counters with [ e5 ] he will have a very weak [ d5 ] square .From here whites idea is to attack on the kingside while black will look for something on the queenside
 [ f4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e5 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ R f c1 ] , [ d x c4 ]  Mission accomplished. Now my QBP will hopefully be decisive. I need to remove a few more pieces from the board first to make the passed Pawn tell.
 [ N h4 ]  [ Q f6 ] , [ N f5 ]  He blocks the queen but now theres no turning back
 [ K d3 ]  [ K f6 ]  [ N d5 + ]  [ K f7 ] , [ K e3 ]  Black wants to first make sure that the white won't be able to get another pawn towards promotion after the knight x pawn.
 [ Q f6 ] , [ R c5 ]  Here I cannot see any good move to defend against the future promotion on [ c8 ] the possible [ c7 ] and [ Q b8 ] check on [ d5 ] pawns smashing up at the center.For the meantime I have to block the forthcoming promotion.
 [ R b7 ] , [ e6 ]  Black fails to see that the primary target of 28. [ R b7 ] is not really the e-pawn. The only alternative was 28... [ N f8 ] although after 29. [ g5 ] [ B d4 ] 30. [ N x e7 ] [ R g7 ] 31. [ R c7 ] black would be fighting an uphill battle for a draw. Now with the text move white wins a piece.
 [ B x d5 ] , [ e x d5 ]  Well that worked the line is free let's nag him a little with the rook.
 [ h x g3 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ B x f5 ]  [ N x f5 ] , [ d4 ]  White is ready to develop his bishop and two rooks. Perhaps [ g4 ] would have been better though.
 [ N c5 ]  [ B c2 ]  [ B f6 ]  [ R c1 ] , [ B g7 ]  Black has wasted a lot of time manouvering his pieces.
 [ R c8 + ]  [ K e7 ] , [ B f8 + ]  Winning the Bishop and with it any hopes Black might have been harboring of saving the game.
 [ e x f3 ]  [ e ]  [ p ] , [ g x f3 ]  Planning to play on the g column but opening the way for my Q to g3. Should I take it? What do you think?
 [ K f4 ] , [ R f8 + ]  And now the rook is supporting the f-pawn. Black resigned.
 [ Q g4 ]  [ R f7 ]  [ N h5 ]  [ Q g5 ] , [ Q e2 ]  He was holding his own
 [ d5 ]  [ g3 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ B g2 ]  In the King's Indian Attack White develops quickly and then fights back in the center. Black often develops his pawns in the center and controls it at the start.
 [ N x e5 ]  [ B x e5 ] , [ Q d2 ]  This awkward defense of [ c3 ] is the best move. White wants the [ B c1 ] to go to [ a3 ] or [ b2 ] and the Queen on [ d2 ] is already eying the dark squares around the Black monarch.
 [ B x c4 ]  [ b5 ]  [ B a2 ] , [ c5 ]  Alekhine has eliminated Gruenfeld's spatial advantage and equalized the game.
 [ N c7 ]  [ a x b5 ] , [ a x b5 ]  25. ..... [ a x b5 ] - pawn trade.
 [ N c6 ] , [ N x c6 ]  Is this bad because it gives LSB a better square?
 [ R d8 ] , [ h3 ]  I am not sure why white does this now there was no pressing threat on the back rank and it allows me to win the game
 [ Q x g2 ]  [ R x g2 ] , [ g6 ]  It is interesting to see if white's compensation is enough after RxN.
 [ d5 ]  [ N a5 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ c6 ]  [ d x c6 ]  [ N x c6 ] , [ c3 ]  Moving [ c3 ] is covers the [ d4 ] square strongly and also it is a way for withdrawing my Bishop from [ b5 ]  [ N g e7 ] , [ N a3 ]  I didn't find any good move so I thought that my [ b1 ] knight should on [ c2 ] it supports my [ N f3 ]  [ O-O-O ]  [ O-O ] , [ h6 ]  I already thought he is going to do pawn storm. But in this situation he have to played 12...[ a6 ]  [ g5 ] , [ N h2 ]  14.[ g4 ] causes me loss.. he can 14... Bx[ g4 ] 15. hx[ g4 ] [ Q x g4 + ]  [ e x f5 ]  [ R g8 ]  [ h x g4 ] , [ B x g4 ]  He thought that g' file is now opened and clear to attack on my king side so he sac Bishop but I have the Idea to control and face this attack.
 [ f x e4 ]  [ g4 ]  [ R x f4 ]  [ Q e3 ]  [ R f f8 ] , [ Q g5 ]  White was in a difficult situation with a pawn less and no more concrete threats on my King. But here the Queen is going to far...
 [ B d7 ] , [ O-O-O ]  and so the die is cast white will normally throw forward his kingside pawns and play moves like [ B h6 ] and as Fischer says sac sac mate. However even Fischer lost one game with this variation against C Munoz (Ecuador) in the Leipzig Olympiad October 18 1960. See "How to beat Bobby Fischer" by Edmar Mednis.
 [ h x g3 ]  [ Q x h1 ] , [ e x d7 + ]  Perhaps this could have waited a little longer and 14.[ B e3 ] played developing and defending at the same time. Something to think about for future games perhaps?
 [ B e3 ]  [ B d6 ] , [ N d2 ]  10. [ N d2 ] - clears the decks. A future plan is to play [ [ f3 ] ] and then put that knight on [ [ f3 ] ] after the resulting pawn trade on that square.
 [ B c4 + ] , [ d5 ]  My opponent must have thought that this would have been adequate but...
 [ R g8 ] , [ B e2 ]  I thought for a long time on this move. White's problems are the pawns on [ c4 ] and [ f5 ] preventing this Bishop from getting into the action. His other thorn is the nasty [ N d4 ] ready to leap into action with a killer fork on [ f3 ] if given the chance and bottling up White's pieces with its mere presence. I'm loathe to exchange while a full piece behind this move is the best option I found for White--if Black leaves the Bishop alone White can renew his attack with a check on h5. If Black takes it the Knight is gone and the Queen will move to a much more useful location on e2. Essentially this is throwing another piece at the problem to hope it goes away but at least it's a relatively weak piece compared to Black's strong Knight.
 [ d3 ]  [ e x d3 ]  [ N x d3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B e3 ] , [ c4 ]  Black wants to keep the Queen in the center.
 [ O-O ]  [ Q e2 ] , [ N c5 ]  Practically forced. I rejected 11...[ B [ f5 ] ] because of 12 [ R d1 ] and I rejected 11...[ f5 ] because of 12 ef e.p. [ R x f4 ] 13 [ N g5 ] or 13 [ R d1 ] with advantage for White.
 [ N e4 ] , [ f5 ]  This creates a giant hole on [ K5 ] from which the Knight can now never be dislodged once it lands.
 [ a4 ] , [ R c1 + ]  
 [ R b2 ]  [ B x f3 ]  [ g x f3 ] , [ N f5 ]  Bringing another knight into the attack.
 [ K x g4 ] , [ R f5 ]  ?? What am I THINKING here? Those pawns are a danger and I've got to stop them...
 [ B e6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ g6 ]  The pawn formation is set - the followup plan for the Botvinnik formation includes [ B g2 ] [ N g e2 ] O-O and then looking to make the appropriate fore-mentioned pawn break.
 [ e5 ]  [ B b2 ] , [ d6 ]  Tempted with [ N c6 ] but let's say colours were flipped and Black was threatening the e pawn with the bishop I'd respond with the d pawn movement. Thus I do similar as Black. This game was played whilst I was overseas no FCO at my side so might as well stick to what (little) I know! :)
 [ g3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ] , [ N x d4 ]  5. [ N x [ d4 ] ] - pawn trade. I am tempted to trade knights here but I do not want the Wicked Witch of the West to sit on [ d4 ] so I decided to respond with the line-opening [ e6 ] - gives Fou Lenoir some air.
 [ Q c6 ] , [ B f4 ]  White now generates the opening initiative and starts to force the black pieces onto the awkward looking squares. It was all by using the opening approach and finding the weaknesses of the black's strange move. The initiative gained means that our idea is successful.
 [ h6 ] , [ N h3 ]  Ok now I can make two pawns isolated on the h column but... is that "intelligent"? Is that "nice"? or "fun"?
 [ R g1 + ]  [ R e1 ]  [ R x e1 + ]  [ Q x e1 ]  [ Q x e1 + ] , [ K x e1 ]  When you find yourself in these situations you need a game plan on how to secure victory. White's pawns are all singletons so there is no support there. Essentially Black gets their king to the middle of the board pushes the three pawns on the c and d files up and then leverages 3 on 1 attacks with the king to promote. If White moves to block with their King the Black king can go scarf the h pawn and promote. It is almost impossible to not win as Black here but you still have to execute.
 [ R e1 ] , [ R e8 ]  This prevents intrusion of the 7th rank.
 [ N x c1 ]  [ N x c6 ] , [ N e2 + ]  the pawn queens
 [ d4 ] , [ B g4 ]  White: King_0_Nothing Black: Janheckman
 [ B d2 ]  [ Q x b5 ]  [ b3 ] , [ B a6 ]  I made mistake here. that is not the right place for bishop. I wished for the development [ b7 ] was better.
 [ R b8 ] , [ b4 ]  to block Black's threatened advance
 [ Q b8 + ]  [ Q c8 ]  [ Q d6 + ]  [ K e8 ] , [ Q e7 # ]  Very good game white... :-(
 [ N x c7 ]  [ Q x c7 ]  [ b5 ] , [ e5 ]  This is to open the e file.
 [ c5 ] , [ a4 ]  20. a4! - this move threatens to undermine my queenside pawn structure. Now watch - passivitis now creeps in starting with the move Rb8.
 [ Q x g5 + ]  [ h x g5 ]  [ f6 ]  [ R x e8 + ]  [ B x e8 ]  [ R e1 ] , [ B c6 ]  The bishop is essentially forced to hide behind the [ d5 ] pawn. It can't easily relinguish control of d8.
 [ e6 ]  [ d3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ c3 ]  preventing from the [ c6 ] knught moving forward and blocking the [ g7 ] bishop.
 [ R f8 ] , [ R g c7 ]  and white proposed a draw which I accepted as [ R x f6 ] isn't possible and white can't progress...
 [ f5 ]  [ a5 ]  [ b4 ] , [ b5 ]  also [ a x b4 ] was possible here: but Black has to be careful; there are a lot of tensions here...
 [ f3 ]  [ a5 ]  [ N b1 + ]  [ K c2 ]  [ N a3 + ]  [ K b3 ] , [ N b1 ]  At this point black (who was me) counted it would take him 4 (unanswered) moves to get a queen and if he tried for a queen by P-[ e4 ] [ e5 ] e6......it would take 5 (unanswered) moves. Otherwise black would have been forced to move my king back to [ d5 ] to protect against the white pawn getting a queen. It's an advantage to have your pawns closer to the other side of the board!!(unless the other king is close enough to capture them)
 [ R e1 ]  [ a6 ]  [ N d5 ] , [ B e6 ]  12. ...... [ B e6 ] - might as well continue to get my queenside developed.
 [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ R e8 ] , [ d4 ]  ? Dooms his DSB to passivity after an eventual ...c4.
 [ B x f3 ]  [ g x f3 ] , [ Q a5 ]  I almost retreated but didn't feel like placing my on the rim where it can be later attacked. So I try something fancy as I keep in mind that he'll lose the exchange if he takes now. Believe it or not I wouldn't have even considered this but something just like this was played against me in a somewhat similar position.
 [ N g5 ] , [ h6 ]  ?? is very pleasant for white Alternative variation: 13... [ N b6 ] [!] 14. [ d6 + ] [ K f8 ] with far from unfavorable complications for black in [Kooiman-Povah London 1976]
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ] , [ g6 ]  Commencing the king's indian defense. Various move orders with the moves [ d6 ] [ g6 ] B[ g6 ] are not crucial.
 [ K x h7 ]  [ Q h3 + ]  [ K g8 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ R d8 ] , [ R h1 ]  Mate is now only a matter of 6 moves if he opts to sacrifice all of his pieces.
 [ Q f5 ] , [ d3 ]  mmm this passed d pawn could be a problem
 [ B d3 ]  [ b6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B b7 ]  [ Q e2 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ R a d1 ]  [ h6 ]  [ R f e1 ] , [ B f8 ]  Black has very few useful moves. Quite a few possible moves simply make the position worse.
 [ B f5 ] , [ c3 ]  The problem with that move is that it weakens your white squares and makes my B stronger and exposes your bank rank. Don't get too down - this position is hopeless and you cannot defend your pawns adequately and avoid mate at the same time.
 [ Q g3 ] , [ R b e8 ]  Now I start to build up pieces against White's e-pawn and suddenly it's that pawn that looks vulnerable.
 [ N f4 ]  [ B x f4 ] , [ g x f4 ]  The black knight found its destination and white reasonably had to remove it from the board. The new threat against white is now the half-open file and most of white's pieces are cordoned off by an unfortunate pawn structure. White's best move here is d4. It takes away the defender of the now-overextended f-pawn and take away the initiative that could be used to manipulate the half-open g-file.
 [ B x f2 + ] , [ K h1 ]  Nice try but white doesn't have to comply with the trade. Black humbly took the [ f2 ] bait. Without even having to move a piece white's rook can now contest the f-file.
 [ N d4 ]  [ R f2 ]  [ N x e6 ] , [ B a3 ]  Black now exploits the weakness of white's castle.
 [ a6 ]  [ B a4 ]  [ b5 ]  [ B b3 ] , [ B e7 ]  My opponents last move is unusual
 [ R x g2 ] , [ R h g1 ]  ? This loses another pawn
 [ N f3 ] , [ g6 ]  Designed to avoid the Rossolimo variation of which I know nothing.
 [ K c5 ]  [ K e2 ]  [ K c4 ]  [ K d2 ] , [ R f1 ]  I had actually thought black would have played [ R h2 ] at the time I thought that [ R f1 ] was actually quite clever but I can't remeber why I thought that now probably because this threatens both the f apwn and the same threats that [ R h2 ] would have had. which is better [ R f1 ] or [ R h1 ] what does the reader think? either way my next two moves would likely be the same.
 [ N f3 ] , [ B c6 ]  The idea is to win a pawn and mess up white's structures around the K because Joe has 32...[ B x f3 ] 33.[ g x f3 ] [ R x f3 ] in mind.
 [ e4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ a6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ b6 ]  [ c3 ]  [ c5 ]  [ Q b3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N g5 ]  [ h6 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N g4 ]  [ Q c4 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ Q e4 ]  [ N x d3 + ]  [ Q x d3 ]  [ h x g5 ]  [ c4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N a3 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ N c4 ] , [ N x d3 + ]  Put them in check along with taking their queen. Simple mistake. Probably thinking about taking my knight.
 [ g6 ] , [ B x b5 ]  White realizes it can gain a pawn advantage but Black sees the opportunity to 1) rid white of its light squared bishop (notice black's pawns) and 2) open up the queen side attack. Black also will have both bishops which will prove key to the final attack.
 [ B x d8 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ B a5 ]  [ O-O ] , [ N h6 ]  10...Bxc3. I personally would rather have the bisop pair most of the time but the teeth of his threat was removed when I castled away. Later the knights prove pivotal.
 [ h3 ] , [ Q e7 ]  not moving my queen anywhere not falling for any traps.
 [ a6 ] , [ a3 ]  To prevent [ B d4 + ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ Q x f6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ N d4 ]  Black trying to threaten [ N x c2 ] or [ N x f3 ] and if white [ Q x f3 ] then Black [ Q x f3 ] white will have to recapture with [ g x f3 ] leaving white king exposed.
 [ N x f4 ] , [ e x f4 ]  Now black's pawn structure takes a little hit isolating the [ d6 ] pawn. Still it was already backward so isolated isn't much worse. Thankfully white voluntarily got rid of one of those pesky knights. Now maybe black will have a little room to breath.
 [ R g8 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ K x f6 ] , [ e8 = Q ]  39. e8=Q. W's Queen #2 in the game.
 [ K e7 ]  [ N f5 + ]  [ K e6 ] , [ N g3 ]  I was planning on chasing the king around until I could get my knight in a better position. Here I realised that if I didn't protect the pawn with something other than my king black might take it.
 [ O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ Q e1 ]  [ d5 ]  [ B b3 ] , [ N a5 ]  Alternative variation: 9. ... [ N d4 ] [The other main choice]
 [ g4 ] , [ B c8 ]  a trick: White tries to overpower the Kings' wing by force...
 [ R f1 ]  [ R e7 ]  [ c5 ] , [ R d2 ]  Mistake. I should have taken the pawn. Anyway white should have played his rook to [ c1 ] in my opinion.
 [ f x e5 ]  [ Q x c5 ]  [ e x f4 ] , [ N g5 ]  White wins his pawn back and looks to have a good position here although black's position is favourable...
 [ N g5 ] , [ h6 ]  nowhere to go...
 [ f4 ] , [ c5 ]  A brute force attack and a little counter attack. The queen has to move! And she will be unable to cover the bishop on [ c4 ] so [ f7 ] will ultimately fall :) (together with the Bishop an c4!) I think this move would have been possible even sooner. But somehow I did not see it...
 [ R x b5 ] , [ B x b5 ]  ...and I also get the rook exchange going into the endgame where no piece is worth more than three points. I think this was very dubious by my opponent as I am ahead on material and I'm about to get a second passed pawn...
 [ K h8 ] , [ R e d1 ]  white kindly offered a way to draw here. White could have been glad with it. But I guess matt did want to take revenge for previous game. Fair enough.
 [ R d2 ]  [ B x b4 ]  [ R a2 ]  [ B x e1 ]  [ R x a4 ] , [ B a5 ]  Pulling the bishop back preserves P[ a6 ] and white has nothing to attack the black bishop.
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ] , [ B f4 ]  Queen's Pawn Mason Variation.
 [ B c4 + ]  [ K h8 ] , [ B g5 ]  16. [ B g5 ] - I wonder whether [ R f7 ] was better here.
 [ Q x e4 ]  [ Q x e4 ] , [ B x e4 ]  And black has a huge material advantage two pieces and a pawn ahead has an easily won game white has nothing but to resign or wait for the inevitable mate he chooses to stop the slaughter immediately! This was a beautiful game white played really bad and commited many mistakes and 2 or 3 major blunders but black was very good and exploited those errors soundly and eventually won the game!
 [ N f7 ]  [ Q d7 ]  [ N x h8 ]  [ N g4 ]  [ Q d3 ] , [ Q d8 ]  I wanted to play Qh5.
 [ N x a4 ]  [ d x e5 ] , [ d x e5 ]  I was aware I was opening for him the d column but the queen should go to [ c3 ] after the knight exchange on a4. But... I saw something and I took the risk.
 [ R e e6 ] , [ Q g4 ]  I this position it may have been better to try to relocate the bishop via [ c1 ] especially considering that it may be done while attacking the awkwardly placed [ h6 ] rook now but that black will likely attempt to make some trades later on.
 [ K h6 ] , [ Q x h7 # ]  
 [ c5 ] , [ e3 ]  White signals his intention to continue quietly strengthening his central control (and not grabbing space with the more popular 4.d5). This allows Black a free hand to develop (again he has more space to maneuver his pieces).
 [ Q x h8 + ]  [ K e7 ] , [ B f6 # ]  That happens. He claims he almost didn't see that but it worked out well for him.
 [ Q x e6 ]  [ K g7 ] , [ R x f6 ]  Get rid of bishop
 [ f x g2 + ] , [ K x g2 ]  Hopefully it will be playable even with -2 for exchange. Good position and some pawns. I should try to use my position somehow.
 [ B g7 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ O-O ] , [ B x d5 ]  Now the game has transposed to a main line of the opening.
 [ O-O ] , [ N f6 ]  Attacks the undefended e pawn and develops the black knight at the same time.
 [ B g7 ] , [ B g5 ]  This pin can get nasty fast for black he must break it immediately.
 [ R f e8 ] , [ Q e1 ]  ?? After which Sue keeps her Queen. Now I accurately pointed out that this is another blunder which will win more material. I gave her Homework by showing her the position right after 22...[ R f e8 ] to see if she could find the best. Unfortunately she did not find the solution this time around. Sue: Cannot see where I blundered Or loss in material.? Could have moved 1. [ R d4 ] 2. R [ x [ e4 ] ] 3. Q x [ e4 ] maybe? Joe: 23.[ R d4 ] was possible but would still result in the same move that I'm bound to play. Best was 23.[ Q b6 ] hitting my [ b7 ] pawn in the process.
 [ N f6 ] , [ O-O ]  ...safety first.....
 [ B e3 ]  [ N b4 ]  [ R d2 ]  [ c6 ]  [ a3 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ N x d5 ] , [ Q x d5 ]  18. ........ [ Q x d5 ] - after a bit of manouevering with my knight I find myself with a choice of recaptures. Q or c pawn. Glenda of course must recapture as she is as well centralised as the Witch and eyeing up the square g2. There is no lsb to divert her from that square. It will take several moves to dislodge her.
 [ B x d6 ]  [ B x d6 ]  [ Q x d6 ]  [ R e8 ] , [ R a d1 ]  Well other than a pawn it doesn't seem I had gained all that much at this point. I did have my eye on the [ b7 ] pawn at this point and was considering [ e5 ] as my continuation.
 [ Q x c3 ] , [ R d3 ]  34. [ R d3 ] - and now the Witch is skewered against the bishop on a3!
 [ R x e6 ]  [ R x g3 ] , [ K f2 ]  Damn! He caught on to my trap. He doesn't go for the [ h6 ] pawn suspicious of me closing in on his King.
 [ Q x e5 ] , [ N c3 ]  I feel I know his style and know he will attack that Knight with his DS Bishop and I will have doubled pawns. But I am not so afraid of doubled pawns anymore though I prefer to live without them. My other option was D3 but he would still 99.99% attack the knight and trade it off. I know this. Then I am still in a situation. If I pull out my bishop to block check he will take my [ B2 ] pawn with his Queen and things get too annoying too fast for me.
 [ B x f2 + ]  [ K x f2 ]  [ Q d4 + ]  [ K e1 ] , [ Q x e5 ]  After all the only things happened were; I lost my chance of castling and two of his pieces are near the centre. His bishop also can be easily developed say 9...Bg4.
 [ e4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ d5 ] , [ e5 ]  The Advance variation against the French Defense.
 [ B e6 ]  [ b3 ] , [ Q c7 ]  Planning the strong queenside castling that in one moves build a strong central pressure.
 [ e3 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ N b d2 ] , [ c5 ]  White meets any such advance with
 [ K f2 ] , [ f x g5 ]  after this entire game i had no clue what to expect from him here
 [ Q g3 + ]  [ K e2 ] , [ N g1 # ]  CHECKMATE in 17
 [ Q h5 ] , [ B f4 ]  Or [ Q c3 ] probably better. Anyway the mating squence [ B h8 ] - [ Q g7 # ] was easily stopped so why to go for it? Better to have room for my knight. [ N e5 ] [ Q e2 ] and I threated [ g5 ] releasing the pressure.
 [ B x b5 + ]  [ B d7 ]  [ B x d7 + ] , [ N b x d7 ]  tada.. another advantage here is that the white bishop is white's most powerful bishop. the black bishop is black's most powerful bishop. imo bad exchange on white.
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ e x d4 ] , [ Q x d4 ]  More often played is nxd4.
 [ O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ B d7 ] , [ R c1 ]  White is perfectly developed and threatens to win a Pawn with 13 NxN NxN 14 P-[ K4 ] and 15 RxP.
 [ B f4 ]  [ b5 ] , [ B d3 ]  White reinforces his center and prepare to castle.
 [ N b c3 ] , [ a6 ]  the Najdorf extension...
 [ e5 ]  [ a3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ Q h5 ]  [ B d6 ] , [ Q d1 ]  Not quite sure what his plan was with his queen but oh well I'll gladly accept the extra tempo. As it turns out his lack of development of all of his minor pieces at these early stages probably proves his undoing in the end.
 [ K f2 ]  [ d5 ]  [ Q g5 + ]  [ K f8 ] , [ Q h6 + ]  Further moves i made it conditional as my opp. cant avoid a mate...
 [ a6 ] , [ a5 ]  12. ... a6! is sharpest for black now after missing out on move 7... Now there is no turning back for white...
 [ B e6 ] , [ c4 ]  I can play this because of the Nf3. No matter my Q is where it is as far as black is unable to get more firepower on c4... and he can't. Now I'm on to play [ d5 ] and [ b2 ] (that gets weak in return but this is the cost of my [ c4 ] move) is defended.
 [ K e6 ] , [ R x f5 ]  ...and decide that with a two pawn advantage with the extra two pawns on the kingside being passed it's worth removing the knight...
 [ Q x e4 ]  [ R a d8 ]  [ R f3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ Q f4 ] , [ N g4 ]  Means a trades are pracrtically impossible to avoid.
 [ f6 ]  [ R f5 ]  [ N h6 ] , [ R f4 ]  [ R x f6 ] forces a draw
 [ b8 = B + ] , [ K c6 ]  The underpromotion to a bishop was warranted here because getting a queen would have risked a stalemate and convoluted control of the c file while promotion to a rook or knight would not have succeeded at checking the king in order to gain tempo. Underpromotions are unique situations but in those rare cases they are necessary. Also let me approach the issue a different way -- would it be better to blatantly hang a queen or blatantly hang a bishop? I think we would all agree it would be better to irresponsibly hang a bishop and thus there is no reason to promote to anything other than a bishop in this situation.
 [ a5 ]  [ R d c1 ] , [ R e8 ]  Game note: "22...[ N c4 ] to threaten ...[ R a e8 ] attack on his [ e4 ] pawn. Also attacks his [ b2 ] pawn immediately but loses mobility. Result is I control 2 centre squares vs 4."
 [ R a c1 ]  [ R a e8 ] , [ Q g3 ]  ? allows black the opportunity to come into the position.
 [ K a1 ]  [ N x d1 ]  [ Q g4 + ]  [ Q g6 ]  [ Q x d1 ] , [ R f d8 ]  26. .... [ R f d8 ] - white's attack has run out of steam and not only that has an 8 point material deficit to contend with against such a strong Master as Janet. White therefore gracefully resigns on the grounds of Ruinous Loss of Material. Commiserations and good effort here Pitroque - you got her worried! Kind regards - Joanne
 [ e6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B b4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N e7 ] , [ Q g4 ]  ? 5. [ [ a3 ] ] is the book move. I've played this opening dozens of times and I don't remember ever forgetting to play 5. [ [ a3 ] ] before Qg4.
 [ Q x b5 + ]  [ K f8 ]  [ N d3 ]  [ R b8 ]  [ Q a4 ]  [ a5 ]  [ Q f4 + ] , [ K e8 ]  If 17.../[ B f6 ] or [ N f6 ] White continues with [ B d4 ] and Ne5.
 [ N d3 ]  [ R h5 ]  [ h3 ]  [ h6 ]  [ e5 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ R x a5 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ R a x e5 ]  [ R h x e5 ]  [ R x e5 ]  [ R x e5 ]  [ N x e5 + ]  [ K e6 ] , [ N d3 ]  35. [ N d3 ] - over the last few moves there have been a plethora of pawn and rook exchanges. Now we are in a knight ending but I am a pawn up.
 [ K h2 ] , [ Q x d4 ]  And he resign. My first sicilian...I have to improve this defence and i need experience. see 12... Nh7. What do u think of my moves? and his moves?. Comment comment and comment like u always do. Bye!
 [ N x f4 ]  [ g x f4 ] , [ Q h3 ]  White threatens my pawn...
 [ R x h3 ]  [ B x h3 ] , [ K g1 ]  I can't afford a discovered check!
 [ d4 ] , [ g6 ]  54th GK Tournament. I meet 1. [ d4 ] with the Modern Defense. The World DB seems to think 1. ... [ [ g6 ] ] and 1. ... [ d6 ] are the two strongest moves for black but 1. ... [ [ g6 ] ] has the lowest incidence of drawn games which puts it at the top of my list.
 [ R f d1 ] , [ R x g8 + ]  Now the battle of two rooks vs two bishops begins.
 [ h4 ]  [ h5 ]  [ R d c1 ] , [ R x h4 ]  Another. I am +5 points in material
 [ R c d8 ] , [ B b2 ]  Almost game over but what if my Bishop had been on [ g7 ] instead of getting astray on [ c7 ] and a5?
 [ Q c2 ]  [ c5 ]  [ e3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N g e2 ]  [ O-O ]  [ a3 ] , [ B a5 ]  Preserving my bishop.
 [ N f6 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ d4 ]  [ d6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d x e5 ] , [ N x e5 ]  5. [ N x e5 ] - two centralised knights of opposite colour - interesting.
 [ R a7 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ R c7 ] , [ R d2 ]  Preparing Rxf2+.
 [ Q d3 ] , [ N e6 ]  I cannot take the knight! What a shame I didn't see it before...
 [ g6 ] , [ Q g4 ]  Instead I was thinking in terms of this move since I was trying to take advantage of his [ e6 ] pawn.
 [ B x f6 + ]  [ K x f6 ] , [ b4 ]  wins the queen
 [ K g1 ] , [ R x g2 # ]  
 [ Q c1 ]  [ N b5 ]  [ R a e8 ] , [ R x e8 ]  White exchanges rooks but relinquishes the e-file - a factor which by chance becomes significant a few moves later.
 [ N x a5 ]  [ N x a5 ] , [ Q c3 ]  With that pesky bishop off the board white can make a battery with his queen and dark-square bishop AND play [ R f e1 ] finally. The immediate threat of this move is mate on g7.
 [ g4 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ h5 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ K e7 ]  [ Q x c6 ]  [ N g7 ] , [ Q d6 + ]  And mate is coming soon. Hope you guys enjoyed! Expect to see more from me here!
 [ B g4 ] , [ Q d2 ]  I needed to have both of those squares free and I was dumb enough to leave one of them occupied.
 [ d x e5 ] , [ Q h5 ]  Despite being down a pawn White has a nice attack and potential mating chances plus he can probably win the pawn back since [ c5 ] is very weak
 [ d6 + ]  [ N d5 ] , [ N x d5 ]  And with this move black resigned although he could have resigned much earlier. He wanted a rematch but I declined. I felt sure he'd promptly show me what he was really capable of and I myself just got off of a 12 hour night shift and was tired. Moral of the story: yes you can play too passively and lose games you should not lose.
 [ B d4 ]  [ R h f1 ]  [ B x f2 ]  [ Q x b7 ]  [ B h4 + ]  [ R b2 ]  [ Q x c4 ]  [ d6 ]  [ g6 ]  [ Q d7 ]  [ R d8 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ Q d4 ] , [ R b7 ]  A very imposing position -- for both sides. My dark squares are extremely weak making his bishop huge but he's basically playing an exchange down due to his other being locked in behind his king.
 [ Q b6 ] , [ N d1 ]  Not a good move but even after the relatively better 21 [ K e2 ] White is in trouble.
 [ R b1 ] , [ e2 ]  Now if 43. Re1?? then 43. ... d2! 44. [ R x e2 ] [ d1 = Q + ] is decisive.
 [ K x e4 ]  [ N x g2 ]  [ K f3 ]  [ N e1 + ]  [ K x f2 ] , [ N x d3 + ]  Black's hope is gone.
 [ Q e5 + ]  [ Q x e5 + ]  [ K x e5 ] , [ B g7 # ]  This is honestly one of the coolest mate positions I have ever seen let alone played. Material-wise I am down a rook+knight+pawn yet the black king is checkmated in the center of the board.
 [ c6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ R d8 ] , [ B g5 ]  12. [ B g5 ] - a pin but this one is fairly harmless!
 [ Q b3 + ]  [ K h8 ]  [ B x f3 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ B x d4 ]  [ Q x d4 ] , [ e3 ]  Equal materials and Bishop opposite colors. But the a and c pawns are isolated. White is slightly better and can play on forever without risks. Black believes that he can hold.
 [ B f5 ] , [ B c4 ]  At this point I surrendered because I have nothing to counter [ Q g5 ] followed by bringing the rook in e1. Note that in the end a rook and a knight remain undeveloped. I see my first and foremost mistake in forsaking the normal development of pieces. For example 13. ... [ a x b5 ] would have opened some opportunities for my second rook and 14. ... [ Q x d6 ] followed by [ B b7 ] and Nd7-[ N b6 ] would have possibly allowed me to take back the [ d5 ] pawn with some chances of equalizing the game.
 [ N g5 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ f4 ] , [ K g7 ]  His passed pawn on [ f4 ] is unprotected. I think it's time for my king to join the battle.
 [ N f7 ]  [ Q e8 ]  [ N x h8 ]  [ Q x h5 ] , [ R x h5 ]  I won a rook and black's is very very cramped. Still I have to fight.
 [ O-O ] , [ e3 ]  Opening the way for the Q.
 [ c5 ]  [ b x c5 + ] , [ K x c5 ]  42. ..... [ K x c5 ] - a decisive pawn trade allowing the incursion of the BK.
 [ N x c3 ]  [ b x c3 ]  [ R x c3 ]  [ R x c3 ]  [ B x c3 + ] , [ K f1 ]  White is down by a pawn in this simplified ending. I think black stands better here with the two bishops.
 [ R a b8 ]  [ g5 ]  [ N h5 ] , [ f4 ]  OH! Also I wanted to play this move and w/o the Knight on [ e3 ] I wouldn't have been able to do so. Hence the knight move on move 17.
 [ N x e6 ]  [ R d c8 ]  [ N e2 d4 ]  [ Q e4 + ]  [ K a1 ] , [ R h5 ]  ?! -- The text eyes doubling the Rooks on the h-file which is not a bad idea; but 26. ...[ R c4 ] is better because it keeps Black's play boiling around White's King.
 [ c x b3 ] , [ Q d4 + ]  The rest is almost forced.
 [ d x c4 ]  [ B x c4 ]  [ b5 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ R d8 ]  [ Q e2 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ O-O ] , [ N e5 ]  15... Ne5! Schlechter: Introduced by Marshall and Schlechter in a similar position with opposite colors but here with the extra move Rd8.
 [ B x f6 ] , [ Q x d5 ]  ? And there it is. It was even set as a conditional move for the first time in this game.
 [ f x e5 ]  [ N g4 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N x f3 + ]  [ B x f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ R c1 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ b3 ] , [ N x f3 + ]  Starts a chain of exchanges in order to relieve the pressure on the black position.
 [ c6 ] , [ B e6 + ]  I give check and also add a little protection to g4.
 [ R f4 ] , [ Q g6 ]  I move my f rook up to [ f4 ] attacking the pieces and the queen moves back to g6.
 [ K a5 ]  [ R a4 + ]  [ K b6 ] , [ B d4 + ]  As now I use my Bishop to check him. And the more this happens the happier I feel about my position. That's also because I'm keeping in mind that he can't take my B without losing the R.
 [ c4 ]  [ e5 ] , [ g3 ]  This is Grandmaster Tony Kosten's recipe: Seize the diagonal and control d5.
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N b d7 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ a4 ]  [ h6 ] , [ a5 ]  I try to put bishop on [ c8 ] out of game by stopping b6.
 [ N f6 ] , [ d4 ]  Here theory says [ N x d4 ] but I don't like [ c4 ] etc.
 [ e5 ]  [ R d2 + ]  [ K g1 ] , [ Q d1 # ]  Great game with a lot to learn from each side. Good example of the power a passed pawn. Had White not given up material in the beginning of the game it would have given him a more solid position in the center and and equality of position. There's alot missing from this annotation. Any thoughts? Thanks to whoever might have actually read this whole annotation. Thanks alot Chizznappy for playing-
 [ Q x c4 ]  [ R x c4 ] , [ B b3 ]  Even now we can see that whites bishop just doesn't have a good place to go. Blacks bishop is so much more active and white will soon have to give up the e-pawn as we'll.
 [ e5 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ e x f6 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ R e7 ] , [ Q e1 ]  White prepares to move Queen to Kingside
 [ K d2 ] , [ R h3 ]  .
 [ h3 ]  [ N x f3 + ]  [ B x f3 ]  [ B x f3 ] , [ Q x f3 ]  23. [ Q x f3 ] - a trade of 2 sets of pieces does not entirely solve my spatial issues.
 [ N f3 ] , [ B g4 ]  Decided to exchange it with no regrets. Now I could have moved it on [ f4 ] because I would have had time to shield it in [ a7 ] but I went for this one instead.
 [ N c6 ] , [ N d2 ]  The trendy way to play the London System these days seems to delay the development of the KN as long as sensibly possible so long as the [ e5 ] square is adequately covered.
 [ N x f3 + ] , [ g x f3 ]  Black gets my pawns in the required mess.
 [ R b5 + ] , [ K c6 ]  Now I'm hitting two hanging pieces. [ R x e5 ] is met with fxe5.
 [ e x f4 ] , [ K h1 ]  The pin on the g pawn has been released.
 [ Q x d2 ]  [ R x d2 ] , [ K h7 ]  17. ..... [ K h7 ] - black has a plan of centralising his king via the kingside. It will not become apparent however until both dsbs are swapped off.
 [ K d8 ] , [ N d6 ]  This move looks very scary to black.
 [ N x d5 ] , [ B c5 ]  His plan is to gain time to bring out another piece and/or castle.
 [ K h7 ] , [ f x g5 ]  using the theme of the pin.
 [ f x g6 ] , [ Q x g6 # ]  
 [ N c2 ]  [ N d5 + ]  [ K d6 ]  [ Q f4 ]  [ Q x e4 + ]  [ Q x e4 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ N c4 + ]  [ K c5 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ K d6 ]  [ f4 ]  [ N d4 + ]  [ K e3 ]  [ K c5 ]  [ K x e4 ]  [ d6 ]  [ N d3 + ] , [ K c4 ]  here he wants to save his horse..but not quite..because he will be trapped.
 [ O-O ] , [ N b d7 ]  The only good move I saw.
 [ R x c1 ] , [ R d8 ]  (?!) Better was to grab the a2-pawn (23...Bxa2) whilst the grabbing was good.
 [ e4 ] , [ d6 ]  I was anticipating a pirc style defense from black after this move however this was not the case.
 [ N e6 ]  [ B b1 ] , [ N d4 ]  61 - [ N d8 ] loses to 62.[ b5 ] - [ N e6 ] 63.[ K f7 ] - [ N c5 ] 64.Bc2.
 [ B g5 ] , [ B e7 ]  There is already only a few moves on either the Gameknot World or the Gameknot internal opening database with this position.
 [ R x e7 ]  [ f x e7 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ R f8 + ]  [ R x f8 ] , [ e x f8 = R # ]  The ending after 34.[ f7 ] would have been more economical. However such interest that this game contains lies in the consequences of an ill-considered raid to snaffle a b-pawn.
 [ Q b4 + ]  [ c5 ] , [ Q x c5 # ]  1-0. An interesting game that finished earlier than expected largely due to the difference between white and black's piece development and the poor placement of the black Queen early on. I'd be grateful for any of your comments on this game. Cheers!
 [ R x e8 + ] , [ R x e8 ]  White continues to simplify.
 [ d3 ] , [ a5 ]  stops b4. also provides a B haven on [ a7 ] and gives the Rook an opportunity (...[ R a6 ] hmmm.)
 [ g4 ] , [ B d3 ]  White didn't defend against either black threat giving black the choice of which he wanted. Black chose to win the exchange and consequently white chose to resign rather than play on down a pawn + the exchange.
 [ K g2 ] , [ K e3 ]  ! 88.[ B c4 ] would allow Kf2-[ e1 ] and waste moves to snare the black king again.
 [ N c6 ]  [ e3 ] , [ d5 ]  3. ....... [ d5 ] - black decided to counter in the centre.
 [ N e2 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ Q b6 ]  [ N d2 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ Q x b2 ]  [ N b3 ]  [ N b4 ]  [ N g3 ]  [ N c2 + ]  [ K f2 ]  [ N x a1 + ]  [ K g1 ]  [ N x b3 ]  [ Q x b3 ]  [ Q x b3 ]  [ a x b3 ]  [ B b4 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ a5 ]  [ B x d7 + ] , [ B x d7 ]  White Resigned
 [ N d7 ]  [ R f d1 ] , [ B g5 ]  So far as in Aleksandrov Aleksej (2660) vs. Ehlvest Jaan (2610) ½-½ in 16 moves (13. [ b4 ] [ Q e7 ] 14. [ R a c1 ] [ B h6 ] 15. [ B f1 ] [ g6 ] 16. [ Q c2 ] [ c6 ] draw agreed). I now come up with an alternative move.
 [ N x b2 + ]  [ K c2 ]  [ N x a1 + ]  [ R x a1 ]  [ N a4 ]  [ R b1 ]  [ b6 ]  [ c6 ]  [ d x c6 ]  [ b x c6 ]  [ R a6 ]  [ h4 ]  [ b5 ]  [ R x b5 ]  [ R x c6 + ]  [ K b3 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ R b6 ]  [ N x d7 ]  [ R x b5 + ]  [ K x a4 ]  [ R f b8 ]  [ N x b8 ]  [ R x b8 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ R b2 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ R x f2 ]  [ K b5 ]  [ R x g2 ]  [ a4 ]  [ B d2 ]  [ a5 ]  [ B x a5 ]  [ K x a5 ]  [ R h2 ]  [ K b5 ]  [ R x h4 ]  [ K c5 ]  [ g5 ]  [ N e3 ]  [ g4 ]  [ K d4 ]  [ R h3 ]  [ K e4 ]  [ R x e3 + ]  [ K x e3 ]  [ K g7 ]  [ K f4 ]  [ h5 ]  [ K g3 ]  [ K g6 ]  [ K h4 ]  [ f5 ]  [ K g3 ]  [ K g5 ]  [ K h2 ]  [ K f4 ]  [ K g2 ]  [ h4 ]  [ K h2 ]  [ K f3 ]  [ K g1 ]  [ h3 ]  [ K h2 ]  [ g3 + ]  [ K g1 ]  [ g2 ]  [ K h2 ]  [ K f2 ]  [ K x h3 ]  [ g1 = Q ]  [ K h4 ]  [ Q g6 ]  [ K h3 ] , [ Q h5 # ]  check mate. I didn't even need to annotate the game after his blunder. I won.
 [ Q f3 ] , [ f5 ]  There is Bishop is gone but not before a desperate defence
 [ N d3 + ] , [ K c2 ]  setting up the queen swap where i hold a major advantage
 [ N c3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ e4 ]  [ d6 ] , [ d4 ]  5. [ d4 ] - white is developing a very strong centre. After getting Henry to safety(?) on the kingside this time I do manage to puncture an Expert's strong pawn centre in a timely fashion! At least with the [ g7 ] pawn already moved white would be hard pushed to find a smothered mate here!
 [ B x d4 ]  [ R a e8 ] , [ O-O-O ]  Finally white castles.
 [ h6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ R d c8 ]  [ N f d4 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ a3 ]  [ B d5 ]  [ O-O ] , [ R c3 ]  On move 27 (!!) white can finally castle but black is piling on the pressure.
 [ h4 ]  [ h6 ]  [ K f5 ]  [ R x f3 ]  [ h x g5 ]  [ N e6 + ]  [ K e5 ]  [ h x g5 ]  [ K x d5 ]  [ g4 ]  [ K c4 ] , [ g3 ]  White can't take the b-pawn because of 53...[ g2 ] 54. [ R a1 ] Rf1.
 [ R x a7 ]  [ R x b3 + ] , [ K f4 ]  ?? Getting out of the check in the most aggressive way since the idea is now centralizing my K. I figured that he couldn't do any more damage because I applied what I learned and remembered from a previous mistake that I made by not centralizing my K when at a disadvantage. In this case I mean launching towards the center. However it's a blunder as I will lose another piece. Best was 41.[ K f2 ] One reason for this blunder which is worth is that we're now on low on time. It was 11:50 when I made this move and had to leave in 10 minutes. So this is where things change and I no longer care about the position but rather comparing what I did or a mistake I previously made. Otherwise I felt that I'd make worse mistakes and get mated very quickly. Sure enough the fear of running out of time becomes a reality because it takes a few minutes to make two moves. Therefore this is where I start speeding and go even quicker then what you'd see for even a fast a blitz game.
 [ R x e8 + ] , [ Q x e8 ]  Threatening check queen trade and taking the what? yes the e (now d) pawn.
 [ c5 ]  [ d4 ]  [ e6 ] , [ B e3 ]  Typical attempts at development. I am hoping to mantain control of the middle but it doesn't seem to work so well. He is pulling all the right moves so far.
 [ e4 ] , [ d6 ]  my own defense that I've worked on for several years--designed to get the queens off and get into an endgame faster than usual. Most players are lost without the queen
 [ R g6 ] , [ B x g5 ]  Biting the bullet. 23.[ R h3 ] [ B c5 ] lost the knight instead.
 [ B x f6 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ Q x h6 + ]  [ N h7 ] , [ Q x h7 # ]  A pretty little attack. This game reinforced my disdain for playing the Dutch when I have the black pieces as I am far too conservative defender. Good game ritt:)
 [ N x c7 ] , [ R b8 ]  More or less forced. And now comes the time where I'll exchange. The idea being is to keep Sue's [ B c8 ] locked in since one of the things that you don't is your material tied down like this. It's not throughout the rest of the game but for now it is restricted.
 [ N x d5 ]  [ c x d5 ] , [ Q e7 ]  at last yes.
 [ B a3 ] , [ b5 ]  I try to gain myself some space on the queenside so as to and maybe open up a couple of lines for my rook to operate on
 [ O-O ] , [ N c3 ]  White develops but the Black pieces are better coordinated for attack and he is ahead in development. Whitestill has to make three moves to achieve the opening goals (castling playing the b or d pawn and then developing the [ c1 ] bishop) while Black only needs one move (a developing move of the [ c8 ] bishop). Black has a good game.
 [ K d7 ]  [ B e6 + ] , [ K e8 ]  If White does not want to try and force a draw this is an interesting try.
 [ Q b6 ] , [ b4 ]  Affordable. The pawns are threatening but I have time before they become a real danger.
 [ R x d1 + ]  [ Q x d1 ] , [ h5 ]  Black begins the push in against White's Kingside - looking to hold back his pawns and displace his pieces to allow the King to enter the fight heading after the e-pawn.
 [ K e7 ] , [ N b3 ]  Now where will the Bishop go..??
 [ d6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B e7 ] , [ B e3 ]  putting the bishop on [ [ e3 ] ] instead of G5 is becoming very fashionable lately. It is easy to understand why because on [ g5 ] the bishop get harassed and white has not really gotten any serious advantage from it. Plus the bishop on [ [ e3 ] ] is actually more flexible than on g5. From here it eyes the [ d4 ] square and can assist with queenside attacking stratagies.
 [ R x g2 + ]  [ K f1 ]  [ K e8 ]  [ B x g7 ]  [ R x g7 ]  [ R d2 ]  [ h5 ]  [ b4 ]  [ R d7 ]  [ R x d7 ]  [ K x d7 ]  [ K f2 ] , [ h4 ]  Closes way for whites King to promote h - pawn.
 [ e4 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ N f6 ]  Breyer's line with the development of both Knights before moving a Pawn is peculiarly his own. [Now known as the Breyer Variation of the Niemzowitsch Defense -- LA]
 [ h x g5 ] , [ f x g5 ]  Now I have an open f-file and a strong g-pawn. Even though I only have my queen and rook in the attack I should be able to crush his position once I get the h-pawn rolling.
 [ N f6 ] , [ R e1 ]  White has all of his pieces in the game and his King is safe. Black has only 2 pieces developed weak dark squares an exposed Queen and worst of all his King is caught in the center! White is threatening 16.[ B h6 ] winning material if Black castles on the move.
 [ e5 ]  [ f4 ]  [ e x f4 ]  [ B c4 ] , [ Q h4 + ]  Risky if you are not careful...
 [ B e3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B e2 ]  [ B x c3 + ]  [ b x c3 ] , [ N e4 ]  A Knight outpost at [ e4 ] is well placed in the center.
 [ O-O ] , [ O-O ]  Black already has a slight edge due to the weaknesses of the light squares on the kingside. So like any good general let's go directly for it
 [ c x d5 ]  [ B h2 ]  [ N e3 ]  [ R h5 ] , [ K g2 ]  Why not Ng4? Anyway I can imagine white thoughts: black has a discovered king I have four pieces pointing at it... how can I be in danger? Just some move to take away this fly and I'll will go for a win. But... This move was a mistake. With the next one I go further on with my attack and the queen gets away from the danger zone while the king is fully in it.
 [ R g1 ]  [ N f4 ]  [ K b4 ] , [ b2 ]  
 [ N c4 ] , [ b3 ]  booting the knight out of c4. White can also play [ B x c4 ] with a good game. The text move has the disadvantage of creating a backward B pawn. I would prefer Bxc4.
 [ K b3 ]  [ N x d3 ]  [ N x d3 ]  [ R f3 ]  [ K c4 ]  [ c2 ] , [ K x d4 ]  Taking the pawn in the mistaken belief that the [ c1 ] square is still guarded.
 [ N x d6 + ] , [ Q x d6 ]  ?! cxd consolidates his pawns.
 [ B e3 ]  [ a5 ]  [ B a6 ]  [ R x c1 ]  [ R x c1 ]  [ N f5 ]  [ B f2 ] , [ N g4 ]  [ N g4 ] looks dangerous but it is not the best move. Computer suggests 30. .. e6! or 30. ... d5! preparing to push the pawns. Now white can regroup his pieces.
 [ B x c3 ]  [ B c6 ] , [ B x b2 ]  Equal attacks on the rooks but you are down a pawn.
 [ K g7 ]  [ Q x b6 ] , [ N x a4 ]  27. ..... [ N x a4 ] - now here is that outside passer I am talking about. The Witch is now en prise. That vital precious pawn on [ a5 ] cannot be taken free of charge by the Witch because Glenda is defending it!
 [ Q f4 + ] , [ Q g3 ]  [ K h3 ] also leads to a won endgame for black. This loses immediately...
 [ Q b3 ] , [ B e6 ]  8. [ Q b3 ] is a little bit of a fork. The queen forks black's pawn on [ [ b7 ] ] tying the DSB down to defense and black's pawn on [ f7 ] which comes into real danger after the inevitable 9. Ng5. So I scrounged around for a solution and kept looking at 8. ... Be6. It obviously loses a pawn but it keeps the kingside safe. Is it worth it? So I analyzed it a bit further and realized fairly quickly that the [ [ b7 ] ] pawn is quite safe.
 [ Q x d1 ]  [ R a x d1 ]  [ h6 ] , [ N f3 ]  Well well back where you belong?! White and black overlooked 15 [ N x f7 ] [ R x f7 ] 16 [ B c4 ] Pinning the Rook. Or 15 [ N x f7 ] Kxf7?!
 [ R x c3 ]  [ R x c3 + ]  [ K x c3 ] , [ h5 ]  Oh dear. White is well ahead in the pawn promotion race - by 2 moves.
 [ b5 ]  [ d4 ]  [ a5 ]  [ a4 ]  [ b4 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ c x b4 ]  [ B x e3 ]  [ f x e3 ] , [ a x b4 ]  Now I have a passed pawn.
 [ N x c6 ] , [ b x c6 ]  ? I should have gone for he queen's exchange with complete equality. I was confident I could unpin the c pawn and reach a secure c5-[ e5 ] solid center.
 [ e4 ]  [ e6 ] , [ N f3 ]  my favorite line against what I thought would be the french...
 [ N b3 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ B e3 ] , [ B e6 ]  By the book.
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ c3 ] , [ c x d4 ]  now taking [ d4 ] is forced...
 [ B x e5 + ]  [ R b6 ]  [ B c4 + ]  [ K d7 ]  [ R x a7 + ]  [ K c8 ] , [ R c7 + ]  And black resigned in light of being hopelessly lost. 41... [ K b8 ] walks into a wind mill and 41... [ K d8 ] 42.[ R d1 ] [ Q d2 ] (42... [ K e8 ] 43.[ B x f7 ] [ K f8 ] 44.Re8#) is simply lost he's down two bishop after his queen is taken (sadly white doesn't have 43.[ R h1 ] because of 43... [ R x f6 ] 44.[ B x f6 ] Kxc7). Kamsky pulled off this win by giving up his queen for two pieces in order to place a dominating pawn on [ b7 ] with two very long scoped bishops supporting it that together dominated the board not only that but he opened the a and b files to great effect in the botvinnik black has very loose pawns one of white's goals is to open up files 16.[ R b1 ] goes for that but 16.[ N a4 ] followed by [ a3 ] is another completely viable and very dangerous plan. I think the most remarkable thing about this game is that black got no counterplay (except his slight prayer for a perpetual at the end) in one of the most dicey and counterattacking openings white's queen sacrifice tied Kramnik down completely. Kudos to Kamsky. if you have any comments or variations I'd love to hear it. I'm never sure how many variations to stick in and when to stick to descriptions.
 [ R h6 + ]  [ K c7 ]  [ R x h7 + ] , [ K c8 ]  forced mate in 4 moves here again i made conditional moves except the last one( because in conditional moves there's no option to choose what will pawn promote into...it says [ e8 = Q # ] but just wanted to make sure) if anyone tried that let me know was it really a queen :)
 [ h x g6 ] , [ Q x g6 ]  [ Q g7 # ] is the threat. As is [ B h6 ]  [ R h7 ] , [ R g4 ]  This isn't exactly winning. Funny that my bishop is still hanging though. I was really considering following up with 23. [ B h6 ] to finally crash through with 24. Bg7+. Note 23. ... [ B f8 ] fails to Qg8#. However the following move caught me by surprise.
 [ B e6 ] , [ h3 ]  Creating an air luft for the King and Bishop
 [ B b3 ] , [ R e8 ]  I can now prevent him from taking pieces with his [ e4 ] pawn because I have mated the rook and Queen. I later decide to capitalize on this weakness in his defense.
 [ O-O ]  [ h3 ] , [ B d7 ]  10. ...... [ B d7 ] - black chooses to retreat his lsb.
 [ N x f1 ]  [ B x f1 ]  [ O-O ] , [ B x c3 ]  one good thing in all that is that I can finally retake this bloody C3 pawn !
 [ Q d2 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ N b c6 ] , [ R a d1 ]  White is mounting pressure in the center.
 [ e4 ] , [ d5 ]  Learned a new thing from this opening; try not to lose your queen if possible.
 [ f x e4 ]  [ d x e4 ] , [ N c3 ]  I decided to bring out one of my knights based on the AP assessment. That is because I am now threatening to capture his free e pawn with [ N x e4 ] in this position. If this happens he will not be able to recapture my knight with [ Q x e4 ] or he will loose the queen because I will respond with Qxe4.
 [ R x d1 ] , [ R x d1 + ]  White graciously resigned.
 [ c4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ g3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B g2 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ O-O ] , [ O-O ]  I don`t like the Black structure. What about you?
 [ a5 ] , [ a4 ]  my note: 18 maybe a4? [ a3 ] looks like bad news with the placement of his dark bishop and stuff.

 [ N e4 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ B x e4 ]  [ h6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ N d2 ]  [ K h8 ]  [ B g2 ]  [ e5 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ a4 ]  [ h3 ]  [ b3 ]  [ a x b3 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ b x a4 ]  [ Q c8 ]  [ Q b3 ]  [ B c6 ]  [ Q c2 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ B x c6 ] , [ Q x c6 ]  I still hate my position.
 [ B e2 ]  [ Q e7 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ N d7 ]  The knight move opens up for castling and prepares for [ N c5 ] which is a good strategic position.
 [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B b5 ] , [ f5 ]  I forget what it's called as it's not KG but similar. However it is a gambit that ION tries.
 [ B g4 ]  [ Q e4 ] , [ R a d8 ]  the second rook has arrived to the party.
 [ R a6 ]  [ Q e7 ] , [ N x d7 ]  32. ....... [ N x d7 ] - I decide to take the rook as my knight is not pinned however the rook is poisoned because next move I cop Old Matey with the Wicked Witch landing on g5. Sigh and double sigh. My only consolation was that the game was unrated. Hope you have had a good read. Bye for now. Joanne
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ B b5 ]  So it's a Ruy Lopez.
 [ N f6 ] , [ B e3 ]  Dumb move on my part. Just wasted a move since I will move the bishop again. I would have been better of with [ B c4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ B b4 ] , [ Q e2 ]  Another dumb move I can't explain today.
 [ N x f6 + ] , [ g x f6 ]  This is probably a little unsound but the open lines give Black good practical chances.
 [ N f6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ c4 ] , [ N c6 ]  ! Freddy varies first. In my previous game Black never even go to move this N. Black immediately counter-attacks.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ d4 ]  Scotch game. I play the Scotch to avoid book lines and develop my own theories in chess. It is good to know self knowledge when your in middle and end games.
 [ Q d1 + ]  [ Q x d1 ]  [ c x d1 = Q + ]  [ K x d1 ] , [ K g7 ]  This move would have put a bind on my two rooks if the e6-pawn wasn't hanging
 [ B a4 ]  [ Q c3 ] , [ O-O ]  finally.
 [ h3 ] , [ N x c7 ]  ...but in addition now the N is also lost without hope! I swear white though he was winning most of the game...
 [ N c6 ] , [ e3 ]  Black has the option of a Sicilian Dragon type setup with d7-[ d6 ] shutting the Knight out of [ e5 ] and g7-[ g6 ] and B8-[ g7 ] bringing pressure along the a1-[ h8 ] diagonal. White decides to counter by forcing an immediate d2-[ d4 ] but Black already has a slight pull because of the awkwardness of White's pawn structure.
 [ Q x d2 ]  [ Q f7 ]  [ B g2 ] , [ O-O-O ]  Black finally has a moment to castle with tempo.
 [ h6 ] , [ B e3 ]  The bishop is in the way there but there aren't many places for it to go and I didn't want to help him develop his Ng8.
 [ R x a1 ]  [ B x a1 ] , [ g4 ]  Creating the passed pawn now!
 [ R x e4 ]  [ f3 ] , [ Q e3 ]  so dangerous pawn most of the time i loose with good player is a question of pawns !
 [ N a3 ]  [ Q d7 ]  [ N c4 ] , [ Q d8 ]  Black queen is back from trip d8-a5-b5-d7-[ d8 ] to starting position. was it worth 4 moves? Maybe somewhere here we can find co-reason of final result
 [ B d6 ]  [ N c2 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ N f8 ]  [ N e3 ]  [ N g6 ] , [ g3 ]  This move not only keeps Black's Knight from [ K B5 ] it also prepares the strategically important move P-KB4.
 [ b5 ] , [ a x b5 ]  This is best of a bad bunch.
 [ Q e7 ] , [ N b5 ]  Advancing my Knight into an attacking position.
 [ N b4 ] , [ Q d1 ]  I considered this the only move to prevent [ N d3 ] followed by Qf2#. Actually after 17. [ Q a4 ] [ N d3 ] 18. [ K e2 ] [ Q f2 + ] 19. [ K d1 ] [ Q x g2 ] there is no mat (black is wining still)
 [ K g2 ] , [ b5 ]  And now we just waste some time...
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ B c4 ] , [ N c6 ]  I am trying the Sicilian Defense here. Let's see how it works out.
 [ e x f6 ]  [ e ] , [ p ]  There you go En Passant! En Passant in English means "in passing" Here is the rules for En Passant: 1.The enemy Pawn must be on its second row. 2.The option is triggered as soon as the enemy Pawn advances two squares. 3.The option is lost if not used immediately. So now you've got it use this move to confuse your opponent. If he calls you a cheater bring him here.
 [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ N c6 ]  I'm so used to seeing 2...[ c6 ] But Charles has played this before. It can either be the opened or closed variation as he annotated a while back.
 [ N d4 ] , [ a7 ]  61. [ a7 ] - although black can now win the f pawn Julia cannot stop me from crowning on a8. Julia now throws in the sponge. Julia and I have played 3 unrated games. I lost the first one drew the second and now won the third so we are level on 1.5-1.5!
 [ Q a3 + ]  [ K c2 ]  [ Q a2 + ] , [ K d3 ]  My only chance to stop the checks is going with the king in his own territory.
 [ K f8 ]  [ e4 ] , [ K e7 ]  I got lucky because my opponent made a blunder the mistake which should have won me the game
 [ K d7 ]  [ K e3 ]  [ R a4 ]  [ g4 ]  [ h4 ]  [ K d3 ]  [ R f4 ]  [ K e3 ]  [ e5 ]  [ R d3 + ]  [ K e7 ]  [ R c3 ]  [ K d7 ]  [ R d3 + ] , [ K c7 ]  I thought it was draw.
 [ Q g8 + ] , [ N f8 ]  Well and now since my bishop is pinned and undefended...
 [ O-O-O ] , [ b5 ]  ? This on the other hand is definitely a mistake. Because of the potential for discovered attacks against the BQ White now has his choice of free pawns to grab--[ b5 ] or g6. Besides that this pawn push creates even more weak dark squares that Black is powerless to defend.
 [ N c3 ] , [ Q f6 ]  This move does look good but I think black is over estimating their chances on f2. Alternative variation: 17... [ B x c3 + ] 18. [ b x c3 ] [ B g4 ] 19. [ f3 ] [ B e6 ] 20. [ K f2 ] maybe black's only opportunity to get out with a draw.
 [ B x d2 + ]  [ Q x d2 ] , [ Q x f6 ]  I exchanged bishop for bishop he exchanged pawn for knight so I came a pawn up after all the minor pieces have left the table. Being a pawn up I thought "well if only I could exchange the rest of the pieces I would have a very good chance to win this". With all the pieces gone I would have essentially a won game. But how do you win a "won game"?
 [ Q g3 ]  [ Q c4 + ]  [ K g1 ]  [ c2 ]  [ Q e1 ] , [ Q d5 ]  resigns!!! why: [ Q x g2 ] mate or r[ d1 ] winning!! please leave a comment or two and rate it on the star system!! thank you
 [ h6 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ c5 ] , [ N x f6 + ]  With this line I almost always trade [ N f3 ] away on f6. Normally I get doubled pawns which is normally always a good thing.
 [ R x e5 ]  [ Q f2 ]  [ Q e7 ] , [ d6 ]  22.d6? why not 22.[ B x c5 ] but I guess I get it anyway on move 24.
 [ b x c4 ] , [ b x c4 ]  At least this advanced pawn is now isolated but I have to keep it under surveillance.
 [ b x a5 ] , [ R x a5 ]  the silver line is Black might spend time in repositioning the rook
 [ R x d8 ]  [ R x c6 ]  [ R e8 ] , [ R x c7 ]  Now 39..[ e3 ] wins because after 40.[ K g1 ] [ K f7 ] 41.[ R a7 ] [ R x e7 ] 42.[ R x e7 ] [ K x e7 ] black has a far-passed pawn.
 [ K g6 ] , [ K x g4 ]  He resigned -- After [ K h6 ] [ K x f5 ] and [ K h5 ] [ Q h7 ] mate. I hope that you liked it? Please leave a comment and rate it on the star system thanks.
 [ g x f6 ] , [ Q x e4 ]  Black's two remaining pieces are still on their starting squares after 25 moves his King's castle is full of holes and on top of it all a Queen for is threatened.
 [ d5 ]  [ e5 ] , [ N h6 ]  Heading to [ f5 ] where Knight can control d4.
 [ K f6 ]  [ R b8 ] , [ B d1 ]  black misses another opportunity. in retrospect this game may be too sloppy to annotate...
 [ d5 ]  [ N b4 ]  [ N d4 ] , [ B g6 ]  Alternative variation: 11...[ B d7 ] 12.[ a3 ] [ N a6 ] 13.[ b4 ] [ c5 ] 14.[ d x c6 ] [ b x c6 ]  [ f4 ]  [ h6 ]  [ f5 ]  [ B h7 ]  [ a3 ]  [ N a6 ]  [ B e3 ] , [ N d7 ]  Alternative variation: 15...[ B f6 ] 16.[ N e4 ] [ B e5 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ R f3 ]  [ N g4 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ d x c6 ]  [ e ]  [ p ]  [ b x c6 ] , [ R g3 ]  Alternative variation: 20.[ N x c6 ] [ Q b6 + ] 21.[ R e3 ] [ Q x c6 ] 22.[ B x g4 ]  [ h5 ] , [ B x g4 ]  Alternative variation: 21.[ c5 ] Nx[ c5 ] 22.[ N x c6 ] [ Q d7 ] 23.[ N x e7 + ] [ Q x e7 ] 24.[ B x g4 ] [ h x g4 ] 25.[ B x d6 ]  [ h x g4 ]  [ R x g4 ]  [ K h8 ]  [ K h1 ]  [ R c8 ]  [ B g5 ] , [ c5 ]  Alternative variation: 24...[ B x g5 ] 25.[ R x g5 ] [ N c5 ]  [ B x e7 ]  [ Q x e7 ]  [ N d5 ] , [ Q d7 ]  Alternative variation: 26...[ Q d8 ] 27.[ f6 ]  [ R x g7 ]  [ K x g7 ]  [ Q g5 + ]  [ K h8 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ Q d8 ]  [ Q h6 ]  [ Q x f6 ]  [ Q x f6 + ]  [ K g8 ]  [ R f1 ]  [ N c7 ]  [ R f3 ]  [ N e8 ]  [ R g3 + ]  [ B g6 ]  [ Q g5 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ f x g6 ]  [ f6 ]  [ Q h6 ]  [ R c7 ] , [ R h3 ]  
 [ B c5 ]  [ d3 ]  [ d6 ] , [ B g5 ]  pins the knight and adds another attacker
 [ Q x g1 + ]  [ K x g1 ]  [ R x f1 + ] , [ K x f1 ]  33. [ K x f1 ] - Coach Ion is very willing to exchange down into an endgame knowing my partiality for this. But as you will see it will be on his terms and that bodes ill for me.
 [ N c8 ]  [ B c5 ] , [ N e7 ]  Hastily rushing to the K-side to defend.
 [ a4 ]  [ b6 + ]  [ K b7 ]  [ N e d6 + ]  [ K b8 ] , [ N a5 ]  i guess white?
 [ Q x f3 ]  [ g x f3 ] , [ N b3 ]  As noted this was my plan behind 5...Na5. But it's in a better context now because protecting [ R a1 ] means further liquidation.
 [ d6 ]  [ O-O ] , [ g5 ]  The fisrt shot.
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ g6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ B g7 ]  We play into the King's Indian defense
 [ c4 ] , [ Q x a8 ]  I pounce on that knight before white sees the opportunity I mentioned in my last note. Get it now while the getting is good.
 [ N e4 ]  [ R e2 ] , [ B f5 ]  not really threatening anything hug but just a scary looking move
 [ Q b3 ] , [ Q h4 + ]  I exploit the fact that White failed to secure his King's safety by castling earlier.
 [ d4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ c4 ]  Protecting the spearhead at d5.
 [ g5 ] , [ R f e1 ]  I thought 17. fxg e.p. just wrecked my kingside even more
 [ Q x d8 ]  [ R x d8 ]  [ R e1 ] , [ N c6 ]  Defending the pawn.
 [ K h2 ]  [ N x f2 ] , [ R e1 ]  I have no idea why white would instigate a trade here. I guess he is trying to find a way to coax out the [ B g7 ] and attempt a 3 move repetition.
 [ Q d2 ]  [ f6 ]  [ Q x h6 ] , [ Q e7 ]  I have to focus on defense.
 [ B f7 ] , [ Q c2 ]  Aiming at his castled position and further reinforcing e4.
 [ N x d5 ] , [ h3 ]  Creating an outlet for the King and putting a question to [ B g4 ] ([ B f3 ] [ B h5 ] or Bf5?) but also slightly weakening the castling position. ----- I need to clarify that - since Black's pieces are active this is a potential weakness. If Black was passive or White equally active this would not be a weakness.
 [ a x b5 ]  [ c x b5 ]  [ B x b5 + ]  [ N d7 ]  [ Q x b3 ] , [ N g f6 ]  Where is the weakness in black's position?
 [ a6 ] , [ a4 ]  Preventing 9...b5. But I've rather handed the initiative to Black.
 [ b4 ]  [ R h5 ]  [ Q d6 ]  [ R c h8 ]  [ Q e7 + ]  [ K g8 ]  [ a4 ]  [ R h5 x h2 + ]  [ K c3 ]  [ R h2 h7 ]  [ Q e6 + ]  [ K g7 ]  [ Q x a6 ]  [ K h6 ]  [ b5 ]  [ K h5 ]  [ b6 ]  [ R g7 ]  [ Q b5 + ]  [ g5 ]  [ a5 ]  [ K h4 ]  [ b7 ]  [ R g g8 ]  [ a6 ]  [ g4 ] , [ a7 ]  As the computer analysis showed there were plenty of chance to improve on the play here on both sides. But I loved how this one played out. My 2nd favorite win to date.
 [ K e2 ]  [ N b1 ]  [ R g8 ] , [ N c3 + ]  A much better knight fork.
 [ B c8 ] , [ B g5 ]  Trying to weaken [ d6 ]  [ K e2 ] , [ B d4 ]  Threatening [ B x f2 ]  [ K d1 ] , [ h5 ]  I just found a wicked defensive resources that will save the game!
 [ e5 ] , [ Q b6 ]  And still everything going to plan and my opponent did hardly think for a second before playing this.
 [ K g8 ] , [ Q d4 ]  threatening mate on [ h8 ]  [ K f8 ] , [ Q h6 + ]  searching the good combination
 [ Q e7 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ e4 ]  [ c x d5 ] , [ c x d5 ]  That pawn center has become a closed center (temporarily). But his pawn chain is more vulnerable than mine.
 [ Q c3 + ]  [ K e2 ]  [ B x g6 ]  [ h x g6 ] , [ N x c4 ]  Premature sac. Apparently Black missed that their attacking forces are Queen and only black-pole bishop. White King has many places to run.
 [ b6 ] , [ f3 ]  P[ e5 ] might have been kind of clever too. Although black could respond [ h5 ] PxP does a good job of splitting black's castle pawns.
 [ e4 ]  [ e6 ] , [ d3 ]  Not sure what this is called but I'm coming up against it more and more recently
 [ b x c6 ] , [ Q d3 ]  Decent play. More common is [ B d3 ] continuing development and preparing for a castle. If you want to move the queen I might also consider [ Q d4 ] or Qf3. [ B d2 ] is also a strong contender...
 [ B g8 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ Q a3 ] , [ R e8 ]  Good controlling e3.
 [ B d3 ] , [ a6 ]  This is unnecessary better and more accurate was 5...c5. The move [ N b5 ] has often caused issues to I tend to throw in ...[ a6 ] as prophylaxis. In some lines this move is necessary to prevent [ N b5 ] followed by [ N [ d6 ] ] but you can generally just counter [ N b5 ] with ...[ f6 ] anyway undermining the [ d6 ] hole. Alternative variation: [Better was just ] 5... [ c5 ] [followed by] 6. [ f4 ] [ N c6 ] 7. [ N f3 ] [ N x d4 ] 8. O-O [ N x f3 + ] 9. [ Q x f3 ]  [ c x d3 ] , [ e x f7 + ]  I can see why white plays this but better was Alternative variation: 9. [ e x d7 + ] [when] [ B x d7 ] 10. [ Q x d3 ] [ N c6 ] [ which is slightly better for white however there's no clear counterplay in that line which is probably why white went for 9.exf7+. I need to defend precisely now.]
 [ O-O ]  [ N f3 ] , [ B g4 ]  I think at this point white is feeling a little constrained that was certainly my intention.
 [ e x d5 ]  [ R d1 ] , [ d4 ]  An attempt to salvage something? No. White has seen this coming and knows that the black queen can be forced out of the game.
 [ B f4 ] , [ Q e7 ]  So now I had to defend my [ d4 ] pawn. I decided that [ Q e3 ] is the best cause it prevents [ e5 ] and [ N h6 ] at the same time.
 [ N f3 ]  [ N d7 ] , [ h5 ]  'In your face!' Forced the bishop back to [ h7 ] but there the bishop is quite snug its gaze firmly fixed down the h7-[ b1 ] diagonal.
 [ c4 ]  [ N b6 ]  [ d5 ] , [ N d4 ]  Loses a pawn but there isn't much better. [ N e7 ] moving the knight back to [ c6 ] if I play d5-[ d6 ] and f7-[ f6 ] to release the dark squared bishop but black still has the problem of his other bishop.
 [ R c8 ] , [ R d6 ]  elevating the rook and attacking the knight
 [ a6 ] , [ B d2 ]  13.[ B f4 ] might be better here but again I had almost no idea what to do at this point.
 [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ B c4 ] , [ B g4 ]  I don't hurry in preparing my castle on king side.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ] , [ f4 ]  ?! It starts here with -0.33/30 (2. [ N f3 ] +0.24/26 2... [ N c6 ] 3. [ B b5 ] [ N f6 ] 4. O-O [ N x e4 ] 5. [ d4 ] [ B e7 ] 6. [ R e1 ] [ N d6 ] 7. [ B x c6 ] [ d x c6 ] 8. [ d x e5 ] [ N f5 ] 9. [ Q x d8 + ] [ B x d8 ] 10. [ a4 ] [ B e6 ] 11. [ N c3 ] O-O 12. [ b3 ] [ B e7 ] 13. [ N e4 ] [ R f d8 ] 14. [ B g5 ] [ h6 ] 15. [ B x e7 ] [ N x e7 ] 16. [ N c5 ] [ b6 ] )
 [ h3 ] , [ B e7 ]  The usual move here is 11...[ [ g6 ] ] although this move looks better because it does not weaken the kingside like the "normal" line of 11...[ [ g6 ] ] and 12...h5. However it will lead to the loss of the [ d6 ] pawn in three moves (and eventually the game) but Black is hoping to have enough compensation for the pawn in unleashing a vicious queenside attack on White's king...
 [ g4 ] , [ h4 ]  !
 [ c4 ] , [ R d8 ]  If White wants this diagonal he's going to have to pay for it.
 [ R c4 ] , [ b3 ]  29. [ b3 ] - black's move looked aggressive but I think I can foil his plans. Whatever I do though I must not put Henry on [ d3 ] - can you see why not?
 [ f x g6 ] , [ R f1 ]  It gives white again the mate threat with Qb8+. Leontxo says "Not falling in the trap 26... NxNc3? 27. N[ x N c3 ] B[ x N c3 ] 28. b[ x B c3 ] [ Q x c3 + ] 29. [ R b2 ] RxRb2? 30. Qx[ R b2 ] Q[ x B e3 ] 31. [ Q b8 + ] and mate."
 [ f3 ]  [ R h8 ]  [ O-O-O ] , [ Q c7 ]  14. ...[ a5 ] was probably more accurate.
 [ B h6 ] , [ B f8 ]  Ending the attack. Fortunately White cannot easily bring additional pieces to bear as his forces are scattered and isolated.
 [ N x c6 ]  [ d x c6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ b5 ] , [ B e2 ]  The seemingly more logical 9.[ B b3 ] fails to 9...[ B g4 ] 10.[ Q e1 ] [or 10.[ N e2 ] [ R x e4 ] winning the pinned Knight] 10...[ b4 ] and if 11.[ N a4 ] [ R x e4 ] traps the White Queen.
 [ B x c6 ]  [ d x c6 ] , [ N x e5 ]  Black has lost a pawn but has the ability to develope the centre pieces more quickly.
 [ B h4 ] , [ B f5 ]  ?? Completing his development. But reversion thinks that this is the losing move which is why I'm giving it two queries. In it he said ..."7...[ B e7 ] is probably Black's best option there having in mind something like 8.[ B d3 ] [ N e4 ] 9.[ B x e7 ] [ N x c3 ] 10.[ B x d8 ] [ N x d1 ] 11.[ R x d1 ] [ K x d8 ] with a likely draw."
 [ B g7 ] , [ B d3 ]  ? [ h3 ] would have been profilactic but I intended to use the h pawn to break the black kinside pawns.
 [ c5 ]  [ d5 ]  [ h6 ]  [ B e3 ] , [ N b d7 ]  8...[ e6 ] is usually necessary trading a set of pawns and giving Black much needed space.
 [ R a e2 ]  [ b5 ]  [ R e5 ]  [ K h7 ]  [ R x h5 ]  [ R d8 ]  [ R f4 ]  [ R g8 ]  [ R d4 ]  [ B d5 ]  [ K e2 ]  [ R g6 ]  [ R f4 ]  [ K g8 ] , [ R f2 ]  At this point the game descends into farce with me in terrible time trouble. White sportingly agreed a draw after several more moves made in the last minute on the clock.
 [ Q x f3 ] , [ b5 ]  Gaining space for development with tempo. I'm looking to attack the queenside before he can get things going on the kingside.
 [ B x d4 ]  [ B x d4 ]  [ Q x d4 + ] , [ K h1 ]  no more [ f6 ] attack and i'm -2 i will try to attack this black queen
 [ R b3 b5 ]  [ N x c4 ]  [ R c5 ]  [ b3 ] , [ N g4 ]  This looks a bit random but I was desperate to prevent White from playing [ B e3 ] when I'd lose what little initiative I had.
 [ R e c6 ]  [ Q b1 + ]  [ K a5 ]  [ Q x a2 + ]  [ K b6 ]  [ Q g2 ]  [ R c6 c7 + ]  [ K e6 ]  [ R c5 c6 + ]  [ K f5 ]  [ R f7 + ]  [ K g4 ]  [ R g6 + ] , [ K f3 ]  Safety.
 [ K f3 ]  [ R c3 + ] , [ K g4 ]  wrong way but death coming anyway
 [ K d2 ] , [ R f7 f2 + ]  i will try to send a rook in his camp to take some paws and do some damages
 [ B b4 ] , [ Q d3 ]  In my opinion this isn't exactly a blunder ([ Q d3 ] the game is still even) it's an ok move. I planned from here what I wanted to do and it worked out due to a blunder by my opponent it was all avoidable of course but so are most things in chess and I felt good that it paid off.
 [ d6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ O-O ] , [ Q c7 ]  Instead of castling which is interesting. Black has still the possibility to do the long or the short castling leaving white to decide to either attack on King's or Queen's flank. I was not sure what to do here so I opted for a I think slow move but safe.
 [ K f4 ]  [ R h5 ]  [ R a6 + ]  [ K g7 ]  [ g4 ]  [ R h4 ]  [ K g5 ] , [ R h1 ]  giving me more options for my rook
 [ B x f3 ]  [ Q x f3 ]  [ Q x f3 ]  [ g x f3 ] , [ N f5 ]  Now white's pawns are weak everywhere. all islands.
 [ N x f4 + ] , [ Q x h5 ]  I really had no choice but to trade Q's. I am way ahead on points so the trade favors me.
 [ B x c6 ]  [ d x c6 ] , [ N f3 ]  I respond by transposing the King's Pawn Play or Ruy Lopez opening into the King's Knight Opening.
 [ K e2 ] , [ d1 = Q # ]  
 [ Q h4 + ]  [ Q x h4 + ] , [ K x h4 ]  White has allowed the queens to be exchanged off which seems to be playing into my hands as I have an extra passed pawn.
 [ N e8 ] , [ B x e7 ]  If immediately 13. ... [ N x e7 ] then 14. [ g4 ] etc.
 [ N f4 ] , [ R a4 ]  Aiming to double rooks.
 [ N d2 ]  [ f6 ] , [ N e4 ]  White problems become clear [ B h4 ] fails because of [ N e3 + ] At this point white starts paying well though often finding a way out where no rescoue seems possible anymore.
 [ d4 ] , [ B g4 ]  Now I'm trying to trade off my bad bishop for his good bishop!
 [ B x d7 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ B x b4 ]  [ N a6 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ R e6 ]  [ R a d1 ]  [ R c8 ] , [ N c5 ]  By this time I realized that though we were technically even my sets of pawns were connected while black's weren't on the queenside. I judged this as an advantage and with a lack of other plans just tried to keep initiative and trade down to where my connected pawns might prove more decisive. Plus 21. ...[ N x c5 ] 22. [ B x c5 ] puts my bishop at a point of attack on black's pawn allowing me to keep initiative.
 [ R f x f2 ]  [ R x h5 + ] , [ K g4 ]  As in the process his Rook is attacked.
 [ N x f6 + ]  [ N x f6 ] , [ Q x f6 ]  And if he takes my rook I win both of his.
 [ d5 ]  [ Q a4 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ B d7 ] , [ Q x e4 ]  a point up and it opens the e file to the king
 [ K e2 ]  [ Q c4 + ]  [ K d2 ]  [ Q f4 + ] , [ Q e3 ]  Good. Cuts down Black's options.
 [ K a8 ]  [ R x d7 ]  [ R x a5 ] , [ R d8 ]  And black resigned. After all a pretty strange but also interesting game I find. Hope you enjoyed it. What makes it even more special is that it allowed me to pass 2000 points for the first time ;-) (while I think I still play worse than most 1900's but well)
 [ R b6 ] , [ R d3 ]  .
 [ R x f5 ]  [ Q x f5 ] , [ Q d3 ]  An attempt to coordinate pieces that are all over the board. Black also attacks the bishop on g3.
 [ B f4 ] , [ B b4 + ]  The bishop check allows black to trade down an awkward pawn for White's c pawn however Black would have been better to continue development at this point. Pushing the d pawn to allow for the development of his WSB and to help prepare to castle would have been better.
 [ N x g4 + ] , [ K f3 ]  Into the frying pan!...Have to protect e3. If 17....n[ x [ e3 ] ] 18.[ Q d3 ] is a possibility with a double attack on [ e3 ] and h7+. If 17....[ Q f6 + ] !8.n[ d f4 ] ....[ g6 ] 19.Qd4! which eases some of my problems. Have to try it...cheap shot! Oh $%£! She also has a free move with the knight because of the sqewer on the Queen. I did see this earlier but was only thinking of N25 but of course she will probably play n[ x [ e3 ] ] and I am toast. I could still play Q [ d4 ] but her attack looks 100% fatal.
 [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B c4 ] , [ d5 ]  Cutting off the potential attack at [ K B2 ] the natural weak spot in all K-side openings.
 [ b x c6 ]  [ Q x c6 ] , [ c5 ]  18. [ c5 ] - here it looks as though I am about to drop the exchange. I decided to save my weak [ [ d6 ] ] pawn and allow the skewer. Now you would not see that weak little [ [ d6 ] ] pawn as a berserker would you?
 [ B d2 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ Q g4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ Q x g7 ]  [ R g8 ]  [ Q h6 ]  [ Q x d4 ]  [ O-O-O ]  [ R g6 ]  [ Q h4 ]  [ R g4 ] , [ Q h3 ]  The sac of the d and f pawns is "book" and presented before this in Watson's first "Play The French". After his [ Q h3 ] it was important to get my Queen off the d-file as well. If I did not get to make a move 10 then he could play the powerful 11.[ B g5 ] which would force material concession from BL by 11...[ Q x d1 + ] 12.[ K x d1 ] [ R x g5 ] since the [ Q e5 ] retreat drops a Rook: 11...Qe5? 12.Qxg4!! Nxg4?? 13.Rd8#. OUCH~! Inferior to the shocking 12.[ Q x [ g4 ] ] would be the more routine looking 12.[ B x f6 ] which still leaves my R on [ g4 ] hanging again concurrent with the threat of 13.[ R d8 # ] BUT then BL has the resource of playing Qf4+! 13.[ K b1 ] and following that with Mate defense by use of a minor piece [such as ...Nd7] while his Q keeps guard of his Rook.
 [ Q x h3 + ]  [ Q h2 ]  [ Q x h2 + ]  [ K x h2 ]  [ N x c7 ] , [ R x c7 + ]  A +2 engame is not bad... well +1!
 [ R c8 ]  [ h4 ] , [ Q a5 ]  attackind thes weak sqaueres and controling the 5th rank .
 [ g4 ]  [ h x g4 ] , [ B x g4 ]  wrong way to capture! Bishops are better in the endgame so do not be in a hurry to exchange them .
 [ Q a5 ] , [ O-O-O ]  Sketch! But 13...[ B x c3 ] 14. [ N x c3 ] Nc5? with a possibility of sacking on [ b3 ] seems to be black's only quick way of taking advantage of the weak castle and I feel confident that I can still run a hurry-up offense on the king side.
 [ R e5 + ]  [ g5 ]  [ R x c5 ]  [ B b6 ]  [ R f5 ]  [ B c7 + ] , [ K g2 ]  Better was 39.[ f4 ] (Black can't capture it since his g-pawn is pinned).
 [ Q x d3 ]  [ R c8 ]  [ b3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B b2 ]  [ R f d8 ]  [ Q e4 ] , [ B b4 ]  Alternative variation: 19... [ b5 ] 20. ax[ b5 ] ax[ b5 ] 21. [ N a3 ] [ B x a3 ] 22. [ B x a3 ] [ Q c3 ] 23. [ N d4 ] [ b4 ] 24. [ R a c1 ] [ N c5 ] 25. [ R x c3 ] [ N x e4 ] 26. [ R x c8 ] [ R x c8 ] 27. [ B b2 ] [ N f4 ] $17 Alternative variation: 19... [ B f8 ] $5
 [ B d2 ]  [ Q b6 ] , [ Q a4 ]  White still eyes [ c7 ] using the discovered check to pick up the rook.
 [ e6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B b4 ]  [ e5 ] , [ a6 ]  ?! If this is a line in the winnawer I am unaware of it. One of the main continuations is ...[ [ c5 ] ] [ a3 ] [ B x c3 ] [ b x c3 ] but I prefer on ...[ [ c5 ] ] to go [ B d2 ] cd [ N b5 ]  [ Q g4 ] , [ B f8 ]  Certainly an option but black has lost some time with his [ a6 ] maneauver and now this retreat. Combined with [ N e7 ] this [ B f8 ] idea after [ Q g4 ] is not so bad but here it seems different.
 [ a5 ] , [ N g5 ]  Trying to check mate... Who wouldn't see that? I should have developped another piece instead or castling
 [ B x b2 ]  [ B x h7 + ]  [ K x h7 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ N g5 + ]  [ K g8 ]  [ R c b1 ]  [ B f6 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ Q e3 ]  [ b5 ]  [ Q h3 ]  [ Q f4 ]  [ R e3 ]  [ Q h6 ]  [ Q g4 ]  [ R a d8 ]  [ R h3 ]  [ Q g6 ]  [ Q f3 ]  [ R d5 ]  [ R g3 ]  [ Q h7 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ B h4 ]  [ R h3 ]  [ R h5 ] , [ Q g4 ]  Another move inviting Bishop to remove the defenses of the White king! May be risky both ways !
 [ Q e7 ]  [ N a4 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ N c6 ]  Finally got around to developing that knight.
 [ K b8 ] , [ Q a6 ]  I could take the undefended queen but why bother? In fact 24. Nxf8? deserves a ? in this position. Not counting deliberate queen sacrifices how often is capturing a free queen the inferior move? As played white threatens 25. [ Q a8 ] and there's nothing black can do to stop it.
 [ f6 ] , [ N d3 ]  I hope in e5: it will close the position and maybe I can defend all with my K's help.
 [ Q f3 ] , [ O-O-O ]  16. ....... 0-0-0 - the Wicked Witch of the West is attacking b7. Henry must therefore go queenside.
 [ B a6 ] , [ N d5 ]  The difference with 19...[ N e8 ] is the tempo! I was thinking in play 20 Rb1!. Now this move isn't possible
 [ B g4 + ]  [ f3 ]  [ B h5 ]  [ h4 ]  [ O-O ]  [ g4 ]  [ B g6 ]  [ b3 ]  [ B x d3 + ]  [ K x d3 ]  [ R f e8 ]  [ R a c1 ]  [ c5 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ R a c8 ]  [ d x c5 ] , [ N d7 ]  [ N x c5 ] is better
 [ c x d4 ] , [ c x d4 ]  Now i have some first trpp to play : 7. [ c x d4 ] - [ B f5 ] 8. ... - [ B x b1 ] 9. [ R x b1 ] - [ Q a5 + ] ! 10. ... - [ Q x a2 ] i learn it whith a norvegian blitz challenger
 [ e6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ d5 ] , [ e5 ]  Transposes to the Advance Variation of the French Defense.
 [ b5 ]  [ R b6 ] , [ R b3 ]  My pawn now has some cover
 [ N x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ g4 ]  [ R g8 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ f6 ]  [ e x f6 ]  [ Q x f6 ] , [ Q e2 ]  With this move white can take P[ g5 ] for free with Bxpg5+. Black will play [ K f7 ] to protect Bh6. To defend against this black should play [ K f7 ] now. Otherwise [ Q e6 ] gives white [ B h6 ] for free too. Even better for white would be Bf4+. The rook at [ b8 ] is worth 5 points while the bishop and pawn add to only four. More pieces but less aggregate value. Black could also play [ K d8 ] preserving the [ R f8 ] threat to Nf3. White's response to that would be Ne5.
 [ Q f7 ] , [ N f h5 ]  Double-attack on the Black KBP. The more I can increase my material advantage the better.
 [ d x e6 ] , [ B x e6 ]  Black is ahead in developement... just a bit since his pieces are not aggressively placed
 [ Q g2 + ]  [ K e1 ] , [ Q e2 # ]  Overall I love bloodbaths. Lesson learned: don't offer trapped pieces a way out. That's where White's game really went to crap. Also that fiancehttos don't work.
 [ B x f1 ] , [ K x f1 ]  ? Maybe this deserves a question mark maybe not. Why not capture with the bishop or queen and take control of the diagonal which Black will have a hard time contesting.
 [ N c3 ]  [ d x c4 ] , [ B x c4 ]  but he loses it almost immediately. He should not have traded - his pawn had protection from his queen and could have even further protection with 3...[ N f6 ]  [ B d6 ] , [ N f3 ]  bringing out both my knights and preparing to castle
 [ K x b6 ]  [ Q b5 + ]  [ K a7 ] , [ Q x a5 + ]  Having garnered a B+P for the Rook Mieses already has back practically full compensation for the exchange. Of course he also sacrificed a pawn to open the b-file. But the open file is worth far more to White than the pawn is to Black.
 [ N c5 ] , [ c3 ]  Both players are declining to take needless exchanges. Evidently we both like to keep things complicated.
 [ B b2 ] , [ e6 ]  Deep Blue looks for a Queen side attack and to hold Kasparov to his home defense (nothing past the 3rd row) by taking control of the center.
 [ b x a4 ] , [ N c4 ]  but this is no way out...
 [ N d5 ] , [ B b2 ]  moving the bishop over will give me a strucure that could allow Queenside castling
 [ R x f6 ] , [ g x f6 ]  forced or else lose the rook without taking the bishop
 [ g6 ] , [ N b5 ]  I decided ti use knight on [ h8 ] as bait.
 [ N b d7 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ B b3 ]  [ a6 ] , [ O-O-O ]  11. 0-0-0 - it is quite usual in the Dragon for white to castle on the opposite side. Usually there are pawn rolls on each side but it doesn't quite happen here.
 [ N c3 ] , [ g5 ]  An extremely aggressive attack by pushing black's kingside pawns and black will also look to develop his bishop on the a1-[ h8 ] diagonal. This will make blacks king vulnerable in the long-run if he chooses to castle kingside
 [ B x c3 ] , [ b x c3 ]  The exchange thusly.
 [ K c8 ] , [ R x e7 ]  very good capture and attack in the same time. !!!
 [ N d2 ] , [ d5 ]  My queen and bishop are in trouble here...
 [ B e7 ]  [ R d d1 ]  [ N a6 ] , [ N d5 ]  20. [ N d5 ] - threatening to win the exchange with a fork on b6.
 [ b x c6 ] , [ b4 ]  this cannot be sound. it breaks up whites pawns and gains nothing really in the way of tempo or positioning unless black blunders. after axb Nxb c5? Nd5! yes white does have an excellent outpost for the knight and commands an open file but assuming black playes something more sensible this is unlikely to become a reality
 [ R g7 g5 ] , [ R h3 ]  The game continues with black moving his rook to [ g5 ] now attacking the knight at h5. White moves his rook over to [ h3 ] to protect the knight.
 [ K e1 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ N d2 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ e5 ]  [ f x e5 ]  [ d x e5 ] , [ R x e5 + ]  four checks forced mate unless right now in this move he wanted to lose his queen for a rook or a knight for nothing
 [ Q b1 ]  [ N x a4 ] , [ N x a4 ]  I am down in material one Pawn. Yet I feel that I will be compensated.
 [ B e4 ]  [ R f3 ]  [ B x f3 ]  [ g x f3 ]  [ R a e8 ]  [ R g1 ]  [ R e2 ]  [ R g2 ]  [ Q f4 ]  [ a3 ]  [ Q x f3 ]  [ K g1 ] , [ R e1 # ]  
 [ c5 ] , [ h x g6 ]  There is a problem of perspective here seems like we are eroding black´s structure but at the same time we are opening some lines for the opponent like the f column to win the h column but the clearvoyance would fail before making a clear advantage. When there is not a certain perspective sometimes we prefer moves like 8.[ h6 ] to stay straight the path of the plan and wait for a psicological result. I don´t say that 8.[ h x g6 ] it´s not a good move in fact it´s a good one but as I said is a perspective view.
 [ e x f6 ] , [ N x f6 ]  the knight is stuck there for a while
 [ c6 ] , [ c4 ]  white has played with his pawns too far. it is important to remember that pawns cant play backwards and they need pieces to support them from behind.
 [ B x g4 ]  [ h x g4 ]  [ b x a5 ]  [ b x a5 ]  [ K d3 ]  [ K f5 ]  [ c5 ]  [ R e1 ] , [ R c4 ]  
 [ Q a4 ]  [ N x c4 ] , [ Q x c4 ]  And the position is interesting.
 [ h5 ]  [ R x a7 ]  [ h4 ]  [ a4 ]  [ K h3 ]  [ R e7 ]  [ R c8 ]  [ a5 ] , [ R d8 ]  With the hopeful trheath 34.-[ R d1 ] mate.
 [ e4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N h6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ Q b3 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ Q a4 + ]  [ c6 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N x f3 + ]  [ g x f3 ]  [ f5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B x c5 ]  [ b4 ]  [ B d4 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ B x c3 ]  [ d x c3 ]  [ b5 ]  [ B x b5 ]  [ c x b5 ]  [ Q x b5 + ]  [ B d7 ]  [ Q e5 ]  [ B a4 ]  [ B x h6 ]  [ Q f6 ]  [ B x g7 ]  [ Q x e5 + ]  [ B x e5 ]  [ R g8 ]  [ K d2 ]  [ O-O-O + ]  [ K c1 ]  [ R g2 ]  [ B d4 ]  [ f4 ]  [ B x a7 ]  [ R d1 + ]  [ R x d1 ]  [ B x d1 ] , [ K x d1 ]  White's first major mistake White shouldn't have taken the bishop as the rook is lost in the subsequent skewer.
 [ Q f1 + ]  [ K e3 ]  [ Q h3 + ] , [ K d4 ]  I was worried my opponent would have moved his king the other direction but he helped me out.
 [ h3 ]  [ R a7 ]  [ b4 ]  [ f5 ]  [ e x f5 ]  [ B x f5 ] , [ R a b1 ]  Presumably attacking the [ b6 ] pawn after 20. [ b x c5 ] [ d x c5 ] or controlling the open file if 20... [ d x c5 ] -- Neither of these seem problematic.
 [ R x f2 ]  [ R x f2 ] , [ B x f2 ]  The bishop hiding on [ a7 ] jumps back into action.
 [ h x g7 + ] , [ R x g7 ]  Forced.
 [ B x g1 ]  [ N e7 ]  [ f x e5 ]  [ B x e5 ]  [ c3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ Q f3 ]  [ B c6 ]  [ Q e3 ]  [ O-O ] , [ B f2 ]  How in the world did I win this
 [ N h3 ] , [ N e4 ]  Placing my Knight on a strong outpost.
 [ R x c5 ] , [ g6 ]  to create an escape square for my king preventing back rank surprises
 [ h4 ]  [ N x c3 ] , [ b x c3 ]  readers please decide if this move can be awarded with ! I dont want to cancel the queen. since it is helping me to command the diagonal c1- [ h6 ] and have a great prospect ahead once the king rook or king knight file opens.
 [ B x f8 ] , [ Q e5 + ]  Check to grab some seconds. I tried to make it with [ Q f5 ] but I couldn't be sure after [ Q e2 + ] Kmoves [ R x g4 + ] I could survive. I bet I couldn't so I went for the endgame.
 [ e4 ]  [ c6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ d5 ] , [ e5 ]  The advance variation of the caro-kann
 [ N c3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ O-O-O ]  [ h6 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ O-O ]  [ R h e1 ]  [ Q d7 ]  [ h3 ]  [ b5 ]  [ g4 ]  [ a5 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ B x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ R f e8 ]  [ g5 ]  [ h x g5 ]  [ N x g5 ]  [ N h5 ]  [ R e g1 ]  [ B f6 ]  [ Q d3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ N e6 ]  [ R x e6 ]  [ d x e6 ]  [ Q x e6 ] , [ Q f3 ]  Queen threatens both [ R a1 ] and Nh5. Black protects the knight by picking off the h pawn.
 [ R a1 ] , [ N f5 ]  The superstar wants to help the rook with his new job.
 [ K g5 ] , [ K f3 ]  43. [ K f3 ] - incredibly it looks as though there is a Joblock operating here on a chessboard with hardly any pieces on it. It is King Mike who is being blocked from helping his pawn through to g8! Fou Leblanc and my isolated [ d5 ] pawn protect each other.
 [ B x c5 ] , [ B x c5 ]  Perhaps 30. [ B d2 ] would have been better so that white would only lose one pawn.
 [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ B e2 ]  This move is not very aggressive. I play it because there is no where else to really play it because of where I will put my pawns. I don't like fianchettoing the white bishop in this position at all.
 [ O-O ]  [ B g2 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ a6 ] , [ b3 ]  The most common move in the Gameknot and World databases. I had no idea what to play so I listened to them. (Not a good strategy generally speaking.)
 [ B e5 ]  [ R e2 ] , [ B g3 ]  The last mistake. I thought the previous move was played in order to go to [ c7 ] preventing the rook to check.
 [ B g5 ]  [ e6 ]  [ B c4 ] , [ B e7 ]  My opponent has now broken off from the standard line which would have been [ f4 ] instead of h4. I continue with the standard line though because it still seems to make good sense.
 [ B d2 ] , [ B x c3 ]  no knights for me an bishops for you.
 [ K e3 ] , [ R h2 ]  46. ..... [ R h2 ] - white can always avoid dropping a further pawn by playing [ R f2 ] but it gives me the desired K & P ending. White does not want this.
 [ e x f5 ] , [ c5 ]  It is already the end. To 23. ... [ N d5 ] White would have replied 24. [ Q f3 ] after which Black's position could not be held.
 [ B e3 ]  [ N e5 ] , [ N x e5 ]  I also considered 14.[ B e2 ] but decided to eliminate black's most active piece. With this N gone black's pieces look uncoordinated while White's are well placed to commence operations in the center taking advantage of the central pawn majority. If the black N is allowed to remain on [ e5 ] black will play for an eventual ...[ c4 ] and ...[ N d3 ] possibly redeploying the other N to [ c5 ] along the way which is a typical plan for black in this opening.
 [ c6 ]  [ B b3 ] , [ B e6 ]  Maybe the best.
 [ e x f3 ]  [ e ] , [ p ]  Fire breath #1 the [ Q h2 + + ] is renewed
 [ N f6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ Q d3 ] , [ B d6 ]  I can't yet see a better place for the bishop so I put it here so that I can castle and get my rook to the e file as planned. White looks a little cramped now.
 [ B e7 ] , [ O-O-O ]  sounds obvious and until now I see no real bad move from white.
 [ N x e4 ]  [ Q e3 ] , [ R e8 ]  Setting up the discovered pin of the queen. White cannot capture 14. [ N x e4 ] because the king is pinned by the dark squared bishop. A castle earlier in the game would have prevented this line.
 [ B x g4 ]  [ h x g4 ]  [ R x g4 + ]  [ K h2 ] , [ B e5 + ]  After 29. . . . [ B x g4 ] 30. [ h x g4 ] [ R x g4 + ] 31. [ K h2 ] [ B e5 + ] the situation is not looking good for white. My kingside is completely exposed. My best defender here is black's [ h6 ] pawn!
 [ N b5 ] , [ B c5 ]  I was afraid of [ b5 ] when I should've been worried about Nb5. Looks like the best I can do is get two pawns for the bishop and go into another losing endgame a pawn down.
 [ R d1 ] , [ R g h3 ]  I consider this a strong if not very evident move. The mate threats [ R b2 + ] and [ R h2 ] or [ h1 ] depending on white's answer are not so easy to meet over the board with your clock ticking down to zero.. Black only has to be careful not to allow a perpetual. By this time the clock had 15 minutes left for white and 14 for black.
 [ N f3 ] , [ a6 ]  To prevent any attack against my king because my king will stand on its' place for long.
 [ N x d4 ]  [ R d1 ] , [ K e7 ]  ok - gonna come under threat for a short while ... worrid a little concerning perpetual checks.. but if your queen comes away from protecting knight on [ b5 ] then that'll be compensation for the short chase.
 [ B g5 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ a3 ]  [ b5 ]  [ B d3 ] , [ Q c7 ]  Both players continue to develop but again White moves t.he same piece
 [ K f8 ] , [ N h4 ]  From this point black has mostly only unhappy decisions to make.
 [ Q x d5 ]  [ R a1 ] , [ Q x d6 ]  Grinding down White's forces little by little.
 [ a6 ]  [ c7 ] , [ Q f5 ]  Black missed the opportunity to prolong the game on move 46 and now there is no good way of controlling the [ c8 ] square. 47... [ Q e8 ] or [ Q g8 ] is met with 48. [ Q d8 + ] and this:
 [ B d3 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N e2 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N g3 ]  [ e5 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ d3 ]  [ h6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ a3 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ N f5 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B d2 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ h3 ]  [ Q d7 ]  [ g4 ]  [ R a c8 ]  [ b4 ]  [ b5 ]  [ K g2 ]  [ N e7 ]  [ g5 ] , [ h x g5 ]  Interesting that it takes 17 moves before someone trades a piece.
 [ N d2 ]  [ N d8 ] , [ h3 ]  (VK) Black is cramped and cannot undertake anything active on either side of the board. White has no quick way of realizing his advantage. At the board I thought at first that it would be best to exchange a pair of Rooks and the prepare for the advance P-[ [ K5 ] ] supported by minor pieces. Another plan recommented by Tigran Petrosian is worth considering: B-[ [ B3 ] ] B-[ Q1 ] B-[ B2 ] N-[ K B1 ] N-[ K3 ] followed by either P-[ [ K5 ] ] or P-B5. But in the heat of the last round I opted for an energetic (and premature!) advance in the center and on the K side. It is worth mentioning that after 28 B-[ [ B3 ] ] (threatening 29 P-N4) 28... P-[ R4 ] 29 P-[ B5 ] really would have been strong. (TH) Here is where the having to play to win comes in. If this match had been in any earlier round Korchnoi would undoubtedly have played a slower but sure win by constriction strategy with his enormous advantage in space.
 [ c3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ h3 ]  [ N a5 ]  [ B c2 ]  [ c5 ]  [ d4 ]  [ Q c7 ] , [ N b d2 ]  still only common moves so far.
 [ Q x d8 + ] , [ N e8 ]  I do not want to give him my other rook so this move was forced. That is because I cannot protect it with my queen or he will immediately take my queen and mate me with Qxe8#.
 [ K e4 ] , [ R c d2 ]  I did not take the knight because I would have lost the rook to his king
 [ R b6 ]  [ R e c1 ]  [ R x c6 ] , [ R x c6 ]  22. [ R x c6 ] - a rook trade and ...... ah what's this? The [ e4 ] pawn is hanging. I decide to let my [ a6 ] isolani go in exchange for the e pawn. This makes the white [ d5 ] pawn an isolani.
 [ N h4 ] , [ Q g5 ]  The queen was threatening to both the bishop and the horse. 9.[ N f5 ] would stop that for a while.
 [ Q c7 ]  [ Q d3 ]  [ h6 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ c4 ] , [ N e7 ]  now white takes advantage of he's space by forcing the black knight to retreat to passive position which we saw in the game 17.e5!-Nd5.18.c4!-Nd7(18..[ N f4 ] was leading to 19.Qe4-[ N g6 ] another lose of tempo . according to whites space and center control white can maneuver he's Pisces to more stronger position while black still struggles with him self by standing behind with he's development .
 [ f x e4 ]  [ Q x e4 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ Q h4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B x b6 ] , [ N g4 ]  too hasty...didn't think at his next move so obvious...but it was a real time game and I'm not used at this way to play...
 [ R h3 ] , [ R g8 ]  I have to play this otherwise 42 [ B d3 ] ... [ R d7 ] 43 [ B x h7 ] ... [ Q x h7 ] 44 [ Q g4 ]  [ Q d1 ] , [ N f5 ]  here I think [ R d8 ] might draw as it forces the perpetual but I thought I'd give the win a go.
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ B f4 ] , [ c5 ]  This is always interesting
 [ Q b3 + ]  [ K g7 ] , [ Q g3 + ]  Still trying for the checks.
 [ Q c2 ]  [ B f8 ]  [ R a2 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ R e1 ] , [ e3 ]  Time to be tricky with a very short-term sacrifice; black plans to get the pawn back. I don't expect much here other than to break up white's castle a bit. It seems the black pieces can get aggressive kingside faster than the white pieces can get defensive.
 [ Q d7 + ]  [ K f8 ] , [ B c4 ]  ?? loses a bishop for nothing.
 [ a3 ] , [ f6 ]  ?! A computer mouse slip. I was pondering castling and [ B f6 ] and somehow mis-clicked the mouse button.
 [ R f1 ] , [ Q h4 ]  44. .... q[ h4 ] - and here comes Glenda!
 [ h4 ] , [ N g4 ]  Moves knight to a safe haven and holds some of the middle
 [ h6 ]  [ B h4 ]  [ Q b6 ]  [ R b1 ] , [ O-O ]  one of the very rare games with Najdorf where I felt comfortable to rook
 [ B x f4 ] , [ Q f6 ]  Black was threatening 16.[ Q x b2 ] followed by capturing the trapped rook.
 [ B a4 ]  [ Q e4 + ]  [ f3 ]  [ Q e2 + ]  [ K h3 ]  [ Q f1 + ]  [ K g4 ]  [ f5 + ]  [ K g5 ] , [ Q x f3 ]  I didn't take to win the pawn but rather to force a checkmate. As now no matter what Carl does mate is now forced. And Carl knew that but was determined to try one more thing which will result in the same thing.
 [ N g5 ] , [ B e6 ]  Black has to prevent 11.[ N x f7 ] which forks Black's queen and rook. However this walks into another fork 11.d5! which wins minor piece for pawn.
 [ b6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ a4 ]  [ B b4 ]  [ B d2 ]  [ d x c4 ]  [ Q x c4 ]  [ Q d7 ]  [ B h3 ]  [ B x c3 ]  [ B x c3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O-O ]  [ a6 ] , [ d5 ]  This was a pretty good move on white's part.
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ] , [ d4 ]  The Philidor. I don't especially like playing against the Philidor but I'm not sure why.
 [ K d6 ]  [ K f2 ]  [ a5 ]  [ b x a5 ]  [ b x a5 ]  [ K e3 ] , [ K c5 ]  Good move traditional ! White can not both protect the c pawn and block the g pawn.
 [ B b5 ] , [ O-O ]  caste unpinning Knight and releasing threat [ e6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ a6 ]  [ B a4 ]  [ b5 ]  [ B c2 ] , [ Q h4 ]  attacking [ h2 ] [ f4 ] and eventually [ d4 ] (after NX[ e5 ] fxe)
 [ b4 ]  [ B x b4 ] , [ N b x d4 ]  White is now winning with superior development and better opportunities for well-positioned bishops on [ b2 ] and [ d3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ] , [ b6 ]  ? ... A wasted move that doesn't seem to accomplish anything except restricting his own dark-squared bishop after white plays a3.
 [ B b4 ]  [ a3 ]  [ B a5 ] , [ B f4 ]  Finally this bishop is at a better square but maybe [ g5 ] was better.
 [ Q x d5 ]  [ N c5 ] , [ b4 ]  White continues to chase Knights with pawn moves. It's getting a little frivolous now; probably development was better. The computer suggests 10.[ B c4 ] threatening mate on [ f7 ] and forcing Black to move his Knight yet again to interpose on e6.
 [ R h4 ] , [ h3 ]  preventing queen to advance in 2 moves protected by the tower
 [ Q x e3 ]  [ f x e3 ]  [ K e5 ]  [ K f2 ]  [ K f5 ]  [ R d6 ]  [ K g4 ] , [ R d5 ]  Cuts off the King into a mating net
 [ N x b4 ] , [ c3 ]  I think this is inaccurate. White is clearly aiming to win the [ d5 ] pawn but Black can simply play...
 [ O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ N e5 ]  [ c6 ] , [ R f e1 ]  [ f4 ] looks tempting but is no good after [ f6 ] [ N e f3 ] Kh8!
 [ R b6 ] , [ f4 ]  A Pawn fork winning a piece.
 [ N c3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ B d3 ] , [ O-O ]  black removes his king from the centre getting ready to start operations in the centre
 [ B b5 ] , [ Q b6 ]  black uses his great advantage in space.
 [ Q x f6 + ]  [ Q x f6 ] , [ e x f6 ]  19. [ e x f6 ] - this pawn although passed looks really vulnerable. However it is this pawn that will say "shamat" to Porcho 13 moves from here.
 [ Q c7 ] , [ e4 ]  Not only does this attack the Knight but it also cuts off the Rook's lateral options and opens up a potential line of attack for the [ B g2 ] from f1.
 [ B x b7 + ]  [ K x b7 ]  [ Q e4 + ] , [ R d5 ]  A nice square for the rook dont you think!
 [ O-O ]  [ N x c2 ]  [ R b1 ]  [ R h f8 ] , [ g3 ]  As expected: White defends his pawn and drives the queen away. The light-squared diagonal is opened up but Black no longer has the light bishop.
 [ c x b5 + ]  [ K x b5 ]  [ c3 ] , [ a3 ]  52. ...... [ a3 ] - my pawn is only 2 squares away from Glendadom and Henry sees a way to support that pawn. It seems that white must give up his dsb to stop this. White sees this and waves the white flag giving me my highest rating so far. 1798 so near and yet so far to that 1800 milestone! I now have 8 points out of 11 games so after a shaky start so far so good.
 [ B e2 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ N f3 ]  Another tempo. :)
 [ b5 ] , [ R a1 # ]  No B or Q required. Hope you had fun at me!
 [ R d7 ] , [ R a b1 ]  Releasing queen's threat over a1.
 [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ g6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ e4 ]  [ d6 ]  [ f4 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N f3 ] , [ c5 ]  6. ...... [ c5 ] - a first attempt at breaching the wall after some standard King's Indian 4 Pawn Attack moves.
 [ R f d8 ] , [ R b7 ]  this was a blunder too because my Bishop is still in danger.......but I did not see it at the time
 [ Q c2 ] , [ B a5 ]  My knight is pinned yet again while simultaneously being attacked by two pieces.
 [ R d1 ]  [ R f d8 ]  [ b4 ]  [ f6 ]  [ c3 ]  [ K f8 ] , [ R b d2 ]  29. [ R b d2 ] - Gudrun my opponent has been putting pressure on that weak [ d6 ] pawn over the last few moves. Henry tries to add to the defense but his movements are literally put in check!
 [ N f4 ] , [ N x c4 ]  i could have taken that night at [ c4 ] with my queen but...obvious mooves make you loose a game....I can attack the block at [ e5 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N c x e5 ] , [ B c3 ]  there!!!....its jst a small moove that can swing a game....and out of its shadow...a great power will emerge...that bishop held the key!!
 [ b x c6 ] , [ N c5 ]  Move your pieces TOWARDS the enemy. Even if they are very bad moves they are frightening at firs sight. A good tactic for blitz! Who cares that we play a long game right now...
 [ B x f6 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d x e5 ] , [ d x e5 ]  9. dxe5?! better was N[ x d e5 ] (do not block your own bishop).
 [ b x c6 ]  [ B x c6 ]  [ N c4 ]  [ Q d4 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ B x a8 ]  [ B b6 ]  [ Q d3 ] , [ R x a8 ]  The smoke is clearing and black has three light pieces for a Queen and two pawns...
 [ c x d3 ] , [ R d1 ]  I think I was trying to get my rook into the mix.
 [ Q a6 ] , [ a3 ]  Now [ N x c6 ] is also a possible sac only it takes less initiative than the sac on d5.
 [ d3 ] , [ Q x e5 ]  He just gave me a free knight.
 [ K f8 ] , [ K c8 ]  Attacks the queening square.
 [ N x e5 ]  [ O-O ] , [ Q f3 ]  All of a sudden he has some pressure on my f pawn but with his queen there I also cannot move my lsb without losing another pawn
 [ b3 ]  [ N f4 ] , [ d6 ]  ruthless...
 [ Q d7 ]  [ Q a7 ]  [ R c7 ]  [ Q b6 ]  [ R b7 ] , [ R a8 + ]  Still not wanting to Sacrafice Queens Deep Blue puts Kasparov in check.
 [ K b5 ] , [ R h3 ]  I thought that this was a better way to do it. I also ideas of promoting my [ f2 ] [ g2 ] or [ h2 ] pawns. If I didn't fixate on that I would've just played 33.[ R e7 ] right away which would get one of those pawns.
 [ N e4 ] , [ N c x e4 ]  Rather than go into defensive mode Dave decides to give up a pawn.
 [ B x e6 ] , [ R e1 ]  ...after the exchanges.
 [ Q x f4 ] , [ Q x c3 + ]  A nice fork...
 [ c5 ] , [ B b5 + ]  [ R b1 ] is a sensible alternative. Up to this point the game has remained fairly even with no obvious advantage to either player.
 [ f5 ]  [ f3 ]  [ K f7 ]  [ N e2 ]  [ N b6 ]  [ e x f5 ] , [ B x f5 ]  25. ...... [ B x f5 ] - pawn trade.
 [ g x h6 ]  [ R g2 ]  [ Q x g2 + ]  [ K x g2 ] , [ K h7 ]  Black is slightly ahead on material because of those sac'd pawns but his rooks aren't very active.
 [ N x c2 ]  [ N a4 ]  [ K c1 ]  [ e5 ] , [ N a b4 ]  If instead 52. [ K d1 ] then 52. --- [ N b2 + ] wins the [ a2 ] Knight.
 [ B a2 ]  [ R b7 ]  [ B b1 ]  [ a3 ]  [ K e2 ] , [ N d6 ]  I will not loose two Pawns for one bishop !!
 [ N x g5 ]  [ R x f4 ] , [ N x e6 ]  Black falls into it. But chess is not simple.
 [ Q a4 + ] , [ c6 ]  My first blunder. White's Knight is no longer pinned
 [ Q f7 + ]  [ K h6 ]  [ Q g8 ]  [ K h5 ]  [ K f6 ]  [ K h6 ] , [ Q g6 # ]  
 [ N b d7 ]  [ g4 ]  [ a6 ] , [ g5 ]  The only move.
 [ Q d1 + ] , [ K g2 ]  forced
 [ R c1 ] , [ N e3 ]  Now white must move the queen.
 [ K f6 ] , [ Q c3 + ]  seaching to pin the white queen
 [ R b4 ] , [ R x b4 ]  White hopes that a one Knight end game can halt the marching pawn. The white King is needed for help but unfortunately far away in the corner.
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ N f6 ]  As Black I prefer Petrov to Ruy Lopez and it is one of the main lines I play.
 [ B e5 ]  [ B b4 ]  [ R e3 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ B d4 ]  [ R x e4 ]  [ R x e4 ]  [ B x e4 ]  [ a3 ]  [ B f8 ] , [ B c3 ]  Computer recommends 30. [ N d2 ] [ B b7 ] 31. [ N f1 ] [ R c8 ] 32. [ N e3 ] [ R d8 ] 33. [ K f1 ] [ g6 ] 34. [ K e2 ] [ f5 ] 35. [ g3 ] [ f4 ] 36. gx[ f4 ] [ B g7 ] 37. [ B x g7 ] [ R x d1 ] 38. [ K x d1 ] [ K x g7 ]  [ b x c3 ]  [ B c2 ]  [ R d8 ]  [ B x b3 ]  [ R a8 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ R x a6 ]  [ b4 ]  [ R a8 ]  [ b3 ]  [ f3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ K f2 ]  [ K g7 ]  [ K e1 ] , [ b2 ]  38...[ B x a3 ] is perhaps more direct. But the text move certainly works.
 [ N c5 ] , [ f4 ]  !? a bit over zealous and creates too many holes. Besides the feared ...[ [ e5 ] ] is still premature as the advance of the [ [ e5 ] ] would seriously weaken [ d5 ] and the light sqaures. The best way to keep the balance is 13. Bc2.
 [ a3 ]  [ B x c3 ] , [ B x c3 ]  Protecting the pawn on [ d4 ] and attacking the queen
 [ B b3 ] , [ R f c8 ]  All according to plan.
 [ g4 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ R e3 ] , [ Q g5 ]  17. ...... [ Q g5 ] - like this!
 [ c4 ]  [ B c2 ]  [ f5 ]  [ N x d7 ]  [ B x d7 ]  [ B x d6 ] , [ Q x d6 ]  14. ...... [ Q x d6 ] - now all the minor pieces but the light square bishops have been traded off. The position looks roughly equal.
 [ B x d4 ] , [ B g7 ]  Do you think [ N x d4 ] was stronger...?
 [ N x d3 + ] , [ Q x d3 ]  Threatening q[ h7 ] - Mate
 [ R a c1 ]  [ c x d4 ] , [ B b3 ]  22. [ B b3 ] - Bishop Laud now attacks Haldup on Sector [ d5 ] can he survive?
 [ d x c4 ]  [ R d8 + ]  [ N e8 ]  [ Q x c4 ] , [ h6 ]  In such a tactical position is not easy to see all the possible continuation. GK computer analysis suggest: 18. ... [ [ b5 ] ] which lead White to gain the quality. Anyway after 18. ... [ [ b5 ] ] I considered better 19. [ Q f4 ] keeping the pressure on f7.
 [ B x d5 ] , [ N d4 ]  Black blunders by this move...Black does not see the threat to the king with my bishop and queen.
 [ g6 ] , [ d4 ]  Black is playing the Modern Defense and white is playing along with the main line.
 [ b x c3 ] , [ c6 ]  Waiting move also protecting my pawn on [ b7 ] enforcing some center control.
 [ B d7 ] , [ N h5 ]  Fritz recommends 22. [ N h5 ] (0.80) My basic hope was to follow with 23. [ N x g7 ] [ R x g7 ] 24. [ Q x g7 # ] or something along those lines.
 [ g6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ B d2 ] , [ N f6 ]  Getting ready to castle.
 [ B x g5 ] , [ R d3 d4 ]  Threatening [ R e4 ] to dominate the board.
 [ c3 ] , [ N f6 ]  ? This is a mistake.
 [ B b4 ]  [ R x e8 + ]  [ R x e8 ] , [ Q c2 ]  28. [ Q c2 ] - white defends his [ a4 ] pawn but now I have a little combo up my sleeve beginning with wait for it ......
 [ f6 ]  [ f4 ]  [ f x e5 ] , [ f x e5 ]  23. [ f x e5 ] - pawn trade.
 [ B x d4 ]  [ R x d4 ]  [ N c5 ] , [ b8 = Q ]  This is not helping anything.
 [ R h2 ] , [ a5 ]  GOSH! Now i realize that I lose a pawn and that the bishop will be perfectly positioned. And I still have no countergame...
 [ c3 ]  [ R c4 ]  [ R a2 ] , [ R x c3 ]  OK I'll trade pawns three for one. Didn't think I would promote that isolated a-pawn anyway. Gobble.
 [ Q g8 + ]  [ K c7 ]  [ Q x g7 + ] , [ K b6 ]  and the [ h6 ] pawn.
 [ K e2 ] , [ N e5 ]  19... [ N d5 ] Looks better. 20. [ Q x e7 ] [ N x e7 ] 21. [ a3 ]  [ Q b7 ] , [ R a e1 ]  This is where I really had to think for a while to find a good move. The only problem is.....I didn't have the time! Maybe 21... [ N e4 ] is the most accurate. For example 22. [ K d1 ] [ Q a7 ] 23. [ c3 ] bx[ c3 ] 24. bxc3. But I decided to play the textmove instead wich actually isn't that strong.
 [ d4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ N f3 ]  White develops a piece and defends the extra pawn. 3. [ f4 ] allows black a lead in development after 3..f6! 4 [ e x f6 ] [ N x f6 ] 5 [ N c3 ] [ d5 ] 6 [ e3 ] [ B b4 ] paving the way for black to castle kingside and having reasonable chances.
 [ K f4 ] , [ R h x e3 ]  There we have it. Now down 3 points in material and although i maintained both rooks 3 pawns down doesnt look convincing..
 [ c x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ B x e7 ]  [ Q x e7 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ R c1 ] , [ B e6 ]  The Bishop is much stronger here than at b7.
 [ K e1 ] , [ Q f2 + ]  White could not have played 17. Kg1?? to hunt the trapped black knight for 17. ... [ Q f2 ] 18. [ K x h1 ] [ Q f1 ] 19. [ N g1 ] [ Q x d3 ] is decisive.
 [ B h3 ] , [ g5 ]  looking to pin back bishop. looking likely that this pawn exchange is on the cards.
 [ Q f7 ]  [ R x e7 ]  [ Q g6 ] , [ N x b5 ]  Saccing the knight to get the Queen into a position from which she can mate.
 [ R e c8 ] , [ f5 ]  Oups! What's going on ? I really hate surprises.
 [ e5 ]  [ B x e5 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ Q e7 ]  [ Q e2 ]  [ O-O ] , [ Q x e5 ]  Now a piece up I look to attack
 [ R f3 ]  [ Q c7 + ]  [ K g1 ]  [ Q c5 + ]  [ K h1 ]  [ g4 ]  [ h x g4 ]  [ Q g5 ]  [ R b3 ] , [ Q x g4 ]  Here is where I made the fatal mistake. I should have just kept checking the king in order to promote isolation.
 [ Q e5 + ] , [ B e2 ]  10. [ B e2 ] as expected. My queen move also prevents White from castling as O-O would be followed by [ Q x h2 ] . Time to bring my rook into play but where? One of the two half open files (f and d) or Re8?
 [ N c6 ]  [ f5 ]  [ N d4 ] , [ B g4 ]  Joining the attack. If necessary White will sacrifice the bishop to proceed.
 [ b4 ] , [ B x b4 ]  ?? Had I given this more thought and done my HW I would've calculated better. Therefore I would've retreated my Queen (which is what should've been done) But this however is where the distraction was the worst as now aside from that thought (which was wrong) I was not with it. What matters is that I should not have taken. It was a case of not playing a move just because it looks good which I've taught my students. But it's not obvious because it was more then just looking good. It also boiled down to planning the necessary ways to reduce the sleep deprivation issue as opposed to what the threat. In doing so unlike what was discussed I ignored the only way of saving the position as now I'm busted. Yes I don't lose a piece on the next move shortly there after he is going to win my Queen at the least. But instead of taking right away he plays other moves that are even more powerful. In doing so he will force a win quickly.
 [ d x e5 ]  [ h3 ] , [ g5 ]  Didn´t even think much on whether taking or not taking the pawn. I just felt shocked and it was that feeling that made me feel like my position was inferior much worse than what it was in reality. I tried to look for a counterattack but then I found nothing; it seemed that black´s King is safe enough to focus on attack and I don´t have much left. It is one of those occasions when you feel like not accepting the gambit because there must be a good reason not to (opening the column etc) and yet it is more than doable (after a light post-game analysis from my side)
 [ N c6 ] , [ Q e4 ]  Not 9.[ Q e2 ] [ N d4 ] 10.[ Q d3 ] [ B f5 ] 11.[ Q e3 + ] [ B e7 ] =+
 [ h x g5 + ] , [ K x g5 ]  pawn for pawn at 1 and move 37 is GREAT
 [ K x e5 ] , [ K d3 ]  White think that after my pawn queening his pawn is already in 7th rank and hoping for a draw. But my king was so near. generally rook pawn and bishop pawn is draw.
 [ B x e5 ]  [ f6 ] , [ B c3 ]  at this point i should have just moved the bishop back but instead let him get the pawn at this point I'm going to move along a couple moves cause i made some mistakes along the way i new the game was won
 [ K g1 ] , [ N d3 ]  White's king is locked in the corner. It's like a puzzle to figure out how I can complete a mating maneuver with two knights.
 [ O-O ] , [ O-O ]  Never forgetting the rule never leave your king in the center or do so at your peril
 [ K e8 ] , [ Q x e6 ]  Best move. Keeps the king prisoner and threatens 27.[ R g8 # ]  [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B b5 ] , [ N d4 ]  The Bird Defence -- as handled by Bird himself.
 [ N x f5 ]  [ e x f5 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ g4 ]  [ b5 ]  [ b3 ] , [ b x c4 ]  Alternative variation: 28... [ N x b3 ] 29. [ Q x b3 ] [ b x c4 ] 30. [ Q x c4 ] [ Q x d5 ] [Black missed a win]
 [ B e6 ]  [ b3 ]  [ N f5 ]  [ R e4 ]  [ N x e3 ] , [ R x e3 ]  24. [ R x e3 ] - now Fou Lenoir loses his life for the black knight. What now?
 [ K b2 ]  [ Q b7 ] , [ R c2 ]  this make no sense unless my opponent is planing to bring his knight to the king's wing to exchange it for two pawns I'll still be better as then I'll get his c pawn... and my pawn is near promotion I can even exchange the queen for the rook and proceed to win it easily
 [ K g1 ]  [ R f8 ]  [ Q c2 ]  [ c5 ]  [ R d1 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ] , [ c4 ]  28. .................. [ c4 ] - the pawn on [ d4 ] cannot be taken because the c pawn is pinned to the Wicked Witch on c7.
 [ b3 ] , [ B c5 ]  Ok now [ d4 ] has a lot of heat as well as pressure on f2. I see to things my white bishop has become isolated somewhat it will have to return to [ B b2 ] I think. I think this may get messy quickly I like the castle here.
 [ K x c3 ] , [ K f3 ]  With the idea of getting the knight on [ e4 ] hopefully while the white rook is moving.
 [ d5 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ a6 ]  4..[ d6 ] is the most popular choice to achieve a solid centre but Black decides on playing at the left wing instead with 4..[ a6 ]  [ c5 ] , [ N b d7 ]  6..Nbd7? allows [ a4 ] and White would have a nice solid structure at the left side of the board.
 [ f6 ] , [ f5 ]  Weakens the f-file.
 [ K d2 ]  [ R h2 + ]  [ K e3 ]  [ R h3 + ]  [ K d4 ]  [ R c3 ]  [ K e5 ]  [ b3 ]  [ c x b3 ] , [ c x b3 ]  generating counterplay. Black has 2 passed pawns down the queen side. Now white must really carefully.
 [ Q e2 ]  [ a5 ]  [ Q f2 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ B b3 ]  [ B x b3 ]  [ a x b3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ R f d1 ]  [ B f6 ]  [ R d2 ]  [ d5 ]  [ R a d1 ]  [ K g7 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ R d2 x d5 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ e4 ]  [ N h2 ]  [ R a d8 ]  [ c3 ]  [ B e5 ]  [ N g4 ] , [ B d6 ]  Unforced error loses the Bishop. Available was [ B f6 ]  [ R x d6 ] , [ R d b8 ]  Necessary was [ R x d6 ] to prevent the coming combination.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ] , [ B c4 ]  I was surprised by this -- I don't usually see bishop's opening here. But there's a lot of room for transposition to more familiar lines.
 [ N x e4 ]  [ Q d5 ] , [ N c5 ]  ? Seriously wrong. [ Q d3 ] or [ Q c2 ] would protect the knight. Even Q[ x Q d5 ] would be ok. But This--Q[ x R h1 + ] spells disaster for white.
 [ R x d1 ]  [ B x c4 ]  [ b x c4 ] , [ h6 ]  ? This prevents [ N g5 ] but is akin to White's earlier pawn moves--it prevents something which simply is not a threat. 17.[ N g5 ] would be met with simply ...Nxe5.
 [ Q a4 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ Q d7 ]  [ h3 ] , [ h5 ]  [ B b4 ] was best here...
 [ R a e1 ]  [ R b e8 ] , [ Q x c7 ]  Big mistake to leave so many pieces attacking with less defense from white's queen
 [ K b5 ] , [ a4 + ]  If [ a3 ] a4+.
 [ B e3 + ]  [ Q x e3 ]  [ R x h5 ] , [ Q f4 ]  30. [ Q f4 ] - Glenda tries to camouflage herself between the black pieces and is backed up by Frere Lenoir. Black must move his queen off [ d7 ] to prevent the mate threat on b8.
 [ K x b3 ]  [ Q x c6 ]  [ h6 ]  [ Q x h6 ]  [ K c4 ]  [ Q d6 ]  [ K c3 ]  [ K g3 ]  [ K c4 ]  [ K f4 ]  [ K c3 ]  [ K e3 ] , [ K c4 ]  Easy checkmate
 [ B d6 ] , [ N h4 ]  Black attempts to distract by further threatening my weakened defences.
 [ B x f4 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ e5 ]  Creating open lines
 [ B g3 ]  [ f4 ]  [ B x f4 ]  [ g x f4 ] , [ Q x f4 ]  The open king position might give some compensation but it's not quite enough.
 [ e4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ] , [ Q x d5 ]  I know I know. My choice. I know this system won't hold against good players but I have worked a lot on it.
 [ B b4 ]  [ R e3 ] , [ R b6 ]  Black had at least two other options. Perhaps best was 26 ... [ a x b2 ] 27 [ [ d6 ] ] Rx[ [ d6 ] ] 28 Rx[ [ d6 ] ] Bx[ [ d6 ] ] 29 [ R d3 ] [ Q c6 ] 30 [ K x b2 ] [ B e5 ] 31 [ a3 ] [ Q b5 ] but 26 ... [ Q c7 ] 27 [ Q b3 ] [ R b6 ] 28 [ N a4 ] [ R b5 ] 29 [ [ d6 ] ] was also playable.
 [ b4 ] , [ K b6 ]  The position still has some fight. Q vs R endings are not easy.
 [ N f6 + ]  [ K f8 ]  [ d5 ]  [ c x d5 ] , [ N x d5 ]  34. [ N x d5 ] - another pawn trade.
 [ Q d3 + ]  [ g6 ]  [ h5 ] , [ K g7 ]  ...[ N b4 ] still should have been played. Black needs to get his pieces out and harassing the queen.
 [ O-O ] , [ g4 ]  Now I do. My opponent thought for a good while and played...
 [ g6 ] , [ Q e5 ]  Combining defense and attack.
 [ K e8 ] , [ R b7 ]  protecting my rook of course
 [ c3 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ Q e2 ] , [ f6 ]  here my opponent removes the defender of the [ f4 ] pawn.
 [ d4 ] , [ d5 ]  Computer far prefers 25...[ e4 ] and I see why now.
 [ f5 ]  [ Q c2 ] , [ f4 ]  The attacking potential of my queen and bishop is the justification for this quick pawn advance.
 [ Q d8 ]  [ d4 ] , [ B g4 ]  pinning the knight.
 [ K d6 ] , [ N x g5 ]  Here I threaten a nice royal fork/checkmate with 10.Nf7#. Black is forced to play 9...Nh6.
 [ g3 ]  [ Q h5 ] , [ N f2 ]  First task accomplished: I've blocked off Black's dangerously advanced Pawns.
 [ c4 ]  [ B e2 ] , [ Q d6 ]  The crushing blow comes.
 [ Q f2 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ K b1 ] , [ b4 ]  as was to be expected...
 [ K b6 ]  [ B d5 ] , [ B x f4 ]  White is losing control...
 [ c3 ]  [ N f2 ] , [ K x f2 ]  Probably to prevent him from being able to castle.
 [ R e7 ]  [ Q b3 ]  [ R d8 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ N e4 ] , [ N x e4 ]  better to exchange than conserve as white's N would have been pushed around and black's might have done well on reaching d2. this was black's successful strategy in our previous game exchange down and look to a potentially strong endgame. slightly worried.
 [ K c1 ]  [ K c4 ]  [ K c2 ]  [ K d4 ]  [ K c1 ]  [ c2 ] , [ K x c2 ]  My opponent doesn't give it up and the game ends in a draw; I decide to throw my pawn at him in a strange sign of respect! Plus I didn't feel I wanted to offer another draw after three were rejected in the game. It was a boring game made interesting by a nice knight trap and strong endgame play in my opinion. I hope you all enjoy it and don't mind the excessive annotations I have put all over it.
 [ N f3 ]  [ R x b2 ]  [ K d5 ]  [ R x a2 ] , [ K x d6 ]  it was in the way... lol
 [ B f4 ] , [ e6 ]  An alternate line for Black is 11...[ Q a5 + ] And after the forced 12.Bd2... Comes 12...[ Q c7 ]  [ O-O-O ]  [ B e7 ]  [ N e5 ] , [ a5 ]  (?!) According to thorough GM & IM analysis the wrong path. Black should have played 13...[ N x e5 ] and limited the aggressive nature of White's position on the kingside.
 [ N c6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ Q g4 ]  [ d4 ]  [ g5 ] , [ h4 ]  White must attack the pawn chain and threatens Bzf7.
 [ d3 ]  [ B b4 ]  [ B e3 ] , [ B x c3 + ]  This is the move that he won with.
 [ d x c5 ] , [ R x c5 ]  Gaining time by attacking Keres' Queen.
 [ R f3 ] , [ h4 ]  To prevent an immediate [ R g3 ] followed by attacks on g7.
 [ R a7 ] , [ N f6 + ]  He removed one threat but this one was simply game. I hope you guys liked how many threats I had going constantly due to my pieces working together so well. It made the game quite fun to play.
 [ B e7 ] , [ e3 ]  But first i'm going to free my bishop from the confines of the back rank.
 [ g6 ] , [ N c3 ]  Still strengthening grip on centre.
 [ R e2 ] , [ R x d4 ]  27. [ R x d4 ] - I now get my pawn back but on the next turn David warns me that Henry is not long for this world. This only means one thing. I am gonna cop wait for it ........
 [ h5 ] , [ c4 ]  I calmly advance the pawn; what else can I do? I want White to make the first move to the sixth rank so that I can block him...
 [ B f4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ h6 ] , [ e5 ]  I'm under the option I should have waited to make this move for at least a move or two. Maybe after [ N c3 ] or something.
 [ K e5 ] , [ B g7 # ]  And...Checkmate! I liked this game and would appreciate comments and a rating.
 [ R g8 ]  [ Q h5 ]  [ Q h7 ] , [ Q h4 ]  ? I think this was it the advantage gets lost.... or? For me 27.[ R h4 ] was the move to make.
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ B f4 ] , [ N c6 ]  This N should not be moved there IMO... not a great deal but it's much easier to play without [ c5 ] from black.
 [ O-O ]  [ B f5 ] , [ Q f3 ]  Not bad but 11.[ Q h5 ] (as played in one game that I found on another website) was probably stronger. It seems as if I'm forced to give up the bishop pair anyway with 11...[ B x e4 ] 12.[ d x e4 ] because if I move my bishop the [ e5 ] pawn is hanging. After 11...[ Q d7 ] 12.[ N g3 ] seems very strong (the bishop has to move anyway and then the pawn can be taken) and 11...[ g6 ] creates huge weaknesses in the king's position.
 [ N g e2 ]  [ B x e2 ] , [ B x e2 ]  I didn't want to reposition my [ B g4 ] so I traded it off for one of the king's defenders.
 [ K f2 ]  [ N f5 ]  [ N c2 ]  [ f6 ] , [ B d3 ]  Seizing his chance to make the favourable bishop-for-knight trade now that the g6-pawn has been weakened.
 [ N d7 ] , [ N x e6 ]  16. ... Nd7?? was a big blunder for black. 17. Nxe6!! is the proverbial lightning from a clear blue sky and it destroys black immediately though it's not immediately clear why. I began looking at lines involving 17. [ Q x d5 ] and 17. [ B x d5 ] and they often ended up with [ N x e6 ] somewhere along the way. Then I tried the old Reverse-the-Move-Order game and lo and behold this idea sprang up. Black's queen is en prise first and foremost. She could run but almost all available squares allow white to get her by moving the knight with discovered check. Of the few that don't such as 17. ... [ Q b6 ] white wins with 18. [ N x g5 + ] [ K d8 ] and one possible continuation much of which is forced goes like this: 19. [ N x f7 + ] [ K c7 ] 20. [ N x d6 ] [ Q b4 ] 21. [ N b5 + ] [ K b6 ] 22. [ B c7 + ] [ K x b5 ] 23. [ Q x d5 + ] [ N c5 ] 24. [ a4 + ] [ Q x a4 ] 25. Bx[ a4 + ] [ K b4 ] 26. [ Q c4 # ] (and still wins black's queen along the way).
 [ K g3 ]  [ K d5 ]  [ K f3 ]  [ K x c5 ]  [ K e3 ] , [ K x b5 ]  ...allowing mine to clean up two pawns giving me a passed pawn on c2...
 [ f x e4 ]  [ f x e4 ] , [ g5 ]  Trying to support N in f4. Had the white not removed the rook from [ a1 ] now a direct [ N f4 ] would have been possible. At this time I felt sort of at a crossroads: either defend my king and I had the feeling it was sort of late (I should have started a few moves back) or committing my pieces to attack the left flank. And I saw what I thought it was an interesting sacrifice. It took me more than a minute to make up my mind but after movement 19 I replied with two quick movements trying to put some pressure on black.
 [ R x f7 ]  [ B x f7 + ]  [ K x f7 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ h6 ]  [ B x f6 ] , [ Q x f6 ]  Black is looking ok in this position. white has gained nothing from the opening.
 [ g6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B g7 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ O-O ]  [ R c1 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ N b d7 ]  [ b4 ]  [ N g4 ]  [ h3 ] , [ N x f2 ]  This was crazy. [ B x c3 ] was the obvious choice.
 [ B f5 ]  [ O-O-O + ]  [ K e8 ] , [ B b5 ]  I looked at several games where [ d6 ] was played instead either here or within the next couple of moves basically swapping the difficult to defend pawn on [ e5 ] for the [ c7 ] pawn. With the Qs off the board the resulting 3 vs 2 pawns on the Q-side could eventually allow me to get a passed pawn on the Q-side. However I prefer to either double your pawns or keep your pieces tied up so I played Bb5.
 [ Q x a3 ]  [ R x b1 ]  [ R x b1 ] , [ Q x c4 ]  and now for the moment black is up two pawns and everything is defended. Whites counter play is his activity.
 [ B d7 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ a6 ]  [ B x c6 ]  [ B x c6 ]  [ Q c2 ]  [ O-O ]  [ e5 ]  [ N h5 ] , [ g3 ]  Obviously I made a mistake here. Left the N hanging to protect the B when I should have just [ B e3 ] or Bd2.
 [ B x c3 ] , [ b x c3 ]  A simple exchange is the opening salvo.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ] , [ Q h5 ]  Ha ha. He thinks you have never seen the bad four move. The GOOD four move puts the queen at [ f3 ] where the mate is slightly less obvious and harder to defend.
 [ N e2 + ] , [ K h2 ]  If [ K f1 ] QxR+ KxN Rc2#.
 [ K x f2 ] , [ N e4 + ]  My queen's domination of the d-file and the fact that White's undeveloped pieces block the rook from protecting his queen are what make my move possible.
 [ a5 ]  [ K h1 ]  [ f5 ]  [ K h2 ]  [ d5 ]  [ B f2 ] , [ f4 ]  I gain space while he makes random moves.
 [ g6 ] , [ N x e6 ]  I had actually looked at [ N x e6 ] on my 16th move but was for some reason I was convinced [ B h5 + ] was better. At this point in the game [ N x e6 ] is desperation play. O-O is more solid but black can force off several exchanges of pieces while keeping his large material advantage.
 [ B x h6 ] , [ B x h6 ]  I decided to exchange our pieces to weaken more his king's side...
 [ c4 ]  [ Q e7 + ] , [ B e3 ]  Seems to avoid over-burdening the KB
 [ c5 ] , [ B g5 ]  [ B g5 ] like i thought
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ a6 ] , [ B e3 ]  English Attack
 [ f5 ]  [ B x f1 ] , [ R x f1 ]  White misses my threat or ignores it so I exchange my final bishop for one of White's rooks. This leaves White with only 1 major piece to continue the game with leaves him down 2 pawns and with no pawn formation to speak of. The game looks as good as over to me.
 [ K h1 ]  [ B d7 ] , [ N b1 ]  This move is and was completely unexpected and stunned spectators and analysers and trainers on both sides. White's knight retreats to its original square!
 [ N x e5 ]  [ d x e5 ] , [ N e4 ]  This is the "well-placed-but-not-dangerous knight"... provided I have a knight on [ f3 ] so to proceed with [ h4 ] blocking black's dsb. But now it is different.
 [ O-O-O ] , [ R e1 ]  Naturally I take the open file.
 [ N b d7 ]  [ Q x b7 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B d3 ] , [ R b8 ]  In this way I can capture on a7.
 [ Q d6 ] , [ Q x e5 ]  Ok another attemp and attack a rock
 [ e5 ]  [ a5 ]  [ e4 + ]  [ K e2 ] , [ K e6 ]  Blacks central pawn majority will be fine for the moment - it's more important to take care of the threats on the Queenside for the timebeing.
 [ c6 ]  [ B d3 ] , [ f5 ]  However that opportunity wasn't gone. Of course Perry played this to prevent me from taking his [ h7 ] pawn. He thought that it was protected this way but didn't realize that I attacked it twice with my last move. But this is where I grabbed it at once especially since it places him in check.
 [ Q d5 + ] , [ K h8 ]  Dodging away from the spite check.
 [ K f6 ] , [ N h3 ]  horse forced onto side of board limiting mobility
 [ R b8 ] , [ N d5 ]  Sending my knight in the center.
 [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ] , [ d6 ]  Both kings have castled and the center is crowded.
 [ Q x d1 + ] , [ R x d1 ]  First an exchange which still asks the same questions of Black.
 [ B d7 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ B e7 ] , [ d5 ]  I have done what I can to continue to develop safely up to this point and attack get some kind of middle game going. We are out of my notes now and there is just too much shit on the board still for me to count very far ahead. This pawn move I thought should make him shit or get off the pot! I thought maybe he would 7. ... Nb4. Then maybe I would follow up with 8. [ Q e2 ] and he would 8. ... 0-0 and finally castle and we could get a move on. Could have even gone 7. ... [ N b4 ] 8.[ B x d7 ] followed by either [ N x d7 ] or [ Q x d7 ] and then 9.[ a3 ] with his Knight backed up to [ a6 ] square.
 [ N b d7 ] , [ N d c6 ]  Black's queen has only one place to go. More importantly the knight move exposed my attack down the half-open (soon to be fully open) d-file.
 [ B d3 ] , [ e x d3 ]  this is the end
 [ R x c5 ]  [ d x c5 ]  [ R x a4 ]  [ R x a4 ] , [ N x a4 ]  suddenly White is in big trouble: he had too little time on the clock to work out the dire consequences of [ [ [ b2 ] ] ] - a direct [ R d1 ] is met with [ N x [ c5 ] ] followed by [ K d6 ] or even a direct Nc3!!; after [ R d3 ] [ [ [ b2 ] ] ] [ R b3 ] Kd7! followed by [ K c6 ] and of course [ R x d5 ] [ [ [ b2 ] ] ] [ R d1 ] ([ c5 ] is blocking the possibly saving Rb5) Nc3!! also leads to big problems - so he resigned; and (re)blocked the 'moderator' account...
 [ B b3 ] , [ N f6 ]  There's what I've been waiting for!
 [ Q h3 ]  [ N b6 ]  [ Q g4 ] , [ R e6 ]  Blocks the Queen from the back rank and prepares to double the rooks.
 [ e4 ]  [ a x b4 ]  [ a x b4 ]  [ R a8 ]  [ e5 ] , [ R a1 + ]  The back rank is horribly weak
 [ K e4 ]  [ K b3 ] , [ K d3 ]  Instead of attacking my h pawn he locks my king against the wall.
 [ g4 ]  [ f6 ]  [ R a8 ]  [ f5 ]  [ K f4 ]  [ f x g4 ]  [ K x g4 ] , [ R c5 ]  Threatening to advance the d pawn.
 [ f4 ]  [ R f5 ]  [ R b7 ]  [ R a5 ]  [ a4 ] , [ B d1 ]  He gladly allows me to attack his pawn island because of 37. [ R b7 ] and 38. [ a4 ]  [ f5 ] , [ g x f5 ]  I realise I can win by taking the a and b pawns and then trading rooks so I take his f-pawn
 [ R d6 ]  [ R a e8 ]  [ R e2 ] , [ R f4 ]  As a dull endgame player (my games very rarely go into endgames... :-) I managed to lose another pawn. Wow!
 [ c3 ] , [ R d5 ]  ...but my rook is forced to retreat one rank...
 [ c x d4 ]  [ c x d4 ] , [ N f6 ]  I have caught up in development with all four minor pieces out. My opponent has 3 pieces out (bishop knight and rook) and castled. The important imbalance favors white though. The [ e4 ] and [ d4 ] pawns give his pieces room to work and restrict mine. My king is still stuck in the center so I must castle before my opponent can get the rest of his pieces mobilized.
 [ B h6 ] , [ N x g4 ]  Evidently white figured in for a penny in for a pound. This just loses the exchange and lets black trade queens in the bargain.
 [ h5 ] , [ h4 ]  ?! The computer finds this as a no-no for me and gives the advantage to Black for the first time in the game. I agree. This creates holes on the g-file. I wanted to stop 23...[ h4 ] however 23.[ g3 ] was better to stop this
 [ R e7 ]  [ N b5 ] , [ e x d3 ]  Black's pawn at [ e4 ] captures White's pawn at [ d3 ] in order to claim the d file.
 [ N d5 ] , [ e5 ]  Good move the idea of 17.e5! is to open the diagonal d8-[ h4 ] for his queen and by the same time it closes temporally whites strong a1-[ h8 ] strong diagonal .
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ f5 ]  The infamous Latvian Gambit. This opening is denigrated by chess masters and shunned by just about every GM you can think of. But for those adventurous (and crazy) enough to play it it can be a lethal weapon unlike no other opening for black. It is an opening for attackers for the tactically-minded and fearless who would rather go down with explosions and fire than fizzle-out positionally in a quiet endgame.
 [ e5 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ N f6 ]  The specified opening comes together.
 [ K f7 ] , [ f3 ]  Allows white to move his knight without the threat of check from my rook also prevents [ N e4 ]  [ R d2 ] , [ h4 ]  I suspect this is a waiting move
 [ Q e1 ]  [ N f5 ]  [ c3 ] , [ O-O ]  With black safely castled he can now begin a three piece attack on the white king.
 [ Q x h4 ]  [ N e4 ] , [ Q h8 + ]  rather than trading queens on [ e7 ] which will help me bring my king to where he wants to go.
 [ B x f3 ]  [ R g1 ]  [ B d5 ]  [ B x a7 ] , [ B x a2 ]  The more Pawns come off the board the better my chances of salvaging a draw.
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B b4 ]  [ a3 ]  [ B x c3 + ]  [ b x c3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e3 ]  [ d x c4 ]  [ B x c4 ]  [ b6 ]  [ N e2 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ f3 ]  [ N b d7 ]  [ a4 ]  [ O-O ] , [ a5 ]  Maybe hold off on this move
 [ f x e4 ] , [ d x e4 ]  Nope. The black bishop was worth more than that pawn.
 [ Q x e5 ]  [ b3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ B b2 ]  He didn't take my tower so I had to press further on to catch the queen in this already hopeless posistion.?
 [ Q h2 + ]  [ K d3 ] , [ Q c2 # ]  hope u enjoyed my easy win match
 [ B d7 ] , [ B g5 ]  Developing with an attack.
 [ c x b4 ] , [ a3 ]  Common line
 [ B x c3 ]  [ b x c3 ]  [ c4 ]  [ B c2 ] , [ Q x d1 + ]  The decisive blow.
 [ R h2 ] , [ Q e7 ]  Now [ f4 ] is not possible anymore.
 [ d x e4 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ B x b4 ]  [ Q x b4 ] , [ Q x e4 ]  A few of the pieces have come off the board. But I still need to trade off the Queens. The Queen is the biggest troublemaker in these kind of situations.
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ] , [ Q c7 ]  last book move
 [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ] , [ d4 ]  The main line of the Sicilian Defence.
 [ O-O ]  [ R e8 ]  [ a4 ]  [ h5 ]  [ R f4 ]  [ N c5 ] , [ N f5 ]  I'd probably not offer this trade if I could do this again. Nothing in it for me - just isolating my pawn.
 [ c x d5 ] , [ N c3 ]  Perceval enters in the battle straight toward the center.
 [ Q g5 ] , [ e x f4 ]  As I had seen - but after I had moved [ Q d5 ] 26. f5! would have given White a good game. The points being is the White would love to play [ N [ f6 ] + ] and either fork my king or queen or win my queen with a discovered attack on my queen with his queen. Now for that to work either my protection of [ f6 ] by my rook on [ f8 ] has to be broken or my bishop's protection of my queen needs be ended. So I cannot retreat my bishop to [ f7 ] because of the former nor to [ d7 ] because of the latter. Likewise I cannot safely take on [ f5 ] without losing my queen. So I would have had to lose my bishop for a pawn and with Knight v 3 pawns White would have a slightly better ending.
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ c3 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ e3 ]  [ a6 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ B x d3 ]  [ Q x d3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B d6 ]  [ N b d2 ] , [ f5 ]  Weakens the kingside but defences the [ e4 ] move from white what I wanted all the time. I must now search for other plans.
 [ B x b4 ]  [ a x b4 ]  [ Q x b4 ] , [ B g6 + ]  i had to protect my knight somehow and this was he best way.
 [ N f6 ]  [ g3 ] , [ e6 ]  Black announces his intention to compete with White for control of d5.
 [ Q x e5 + ]  [ B e7 ]  [ R f1 ] , [ h6 ]  The Knight has no flight square! Now in addition to his positional disadvatages he will face a material one as well.
 [ e6 ] , [ B c4 ]  Developping quickly is necessary to take profit from the gambit.
 [ N f3 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ e3 ] , [ d6 ]  I though [ d5 ] was better but JK like the open diagonal...
 [ e5 ]  [ B c3 ]  [ N x e3 + ]  [ K f2 ]  [ d4 ]  [ B d2 ]  [ N d1 + ]  [ K e2 ] , [ N x b2 ]  Needless to say I was fairly happy with the last 4 moves
 [ Q d3 ] , [ N h4 ]  This is a ploy by Black to remove another support from the centered N and perhaps win a piece.
 [ Q f3 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ B b2 ]  Bill goes to fight back
 [ f x e5 ] , [ d x e5 ]  Certainly Fischer must not have liked the continuation 15...[ h x g5 ] 16.[ e x f6 ] [ B x f6 ] 17.Bh5.
 [ R f3 ] , [ R f8 ]  Increasing pressure.
 [ R b8 ]  [ N x a2 ]  [ N x a2 ]  [ R x a2 ] , [ R b7 ]  Better than 25...[ R x b3 ] 26.[ R c8 + ] [ B d8 ] 27.[ R x a7 ] and when I get the chance Bg5.
 [ O-O ]  [ O-O ] , [ Q g4 ]  I was not sure about this move. I probably made it as a waiting move.
 [ B x e6 ]  [ f x e6 ] , [ Q x b7 ]  Lost a piece without a compensation + my defense is breaking.
 [ K e7 ]  [ Q g7 + ]  [ K e8 ] , [ Q x f6 ]  ?? I did not even see Qg8+. I wrote it off quickly because I thought after 29...[ R f8 ] there was not stopping promotion. But there was Qb3! Preventing the bishop from going to c2.
 [ Q e5 + ]  [ K c8 ]  [ B x d8 ]  [ K x d8 ] , [ R e8 + ]  To win the bishop.
 [ d6 ] , [ B d5 ]  Okay this is still somewhat of a book play. Similar to another game I am playing. A GK game shows [ N e7 ] with the bishop retreating but I don't like because of BxN which forces the trade. Although I could get good play with the open file he still has not committed to castling. So it could wind up destroying the king side with no compensating attack. [ B e3 ] [ B g4 ] Think I prefer [ B e3 ]  [ B e6 ] , [ c4 ]  [ B b5 ] [ B d5 ] BxB I like BxB allows knight to move without having to protect b pawn. After trade move Knight to [ d4 ]  [ B x d5 ] , [ e x d5 ]  Like the previous annotation said [ N d4 ] nice little post for the knight. If he trades the bishop in that spot is nice as well.
 [ a5 ]  [ e5 ] , [ N c6 ]  41.[ N e2 ] leaves black no chance.
 [ f5 ]  [ R e6 ]  [ R d1 + ]  [ K f2 ]  [ R d2 + ]  [ R e2 ]  [ R x e2 + ]  [ K x e2 ]  [ K f7 ] , [ K d3 ]  With the trading off of the rooks the endgame became less complicated as I don't have to calculate so many possibilities now. Since his king is so far on the kingside I figured that I would go for some play on the queenside.
 [ K d7 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N g4 ]  [ d x c6 + ]  [ K c8 ]  [ R d5 ]  [ R h2 + ]  [ K g1 ]  [ B b4 ]  [ R x d8 + ]  [ K x d8 ] , [ N d5 ]  White can get the piece back now but not equality.
 [ d x c6 ] , [ e5 ]  ?! White is playing extremely aggressively but the e-pawn was in no real danger (...[ f x e4 ] isolates Black's pawn far from any support and will be won back easily) and White needs to develop in order to compete with what is about to become a very active Black position.
 [ N x g4 ] , [ B x g4 ]  I felt I had no choice but to initiate the knight trade...
 [ b3 ]  [ f5 ]  [ c4 ]  [ Q c6 ]  [ R e1 ] , [ B e5 ]  28...Be5. If he plays 29. Bc3!? then 29...f4! 30. [ Q x e4 ] (or if 30. gxf [ B x c3 ] nets the Bishop since 31. [ Q x c3 ] [ e3 + ] 32. [ f3 ] [ R g6 ] etc) [ B x c3 ] also nets the Bishop.
 [ h4 ] , [ h5 ]  Stopping the h-pawn in its tracks but creating a weakness on the g5-square which white now exploits with...
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ N f3 ]  The game begins quietly with a Three Knights' Game.
 [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ B b5 ]  Ruy Lopez aka 'Spanish Torture'. Playing against this regularly will teach you good defensive skills but be prepared for some steady agonizing pain if you don't know what you are doing (hence the name)!
 [ c4 ]  [ N b4 ] , [ d x c5 ]  And Sasha exchanges right away since it was her center pawn. This gives brings her closer to controlling the center. Plus it will give her yet another tempo when all is said and done.
 [ N c3 ] , [ e6 ]  A solid move but still white has slight advantage.
 [ N c7 ]  [ R a3 ]  [ B x a3 ] , [ b x a3 ]  At this point one has to wonder how in the world could Black stuff things up.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ] , [ d4 ]  White is looking for an early exchange.
 [ K d2 ]  [ K f7 ] , [ K d3 ]  White should move his king in kingside he overestimate the position.
 [ N e7 ] , [ B c4 ]  White wants to move his pawn at [ d2 ] to invite the dark-squared bishop into the attack.
 [ R x f2 ]  [ K x f2 ]  [ f4 ] , [ g x f4 + ]  pawn trade two V.S. one
 [ N x f3 ] , [ d x e5 ]  Now is a good time for black to take but he's still behind. The question will he be able to come back? That remains to be seen.
 [ B c4 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ B b4 + ]  [ N c3 ] , [ N g e7 ]  Not sure about this seems a little negative
 [ N f6 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ e5 ] , [ B g3 ]  Forced but it has the advantage of putting preasure on [ e5 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O-O ] , [ d6 ]  Black should have played [ B x c3 ] with equal chances.
 [ N c3 ] , [ N e4 ]  Even better. I make pressure on white and force him into my game.
 [ B d7 ]  [ d4 ] , [ N x d4 ]  [ c x d4 ] was best
 [ K e8 ]  [ B g7 ] , [ R g8 ]  I was really worried about my position and it took me along time to figure out what my next move would be. Finally the only sensible move that I saw was [ N e5 ] getting my knight to safety and attacking his bishop.
 [ R e7 + ] , [ K d6 ]  thewrongreason: Thanks for the clarification ION. If we still had time I also would've changed my vote to what white played. And in this position I'm thinking long term strategy which might not work because of the refinement. But this is somewhat similar to the position that I had in the chess dream on Wednsday which you'll see in my next annotation. That's where I overlooked the opportunity to take a pawn which then became passed. In doing that I almost allowed a draw by rep which is what finally made me realize that my draw with the Master Mater was a waisted game. Having said that I'm thinking about that game. And with that I'm torn between 2 candidate moves involving the K with one being 34.Ke3. But my gut's telling me that we should play 34.[ K f3 ] so that'll be my vote. And ION mentioned something about that to. My idea here is to be able to at some point when it becomes a legal move to get the monarch to [ e6 ] where the [ f6 ] pawn will be unstoppable. redfoxrising: 34.[ K f3 ] ... is my suggested vote archduke_piccolo: 34.[ K f3 ] There is a subtle difference between this move and the other that comes into consideration 34.Ke3. If 34.[ K e3 ] Black will play 34...[ R h8 ] with the idea of giving check and taking out the c-pawn or maybe the bishop. Now after 34.[ K f3 ] [ R h8 ] we can play... 35.[ R a7 ] Rh3ch 36.[ K g4 ] ... gains us a tempo. If now 36... [ R x c3 ] (?) 37.[ f7 ] ... wins.
 [ e4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ B b4 ]  MY favorite variation of the french defense.
 [ R x g5 ]  [ R x h3 ]  [ R h5 ]  [ R h2 + ]  [ K c3 ]  [ h3 ]  [ g5 ]  [ R h1 ]  [ g6 ]  [ h2 ] , [ K c2 ]  If [ R a1 ] then [ g7 ] [ h1 = Q ] [ R x h1 ] [ R x h1 ] [ g8 = Q ] and I am lost.
 [ e x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ Q a5 + ]  [ N d2 ] , [ B f5 ]  See no gain pawn is protected and opened up possible queen side rook. Castle soon
 [ R x b4 ]  [ K e7 ]  [ R b7 + ] , [ K f8 ]  White appears to have a winning advantage.
 [ Q d2 ]  [ Q x d2 + ]  [ K x d2 ]  [ B x d1 ]  [ K x d1 ] , [ K g7 ]  36. ..... [ K g7 ] - Freddy now activates his king. I decide to play on a few moves until the zugzwang.
 [ Q c7 ]  [ Q h5 ]  [ N e7 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ Q c4 ] , [ N a3 ]  [ N e5 ] should have been played. Now black could take on [ a4 ] but risks a discovered attack and his own a-pawns are weak.
 [ c3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ e x d4 ] , [ c x d4 ]  in most variations [ B b4 + ] can save something: not here...
 [ N b5 ]  [ N a6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N b4 ] , [ N b5 ]  !!???!
 [ O-O ]  [ c6 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N x c6 ]  [ Q x e1 + ]  [ Q x e1 ]  [ d x c6 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ N g4 ]  [ B x h7 + ]  [ K x h7 ]  [ Q b1 + ]  [ g6 ]  [ B x c5 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ Q c1 ]  [ R e6 ]  [ f3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ Q f4 ]  [ R a e8 ]  [ g4 ] , [ B d3 ]  The black king is very vulnerable
 [ R x b5 ] , [ R a6 ]  Black is losing but he makes a few threats anyway to see if he can get anything out of the position.
 [ K f7 ] , [ K c2 ]  I still anticipated 25.[ R x g5 ] but this move makes sense to me. The idea being is that we're now in the endgame which in that phase the monarch is a powerful weapon. So in this position Joe is mobilizing his King.
 [ R c5 + ]  [ K f4 ]  [ K e7 ]  [ R g5 ]  [ R c2 ]  [ K g3 ]  [ R c3 + ]  [ K h4 ]  [ R c2 ]  [ f4 ]  [ R c4 ]  [ K x h5 ]  [ R x f4 ]  [ h4 ]  [ K f6 ]  [ g3 ]  [ R f3 ]  [ K h6 ]  [ K e6 ]  [ K g6 ]  [ R f6 + ]  [ K h5 ]  [ R f3 ]  [ R g6 + ]  [ K f5 ]  [ K h6 ]  [ K e4 ]  [ h5 ]  [ R f5 ]  [ g4 ]  [ R f4 ]  [ K g7 ]  [ K f3 ]  [ g5 ]  [ R h4 ]  [ h6 ]  [ R h5 ]  [ h7 ]  [ K g4 ]  [ h8 = Q ]  [ R x g5 ]  [ Q c8 + ]  [ K h5 ] , [ Q h3 # ]  
 [ R d f6 ]  [ Q e3 ] , [ Q c8 ]  Black intends [ Q h3 + ] but moving the Q off the 7th rank allows White to win the exchange.
 [ h x g3 ] , [ N e3 ]  <Mini-seminar on forking: Session 3>
 [ O-O ]  [ g5 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ f5 ] , [ N e5 ]  I learned at one point that if you can take [ e5 ] or [ d5 ] with a Knight you should do it. I'm not sure if that's always true but with the Queen threat present here thanks to Black's advanced pawns and no development I was all for it.
 [ f4 ]  [ e x f4 ]  [ B x f4 ]  [ Q d7 ]  [ B h3 ] , [ Q a4 ]  To provoke more weaknesses.
 [ B g2 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ d x e4 ] , [ O-O ]  I didn't play [ B c4 ] preventing rock because of [ N d2 ] missing that [ B d3 ] attacking the queen was good for black.
 [ b x c7 + ]  [ K x c7 ]  [ R c1 ]  [ b6 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ B f4 + ] , [ K b7 ]  THis was a mistake - I should have gone to [ c1 ]  [ B f3 + ]  [ K c8 ]  [ Q a4 ]  [ R d7 ]  [ Q a6 + ] , [ K d8 ]  Quick - get that K out of there!
 [ B g2 ] , [ B x h5 ]  27......... [ B x h5 ] - and another.
 [ R b8 ] , [ h4 ]  again I could not find an immediate progress after [ R a e1 ] [ B e6 ] [ Q c5 ] and/or Re5; this move however seemed appealing at the time...
 [ N e5 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ N h7 ]  [ B x f5 ]  [ e x f5 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ g5 ]  now u know wat i mean
 [ K d4 ]  [ K c6 ]  [ a4 ] , [ K b6 ]  42. ......... [ K b6 ] - Henry spies second helpings on [ a4 ] so he makes for that square!
 [ c x d4 ]  [ e x d4 ] , [ N c6 ]  As good as d5.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ f4 ]  [ e x f4 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ g5 ]  Nothing too unusual except the choice in opening by white.
 [ Q x e4 + ]  [ B e2 ]  [ B b4 + ] , [ N c3 ]  I was in a hurry to develop and get my king out of the center. You've got to castle rapidly in an open game. I think I was more worried that he would play [ c3 ] here and I'd have to move the bishop again instead of developing the knight next or [ N b d2 ] -- probably the best move -- and make me take a move with the queen. Though I know the queen can't stay out in the middle of the board like this.
 [ g6 ]  [ d5 ] , [ N b8 ]  16. ... [ e x d5 ] 17. [ e x d5 ] loses tempo when black must move the queen to a useless square for defense.
 [ K d8 ] , [ Q a5 + ]  I had wanted to play 15. [ R f e1 ] while the black king and queen were still on the e-file but I was 1 move too late. But here I found the way to gain a tempo and get exactly what I wanted. Black cannot play 15. .. Qf8?? to block for then he loses his queen so he has to run back to [ e8 ] where I wanted him. I am inclined to give this move an exclamation 15. [ Q a5 ] ! for the pure simplistic beauty of its quiet but inexorable threat.
 [ B b2 ]  [ N g4 ]  [ e3 ]  [ N g f6 ]  [ h3 ]  [ B d6 ] , [ N d2 f3 ]  White's position was always solid but with time to develop White may now be better.
 [ K b1 ] , [ c5 ]  Forcing the knight out.
 [ N c3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ Q f3 ]  [ h5 ] , [ B c4 ]  I kind of like [ N d5 ] here which threatens the black queen. Black must then play [ Q d6 ] or [ Q c5 ] to defend against NxP[ c7 + ] which forks black's a rook.
 [ B e6 ] , [ R x g7 ]  My rook can easily become trapped. Is always a tought fight very interesting.
 [ B g4 ]  [ h3 ]  [ B h5 ] , [ g4 ]  Ruins the kingside. This is fine - as long as he does not castle kingside.
 [ O-O ]  [ g6 ] , [ a4 ]  Preventing me from advancing with ...[ [ b5 ] ] but is it really relevant in the current position? I have already committed myself with ...[ b6 ] and ...[ [ b5 ] ] will only lose time. Perhaps simply developing with [ B e3 ] or retreating with [ N e1 ] preparing [ f4 ] and [ f5 ] is correct.
 [ d5 ]  [ c4 ] , [ c6 ]  Black chooses a Slav
 [ c6 ] , [ B x f6 ]  ...and attack the other rook trapping it.
 [ B c7 ]  [ R d e8 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ R a d8 ] , [ N e5 ]  Threatening Kn[ x f7 ] immediately
 [ e6 ] , [ c x d5 ]  White doesn't gain anything here by releasing the tension in the center.
 [ N x d4 ] , [ N d5 ]  The Bishop is immune due to the fork on c7.
 [ N f3 ] , [ c6 ]  I'm not keen on this response from black though I think it's still within book I don't like that it restricts the knight
 [ b x c5 + ]  [ K x c5 ]  [ K d3 ]  [ d4 ]  [ K c2 ]  [ K c4 ]  [ K d2 ] , [ d3 ]  45. .......... [ d3 ] - over the last few moves white has had to go back back back. Now white makes a mistake and plays 46. Kc1. [ K d1 ] would have prolonged the game but I would have manoeuvered Henry over to [ f3 ] and I would be able to clean up a couple of kingside pawns and crown the h pawn about 3 moves before white could crown his a pawn. However ......
 [ K d5 ] , [ B x d3 ]  I'm really getting on top here
 [ K x h5 ]  [ K f3 ]  [ N d2 + ]  [ K e2 ]  [ N b1 ]  [ K f3 ]  [ K g5 ]  [ K e4 ]  [ K g4 ]  [ N e1 ]  [ K g3 ]  [ K d3 ]  [ K f2 ]  [ N c2 ]  [ e4 + ]  [ K x e4 ]  [ K e2 ]  [ K d5 ] , [ K d2 ]  There is nothing more I can do to save the position. So I resign here.
 [ N g1 + ] , [ K e1 ]  The knight is now without any sensible moves.White can't do anything about the e pawn marching down the board. She plays on to mate but further annotation is not necessary.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N g5 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ N a5 ]  [ d3 ]  [ h6 ] , [ N e4 ]  I'm going to guess that this was an oversight.
 [ e x f5 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ O-O-O ]  I generally do not castle on the Queenside but will not hestitate to do so when I believe the position warrants it.
 [ R x e4 ]  [ B d5 ]  [ R x e8 + ] , [ R x e8 ]  19. ...... [ R x e8 ] - rook trade. It looks like a nice peaceful ending does it not? Things can change dramatically though.
 [ Q x e3 ]  [ R e8 ] , [ O-O ]  Finally castling to move the king out of the center.
 [ R c6 + ]  [ K x f7 ]  [ a4 ] , [ R e6 + ]  transforming advantages again. The endgame is easily won for white.
 [ e x d4 ] , [ B x b5 + ]  Takes pawn with check
 [ K b6 ] , [ K c4 ]  
 [ f3 ]  [ Q g6 ] , [ K h1 ]  15. [ K h1 ] - Henry sidesteps a possible pin but this is where he will be boxed in!
 [ N e4 ] , [ Q f5 ]  Black continues to waste even more time and just leaves his King in the center where it is exposed to attack.
 [ N d5 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ e4 ] , [ g3 ]  I wanted to blunt out the bishop and i thought i can handle a knight coming to [ f3 ]  [ N e5 ] , [ Q c3 ]  I thought about nb6ch a long time but decided to add more pressure on black
 [ N d5 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ Q x d5 ]  [ Q e2 ]  [ B e6 ] , [ B e3 ]  Finishing development. [ c4 ] at some point here seems pretty good.
 [ h x g6 ] , [ K f2 ]  [ K f2 ] in order to play [ R h1 ]  [ Q x c5 ]  [ N x c5 ] , [ B a3 ]  Ba3! X-rays to the Rook
 [ K e8 ] , [ g4 ]  the knight is trapped!
 [ Q f4 ] , [ Q f3 ]  15. [ Q f3 ] - there are a lot of black pieces buzzing around Henry. I see Fou Leblanc is hanging on a4. [ Q f3 ] does not lose a piece however because if the Wicked Witch of the West snaps up Fou Leblanc then the knight on [ f5 ] is hanging. Glenda duly swipes it.
 [ B b5 ]  [ R b b1 ]  [ B a4 ]  [ R d e1 ]  [ B c6 ]  [ Q d3 ] , [ Q f5 ]  ! - A nice response forces me to pull the Bishop back to keep my knight.
 [ R x a3 ]  [ h3 ]  [ Q a5 ]  [ R e a1 ]  [ R a8 ]  [ g4 ]  [ B e4 ]  [ Q b2 ] , [ B x b4 ]  All in all it was an exciting game for what I would like to thank for my opponent! Being a bit more aggressive probably the result would have been the opposite!
 [ e4 ] , [ g6 ]  More experimentation on random openings.
 [ N h5 + ]  [ K h8 ] , [ N x f6 ]  The h pawn is doomed
 [ e4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ Q x d5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ Q e5 + ]  [ B e2 ]  [ c6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ d4 ] , [ B f5 ]  All completely standard so far (for me).
 [ e6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ B g5 ] , [ B e7 ]  now it is the queens gambit decline
 [ R g6 g4 ] , [ Q h3 ]  if 19.[ Q h6 ] then 19...Rg8-[ g6 ] and we will end up in the same position as in the game.
 [ K g6 ]  [ g5 ] , [ a5 ]  Black probably should have just played 43...[ K h6 ] but this move does not really cause problems other than giving up a tempo.
 [ Q c6 ]  [ B e7 ] , [ Q x c3 ]  At this point I decided to try to grab as many pawns as I could
 [ d x e5 ] , [ N b d2 ]  I think White is better and can get the material easily .
 [ N x b3 ] , [ a x b3 ]  That's because I take this way as opposed to playing 7.[ c x b3 ] The idea being is that like we saw with one TA's blitz Q sacs I now have an open file with the Rook. As I learned in that game open files can be dangerous.
 [ R d1 + ]  [ K a2 ] , [ g6 ]  ???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? Joy! This is probably the worst move he could have played.
 [ a6 ]  [ B c4 ] , [ B e6 ]  If White captures I will have a half-open KB file for my KR to use. Of course I would have to unpin my KN first so I could clear the decks.
 [ N e4 ] , [ Q e3 ]  There were better ways to maintain the pressure. 12. [ B x d8 ] seems the best way to save the position.
 [ b x c6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B b4 ]  [ B d2 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ R e8 ]  [ a3 ] , [ B c5 ]  [ B c5 ] gave me more options than [ B a5 ] after 11. b4. Nonetheless I ended up moving my bishop to [ b6 ] anyway.
 [ N x d4 ] , [ e x d5 ]  Or not. Black voluntarily doubles his pawns on the d-file but this is generally not very weak and either way it was going to happen on [ d5 ] or d4.
 [ N c4 ]  [ B e1 ]  [ Q d7 ] , [ N e c3 ]  A change of plan ! Let's secure ourselves from [ R f8 ] place the queen at [ c2 ] and be prepared for [ Q e2 ] whatsoever be the outcome of f3.
 [ K c4 ] , [ R a2 ]  I'm really after the f pawn here but first I have to chase off the g pawn.
 [ K c7 ]  [ N x e6 + ]  [ K b6 ] , [ R a b1 + ]  My pieces start closing in on the enemy king.
 [ R x h4 + ] , [ K x h4 ]  finally...small piece advantage and good position... only took 27 moves!
 [ R f8 ] , [ B g3 ]  Moving my bishop to further protect my king.
 [ N c2 ] , [ B b3 ]  21... [ R x d3 ] was a possibility but I thought the move played was stronger simply because I hadn't considered White's reply!
 [ g x h3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ Q g4 ]  White still has the idea of trading queens rapidly to simplify his position but black of course......
 [ K h2 ] , [ b x c4 ]  and the bishop is won
 [ Q d6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ d x c4 ]  [ R x c4 ] , [ N d5 ]  A blunder by Black allowing a quick finish
 [ B x d7 ] , [ R c7 ]  [ B g7 ] was best for black.
 [ h3 ] , [ b5 ]  attacking the white knight at [ a4 ] knight which will eventually lead to a pawn advantage.
 [ N f3 ] , [ N f6 ]  Next we developed out knights. I played [ f3 ] and black played f6.
 [ f x e3 ] , [ B g5 ]  Now 17. [ R c3 ] would fail to Nxd4.
 [ f6 ]  [ a3 ]  [ B f7 ]  [ b3 ] , [ Q a6 ]  Aiming for [ e2 ] but here the Queen is out of action for a long time to come.
 [ N f3 ] , [ d x c4 ]  I mean accepted
 [ R h3 + ]  [ K d4 ]  [ R h4 ]  [ f5 ]  [ K f7 ]  [ K e5 ]  [ R h5 ] , [ R b7 + ]  to imprison the king in the 8th row.
 [ R g3 + ]  [ K d2 ]  [ R g1 ] , [ N c2 ]  (!?) A crucial decision. Well I thought so at the time. At this point I was worried that White might be tough-minded enough to try 86.[ N x a2 ] [ R g2 ] 87.[ K c3 ] [ R x a2 ] 88.[ K b4 ] leaving Black with a R b-P vs B endgame - notoriously difficult to win. I spent quite a bit of time on this ending after 88...[ R a8 ] 89.[ B g7 ] (say) [ R a7 ] 90.[ B d4 ] Rb7. Black's plan would then be to bring the K over to defend the pawn (no trivial task when the WK has access to c5!) so that the rook would then be free to clear a path to the queening square. As it transpired the game would have been winnable but the process would have been a long one.
 [ B e7 ] , [ B x c6 ]  Too little too late...
 [ N b c6 ]  [ h5 ] , [ e5 ]  opening up the LSB diagonal: [ B g4 ] is not nice...
 [ K f2 ]  [ R c8 ]  [ R h1 ] , [ R c7 ]  27...[ R c7 ] ! was better because of the time i missed it aggain .
 [ b4 ] , [ B b7 ]  12. ...... [ B b7 ] - finally the decks are cleared.
 [ N x d3 + ] , [ R x d3 ]  11. [ R x d3 ] - I have no desire to capture with my pawn and mess up my pawn structure so the rook recaptures.
 [ R x h6 ] , [ O-O-O ]  Not exactly an early castle here but I liked my Rook lined up on the d column
 [ N e5 ]  [ h4 ] , [ h5 ]  The main idea of the Soltis variation. It seems odd that Black spends time shuffling kingside pawns but it turns out that the h-pawn advance usefully hinders White's attack buying Black valuable time on the queenside.
 [ Q c5 ]  [ R d2 ]  [ Q c6 ]  [ g4 ]  [ Q f3 ] , [ g5 ]  My first mistake in time pressure. Now 28...[ Q f4 ] wins a pawn. However my opponent is also playing very fast and trying to imbalance the game.
 [ K g6 ] , [ b4 ]  Not sure why. Probably nothing better.
 [ Q c6 ] , [ b3 ]  ?? Completely blocking off the queenside. There are three better options here. 1. A much better move may hav been 16. [ a3 ] because of 16...bx[ a3 ] 17. bx[ a3 ] 18.Rf-b1. This would have been a lot better because my king would have been a lot safer and I could have attacked the queenside without endangering my kingside as you will see my kingside is soon under attack in this game. 17. f4! which opens the centre and leaves the possibility of couterplay on the queenside. 3. [ N g3 ] with the plan of putting it on [ f5 ] with a powerful position. Basically I played one of the worst possible moves here.(within reason)
 [ N d6 ]  [ B x d6 ] , [ c x d6 ]  Now White has a good-sized advantage
 [ f4 ]  [ B e3 + ]  [ K b1 ] , [ B x f4 ]  Black wins back the pawn he has been down for the last ten moves and is starting to coordinate against White's kingside. After 11. [ f4 ] it is now White who is responding to threats; if Black wants this to continue he will need to find a way to develop his rooks quickly and maintain the initiative.
 [ e x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ] , [ N x e5 ]  White accepts the offered pawn...
 [ e x f4 ] , [ B f5 ]  A good idea to try and develop the bishop but leaves his [ d5 ] pawn unguarded. 14...[ c6 ] and then developing the bishop on the alternate pawn islands would have been better.
 [ Q x d5 ] , [ b x a6 ]  I think I overlooked the obvious.
 [ B c5 ]  [ R d x d7 + ]  [ K c8 ]  [ R d c7 + ]  [ K d8 ]  [ R c d7 + ]  [ K c8 ] , [ R d c7 + ]  will draw if not [ Q x d7 ] then [ R x d7 ] then k[ x d7 ] then [ Q x c5 ] then white wins
 [ N g f3 ]  [ R c7 ] , [ R a c1 ]  Ra-c1?! This move swaps off two rooks for a queen which is generally seen as bad but it is quite hard for Black to win.
 [ Q e1 ]  [ Q c8 ]  [ N a2 ]  [ c5 ] , [ Q c3 ]  Do I want to take it and trade queens.. Or do I want to push the pawn and lock things up even more and make it harder to get to his king.
 [ N f3 ] , [ R x f3 ]  As you see White cannot recapture the rook because of 13. ... Qh2#.
 [ N b4 ]  [ B c4 ] , [ N c2 ]  Well played White manoeuvre the Knight is now posted between attack (d4) and defence (a3).
 [ R f2 ]  [ O-O-O ] , [ f5 ]  Cutting the way back for my bishop.
 [ d3 ] , [ N h5 ]  I don't know why Kieseritzky played this but as black the only move that would've come into consideration would be 7...[ B b7 ] for a nice long diagnol which is why I wouldn't have hesitated to play it.
 [ R x g1 + ]  [ K x g1 ]  [ Q x d4 + ]  [ K f1 ]  [ Q d1 + ]  [ K f2 ]  [ Q d2 + ] , [ K f1 ]  I'd like to find a way to check him with the pawn advance.
 [ d3 ] , [ h6 ]  blocking the dark bishop's threat...
 [ N b5 ]  [ R a4 ]  [ c3 ]  [ R a2 + ]  [ K e3 ]  [ R h3 + ] , [ f3 ]  You might be able to tell that I don't really know what I am doing here. I had no idea what I was supposed to be doing except waiting for a tactic to present itself or something. So I just shuffled my pieces around hopping for a blunder.
 [ N x e4 ] , [ B b2 ]  Well... the Q question is answered... I did NOT see that coming! Crazy but I didn't! I was TOO busy looking at "center control"... now I've only got two choices... no really only one... [ d3 + ]  [ d4 ] , [ N f6 ]  Undeterred by recent experiences I persevered with an Indian defence though which flavour I hadn't yet decided.
 [ B b3 ]  [ Q c7 ] , [ O-O-O ]  White completes his own development and commences trying to build up an attack.
 [ f3 ] , [ h6 ]  I decide to attack the intruding Bishop.
 [ B h2 ] , [ Q f2 + ]  53. ...... [ Q f2 + ] - #2.
 [ h6 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ O-O ] , [ a6 ]  My foe wants to capture the queen side
 [ f5 ] , [ N e7 ]  44. ..... [ N e7 ] - and with this move he gets duly spiked the [ f5 ] pawn will be lost. Dmaestro now waves the white flag. A good start to my weekend.
 [ K g2 ]  [ R f8 ]  [ B b3 ] , [ B d7 ]  Andreiken managed to get Nakamura's pesky pieces off his camp. Note that Andreiken does not want to take the rook on [ f1 ] as Nakamura would just retake with the other rook and gains control of the f-file.
 [ B d6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ] , [ c3 ]  [ c4 ] was perhaps better to undermine the support of the annoying [ e4 ] knight.
 [ B c5 ]  [ O-O ]  [ d6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ h3 ]  [ B x f3 ]  [ Q x f3 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ Q g4 ] , [ Q f6 ]  blunder by me allows Nd5!
 [ K e5 ]  [ R e8 + ]  [ K f4 ]  [ R d8 ]  [ R e3 ]  [ R d4 + ]  [ K g3 ]  [ R d6 ]  [ K g2 ]  [ R g6 + ]  [ R g3 ]  [ R e6 ]  [ h3 ]  [ R e2 + ] , [ K f1 ]  And there is no way to stop at least one of Black's pawns from Queening. I have to thank my opponent (thanks janet) for being so encouraging and helpful during the game. She certainly did not have to take the time she did and it was much appreciated. It seems that my positional game has improved (when I avoid stupid blunders) and my openings are good enough to get me into the middle game competitively. What this game has clearly demonstrated to me is that it is time to dedicate the larger portion of my study time to endgames. As always comments and input is appreciated.
 [ B e3 ]  [ O-O ] , [ g4 ]  I like [ [ g4 ] ] to meet an ...[ e5 ] by [ N f5 ] and recapture with the [ [ g4 ] ] pawn if taken there.
 [ Q e2 ] , [ O-O ]  7. ...... O-O (now is a good time to get my king out of the centre)
 [ R b8 ] , [ N g5 ]  [ f7 ] is still the goal
 [ g6 ]  [ K f2 ]  [ K g7 ] , [ B f1 ]  Stopping the c-pawn advancing. Was [ K g1 ] a mistake. Was 29...[ c4 ] better. I think so note how [ K e3 ] fails to [ N c2 + ] [ K d2 ] [ N x a3 ] Kc3. Although white gets the c-pawn the a-pawn will be more dangerous than the c was. Then black should be able to get his king in behind the white K-Side pawns. (Only quick analysis) So I will come back later and do some more this may be mistaken. I managed to lose my notes on this position so I don't know what else I saw.
 [ R e1 ]  [ B d5 ] , [ N x c5 ]  loses on the spot--had to play [ N g5 ]  [ K x c5 ]  [ R x e5 ]  [ R f1 + ]  [ K d2 ] , [ R f2 + ]  and black resigned.
 [ Q x f6 ] , [ B d3 ]  In my previous game these double bishops turn out to cause me a massive amount of trouble.
 [ N c6 ] , [ R e8 ]  ! White's Knight is now wholly shut down. It can jump back and forth between [ a7 ] and [ c6 ] but cannot participate in the battle on the kingside where the Black King can now escort his pawn majority to victory.
 [ R x g1 ]  [ N f3 + ]  [ K d1 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ] , [ f5 ]  I wanna promote as soon as possible.....
 [ R x d5 ] , [ R b6 ]  Last chance to bring a pawn to queen. The problem is that the white king dwells in between the black king and the b pawn.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ a6 ]  [ B a4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B e7 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ b5 ]  [ B b3 ]  [ d6 ] , [ c3 ]  All this so far is the main line in the Ruy Lopez.
 [ B g4 ] , [ Q x g4 ]  6. [ Q x g4 ] - and here is the sac!
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ] , [ c4 ]  This really is my first serious attempt at one of the Queen's Gambit openings.
 [ b4 ]  [ B b6 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ N h5 ]  [ N h4 ] , [ N f4 ]  Both my Knights are now on fine outposts.
 [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ g6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ] , [ e4 ]  [ N x c3 ] [ b x c3 ] and I will have a strong pawn center but allowing black a queen side pawn majority
 [ B e7 ] , [ N e4 ]  I must retreat my knight here as attacking the rook would force it to move.
 [ R x h6 ]  [ R x f8 + ]  [ K x f8 ]  [ R f1 + ] , [ R f6 ]  An it gets worse I was hoping for [ K g8 ] so I miss calculated and it cost me
 [ b6 ] , [ R h3 ]  attacking down the H-file My thought processing believed this far better the trying to play Pawn [ h4 ] [ h5 ] h6....
 [ e4 ] , [ e6 ]  The French Defense. Viewed by many to be dull(as in the exchange variation) it actually leads to sharp and tactical positions; the Winawer for example.
 [ N f6 ] , [ B f3 ]  Preventing 21...[ N d5 ] and controlling the f3-[ a8 ] diagonal.
 [ N f3 ] , [ g5 ]  If Black thinks that White will want an easy win for a pawn guess again.
 [ K g7 ] , [ R g4 + ]  ...and I attack one more time...
 [ B e3 ] , [ e6 ]  This does prepare [ [ [ d5 ] ] ] except that [ [ [ d5 ] ] ] seems immediately playable. Perhaps the ultimate aim is avoiding an isolated queen pawn but I am not sure that an immediate [ [ [ d5 ] ] ] would create one. There is also no reason to fear a reciprical pin should black play Nf6. Black should develop a piece besides the e pawn for several reasons. First white is better developed with more central active pieces. Each black move that fails to create activity adds to the disparity between black and white.
 [ R a2 ] , [ N c3 ]  Isn't this a beatyful fork? [ N f6 ] would have been a nice idea too treatening mate on g2. but white could easily defend it.
 [ R e4 ]  [ K h3 ]  [ R g4 ] , [ R g1 ]  Wow! Am I in trouble or what?
 [ B g6 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ c6 ] , [ f4 ]  12. [ f4 ] - the beginnings of a pawn storm which does not quite materialise.
 [ Q x h8 + ]  [ K e7 ]  [ R x e6 + ]  [ f x e6 ]  [ B b4 + ]  [ K f7 ]  [ Q f8 + ]  [ K g6 ]  [ B d3 + ]  [ K h5 ]  [ Q h8 + ]  [ K g4 ]  [ Q h3 + ]  [ K f4 ] , [ Q g3 # ]  
 [ N x d4 ]  [ Q x e5 + ]  [ Q e2 ]  [ Q x d4 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B b4 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B x c3 ]  [ b x c3 ]  [ Q x c3 ]  [ B b2 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ Q x e6 + ]  [ B x e6 ]  [ B x c3 ]  [ N e2 + ]  [ K h1 ]  [ N x c3 ]  [ R f e1 ] , [ N f6 ]  
 [ N x e4 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ N f d2 ]  [ N f5 ]  [ f3 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ Q d1 ] , [ B c8 ]  [TR] This is why my Bishop retreated all the way back to [ c8 ] on the last move. I considered that you may have also played [ B b2 ] in which case I needed to retreat the N. I am not working up much counterplay and I'm afraid that I'll quickly be in a worse position unless I can activate my pieces better than this. My 13...fxe was probably a poor move as now my structure isn't coordinating very well with my pieces. If your pawn was still on [ e5 ] and mine had gone f5->[ f4 ] then I would have a much better handle on what's happening here.
 [ b x c5 ]  [ R x c8 + ]  [ R x c8 ]  [ R b1 ]  [ c4 ] , [ R b8 ]  ! White pins the rook against the king. Absolute pin! This goes with my plan to reduce pieces on the board for a won endgame. White has enough time to stop the c-pawn from promoting. If 24...[ R x b8 ] 25 BxRb8...[ c3 ] 26. [ N e1 ] and black doesn't have enough support to advance the pawn. White's bishop can return in time to help.
 [ Q c2 ] , [ N x a1 ]  The knight happily trades its life for the life of a rook!
 [ d x e4 ]  [ N x e4 ] , [ Q x d4 ]  ? I think that this was a mistake on my part - and the computer (Fritz 10) corroborates this judgement. I played this move in the hope that White would allow a queen exchange which would help to consolidate Black's material advantage. However 5...[ c x d4 ] is better since it affords Black a space advantage and a firm grip on the centre as well as his material advantage. Black could then have followed up with ...[ N c6 ] and ...[ e5 ] with a powerful grip on the central dark squares.
 [ e5 ]  [ K d5 ]  [ K g6 ] , [ K x e5 ]  and I resigned.
 [ f4 ] , [ N c8 ]  [ N d6 ] [ N e4 ] it will take two moves to position this knight somewhere good giving white opportunity to develop his pieces.
 [ Q x f6 + ]  [ K g8 ] , [ Q g7 # ]  
 [ b x c6 ]  [ Q d7 + ] , [ R e5 e7 ]  -+
 [ O-O ]  [ K g7 ]  [ Q b3 ]  [ R f8 ]  [ c4 ] , [ B e5 ]  An important move. Defends my king and prevents d4. The white queen does a good job of preventing my Queenside development however the bishop on [ c8 ] is actually fairly active and it defends b7.
 [ R e7 ]  [ h2 + ] , [ K h1 ]  Still though I thought there was still chance for my opponent to make a mistake. A draw had been apparanet to me for a very long time now I think since about move 55 however I kept playing on in the hopes that white would slip up.
 [ h5 ] , [ R d2 + ]  ...and attacks the king forcing him to move.
 [ B h6 ]  [ B g3 ] , [ R g7 ]  preparing to double rooks. Whites position is really passive here and he seems just to be waiting for a squash
 [ B d3 ]  [ Q a1 + ]  [ N b1 ] , [ N d7 ]  good move the idea is to manoeuvre the knight to [ e5 ] and makes strong pressure on d3. and the problem for white is that it seems that he doesn't a wear of his dangerous situation and don't pay attention on whats happening on his back Yard.
 [ e4 ]  [ b6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ B b7 ] , [ B d3 ]  I have very little experience against Indian Defenses so I'm flying fairly blind.
 [ e x f3 ] , [ R g3 x g6 + ]  Black cannot capture [ f x g6 ] due to [ Q x g6 + ] followed by mate on g7.
 [ R x g2 ]  [ a5 ]  [ R a2 ]  [ K b5 ]  [ K f7 ]  [ a6 ]  [ K f6 ]  [ R e4 ]  [ g5 ]  [ R a4 ]  [ R b2 + ]  [ K a5 ]  [ R b8 ]  [ h5 ]  [ R g8 ]  [ a7 ]  [ g4 ]  [ K b6 ]  [ K g5 ]  [ a8 = Q ]  [ R x a8 ]  [ R x a8 ]  [ K x h5 ]  [ K c5 ]  [ K g5 ]  [ K d4 ]  [ K f4 ]  [ K d3 ]  [ K f3 ]  [ R f8 + ]  [ K g2 ]  [ K e2 ]  [ g3 ]  [ R h8 ]  [ K g1 ] , [ K f3 ]  
 [ d5 ] , [ d4 ]  2. [ d4 ] - first two moves follow my consultation game v Ipissimus (Martin) but black will deviate from this on his next turn.
 [ R d3 + ] , [ K c2 ]  Now I can save the B in [ f5 ] threatening a discovered check. But... [ g4 ] and I am committed to play double check or get out the lsb from the game. But... can I get something more from the position?
 [ B x d4 ] , [ N b6 ]  ?! I was trying to counter into the middle but finally I think an attack on the queen side would have been better. Now I can't freely move my [ b7 ] pawn.
 [ B g3 ] , [ R a g2 ]  and faced with inevitable catastrophic loss of material or mate I resigned.
 [ R g4 x g5 ] , [ R a8 # ]  
 [ K c2 ] , [ B d1 + ]  I need you back down there sir.
 [ h x g3 ] , [ B g6 ]  ?! [ B g4 ] seems like a better choice.
 [ c x d5 ]  [ Q x d5 ] , [ N c3 ]  5. [ N c3 ] - but a pawn trade takes place and now black's queen is gonna be pestered - she retreats to the safety of d8.
 [ Q a4 ]  [ B x d4 + ] , [ Q x d4 ]  He should have played it earlier.
 [ B d4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ B b2 ] , [ N g4 ]  Of course I don't care about pawns. Not in this position. If the WQ leaves [ c4 ] threatens e3. [ h2 ] is en prise.
 [ N g e2 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ O-O-O ]  My king is safe I still control the center fairly well and my pieces are all on great squares
 [ Q f6 ] , [ c4 ]  ?? My goal is to exchange her pawns but she is behind. Therefore she is not going to just accept this exchange. Instead she is going to respond with an important move. Consequently this is a serious blunder as it is going to loose my rook. Of course I am still thinking about and am overwhelmed by this Hurricane. If that is not bad enough I am not the only one who is overwhelmed by the storm. I work at a retail store and we are running out of flashlights and D batteries. Afterall all of my customers are buying supplies because we know that it is only a matter of time before this storm produces a lot of damage so we are prepared.
 [ K c6 ]  [ e7 ] , [ K d7 ]  I'm gonna sacrifice 2 queens to take a rook and a queen. strange but effective.
 [ O-O ] , [ h6 ]  [ h6 ] to make it impossible to move the knight to [ g5 ]  [ g5 ] , [ B x c6 ]  I lost my knight no problem - recapture
 [ d5 ] , [ N b6 ]  His [ e5 ] took us out of the Opening Databases (not that either of us were using them at the time of course. With my king still in the centre I felt best to close the centre although I did consider exchanging pawns too. [ N b6 ] looks a dreadful move. It blocks the advance of his b pawn. I think he wanted to give another square to his [ N f6 ] (another downside of [ R e8 ] was that he now has less squares for that Knight.
 [ K g7 ]  [ R x c7 ]  [ R x c7 ]  [ Q x c7 + ]  [ K g8 ] , [ R x f8 + ]  I had to think long and hard about 36. Rxf8+. I had to make sure I had sufficient time to move my queen into a more effective position (note that it cannot reach back to cover the King if some perpetual check scenario was possible).
 [ f4 ] , [ K b5 ]  This is kind of insane because the king will not do anything here.
 [ N c5 ]  [ R x b7 ]  [ N x b7 ] , [ R b8 ]  I'd rather have a Knight there even though Knights are tricky little beasts!
 [ K g8 ]  [ h5 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ h6 ] , [ g6 ]  Black has a really cramped position white will strengthen the hold on the c file
 [ d6 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ b4 ]  [ B f6 ]  [ N g5 ]  [ B x g2 ]  [ K x g2 ]  [ R e8 ] , [ Q f3 ]  15 Qf3? Here is my only really significant mistake i didnt see it at the time but my d pawn is hanging. Fortunately for me black gets greedy and want to push his pawn forward with 15...[ e5 ]  [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ Q x d5 ]  [ N x c6 ]  [ Q x c6 ]  [ Q e2 + ]  [ B e7 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ O-O-O ]  [ B e6 ]  [ Q e3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ Q g3 ] , [ N h5 ]  12. Nh5! good move eliminating the threat on the Black's king side
 [ Q e6 ] , [ B f6 ]  Black is going to have trouble castling now. 13. ... [ N e7 ] 14. [ R a d1 ]  [ a6 ]  [ R a d1 ]  [ b5 ]  [ N d5 ] , [ R c8 ]  None of black's pieces can move except his bishop!
 [ c3 ] , [ B a5 ]  The players in my chessclub said [ B e7 ] was better
 [ h3 ]  [ K f1 ] , [ h2 ]  The power of the knight truly shines now. White resigns. Lessons from the game; 1) Don't play the Hillbilly attack :) 2) Play [ h3 ] and [ a3 ] moves only if necessary. They are often misused.
 [ d x e4 ] , [ N x e4 ]  This exchange leaves Wurm with a centralized Knight.
 [ K h7 ] , [ d7 ]  He did this for me to move my bishop. It doesn't really matter what I do at this point he wins.
 [ N b3 ] , [ N x b3 ]  Clearing the g1-[ a7 ] diagonal with tempo is surely best but which piece to capture? Black reasons that the [ b3 ] knight is more valuable than White's bad [ d3 ] bishop especially as . .Nx[ d3 ] allows cx[ d3 ] and blunts the thematic ...d5!
 [ d x c3 ] , [ h5 ]  Black's quiet foot soldier informs White's LSB that his presence is a blight upon all that is good.
 [ e5 ]  [ Q f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ g4 ]  ? places a pawn which is immediately threatened!
 [ K d2 ]  [ a5 ]  [ a3 ]  [ a x b4 ]  [ a x b4 ] , [ N d6 ]  Now the Black knight starts a long manoeuvre towards the squares behind the enemy lines. There is also the possibility to sacrifice a piece for two pawns. But Black play with calm.
 [ b4 ] , [ N b6 ]  ...Nb6? - This was a mistake. All I've done is restricted my king and pawns making it difficult to get the king behind the pawns to safety and it looks as though White is opening routes for rook and bishop. Maybe I should have played ...[ N a6 ] last move.
 [ B e7 ]  [ B x e7 ]  [ N x e7 ]  [ g4 ]  [ N g6 ]  [ Q h5 ]  [ B c6 ] , [ d5 ]  a much more open board now developed with the possibility of a knock out blow being landed by either player.
 [ Q h8 + ] , [ K d7 ]  he moved there to prevent the deadly king-queen rook pin it was a good move.
 [ N f6 ] , [ N e5 ]  Starting to push into his territory although now I leave the [ d4 ] pawn completely exposed to the queen.
 [ R x f7 + ]  [ K g6 ] , [ R c7 ]  Now instead of wanting a draw - I WANT to win :)
 [ N e4 ]  [ R a c1 ]  [ f5 ]  [ N d2 ]  [ R e f8 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ R c e8 ]  [ Q e2 ]  [ Q f7 ]  [ R c e1 ]  [ R e6 ]  [ N d2 ]  [ Q e7 ]  [ Q d1 ]  [ N g5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ N x g5 ]  [ h x g5 ]  [ Q f3 ]  [ f4 ]  [ K h1 ]  [ b5 ]  [ a3 ]  [ a5 ]  [ N d1 ]  [ b4 ]  [ a x b4 ]  [ B x b4 ]  [ R e2 ]  [ R f8 ]  [ e4 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ Q g4 ]  [ R d8 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ R x d4 ]  [ K g1 ]  [ R d8 ]  [ N a2 ]  [ B d2 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ R e5 ]  [ N b1 ]  [ B b4 ]  [ K h1 ]  [ a4 ]  [ R c1 ]  [ e3 ]  [ R f1 ] , [ R e d5 ]  39.[ R c1 ] [ e3 ] [ N a3 ] would have been better 40.[ R f1 ] [ R e d5 ]  [ Q f3 ] , [ R d5 d1 ]  The end is near
 [ b x c5 ] , [ b x c5 ]  Black is lost here. Amazing considering Black has a queen on an open board.
 [ N f6 ] , [ B g5 ]  Developing with a pin.
 [ O-O ]  [ O-O ] , [ Q b3 ]  The computer calls this a mistake but I like this square for my queen it threatens the [ b7 ] pawn and is on a nice diagonal with the black king
 [ B x d7 ] , [ N x d7 ]  That passed pawn is still a threat but for now not too much of one I can regain material by taking the [ b7 ] knight first
 [ R e8 ]  [ O-O ] , [ e5 ]  A good pawn break by my opponent.
 [ B x c6 ] , [ Q x c6 ]  Completing the exchange.
 [ e3 ] , [ b4 ]  22. [ Q x e3 ] [ B g5 ] pins my Queen against the Rook. 22. [ f x e3 ] creates an isolated pawn and weakens my defense but was probably the best choice.
 [ a6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ d6 ]  [ d3 ]  [ B g4 ] , [ h3 ]  I don't like the Bishop pinning my Knight down on f3. So with [ h3 ] I attempt to drive it away.
 [ h5 ]  [ e6 ]  [ R f g1 ]  [ B f4 ] , [ d5 ]  The d-pawn is worth blocking off the bishop in order to get the queen to [ f3 ] then g2.
 [ Q e4 ] , [ O-O ]  Takes the pressure off make white work for this.
 [ B g6 ] , [ d4 ]  Closes the centre which often makes knights more significant but here I am happy with my lsb white's bishops on the other hand are more restricted
 [ B b4 + ]  [ B d2 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ e5 ]  [ Q d5 ]  [ R h2 ]  [ d3 ] , [ c3 ]  I do not see why he avoids taking this pawn
 [ e x d5 ]  [ c x d5 ] , [ N x b5 ]  here is the free pawn
 [ h6 ] , [ Q a4 + ]  It was here I couldnt tell how but I could see a vague stronghold I could gain with both the Bishop and Queen coming together around [ d7 ]  [ K f7 ]  [ B h3 ] , [ e5 ]  Maybe [ e6 ] would have ben smarter? That gives Black no more pawn with which to defend and gives White an outpost for white Bishop with [ B e6 + ]  [ Q e8 ]  [ N f5 + ] , [ K d8 ]  Black has got to be running scared here....just a few moves away from mate no tempo no development I was extrememly happy with what I was sure was going to be the outcome..
 [ B d3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N g5 ]  [ h6 ]  [ B h7 + ] , [ K h8 ]  12. ...... [ K h8 ] (forced) thank God my rook is defending [ f7 ] can you the jury see why I say thank God?
 [ B e3 ]  [ B b6 ]  [ B x b6 ]  [ c x b6 ]  [ Q e3 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ O-O-O ]  ?! We discussed this one at length afterwards. I still don't like it.
 [ Q e1 ]  [ Q h5 ]  [ Q g3 ] , [ d6 ]  Blocking the Queen's attack but at the cost of weakening the now backward KP.
 [ N f6 ] , [ B f4 ]  Departing from opening theory with early pressure on c7. I could stop it with 3. ...[ a6 ] but that's too reactive of a move. I could even play 3. ...N[ a6 ] which is really cowardly and runs into trouble after 4. [ e3 ] (or even 4. e4?). Perhaps I could indirectly answer the threat with 3. ...e6. Then there is 4. [ N b5 ] [ B b4 + ] 5. [ c3 ] Ba5. Other moves that might work are [ N h5 ] [ B d7 ] and c5. [ c5 ] does look interesting but seems kind of hair-raising.
 [ B g4 ]  [ R d8 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ e3 ]  [ N c2 ] , [ a4 ]  Oops white is vulnerable to a pawn fork of his knight and bishop.
 [ R d4 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ Q d2 ] , [ N h4 ]  29. ..... [ N h4 ] - I threaten a family fork of my own but the threat is easily dealt with.
 [ K f7 ] , [ R b1 ]  Mistake again but not a vital one. [ R d1 ] is the best move this was just a plan to free up the knight.
 [ g3 ]  [ e5 ]  [ B g2 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ d3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B g4 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ e4 ]  [ d4 ]  [ a3 ]  [ h6 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ c3 ]  [ B x f3 ]  [ B x f3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ c4 ]  [ a6 ]  [ b4 ]  [ Q d7 ]  [ Q b3 ]  [ a5 ]  [ b5 ]  [ N d8 ]  [ a4 ]  [ N e6 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ Q e7 ]  [ N a3 ]  [ N c5 ]  [ Q c2 ]  [ b6 ]  [ N b1 ]  [ Q d6 ]  [ N d2 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ B f6 ] , [ N e1 ]  Four knight moves in a row lets black develop. Not sure why [ e1 ] is better than f3.
 [ K h6 ] , [ B b3 ]  The irony of it! This bishop which a short while ago was fighting for its life in what looked like a fatal trap slams shut the door to the prison for the rook on b2. The game now takes on something of the deadlock aspects of the entrenched warfare of the First World War's Western Front. At the moment Black has one rook completely immobilsed and his King shut in on the h-file. White's pieces are slightly the freer but he has no counterpart to Black's semi-mobile pawn centre. Both sides look for an opening still looking to impose themselves upon the game.
 [ Q e1 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ Q d8 ]  [ N e3 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ Q c3 ] , [ R b8 ]  18...[ b x a5 ] I think would be better but 18...[ R b8 ] was still a great move.
 [ N c2 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ N x b4 + ] , [ K c5 ]  Normally it's a bad idea when a knight has your king in check to approach the knight on a space diagonal to that knight. It usually allows the knight to retreat and give check at the same time. But in this case both squares that allow white's knight to move with check are covered ([ d3 ] and a6) so white can only retreat the knight.
 [ Q d2 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ R a d1 ] , [ B f6 ]  15....... [ B f6 ] - improves the position of the prelate - protects [ g7 ] and hits at [ b2 ] - this will be a crucial square for black later on in the game. I am now fully developed but I need to centralise my rooks.
 [ Q x e4 ] , [ K f8 ]  I'm not sure why he played this. But his [ h7 ] or [ g4 ] pawn could've been protected with 26...[ h5 ] However I would answer with 27.[ Q e8 + ] and after 27...[ K g7 ] 28.[ N e7 ] followed by 29.[ Q g7 + ] and I believe that mate would be unavoidable. Even if I couldn't mate immediately I think that white still has an inevitable mating sequence.
 [ Q h6 ] , [ e4 ]  The natural response a fork that makes the queen look extremely exposed on h6. However Suba has the game in control. The following sacrifices shatter white's kingside.
 [ K g7 ] , [ R d7 + ]  ?? leaves his king unprotected from ..[ R f3 ] check and he has no mate yet his knought is too far and i have too many pieces to defend.
 [ f6 ] , [ Q x f6 ]  why not!
 [ K h1 ] , [ Q x e1 # ]  two. I was focused on the queen kill in this one by missing the opportunity but it lead to an easy endgame.
 [ B b2 ] , [ O-O ]  So now white is facing an interesting dilema. I thought about going for a queen castling and the push on BK defences or play safe and go for a short castling.
 [ h3 ]  [ N h6 ]  [ f4 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ R a d1 ]  [ R h d8 ]  [ R x d5 ]  [ R x d5 ]  [ g4 ] , [ a5 ]  Trying to put some pressure on the QS pawn structure.
 [ R e7 + ]  [ K d8 ]  [ R x b7 + ]  [ K c8 ]  [ R x h7 ] , [ N c6 ]  giving free night is of course better than whole free rook
 [ N x e4 ] , [ B x d8 ]  What I didn't expect black to do was willing give up the exchange. I guess he thought he could recover the material or compensate somehow.
 [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ B b5 ]  Yes the anticipated Ruy Lopez.
 [ d3 ] , [ B b4 ]  Well I'm out of book moves. Just playing by ear. White offered me the classic knight pin so I take it relieving a little pressure from d5.
 [ N f3 ] , [ h5 ]  ? ...but interesting. In fact I decided I could just ignore it. I want a pawn in [ h3 ] so no problem with that pawn.
 [ b x c3 ]  [ N a6 ] , [ B a3 ]  There are just two games in my database with 6...Na6. White played 7.[ g3 ] in one and 7.[ Q d4 ] in the other. Black won both games.
 [ B x h3 ] , [ B x a8 ]  Now if 18... [ Q x a8 ] then 19. [ Q f3 ] is no different than the main game.
 [ B x f3 ] , [ g x f3 ]  Now I can begin to pressure White's kingside.
 [ B x a3 ]  [ N x a3 ]  [ Q e7 ] , [ B b5 + ]  Fischer tries to generate an attack on Celle's King which is stuck in the center of the board.
 [ b5 ]  [ B b3 ]  [ B e8 ] , [ R x d8 ]  24. Rxd8?! - in retrospect maybe I could have delayed this trade by playing [ B c2 ] and then b4. This move may well have enabled me to have put my [ e2 ] knight on [ d4 ] after the second rook trade and this may well have made the vital difference between another loss to Ion and a high draw.
 [ Q e7 ] , [ e5 ]  Trying to squeeze black's position.
 [ R e7 ]  [ R h4 ] , [ Q e8 ]  (RC) Now Lasker must be careful how he presses his attack for he has the burden of his weak KP to carry. The promising line is N-[ B4 ] threatening N-[ N6 ] ch but Black will simply answer N-[ R3 ] since he no longer needs to defend his Q pawn. Lasker therefore plays his Queen to a square where she will still be attacking the Q pawn after he has played N-B4.
 [ B c5 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ d6 ] , [ R f7 ]  ...and put the rook on the attack.
 [ K g1 ]  [ Q d1 + ] , [ K f2 ]  His only move.
 [ N e g5 ]  [ Q e7 + ] , [ K f1 ]  8. [ K f1 ] - Klaus is prevented from castling but he has a way of showing me that this is no hardship for him.
 [ N d2 ] , [ B b7 ]  A move that is different from the normal Marshall. Normally the Black Queen is on [ h3 ] and the black LSB is on [ g4 ] setting up nice mating nets. Here though Q[ h3 ] drops a pawn so deploying the bishop along the [ a8 ] [ h1 ] diagonal seems effective.
 [ N f7 + ]  [ K d7 ] , [ R e7 # ]  That's all folks! Thanks for reading - all comments welcome.
 [ B d2 ] , [ R d6 ]  go on the left i take the right and vice versa.
 [ K x g5 ] , [ b4 ]  Here they come!
 [ e4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e5 ]  [ c5 ]  [ c3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ f4 ]  Quite dubious. Ali chose to be more ambitious in place of the normal continuation 5.Nf3. Equal would have been 5...[ B d7 ] 6.[ B e3 ] [ Q b6 ] 7.[ Q d2 ] [ c x d4 ] 8.[ c x d4 ] [ B b4 ] 9.Nc3.
 [ N f3 ] , [ R a7 ]  The only way I could possibly generate play would be to maneuver my major pieces around and make a [ b5 ] boost effective otherwise this position is a dead draw.
 [ b3 ]  [ a6 ]  [ B a3 ] , [ Q a5 ]  Premature. White is attacking the black pawn on [ [ c5 ] ] and from here the black queen can defend [ [ c5 ] ] while attacking the white bishop on a3. But she won't get to stay here. I thought she would drive away the bishop before she was driven away herself but I overlooked white's simple response. I'll put a ? on 10. ... Qa5?.
 [ B c5 ]  [ R h3 + ]  [ K g2 ] , [ R e3 ]  After some irrelevant moves here comes to this board. The mate is not to complex to figure out. White declared the victory after Black hoisted their white flag. I hope that you enjoyed this annotation. Comments are very welcome and highly appreciated. :)
 [ B e1 ] , [ R f8 ]  here you are... but many people for such a small place isn't it?
 [ Q g6 ] , [ B f1 ]  Defending against mate.

 [ Q g3 ]  [ h x g4 ] , [ N f3 ]  profiting from the pinned pawn to develop my knight
 [ B d3 ] , [ N x e3 ]  I think this is a mistake - Normally I would have waited with this move black open the f-line white get an extra protection on [ d4 ] and white get an easier game.
 [ N f6 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ B g6 ]  [ B x g6 ] , [ h x g6 ]  standard: open up the h-file...
 [ Q e7 ] , [ Q x c6 ]  Ok it is cheaper this way.
 [ K d4 ] , [ B g7 + ]  black won ( white resigned
 [ B b5 ] , [ B d7 ]  This is the correct answer. If [ B b7 ] [ Q a4 ] and if [ Q d7 ] [ N e5 ] winning a piece with a much better position.
 [ Q x a4 ]  [ R x a4 ]  [ a6 ] , [ R c1 ]  And this has to be a positional blunder if you will; [ f5 ] was still a good move to this point for white. Those pawns aren't going to move and he's only blocking his own bishop. I don't know what he's thinking here but I know what I'm doing now; time to begin to fight back.
 [ B x d5 ]  [ R x d5 ] , [ Q c7 ]  The d-file is becoming a dangerous place to be. Black also has the problem of dealing with the threats to his [ N e5 ] and pawn at c5. This answers both for the moment.
 [ N h6 + ]  [ K h8 ]  [ N f7 + ]  [ K g8 ] , [ N x e5 ]  Alternative variation: 40. [ R x e5 ] [ N f5 ] 41. R[ e x f5 ] [ g x f5 ] $16
 [ B x e3 ] , [ R x b7 ]  A glimpse of hope. The rook controls the b line and make way to [ B b7 + ] putting the bishop in [ c4 ] unprotected and allowing black to castle.
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ] , [ c4 ]  I begin with my favourite opening the queen's gambit.
 [ R c1 ]  [ R h d8 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ B x c3 + ] , [ b x c3 ]  In return for the minor exchange I cripple kid bro's Pawn position. With the endgame stage on us I feel it's worth it.
 [ Q x c4 ]  [ d6 ]  [ Q e4 + ]  [ K f7 ]  [ Q c2 ]  [ N x c3 ]  [ Q x c3 ]  [ B a5 ] , [ N b4 ]  What a pressure over b4! This will give to the black the option to develop the board trough [ N e7 ] [ B e6 ] and [ R c8 ]  [ B x b4 ]  [ Q x b4 ]  [ a5 ]  [ Q b3 + ]  [ K g7 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ a4 ]  [ Q a3 ]  [ Q a5 + ]  [ B d2 ]  [ Q c5 ] , [ Q x c5 ]  Let me understand why you take the queen when the final is almost lost? I think you have to get a chance with 28.[ Q g3 ]  [ d x c5 ]  [ N c2 ]  [ a3 ]  [ B c3 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ N e3 ]  [ N e7 ]  [ g4 ]  [ B e4 ]  [ f3 ]  [ B g6 ]  [ B g2 ]  [ b5 ]  [ f4 ]  [ R a7 ]  [ f5 ]  [ B f7 ]  [ g5 ]  [ K f8 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ R g8 ]  [ K d2 ]  [ a2 ]  [ h4 ]  [ b4 ]  [ h5 ]  [ R d7 + ]  [ K c2 ]  [ b3 + ]  [ K b2 ]  [ R d2 + ]  [ K c3 ]  [ R x e2 ]  [ B x e7 + ]  [ K x e7 ]  [ N d5 + ]  [ B x d5 ]  [ B x d5 ] , [ R c2 + ]  The black could continue with 48...[ R g5 ] to give great freedom to this rook
 [ B x f8 ] , [ K x f8 ]  So he cant castle anymore. If he took with the rook then I would play [ Q c6 + ] followed by Nc5.
 [ R a d1 ]  [ Q x f3 ] , [ g x f3 ]  Yeah here's the other reason why I should have done the exchange first. Now the king is mightily exposed.
 [ Q c7 ] , [ e5 ]  White opts for the central attack.
 [ N e8 ] , [ O-O ]  ! I take the time to allow my pieces to quickly come into the attack later.
 [ e4 ]  [ Q d1 ]  [ e3 ] , [ f3 ]  somehow black managed to pass a pawn to e3. it not convenient to white.
 [ Q x f3 ]  [ g x f3 ]  [ R a b8 ] , [ R a1 ]  not sure of what the point of this move is
 [ Q c6 ] , [ d5 ]  ! Deflection
 [ c3 ] , [ a6 ]  Not the best.
 [ d3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ h3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ B g7 ] , [ d4 ]  White should have continued with the plan to play e4. Now he has wasted a tempo and weakened [ e4 ] in one move.
 [ N e4 ]  [ B a1 ]  [ b6 ]  [ f3 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ B x f6 + ]  Looked like a good trade to me. Finally got those stacked pawns. Hoping for 21. ... [ g x f6 ] 22. [ b4 ] cx[ b4 ] 23. [ Q c7 + ]  [ g x f6 ]  [ b4 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ N x b6 ]  [ a x b6 ]  [ b5 ]  [ c4 ]  [ R d1 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ Q a4 ]  [ B x e3 + ]  [ K f1 ]  [ d4 ]  [ Q x c4 ]  [ B d5 ]  [ Q a4 ]  [ K e7 ]  [ Q a7 + ]  [ K d6 ]  [ Q x b6 + ]  [ K e5 ] , [ Q c7 + ]  Just going to try to keep picking off pawns and hopefully capitalize on an errant move. Not really trying to force anything just yet.
 [ h3 ]  [ c6 ]  [ B f2 ]  [ R b8 ]  [ Q d3 ]  [ Q b4 ]  [ Q x a6 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ Q f1 ]  [ R a8 ]  [ Q e1 ]  [ Q c2 ]  [ Q d1 ] , [ Q x d1 + ]  Got most of the positions I wanted. I should be a able to use the pawn promotion to come out ahead in forthcoming exchanges. Queen for a queen rook for a bishop pawn(promoted) for a rook.
 [ K f7 ]  [ R h7 + ] , [ K e8 ]  Forced.
 [ B g7 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ c6 ]  Interesting. Prepares [ d5 ] but at the cost of being unable to immediately deploy the knight to c6.
 [ R e4 ]  [ R e7 x e4 ]  [ f x e4 ]  [ Q x e4 + ]  [ K h2 ]  [ Q f3 ] , [ B x b6 ]  I really hoped he would capture [ b6 ] without looking properly. Than I could go r[ x e8 ]  [ B x c6 + ]  [ b x c6 ] , [ d3 ]  Defending [ e4 ] and letting the bishop free
 [ R d6 ]  [ R h7 ]  [ K e7 ]  [ Q x g7 ]  [ K d8 ]  [ B x e6 ] , [ f x e6 ]  Look at the 7th rank domination by White's Queen and Rook. Black can resign now. We can see the logical flow in this game. In the opening aim is to control the center. In the middle game aim is to dominate the center and open lines to attack the opponent's King. In the end dominate the 7th rank. Looks like a text book game. My guess is many Chess principles of today were authored after studying Steinitz Lasker and Capablanca's games.
 [ f x g4 ] , [ c4 ]  I don't want to give him tempo but I finally will have to.
 [ Q f5 ]  [ B x d3 ] , [ Q h5 ]  
 [ e7 + ]  [ K c8 ]  [ e8 = Q + ]  [ K b7 ]  [ Q x b5 + ]  [ K a7 ]  [ B c7 ]  [ R c2 ]  [ Q b6 + ]  [ K a8 ] , [ Q b8 # ]  
 [ N c b5 ] , [ Q c1 + ]  White's fate is sealed. The back door is wide open and too late to prevent mate.
 [ B e3 ]  [ Q c7 ] , [ B a4 ]  Loses the piece but was [ N b5 ] viable?
 [ N g4 ] , [ Q c6 ]  Attacking a weak point.
 [ B x e5 ] , [ Q f3 ]  Now White can be mated--do you see it?
 [ N h4 ] , [ Q e6 ]  So far so good...temporary.
 [ f6 ]  [ B d4 ]  [ b6 ]  [ K f1 ]  [ e5 ]  [ B e3 ] , [ N x e3 + ]  damaging White's pawn structure
 [ R b1 ]  [ R h h1 ]  [ R d2 ]  [ Q h6 ] , [ R b2 ]  blunder. lead to loss of the knight after a forced sequence. but the position is lost for white.
 [ N a3 ] , [ Q c7 ]  Development and attack of the [ c3 ] pawn. Black is now ready to begin the attack on the center that I have been preparing for.
 [ Q f1 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ g4 ]  now the object of [ R g1 ] becomes somewhat clear...
 [ e5 ] , [ N h4 ]  White repositions the knight (while protecting the [ g2 ] mating threat from Queen and Bishop that he just opened - eg. 20.[ N x d4 ] Qxg2#) but I'm not certain what he was planning here.
 [ b5 ] , [ e x f6 ]  There is no time now for moving the bisshop. After [ B b3 ] [ B a6 ] black get another piece into play. Now white as the immeadiate threat Re8#;
 [ B x c5 ]  [ R b7 x b2 ]  [ R x b2 ]  [ R x b2 ]  [ c3 ]  [ R d2 ]  [ R x e5 ]  [ R d3 + ] , [ R e3 ]  Another key move is Re3!
 [ f x e5 ]  [ f x e5 ] , [ Q h5 + ]  The King-hunt begins now.
 [ N e4 ]  [ R d8 ]  [ R a d1 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ N x d6 + ]  [ R x d6 ] , [ h3 ]  16. [ h3 ] - one more pair of minor pieces swapped without compromising my pawn structure - good.
 [ g5 ] , [ c6 ]  37. [ [ c6 ] ] - If fxg5?? then I will instantly cop Old Matey - do you the Inquest Jury see how? In the meanwhile I take advantage of the pin on the [ b7 ] pawn to trade off one of my isolanis in this case the [ [ c6 ] ] pawn. This will leave Bob with just one pawn on the queenside though this pawn could prove decisive to me further on in the endgame.
 [ N f6 ] , [ B c4 ]  This must be still theory but I can't study any chess nor I have access to the database anymore so I can't see what was played before. A pity. Now the normal [ e6 ] (the Icelandic gambit itself) doesn't work since after the exchange my e pawn will stand pitifully isolated in the center against a well developed white open e column... of course not!
 [ K e7 ]  [ R x f2 ]  [ B x f2 ] , [ K x f2 ]  As white opted to play for a draw?
 [ Q x e3 + ] , [ K h1 ]  Capturing any piece would leave my king open to check and even draw
 [ N f4 + ]  [ K h6 ]  [ R e3 ] , [ a5 ]  Black needs to exchange as many pawns as possible.
 [ K c6 ]  [ R c8 + ]  [ K b7 ] , [ R b8 + ]  And it continues by exchanging Rooks.
 [ R e7 ] , [ d5 ]  This is the right moment to push forward.
 [ N c6 ] , [ B b5 ]  I could tell [ N c6 ] was a reflex move. My opponent only now began to think of the consequences. His position is not bad but the time spent here thinking of the next move suggested he had now only begun to play.
 [ h3 ]  [ h4 ]  [ B h2 ]  [ g4 ]  [ K b2 ]  [ g x h3 ]  [ g x h3 ]  [ R e7 ] , [ K x a1 ]  A number of horrible forced king moves comes to an end for the time being
 [ N d2 ]  [ Q e4 + ] , [ K b3 ]  he thinks his king will be safe with his queen... but....
 [ d3 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ B d5 ]  [ e4 ]  [ B x e4 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ f4 ] , [ g5 ]  19.[ R g1 ] (development) [ g x f4 ] 20.[ N c4 ] [ N x c4 ] 21.[ R x g4 ] [ N e3 ] 22.[ B x e3 ] [ f x e3 + ] 23.[ K x e3 ] [ Q h6 + ]  [ K g3 ]  [ g x f4 + ]  [ B x f4 ]  [ Q g8 ] , [ B x e5 ]  21. better was [ K f2 ] getting out of the way of the discovered attack
 [ Q e3 ] , [ h6 ]  Guarding the [ g5 ] pawn while keeping the rook on f8.
 [ Q d6 ]  [ Q x b4 ] , [ Q x g6 ]  regaining the pawn
 [ Q g2 + ]  [ K f4 ] , [ Q x h3 ]  Another free pawn. The count is five though there is no way to save both of the pawns. My opponent resigned here. If count the last one he gave away more than half of his pawn for free and it really cost him the game. Thanks for the game.
 [ Q c5 ] , [ Q e4 ]  White is not ready to exchange its Queen nicely in the center and not so easily scared away.
 [ h3 ]  [ B x f3 ] , [ Q x f3 ]  10. [ Q x f3 ] - white's position looks perfectly OK at this point but appearances can be very deceptive.
 [ B g2 ] , [ N c6 ]  This is basically forced though 2...[ d5 ] is also possible if fairly awkward.
 [ d5 ] , [ B d2 ]  7. [ B d2 ] - I break one of the pins by developing a piece. My e pawn needs some serious back up.
 [ d5 ]  [ e3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N d2 ]  [ c5 ]  [ c3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ f4 ]  Here is the end of the line of this thematic game.
 [ B x f6 ] , [ g x f6 ]  After a long think he opts to trade. Apparently he has confidence in his ability to force something here. A lot of trading ensues. We both have about 10-15ish minutes left on the clock.
 [ R x b8 ]  [ R a b1 ]  [ d4 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ Q d5 ] , [ N x f6 + ]  Discovered check with fork
 [ N f3 ] , [ N b d7 ]  This was made to leave the "c" pawn free to advance.
 [ N b4 ] , [ N a3 ]  So far black is responding as expected so as before I cover [ c2 ] not concerned about ...Nd3+; as 15. [ K e2 ] Nxc1; 16. [ R x c1 + ] with tempo and a rook on a nice file.
 [ N c3 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ Q d4 ] , [ Q d7 ]  19. ....... [ Q d7 ] - In retrospect [ R d8 ] should have been played here. Guess I was in a state of shock over what happened a few moves back. It is so easy to be in this state after something so awful. When this happens it is quite possible that more mistakes can be made. So is the case here.
 [ R e8 + ]  [ K f7 ]  [ R a8 ]  [ N b6 ]  [ R a6 ]  [ N c4 + ]  [ B x c4 ]  [ b x c4 ]  [ K c2 ]  [ K e6 ]  [ K b2 ]  [ K d7 ]  [ R a5 ]  [ R b7 ]  [ K a3 ]  [ K c7 ]  [ K a4 ]  [ R b6 ]  [ b5 ]  [ c x b5 + ]  [ R x b5 ]  [ R a6 + ]  [ K b4 ]  [ K d6 ]  [ R a5 ]  [ R b6 + ]  [ R b5 ]  [ R a6 ]  [ R a5 ]  [ R x a5 ] , [ K x a5 ]  So white is still up only one pawn. Not sure why black accepted that trade--he would have been better off drawing.
 [ K h8 ]  [ Q h6 ] , [ R g8 ]  The correct moves for black here.
 [ Q x g3 ]  [ B x g5 ]  [ R h1 + ]  [ K e2 ]  [ Q x g2 + ]  [ K e3 ] , [ R h3 + ]  now it's just a matter of time...
 [ f4 ]  [ N g6 ] , [ N x e7 + ]  White can play through the [ f5 ] square if desired with tempo. The [ e4 ] pawn is not well guarded however. Also all the pieces for White are not developed.
 [ d5 ] , [ N c3 ]  Main Line. Apparently this is played in over 40% of all games involving the French Defense.
 [ e x d6 ]  [ e ]  [ p ]  [ Q x d6 ] , [ O-O ]  putting the K on the weak diagonal
 [ K f8 ]  [ Q c5 + ]  [ K g8 ] , [ Q c8 + ]  Nicely done.
 [ B x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N x e7 + ]  [ K b8 ]  [ B x d4 ]  [ B x h1 ]  [ R x h1 ]  [ N c5 ]  [ N f5 ]  [ N e6 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ Q c6 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ g6 ]  [ N d6 ] , [ R x d6 ]  I didn't think there was any choice. Leaving the knight on [ d6 ] is extremely dangerous.
 [ R e8 ] , [ a3 ]  A small but very important move. White's bishop on [ [ e5 ] ] is on the verge of being forced off [ [ e5 ] ] and when that happens Black would like nothing better than to post his bishop on d6. With his dsb on [ [ d6 ] ] Black will be in position to exert potentially fatal levels of pressure against White's underdeveloped kingside. But by forcing the bishop to move now White prevents this. Black will either have to move his bishop off-line to [ a5 ] or waste a tempo in tucking it away on f8; if it moves to [ [ d6 ] ] immediately White will simply exchange it.
 [ B d3 ]  [ N g7 ] , [ N c2 ]  17. [ N c2 ] - I spend the next two moves improving my development and the placement of my knight - this I feel is the quickest way to recover my composure after such a blunder.
 [ N f6 ] , [ a3 ]  12. [ a3 ] prevents Nc6-[ b4 ] ....[ g5 ] supports [ f4 ] prepares for g4. 13. Nx[ g5 ] removes [ g4 ] threat positions for [ N [ f7 ] ] [see move 16.] if 0-0-0 [ f7 ] (forks both Rooks) ....[ h5 ] positions for advance to [ h4 ] [see move 22.].
 [ Q f6 ]  [ Q e1 ]  [ B f5 ] , [ N h5 ]  
 [ N f3 ] , [ d4 ]  an attack on the knight pinned because if it moves [ Q x g2 ] mate
 [ b3 ] , [ Q f6 ]  First move that I did not even consider in my calculations. First sign of sloppy play - seeing unexpected moves.
 [ R x b8 ]  [ R x b8 ] , [ R x a7 ]  Snatching another pawn and placing a Rook on the always dangerous 7th Rank
 [ Q d2 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O-O ] , [ b5 ]  ..both sides are aiming for maximum activity....
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ] , [ d4 ]  This a game from my own tournament and the highest rated player I've beaten. I offered up the Danish Gambit
 [ K e6 ] , [ b5 ]  And the race is on. Black is forced on the defensive.
 [ R x a7 ]  [ N c5 ]  [ K c3 ]  [ N e6 ]  [ R a6 ]  [ N x f4 ] , [ R x b6 + ]  The way is clear for a run by my a or c Pawn. I decided on sending the a-Pawn because the Rook protects his advance.
 [ c7 ]  [ K g8 ]  [ c8 = Q + ] , [ K h7 ]  White misses a mate in two. 55.[ Q f8 ] [ f4 ] 56[ Q g7 ]  [ Q x f5 + ] , [ K x h6 ]  Black said afterwards he was hoping for a stale mate position. He has every right to look for one against any opponent.
 [ N e2 + ]  [ K h1 ] , [ B x h3 ]  The final shot. I can easily sac this bishop since [ g x h3 ] Qc6+. If [ f3 ] (forced to defend the king) [ N g3 + ] forking the rook. White sensibly resigned.
 [ N h5 ] , [ N e2 ]  With 18. ... [ N [ [ h5 ] ] ] the black knight returns to [ [ h5 ] ] blocking white's mating threat but it is now pinned there with no safe moves to escape. White plays 19. [ N e2 ] intending 20. [ N g3 ] to win the black knight on [ [ h5 ] ] (not 20. ... Nxg3??? 21. [ Q x h7 # ] and after 21. Nx[ [ h5 ] ] gx[ [ h5 ] ] 22. Qx[ [ h5 ] ] black cannot stop 23. Qxh7#). But this was not white's best move here as black's reply proves.
 [ Q b6 ] , [ b3 ]  Sad necessity....
 [ K f7 ]  [ Q d7 + ]  [ K g8 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ h5 ]  [ Q e6 + ]  [ K h7 ]  [ N x f6 + ]  [ K h6 ]  [ N g8 + ]  [ K h7 ]  [ Q f7 ]  [ g5 ]  [ N f6 + ]  [ K h6 ]  [ N x h5 ]  [ B x d4 ]  [ R d1 ]  [ B x b2 ]  [ R d6 + ]  [ B f6 ] , [ R x f6 # ]  a good game but it was just me assuming what they would do. I probably made some mistakes along the way for this person's moves after 26 but it was obvious I was going to win this game
 [ e4 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ B e2 ] , [ N b d7 ]  black plays the hedgehog for a while. Don't be mistaken: he will attack soon.
 [ N c5 ]  [ b3 ] , [ f6 ]  Computer now puts black 0.15 ahead
 [ K g3 ]  [ R e f8 ] , [ R x e5 ]  Why did I move here? should have moved to [ e7 ] not [ e5 ] ?
 [ Q x d7 ] , [ R a d1 ]  Sound development by white.
 [ R d1 ] , [ K e6 ]  OK now I got nervous. Black dares not allow white to get his rook on the 7th rank forking the king (who was on f7) and the pawn on a7. But white will either get there or get a three-move repetition draw (the white rook can keep threatening to move to [ d7 ] or [ e7 ] and any moves by the black king to prevent it would be met with checks until eventually black repeats the position three times or abandons the 7th rank). Now that black is ahead in material and faced with a certain win I am of no mind to allow the repetition draw so I may have to let that rook rampage on the 7th.
 [ K f7 ]  [ N d6 + ]  [ K g7 ]  [ f6 + ]  [ K g6 ] , [ Q e7 ]  ?? This however is the losing blunder. Up until now white had the intitative. But by playing this and with his [ R g4 ] g and h pawns Steve's attacks against Sue is overwhelming. Best was 42.[ f7 ] as Sue would promote due to her [ N d6 ] and then if 42...[ h2 ] (which is happening) white would win after 43.[ f8 = Q ] because if 43...[ h1 = Q ] white answers with 44.[ Q f7 # ] which is mate. Even if he did stop mate for the time being white still forces a win. but by playing this he is going to promote one way or another with what I noted earlier. After that it's mate soon after.
 [ d4 ] , [ Q x e7 ]  Finally. Ok now I am winning isn't it?
 [ N x e5 ]  [ N x b3 ]  [ a x b3 ] , [ f6 ]  ?! Of course he could've won this back with 7...[ Q e7 ] as Jack Stockel has showed me. But with very little time I anticipated this being played.
 [ c4 ]  [ Q c5 ]  [ g x h6 ]  [ g x h6 ] , [ B x h6 ]  Yes! Next NxB!
 [ f4 ] , [ N e4 ]  I am taking the space left behind by the white and also [ f6 ] can come to push back the knight at [ e5 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ d x e4 ] , [ B e2 ]  White is trying to secure his king by castling.
 [ b3 ] , [ N d7 ]  I think White's best move is [ B x g7 ] [ K x g7 ] [ Q d4 ] which goes into the line played in the actual game except that I would be down a tempo.
 [ N d2 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ N d2 b3 ] , [ R c8 ]  Selman challenges Steinitz's control of the QB file.
 [ R f8 ] , [ Q d5 ]  Both Kings are unsafe.
 [ R x c4 ]  [ B x c4 ] , [ B c6 ]  Allowing Black to pick up the d-pawn with the Queen and preparing to blast open White's kingside.
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ N c3 ]  Common book moves the opening. White could have considered 5.[ f3 ] but it send the message of s castling queenside to Black.
 [ R f3 x f5 ]  [ R x c3 + ] , [ K d6 ]  Now its time to get in front of the pawn
 [ R x c2 ] , [ R a e1 ]  White continues his overprotection without much ado.
 [ B e2 ] , [ Q a5 ]  i did this mainly for the pin
 [ e6 ]  [ B b2 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ c5 ]  [ e3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ d x c4 ] , [ B x c4 ]  The first skirmish and now I'm ready to castle.
 [ R e1 ]  [ b5 ]  [ B b3 ]  [ d6 ] , [ c3 ]  8. [ c3 ] - creating an escape hatch for his bishop thus avoiding the famous Noah's Ark Trap.
 [ R c4 ] , [ e5 + ]  25. ... Rc4?? was a bold move that seals black's fate. Now white's bishop and queen have free access to the black king and white will add a rook on the open a-file momentarily. Black is already doomed but just how doomed is yet to be seen.
 [ K x b8 ]  [ h8 = Q + ]  [ K c7 ]  [ Q x f6 ] , [ R d2 d6 ]  49....[ a5 ] gives better chances.
 [ e5 ] , [ N c4 ]  ? Ok the idea here why I played this was to protect my N on d4. I figured that now I'm in trouble after the use of Analyze the Board. But I thought this move would bail me out. Terrible miscalculation on my part. And I saw ahead and anticipated what happened but there was another defender that I overlooked this time his R. With that this backfired what I had analyzed. No matter he's going to be 2 points ahead but this move loses another pawn. Having said all of that best was 25.[ Q e1 ] 25...[ N h5 ] 26.[ N c4 ] [ Q f6 ] 27.[ N x e5 ] [ Q x e5 ] 28.[ B x a6 ] [ Q x e4 ] 29.[ B x b7 ] [ Q x b7 ] 30.[ Q e5 + ] [ N f6 ] 31.[ Q g3 ] [ N e d5 ] 32.[ N f5 + ] [ K h7 ] 33.[ N d6 ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ N x d6 ]  [ d x e3 ]  [ e5 ] , [ e x f2 + ]  ?! Mistake according to the computer but I give it however as an inaccuracy. The idea is to promote the pawn of course. And usually that's how it happens with no way to stop it. But that's not so here because he doesn't have anything right in front. Generally speaking it's the R which is where putting the behind a promote that is to promote will often guarantee the win. However with nothing behind I am going to take it and get a little compensation for lost material. At least for now. Having said that best was 27...[ N e8 ] 28.[ N x b7 ] [ R x d3 ] 29.[ f x e3 ] [ R d7 ] 30.[ N d6 ] [ N x d6 ] 31.[ e x d6 ] [ R x d6 ] 32.[ e4 ] [ b5 ] 33.[ K f2 ] [ R d2 + ] 34.[ K f3 ] [ R d3 + ] 35.[ K f4 ] [ g5 + ] 36.[ K g4 ] [ N c6 ] 37.[ R x a6 ] [ R x c3 ]  [ K x f2 ]  [ N e8 ]  [ N x e8 + ]  [ R x e8 ] , [ g4 ]  ?? Ok I did consider 30.[ B x a6 ] but I thought he'd take back and now would win a piece for a pawn in addition to what I lost. So instead I moved the g pawn to strengthen those pawn structures because as I learned in the Deeper Chess Theory Club you want to try an connect those pawns. However given that I'm lost I think creatively in order to avoid getting overwhelmed and stressed as that makes the situation and where I make more mistakes. In fact this is something to that hindered my progress back in the day. However what I overlooked was my R on [ a1 ] so the best move then was to just take winning something back. But this move however prevents the compensation and in fact loses yet another pawn after what black plays next.
 [ B h6 ]  [ K f6 ]  [ R f1 + ]  [ B f2 ]  [ R x f2 + ]  [ B f3 ] , [ R x f3 # ]  The final blow
 [ Q c4 ]  [ O-O ] , [ B d3 ]  Allows White to castle.
 [ K h6 ]  [ N f7 + ]  [ K g7 ]  [ N g5 + ] , [ K h6 ]  This kind of repetition is common in GM play it tests the waters to see if somone'll screw up (29... Kh5? 30.Qg5#) and gains a little time. Now white plays the right move.
 [ N x f5 ]  [ e x f5 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ g4 ]  [ b5 ]  [ b3 ] , [ b x c4 ]  
 [ N f6 ]  [ e3 ]  [ e6 ] , [ N f3 ]  both sides are getting developed
 [ f5 ]  [ Q g5 ]  [ e5 ] , [ c4 ]  A mistake. White has lost a pawn here.
 [ Q d4 + ] , [ K h1 ]  I like the king in the corner..I see a mate developing with my bishops help
 [ Q c1 ]  [ e6 ] , [ a3 ]  Maybe another mistake but i dont want [ B b4 ] because my K is in the middle and my other N cannot be easily on [ e2 ] to defend.
 [ f3 ]  [ R b6 ]  [ f4 ]  [ f5 ] , [ B f2 ]  Attack's Black's rook but hangs the pawn at f4.
 [ N g4 ]  [ R e d8 ]  [ R f d1 ]  [ g5 ]  [ N e3 ]  [ Q c6 ] , [ h4 ]  Black's faulty play on the 21st move already makes itself felt although he still has the better position.
 [ R x c7 ]  [ Q x c7 ] , [ Q e3 ]  White centralises his Q defending the pawn.
 [ c x d4 ] , [ f5 ]  White takes black pawn at [ d4 ] and black moves [ f7 ] pawn to [ f5 ] to protect pawn at e4. F5 pawn is also protecting bishop at [ g5 ] and queen is in a hole.
 [ O-O ]  [ b x c4 ]  [ B x c4 ] , [ N b d7 ]  Strengthening [ e5 ] and preparing [ N b6 ] or if white pushes [ d5 ] which he often does in the KID [ N c5 ] which can be supported by an ...[ a5 ] push (hindering [ b4 ] by white dislodging the knight).
 [ Q c8 + ]  [ K f7 ] , [ Q x h8 ]  White pounces winning the Rook. In turn he has to be careful not to get his Q trapped on the 8th rank.
 [ B d3 ] , [ B g7 ]  White hopes to gain a strong attack Black chooses a Kings Indian type formation.
 [ B a4 ] , [ b5 ]  6.......[ b5 ] chase the B away
 [ R a7 ]  [ N x c5 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ R e6 + ]  Just a nudge before taking the a-pawn.
 [ N x e4 ] , [ d4 ]  Better than the immediate [ R e1 ] [ d4 ] tries to open the e-file and develops the Bc1.
 [ K c7 ]  [ R a b1 ] , [ R b8 ]  29.[ a4 ] is better
 [ N e6 + ]  [ K e7 ]  [ N x c7 ]  [ d8 = Q ]  [ N b5 ] , [ Q b6 ]  Black's LSB is trapped. He's gonna lose SOMETHING.
 [ Q x g4 ]  [ Q x g4 ] , [ B x e5 ]  Black is ahead in material and his king is in safer but with the many lower pièces white can afford trading so that black has to be very carefull expecially because with his passed pawn black could force an exchange. Here white is fairly cramped : can Harly move the knight LSB is pinned rook protects the DSB. The only piece white can move safely is the DSB. Anyway the situation is pretty complicated and the first who does the mistake loses.
 [ R f3 ] , [ h5 ]  This move seems to indicate that White is out of options and is waiting for the end to arrive.
 [ d5 ] , [ d3 ]  Better was probably [ N c3 ] to defend the pawn this loses the pawn or trade queens and white can't castle.
 [ B h3 ]  [ N x c6 ]  [ b x c6 ]  [ Q d3 ]  [ B x g2 ]  [ K x g2 ]  [ a5 ]  [ R c2 ]  [ a4 ] , [ N d2 ]  This knight's job is to neutralize its opposite number.
 [ Q e2 ] , [ N e3 ]  and now the N has a lovely outpost close to White's K tying White to the defence of g2.
 [ Q c4 ]  [ R e3 e1 ]  [ R x e1 ]  [ R x e1 ] , [ Q x b4 ]  the game is totaly lost for white dangerous fork on the whites DSB and a rook and even after white trys to defend them both by 35.[ R b1 ] wont help at all after 35...[ B g7 ] and white will lose a piece and the game .
 [ c x d4 ] , [ c x d4 ]  Creating the isolated pawn on [ d4 ] and a free pawn on b4.
 [ N c6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ d3 ]  [ a6 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ b6 ] , [ g3 ]  Wasn´t sure to open a fianchetto here to counteract black bishop´s position. I think it helps holding the position although it requires one extra movement. But since black has already spent two pawn moves before it seems right.
 [ N e4 ]  [ Q x a1 ] , [ B x a1 ]  Could have taken with bishop or queen but saw that by taking with bishop I would have the threat of knight check winning his bishop through a discovered check and then trading his rook for my knight. Also currently threatening to take his rook still so I still have two threats.
 [ O-O ] , [ B c5 + ]  Getting the bishop out with tempo surely can't be bad? He can't effectively block the check so must waste a move with the king.
 [ B f1 ]  [ K f6 ]  [ K e3 ]  [ K g5 ]  [ b4 ]  [ K h4 ]  [ K f4 ] , [ B h3 ]  I decide to attack the bishop...
 [ K g5 ]  [ K d3 ]  [ N a6 ]  [ K e3 ]  [ N c7 ] , [ K d3 ]  I tried for a while to see Black would make an inaccuracy but he did not. I offered a draw at this point as I saw through analysis that we would be shuffling pieces for another 20 moves completing nothing. A strange draw for sure - blunders inaccuracies and theoretically unsound ideas made for an odd game that somehow ended in a friendly way.
 [ Q x e6 ] , [ Q x e6 + ]  and the knight falls next
 [ K f7 ] , [ N f5 ]  32. Nf5! - this is another forced trade of pieces one pair of knights is going to come off. It looks as though I am giving away a free knight but if black takes on [ f5 ] then I take on c6.
 [ N x e5 ]  [ R e1 ] , [ B g4 ]  Again GK calls this a mistake because eventually with the optimum series of moves for each player W ends up with an advantage pressuring the pawn at [ e7 ] which if B wants to defend then leaves the pawn at [ b7 ] vulnerable.
 [ B e2 ] , [ R f7 ]  protects [ b7 ] and prepares rooks for doubling later
 [ B e3 ]  [ Q f6 ] , [ N d2 ]  I have a preacution
 [ Q x b6 ]  [ Q c3 ] , [ R d8 + ]  Now mate is forced
 [ g x h5 ] , [ R x h5 ]  This subsequent recapture illustrates the mistake of advancing the h pawn. It allows capture of the defenseless f pawn.
 [ c3 ]  [ g3 ]  [ R d2 ] , [ R b1 + ]  to prepare [ R h1 ] which prevents [ B h3 ] now if [ K c2 ] I have [ R h2 ] with a skewer that forces white either to capture my rook and allow promotion or to allow me to capture his rook also allowing promotion
 [ Q b3 ] , [ b6 ]  The final blunder probably he hasn't seen the checkmate coming.
 [ f4 ] , [ B x f4 + ]  Black can still save himself by playing [ N e5 ] and after BxQ NxB BxR NxR black will have a great edge but the game was still playable. My opponent resigned here. In case he wouldn't the game would have gone like this:
 [ R d8 + ] , [ K x c1 ]  Another way to trade--even better because it puts the rook in play.
 [ R f2 ] , [ c4 ]  I'll now try to create a passed c pawn
 [ R e8 ] , [ Q g4 ]  I could at the time see 2 options. One was to blunt the queen's attack line with 12...[ g6 ] and after 13.[ N x f6 ] [ Q x f6 ] White has no attack left. Or I could have played a "waiting move" - I had 12...[ B d7 ] in mind - and Black's position is sound.
 [ K x g3 ]  [ N g4 ] , [ K x f3 ]  Capturing the knight allows the pawn to queen
 [ K f8 ] , [ B a5 ]  a little plan to distroy black's both king and queen sides
 [ N c3 ]  [ Q e7 ]  [ Q d5 ] , [ B x c3 + ]  Forcing an ugly weakness in Rubinstein's Pawn structure.
 [ K x e5 ]  [ K h7 ]  [ g8 = Q + ] , [ K x g8 ]  Simplifying the board. It's easy to checkmate with rook and king and a crucial skill to learn.
 [ N x e4 ]  [ N b d7 ]  [ N x f6 + ]  [ N x f6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ B e7 ] , [ Q e2 ]  This is played to prevent ... P-[ Q N3 ] followed by ... B-[ N2 ] which is Black's usual development in this variation.
 [ N d4 ]  [ B d2 ] , [ c6 ]  Like before he is going after my pawn. But this time I allow it since I don't lose anything. In fact I'll take because I anticipate that he'll take back. And if Mike does that's I'll respond with 9.[ N f3 ] or 9.[ N g e2 ] so that I can castle on the next move.
 [ Q e2 + ]  [ K b3 ]  [ Q b5 + ]  [ K c2 ]  [ Q e2 + ]  [ K b3 ]  [ K b8 ]  [ Q b4 ]  [ N d1 ] , [ R x c6 ]  Half way clever except QxP[ b2 + ] is going to hurt--black WANTS to trade down enjoying a seven point advantage. White may just lack decent options.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ Q f6 ]  From my limited experience i know that taking out your queen at the beginning of the game is not something you want to do. now the queen is open for attacks and during the time you protect your queen the opponent develops his/her game - taking out more pieces and making a good strategic stand. I have a phrase: " Respect your queen and leave her alone until such time she is needed in the game"
 [ N h3 ] , [ R x e4 + ]  ! Crashing through taking advantage of the knight pin against the [ c1 ] rook. White must play 24. [ K d1 ] (24. [ N x e4 ] Qxc1ch 25. [ K f2 ] (25. [ Q d1 ] Qe3ch and mates next move) [ Q x h1 ] picking up the other rook) when 24. ...Qg4ch 25. [ K c2 ] (25. [ Q f3 ] Be2ch!; 25. [ N f3 ] [ R e3 ] with ...[ R x f3 ] to follow) [ R e2 ] white is placed in a tortuous bind and her position will eventually collapse. An instructure miniature about the dangers of giving your opponent too many tactical possibilities in exchange for static positional advantages especially if the position is anything but static! Thanks to Joanne for the game and annotation privileges.
 [ e x d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ B b4 + ] , [ N c3 ]  Developing and blocking the check. Two birds one stone. Now I'm up in development by a knight and a pawn.
 [ g4 ] , [ N c x d4 ]  I attack his knight with my pawn and he takes my pawn at d4. I felt like he was trying to go 13...N[ c x [ d4 ] ] 14. N[ f x [ d4 ] ] [ Q x [ d4 ] ] 15. [ Q x [ d4 ] ] N[ f x [ d4 ] ] but now that I look back at this position it might have been okay to take his night on [ d4 ] because my bishop is guarding my queen so it could have been. 13... N[ c x [ d4 ] ] 14. N[ f x [ d4 ] ] [ Q x [ d4 ] ] 15. [ g x [ f5 ] ] [ Q x d3 ] 16. [ B x d3 ] this would have been fine but i did not see this at the time so I took his night on [ f5 ] with my pawn.
 [ a4 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ B f5 ]  [ R e1 ] , [ N e4 ]  I would've liked to move [ N b d7 ] but I don't have a good reply if he plays Nh4. The move I was originally worried about here was [ Q d3 ] because if I trade knights and bishops then I'm looking at [ B f4 ] at some point and it'll be even harder to get the knight out and keep protecting my pawn on d6. But I decided if he plays [ Q d3 ] here I can try Ng3.
 [ N f3 ] , [ g5 ]  Winning another tempo as white must move the bishop.
 [ N e6 + ]  [ K e7 ]  [ N x d8 ]  [ R h x d8 ] , [ Q a6 ]  And Black resigned.
 [ O-O ] , [ R h6 ]  as expected
 [ K f7 ] , [ Q h1 ]  41. [ Q [ h1 ] ] - Glenda goes to [ h1 ] and I now threaten [ R h7 ] pinning the Wicked Witch of the West to her other half. She moves her king to f6.
 [ Q b6 + ]  [ K x d7 ]  [ R a7 + ]  [ K c8 ] , [ Q b7 # ]  This was the single greatest game of my life. But I didn't win because I'm better than my coach (which I'm not!) I just caught him at an off-moment since he was playing a lot of simultaneous games in an opening he wasn't familiar with. But still I BEAT A 2500!!!!!!!
 [ Q x f6 ] , [ R c1 ]  This is also a bit odd as [ e3 ] is the theoretical recommendation bringing the other bishop into play and preparing to castle.
 [ b5 ]  [ c x b5 ]  [ B x b5 ] , [ g4 ]  Now [ g4 ] is played. Have to move the rook
 [ Q x d4 + ]  [ c x d4 ] , [ R a b8 ]  grabbing the open file by my isolated and very sorry looking pawns would [ R a d8 ] be a better move?
 [ e4 ]  [ K e7 ] , [ K f2 ]  I march my king towards the centre looking to protect my pawn on [ e4 ] and look for weakness to exploit in the black pawn line
 [ R c2 ]  [ R h4 ] , [ Q g2 ]  Alternative variation: 30. [ B d4 ] [keeps an even firmer grip] [ N d5 ] 31. [ Q x f7 ] [ K c6 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ B g5 ] , [ R h c4 ]  Alternative variation: 31...

[ Q d7 + ] [ K a6 ] 49. [ Q c6 + ] [ K a5 ] 50. [ Q b6 # ]  [ K c7 ] , [ Q x d4 ]  Alternative variation: 39. [ Q x d4 ] [ Q d5 ] 40. [ Q f4 + ] [ Q e5 ] 41. [ Q x a4 ]  [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ B f4 ] , [ N d7 ]  In my way to play this opening this self-blocking the dsb is not often played and I don't think it is the best option for black unless he plays very soon after c5.
 [ Q x f3 ] , [ e6 ]  
 [ d6 ]  [ R a f1 ] , [ b5 ]  The last two moves were unimportant just building a position on either side. I have now challenged his bishop forcing him to retreat. His only option is Bb3.
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ B b5 ]  i usually use italian opening
 [ K d7 ]  [ d x c5 ]  [ Q f3 + ]  [ K c1 ] , [ b x c5 ]  Hmm [ c3 ] looks good don't you think?
 [ N e1 ]  [ Q b1 ]  [ B d2 ]  [ Q x a2 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ Q b1 + ]  [ K f2 ] , [ a5 ]  The passed a-pawn can be stopped but it will divert white's forces to the queenside.
 [ B e8 ] , [ R d a1 ]  It looks like my bishop was after the a pawn but really I just wanted to get my queen back out.
 [ K g8 ] , [ N e7 + ]  After which they do it again.
 [ b x c4 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ e4 ]  [ N b d7 ]  [ B x c4 ] , [ g6 ]  The Benko (or Benoni) isalso set up in a King's indian position.
 [ B x c5 ] , [ R x e5 ]  Instead of [ Q g6 + ] next how about: 33. ... [ R g3 + ] 34. [ K f1 ] forced or else [ Q d1 + ] mates 34. ... [ Q x h3 + ] winning a pawn 35. [ K e2 ] [ R g2 ] this should win the N also
 [ Q b3 ] , [ Q c6 ]  Wary of all trades and with good reason. Someone has to defend the Q-flank from invasion.
 [ R d2 ]  [ R a b8 ]  [ R b1 ]  [ Q b6 ] , [ R c2 ]  31. [ R c2 ] - I plan to trade my b pawn for Simon's c pawn.
 [ N x a3 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ B x e6 ] , [ K x e6 ]  Again I think the ending favours me with wide-spread pawns and a much better placed King.
 [ e4 ]  [ R h2 ]  [ e5 ] , [ Q f2 # ]  Mission accomplished.
 [ N b6 ] , [ g3 ]  Maybe he wants to prevent my knight from coming to [ f4 ] and he's probably also planning to push his pawns forward ([ h4 ] etc.) to give his attack some new power. However this also creates some weaknesses of his own. Maybe 19.[ B c5 ] should be considered (as I expected and was also suggested by the computer).
 [ Q c2 ] , [ N d7 ]  Preparing for e5. If white had played [ e4 ] I would have countered with [ f4 ] followed by e5. Also if white tried d4-[ d5 ] it leaves the field [ c5 ] open for blacks Knight.
 [ K d3 ]  [ e2 ]  [ K x e2 ]  [ K x d4 ] , [ K d2 ]  Black will get another passed pawn--and the King is threatening all the white Kingside pawns.
 [ B e1 ]  [ B x e1 ] , [ R x e1 ]  ...and I couldn't resist trading our bishops having an extra pawn. My c7-pawn has actually lost the protection it had and we have a single rook and pawn endgame where I have a 7-6 pawn advantage but I have three which are isolated and weak and my opponent has one.
 [ B f2 ]  [ g5 ] , [ e5 ]  time to break some tensions...
 [ Q x g1 + ] , [ Q g7 ]  I want the exchange...
 [ N b3 ] , [ e6 ]  [ g5 ] to prevent white next move is better.
 [ N x d7 ] , [ B x d7 ]  another peice comes into play.
 [ Q x e7 ]  [ B x e7 ]  [ B x f8 ] , [ B x f8 ]  My gut told me this endgame was winning. I have two passes pawns on the Kingside and a potential for a passed pawn in the center. Also a rook is much stronger than two minor pieces in the endgame due to the fact that the minor pieces do not support each other well without the help of a rook. This move focuses on getting my king active
 [ K x c2 ]  [ K f4 ] , [ K d3 ]  if 46.[ K b3 ] then ...[ c5 ] 47.[ K a4 ] c4! and he is distracted again.
 [ B e2 ] , [ f4 ]  58…[ Q g4 + ] would allow white to win quite easily 59.Qxg4+! [ h x g4 + ] 60.[ B x g4 ] [ f x g4 + ] 61.[ K x g4 ] and black is stretched too thin.
 [ R b8 ] , [ h4 ]  And now we are completely out of the DB. Black places his rook to support his pawn advance. I had expected the rook to play to [ c8 ] instead seizing the half-open file but then after black's play I realized that the other rook wants that file which leaves the queen's rook to remain on the a- and b-files to support the pawns. White continues with his avalanche although in retrospect I think 13. [ N x e7 ] may have been better. This move as played allows black to defend though he has limited options. 13. ... [ N e8 ] might work.
 [ e5 ] , [ N g4 ]  I think [ d5 ] was better for the Kn
 [ f3 ] , [ N f6 ]  Probably retreating to [ f2 ] would have been better.
 [ d x e5 ] , [ B g5 ]  The counterblow. Black does well to contain the damage...
 [ d6 ]  [ B x h6 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ Q f3 ]  [ B x b3 ]  [ B x f8 ]  [ B a4 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ R g8 ]  [ B f6 ]  [ Q d7 ]  [ N a3 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ Q h3 ]  [ Q x h3 ]  [ N x h3 ]  [ N x c2 + ]  [ N x c2 ]  [ B x c2 ]  [ R c1 ] , [ B e4 ]  Is castling not a good option here?
 [ Q c5 ]  [ K c2 ]  [ R d5 ]  [ R d4 ]  [ c6 ]  [ g5 ] , [ Q b5 ]  ?? [ c4 ] is a valid fork! I thought it was impossible I just thought about subtle manouvers on the K side... :-)
 [ b x a4 ] , [ B x a4 ]  (?) The first small slip by White - not that it is so serious. GK recommends first 22.Nh4! [ Q h5 ] 23.[ N f5 + ] [ B x f5 ] 24.[ N x f5 + ] [ K f8 ] and now: 25.[ B x a4 ] [ Q f7 ] (seizing the vacated a2-[ g8 ] diagonal) 26.[ Q g5 ] [ h6 ] 27.[ Q g3 ] [ N h5 ] 28.[ Q f3 ] [ R a6 ] 29.[ b3 ] [ N f4 ] 30.[ K d2 ] with a slight advantage to White.
 [ Q x h5 ] , [ R x h5 ]  The queen exchange might have been a blunder on his part. Made things somewhat safer for me. The h rook is still in the same danger of [ g6 ] though which wins him a tempo since i would have to withdraw.
 [ N x e8 ]  [ R x e8 + ]  [ K f7 ]  [ R d8 ]  [ R x g3 ]  [ R x d6 ] , [ B x h3 ]  I am up a rook. He resigned.
 [ N e5 ]  [ O-O ] , [ O-O ]  ?! 9. [ c4 ] !? could be interesting too...
 [ N c3 ] , [ d x c4 ]  I decide that it's safe now to take the pawn (Black doesn't really have much else at the moment) but this is promptly met by...
 [ K c5 ] , [ R f1 ]  Taking away the rook's last escape square on the h file making [ K g3 ] followed by the loss of the h pawn inevitable.
 [ R g2 + ]  [ K h4 ]  [ g5 + ]  [ K h5 ] , [ B f3 + ]  And I resigned here because it's mate in two. For one thing my only options are 24.[ K [ h4 ] ] or 24.Kh6. After that black answers with 24...[ R f8 ] and now my monarch is pinned so that it can't get out danger which means that he'll use his [ R a8 ] to mate on [ h4 ] or h6.
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ B b5 ]  My beloved Ruy a favorite of most all players who love to attack.
 [ K b8 ]  [ K c6 ]  [ h5 ] , [ f4 ]  To block your pawns up. I want to put you in "zugzwang" which means you are in a place where any move you make is bad.
 [ N x e6 ]  [ Q x e6 ] , [ B x f4 ]  And white has regained one pawn and scrambled Black somewhat with the isolated pawn and Knight on the rim. Also possible was 15.[ R e1 ] [ B e3 ] 16.[ B x e3 ] fxe3.
 [ N f2 + ]  [ K g2 ]  [ N x d1 ]  [ R x d1 ]  [ B f6 ] , [ Q c5 ]  securing a better position: after [ Q x c5 ] [ N x c5 ] [ B x b2 ] [ N d7 ] White is winning...
 [ R d1 ]  [ Q c6 ] , [ B f6 ]  Threatening mate. *INTERLUDE*
 [ K x f2 ] , [ N g4 + ]  Double check. Knight and Rook so the knight can't be captured by the bishop. The king must move. Keep in mind that [ K g3 ] or [ K e3 ] are also losing. And I will add the lines later. Feel free to prove it to yourself [ K g3 ] does get trickier though.
 [ N x d4 ]  [ R e7 x e1 ]  [ R x e1 ]  [ R x e1 + ]  [ Q x e1 ] , [ Q x d4 + ]  29. ....... [ Q x d4 + ] - after that plethora of exchanges Freddy is now set to win my [ c5 ] pawn.
 [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ a6 ]  [ B e2 ] , [ e5 ]  ..all standard Najdorf stuff...
 [ R b8 ]  [ a x b5 ] , [ a x b5 ]  I am now left with a strong advantage in the open a file.
 [ h6 ]  [ N h3 ] , [ B e6 ]  The attack on [ c4 ] gains Black a bit of time...
 [ N d2 ]  [ B x f7 ]  [ B x f7 ]  [ K x f7 ]  [ N e4 ] , [ h5 ]  The d-pawn is already a protected passed pawn. Black wishes to create another passed pawn. The knight will have trouble being in two places at once.
 [ K a7 ] , [ d5 + ]  25. [ d5 ] my opponent threw in the sponge here as he will have to give up his queen and rook to escape the immediate clutches of Old Matey. I am very pleased with this mating attack as I am normally a very passive player. I really do need to develop this aspect of chess as I do tend to make heavy weather of converting material or positional advantages.
 [ B e2 ]  [ Q x b2 ] , [ f3 ]  I'm hoping to clean up that forward e-pawn and open the f-file for my Rook
 [ a6 ]  [ R b8 ]  [ a7 ] , [ R a8 ]  I figured that his pawn was blocked and thus hoping it was the best that Bernie could do. However that does not happen as we're about to see.
 [ b6 ] , [ b4 ]  This was a great move I put pressure on his queen and some stress on him. As a result I was able to get a draw instead of a loss against him. This "forced draw" started here after the opponent made a move.
 [ e5 ]  [ a5 ] , [ K b1 ]  Perhaps it wasn't necessary here but in most cases this King moves proves its usefulness later on.
 [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ B x c6 ] , [ B x c6 ]  I was a bit surprised at black exchanging on c6. Surely it is better to wait?
 [ K x e7 ]  [ Q e2 + ]  [ K f8 ]  [ R e1 ] , [ Q e4 ]  he should have resigned here.
 [ N x f4 ]  [ R x f4 ]  [ R x g5 ]  [ g4 ]  [ R x e4 ]  [ R f7 ]  [ R g x g4 ]  [ R h1 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ R h h7 ]  [ R x c4 ]  [ R f x c7 + ]  [ K b8 ]  [ R c f7 ]  [ R d4 ]  [ R h5 ]  [ N a4 ]  [ R f1 ]  [ N b6 ]  [ R d1 ]  [ R a4 ]  [ K b1 ]  [ N c4 ]  [ R h3 ]  [ R c8 ]  [ R b3 ]  [ N a3 + ]  [ K a1 ]  [ N x c2 + ]  [ K b2 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ R b6 ] , [ N b5 ]  The rook here is trapped.
 [ N x f4 + ]  [ K f3 ]  [ N d5 ] , [ R b2 ]  To prevent forks on [ c3 ] (36.Ke4?? was impossible due to 36...Nc3+). Also this gives me the option of moving my rook to the c-file should Black move his rook off the [ b6 ] square to support my pawn in another way.
 [ B c3 ] , [ B x c3 # ]  i appreciate your comments . thank you. ^/diff +64.8
 [ N d5 ] , [ K b8 ]  20. ......... [ K b8 ] - Henry evades a royal knight fork on [ b6 ] but ......
 [ N b d2 ]  [ B g7 ] , [ Q c2 ]  both players have completed development: White - as always - has reached a Grand Prix Attack setup; Blacks' position is solid but there still has a lot of work to be done...
 [ a6 ] , [ e3 ]  pretty obvious.
 [ f6 ]  [ N g4 ]  [ h5 ] , [ N f2 ]  of course Black is way behind in development: but there is profit in the momentum of this attack...
 [ a3 ] , [ a6 ]  Initiating one plan being to put my [ B b2 ] and remove his from K-side defense.
 [ Q d6 ] , [ B b2 ]  Well if Black doesn't want to recapture...
 [ e4 ] , [ e5 ]  The king's pawn! I like the king's pawn! Ruy Lopez shall we?
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ B c5 ]  ? Not a move I ever encountered before. His pawn is wide open.
 [ a x b5 ]  [ B x b5 ] , [ N c6 ]  After the development of both sides is finished White has to make a crucial decision. White is up a pawn in material but Black's pieces are superior positioned. The LSB is a nuisence from the beginning. The DSB will show itself on [ d6 ] very soon and with both Bishops aiming at the King's pawns windmill and mating themes spring to mind automatically. White's main goal must be to exchange one of the Bishops before Black's attack gets underway preferrably the LSB. Right now there is no line for White to achieve that goal though. White also has to put his DSB to use. On the positive White has an eye on [ e5 ] to use as an outpost and the promise of pushing the queenside pawns.
 [ B x a3 ]  [ b x a3 ]  [ f4 ]  [ Q h4 ]  [ Q x e5 + ]  [ K f1 ]  [ g6 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ Q g7 ]  [ B h6 ]  [ Q f6 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ Q c3 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ R f7 ]  [ B b4 ]  [ Q c7 ] , [ B d2 ]  Spent a long time thinking about black's next move and finally came up with the following plan
 [ B d3 ]  [ b x c4 ]  [ B x c4 ]  [ Q b6 ]  [ B d3 ] , [ e4 ]  !! The first sacrifice of the game. This is probably definitely sound because of the tactics in the position.
 [ N f3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ B e7 ] , [ g3 ]  A key decision. It's either this or 6.[ e4 ] turning the game into a Sicilian with a Maroczy bind by transposition. I go for the fianchetto.
 [ B c4 ] , [ B x c4 ]  gladly I exchange the light squared bishops
 [ e5 ]  [ f3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ b6 ]  [ e7 ]  [ b5 ]  [ g4 ]  [ f5 ]  [ g5 ]  [ h5 ]  [ g6 ]  [ b4 ]  [ h4 ]  [ R h7 ]  [ N h3 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ d4 ]  [ R h6 ]  [ d5 ]  [ R h8 ]  [ d6 ]  [ Q c8 ]  [ c4 ]  [ f2 + ]  [ K x f2 ]  [ B g2 ]  [ K x g2 ]  [ a5 ]  [ c5 ]  [ B x e7 ]  [ c6 ]  [ f4 ]  [ b3 ]  [ R a6 ]  [ K f3 ]  [ K d8 ]  [ K x f4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N g5 ]  [ R h6 ]  [ N h7 ]  [ R a7 ]  [ N f8 ]  [ N e8 ]  [ a4 ]  [ N a6 ]  [ K e4 ]  [ B x f8 ]  [ K d4 ]  [ N b8 ]  [ B g5 + ]  [ N f6 ]  [ Q f3 ]  [ R h8 ]  [ Q d5 ]  [ R b7 ]  [ Q g8 ]  [ R a7 ]  [ B a6 ]  [ R x a6 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ c x d6 ]  [ R e8 + ]  [ K c7 ]  [ N a3 ]  [ N x e8 ]  [ N b5 + ]  [ K b6 ]  [ N c7 ]  [ R a8 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ N h7 ]  [ K d5 ]  [ Q x e8 ]  [ K d4 ]  [ N a6 ]  [ B d8 ]  [ d5 ]  [ K x d5 ]  [ Q e1 ]  [ K d4 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ K d3 ]  [ Q c1 ]  [ K e2 ]  [ Q e1 + ]  [ K x e1 ]  [ B x h4 + ]  [ K e2 ]  [ R a7 ]  [ N a8 + ]  [ K c5 ]  [ c7 ]  [ K d6 ]  [ c8 = Q ]  [ N f8 ]  [ K f3 ]  [ N x g6 ]  [ K e4 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ K f5 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ K e4 ]  [ N g6 ]  [ K f5 ]  [ B h4 ]  [ K x g6 ]  [ B g3 ]  [ K x g7 ]  [ R x g8 + ]  [ K x g8 ]  [ h4 ]  [ K g7 ]  [ B e1 ]  [ K g6 ]  [ B c3 ]  [ K g5 ]  [ K e5 ]  [ K x h4 ]  [ B d4 ]  [ K g5 ]  [ B c3 ]  [ K g4 ]  [ B e1 ]  [ K f3 ]  [ K d5 ]  [ K e2 ]  [ R b7 ]  [ K x e1 ]  [ K e5 ]  [ K d2 ]  [ K f5 ]  [ K d3 ]  [ R c7 ]  [ K d4 ]  [ K g4 ]  [ K d5 ]  [ K g3 ]  [ K d6 ]  [ R c1 ]  [ K x d7 ]  [ K g2 ]  [ K d6 ]  [ K g1 ]  [ K d5 ]  [ K g2 ]  [ K d4 ]  [ R c5 ]  [ K d3 ]  [ R c4 ]  [ K x c4 ]  [ K g1 ]  [ K b5 ]  [ K h2 ]  [ K x a6 ]  [ K g1 ]  [ K x a5 ]  [ K f1 ] , [ K x b4 ]  Now I have to finish in 50 moves. Which could be harder than it sounds!
 [ f6 ] , [ Q x h5 ]  finally
 [ R d d8 ] , [ g4 ]  blocks the g pawn and opens space for my king the idea is to play [ B f6 ] when possible first I'll need consolidate and prevent [ B e3 ] by playing [ R f3 ] and [ K g2 ] to defend the rook from a possible pin by black with [ R f8 ]  [ R x f8 ]  [ R h8 ]  [ R x h8 ] , [ B x h8 ]  as planed
 [ B f4 ]  [ N f2 ] , [ R c4 ]  Either Black submits to the exchange of Rooks or he loses more material.
 [ a3 ]  [ b6 ]  [ B e3 ] , [ B b7 ]  Both sides develop. Black puts pressure on [ e4 ] while White occupies the center directly.
 [ B e3 ] , [ Q e5 ]  Threatening b2.
 [ B e4 ] , [ R g3 ]  This drops the [ e5 ] pawn however there is not much else white could really do about the threat of mate.
 [ Q x e6 + ] , [ K f2 ]  It was a little noisy on and off but not too bad until now. Had it been a little quieter I would've answered with 22.[ K d1 ] to prevent a check.
 [ b x a4 ]  [ K x c4 ]  [ K f7 ] , [ K b5 ]  Or [ K c5 ] and his king can't escape the cage. But again let's do it quickly.
 [ R x d1 + ]  [ K x d1 ] , [ R d8 + ]  I knew that would happen.
 [ f3 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ Q x e5 ]  [ O-O ] , [ Q g3 ]  Ooh you know what a totally AWESOME move for black is? [ B h4 ] pins the white queen.
 [ K x e5 ]  [ K f7 ] , [ K d6 ]  51. [ K d6 ] - here is an excerpt of a pm I sent to Freddy "Ok white wins I cannot prevent the queenside pawns be gobbled up by your king. Here is a sample analysis. 51. [ K d6 ] [ K f6 ] 52. [ K c7 ] [ g5 ] 53. [ K x [ b7 ] ] [ g x f4 ] 54. [ g x f4 ] [ K g6 ] 55. [ K x a6 ] [ K h5 ] 56. [ b5 ] [ K g4 ] 57. [ b6 ] [ K x f4 ] 58. [ b7 ] [ K e4 ] 59. [ b8 = Q ] Well played Freddy!
 [ K e7 ]  [ Q x a8 ]  [ R h6 ]  [ Q x b7 ] , [ B g4 ]  hand over more material... it's a wonder the game continued for so long!
 [ b5 ]  [ a x b5 ] , [ c x b5 ]  Threatening the bishop.
 [ K h3 ] , [ K g5 ]  Using the king to push an enclosing wall towards the first rank [ g4 ] and h4.
 [ N g3 ] , [ R a f8 ]  Note that now Black is threatening [ R x g3 ] followed by Rxf1. So White moves the rook away.
 [ d6 ]  [ e x d6 ]  [ Q x d6 ]  [ B e4 ]  [ f5 ]  [ B x c6 ]  [ B x c6 ]  [ N e2 ] , [ B x f3 ]  13. ........ [ B x f3 ] - here I am forced to allow my castled position to be broken up after the aforementioned exchange of bishop for knight.
 [ N e4 ]  [ B f3 ] , [ R c8 + ]  28. [ R c8 + ] - a counter-attack which alas does not cut the mustard.
 [ Q c2 + ] , [ g6 ]  Clearly this was a risky policy as my kingside is weaker than his.
 [ B g5 ] , [ c4 ]  ?! This however is a somewhat questionable decision. I was very much relieved to be given the opportunity to get rid of the Bishop pair - of course my Knight is inferior to the remaining Bishop but this position is now definitely unwinable for White. Time remaining: 6 minutes
 [ R x d2 ]  [ R e4 ]  [ g5 ]  [ K g1 ]  [ N h4 ]  [ R e3 ] , [ N d5 ]  It is mate soon for instance 47. [ R e4 ] [ N x f3 + ] 48. [ K f1 ] Bh3#. Even sacrificing my rook for his bishop doesn't work - his knights and rook mate me in short order
 [ B e5 ] , [ R a d1 ]  34. [ R a d1 ] - an attempt at counterplay on the d file but ....
 [ B f4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ a3 ]  [ B d6 ] , [ B e5 ]  this was novelty for me. Usually it is bishop exchange
 [ h5 ] , [ K g8 ]  The complications after18...[ g5 ] are in White's favor 19.[ N g6 + ] The point! 19...[ K g8 ] 20.[ N x f8 ] and now: A. 20...[ f4 ] 21.Nxh7! [ f x e3 ] 22.[ Q x e3 ] [ K x h7 ] 23.[ h6 ] [ B f8 ] (23...[ B h8 ] 24.Bd3+) 24.[ [ d5 ] ] attacking the knight on [ b6 ] White wins. For example: a1. 24...N6x[ [ d5 ] ] 25.[ Q e4 + ] [ K h8 ] 26.[ N x a2 ] [ N x a2 ] (26...[ N f6 ] 27.[ [ [ [ e6 ] ] ] ] [ N x e4 ] 28.exf7+-) 27.[ [ [ [ e6 ] ] ] ] wins. a2. 24...Bx[ [ d5 ] ] 25.Qx[ b6 ] wins. B. 20...[ B x f8 ] 21.Bx[ g5 ] with advantage.; Magnus was expecting 18...[ g x h5 ] but White has two ways to deal with it successfully: A.19.[ N x h5 ] [ R g8 ] (19...[ [ [ a4 ] ] ] 20.Nxg7) 20.N[ f4 ] [ [ [ a4 ] ] ] 21.[ [ [ [ e6 ] ] ] ] Bx[ [ [ [ e6 ] ] ] ] 22.[ R x h7 + ] [ K x h7 ] 23.[ R h1 + ] B[ h6 ] 24.Nx[ [ [ [ e6 ] ] ] ] [ R g6 ] 25.[ N g5 + ] wins. B.19.[ R x h5 ] [ [ [ a4 ] ] ] 20.[ R c h1 ] [ a3 ] 21.[ R x h7 + ] [ K g8 ] 22.[ [ [ [ e6 ] ] ] ] Bx[ [ [ [ e6 ] ] ] ] 23.[ R x g7 + ] [ K x g7 ] (23...[ Q x g7 ] 24.Nxe6+-) 24.[ [ d5 ] ] N6x[ [ d5 ] ] 25.Nfx[ [ d5 ] ] Nx[ [ d5 ] ] 26.[ B h6 + ] [ K f6 ] 27.Ne4+! and White mates.
 [ R f7 ] , [ R g6 ]  move it up so i can threaten two pawns on the left side.
 [ N c6 ]  [ a3 ]  [ B a5 ]  [ b4 ] , [ N x b4 ]  7. ... [ B b6 ] is the safe move here but I thought with White's Bishop blocked momentarily and my strong Knight on [ e4 ] I could force a favorable exchange or even a quick Mate if I could get my Queen into the attack. I also enjoy playing a true sacrifice now and again!
 [ N c3 ]  [ N e7 ] , [ e4 ]  [ e4 ] now that i dont have a bishop on [ g2 ] i can play this
 [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ] , [ e6 ]  Normal Sicilian play so far but still this move (though book according to analysis) is a new one for me
 [ Q f7 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ g5 ]  Here was where I got carried away with an illusory attack. [ g5 ] is a serious weakening move and White has adequate defenders but I couldn't see any other way to generate play on the kingside
 [ O-O ] , [ N b d2 ]  wrong place for that knight [ N c3 ] is way better attacking my pawn
 [ R c3 ] , [ R h b1 ]  I want the queens off now because it is active against my king.
 [ e4 ]  [ N g1 ] , [ h6 ]  ?? I'm not exactly sure why Ken played but according to Joe this loses which is why I gave it two queiries. It's important to note that TA showed everyone two positions with the fen. This was the first. In it he said "His weak pawn storming combined with his perplexed Knight moving only drew him in farther to my electrical storm."
 [ O-O ]  [ N x d4 ] , [ a3 ]  Attacking the Queen.
 [ d5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B g5 ] , [ N b d7 ]  The main line in the Richter Veresov Attack. Black protects himself from the doubling of Pawns (after Bxf6) but at the same time Bishop on [ c8 ] is trapped for a while.
 [ K c2 ] , [ Q x e4 + ]  +15!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
 [ B c6 ]  [ h5 ] , [ a5 ]  Now he's going to try to promote that pawn too. Great...
 [ K d4 ] , [ a4 ]  A queen completely turns the tides however there is no rush.
 [ N g5 ]  [ N f4 ] , [ N h2 ]  In the heat of the game Safeway misses an opportunity for the diagonal joop on [ e3 ]  [ N e4 ] , [ N g4 ]  Jabborg can't move his [ e4 ] knight because he would be jooped
 [ Q x h8 ] , [ B x h8 ]  I was very proud of this attack starting with [ Q b6 ] ending with the exchange for the queen. It since occurred to me that two rooks for a queen and a pawn is exactly equal but when I smelled her majesty's blood in the water I couldn't help myself. Anyways blacks position seems substantially stronger here.
 [ a4 ]  [ c6 ]  [ a5 ]  [ B a7 ]  [ N e4 ] , [ c5 ]  ? I think he had considered a few moves ahead and missed a short term weakness in his position.
 [ d x e4 ] , [ N x e4 ]  Slowly improving my position.
 [ O-O-O ] , [ O-O-O ]  16. ....... 0-0-0 - It seemed a good idea at the time but Henry is gonna be just as vulnerable on the queenside as on the kingside.
 [ N b c6 ] , [ Q h4 ]  I was expecting [ f6 ] Bx[ f6 ] [ N e2 ] with the smallest edge for Black; it is still over after [ d x c3 ] so I decided to take the plunge...
 [ B x e6 ]  [ N x e6 ]  [ Q d7 ] , [ g x f5 ]  I'm sure this was unexpected on my part but starts to open up blacks king side. I'm not sure this is the best move but I felt [ B x f8 ] [ R x f8 ] [ N x g7 ] [ Q x g7 ] and black is holding on.
 [ B e6 ] , [ g5 ]  White has little time to waste capturing blacks pieces so white allows black to initiate all exchanges and continues to attack the kingside with 0-0-0 in mind if necessary.
 [ B e3 ] , [ N d5 ]  another good move. I wasn't willing to close off the d-file and un-double his pawns with a knight trade so I knew i'd have to chase his knight away before i could do much.
 [ Q x d6 ]  [ Q g7 ]  [ N x f6 + ]  [ R x f6 ] , [ Q x e5 ]  34. [ Q x e5 ] - ...... and another!
 [ B x h8 ] , [ B x h8 ]  At this point I badly need to rearrange my forces and castle. My opponent however continues to make small threats that I need to defend giving me no time to achieve anything I want to.
 [ B e3 ] , [ O-O ]  White's bishop moves back to [ e3 ] and black castles.
 [ Q x e3 + ]  [ K h1 ] , [ N g4 ]  My blunder in the sense that if now white plays [ B h3 ] my knight is pinned (or exchanged) and there is no mate. I could have won but not in the nice way I did.
 [ K c5 ]  [ N x f5 ]  [ c3 ]  [ b3 ]  [ a x b3 ]  [ a x b3 ]  [ K b4 ] , [ N d4 ]  the Knight is outplayed...
 [ B c4 ] , [ N f6 ]  But things became easy again once he developed his N as now I'm gonna pin it.
 [ B x f2 + ]  [ K e2 ] , [ B x g1 ]  Looks like he have gotten the piece back with much better position but my next move was probably a surprise for him.
 [ R f8 ]  [ Q x a1 ]  [ Q f6 ] , [ Q e1 ]  20. [ Q e1 ] - Glenda gets as close to her other half as she can aaah! Reason Henry is in Old Matey's shadow (Qf2#).
 [ Q d8 + ] , [ K f7 ]  I played it anyway but it was in fact useless.
 [ N f3 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ O-O ] , [ O-O ]  middle game from now his center is very dangerous i should play [ e4 ] as soon as possible to stabilize the center
 [ K e1 ]  [ R x c2 ] , [ R a1 ]  Of course trading the rooks is tantamount to resigning but white has no drawing chances anymore.
 [ e4 ] , [ e6 ]  this works really well for me. I've found my opening on black.
 [ K e6 ] , [ Q h3 + ]  A quick trot to [ h3 ]  [ K e7 ] , [ Q g5 + ]  Trot to the g-file
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ d4 ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ c3 ]  [ d x c3 ] , [ B c4 ]  Mieses offers a full Danish...
 [ d4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ c5 ]  Again from round two there was that seemingly premature push of the c pawn. I reacted accordingly.
 [ R h x d1 ]  [ R c5 ]  [ h3 ]  [ R f c8 ]  [ R d2 ] , [ K f7 ]  The is no hurry. Balck moves his king to [ d7 ] to be able protect the c-file. White is not only a piece down he can only wiat while black prepares to finish him of
 [ N x a4 ]  [ Q x a4 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ N e2 ] , [ O-O ]  And black has a comfortable position out of the opening. It will take white time to prepare [ g5 ] or [ h4 ] and black can look forward to pressure along the semi-open c-file.
 [ e5 ]  [ f4 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ h3 ]  [ B x f3 ]  [ Q x f3 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ d3 ]  [ O-O ] , [ B e3 ]  Be3: The good thing is this move develops piece clears the back for a possible queenside castle and reinforces the center. However [ B x c6 ] is the better move. (Engine favors white with this move).
 [ N x c6 ] , [ Q e8 ]  But that advice helped because she saw my intentions this time. Erika realized that I was attacking her Q so she had to do something in order to defend it.
 [ B x d4 ]  [ R x d4 ] , [ R f e1 ]  ?! Thanks to the revealed threat on [ a1 ] Black can now exchange the opposite square bishops damage White's queenside pawn structure and gain time.
 [ Q h6 ] , [ R f7 ]  Blockading the pawn.
 [ B d3 ]  [ c6 ]  [ N g e2 ] , [ b5 ]  Part of my plan for queenside expansion. Now if [ c x [ b5 ] ] then [ a x [ b5 ] ] gives me a space edge on the queenside as well as an open file for my rook. Or if white doesn't take on [ b5 ] then I have the option of [ b x c5 ] with an open b-file and potential to create a weak pawn for white later on with pressure against [ b2 ] with my rook and/or the a-pawn.
 [ c x d6 ] , [ R e1 ]  Time to activate the QR.
 [ B x g4 ]  [ B x d4 + ]  [ K h1 ]  [ N x g4 ] , [ N x f8 ]  We have reached a critical moment. White is up a full rook but he is still facing a strong attack. It looks like black could now play the crushing move Qh4. He must resist the temptation to do so however since white would then get the last laugh by playing Qh7+. Black would be forced to exchange queens after which his attack is kaput and white will just be up an exchange.
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ c4 ] , [ c6 ]  The Slav seems to be popular these days.
 [ h x g5 ] , [ h x g5 ]  Black wins another Knight going to +6. White is hoping for [ g6 ] followed by [ Q h7 # ] but there it's easily defended against allowing Black to gain an even larger lead.
 [ d x e5 ]  [ Q x e5 + ] , [ K h7 ]  Here I was looking for something which could attack black but couldn't find anything to open up the cramped defense and I ended up with pushing pawns
 [ B e3 ] , [ R g6 ]  Oh no wait it was idiocy.
 [ K h8 ]  [ Q x h5 + ]  [ K g8 ]  [ h x g5 ]  [ f x g5 ]  [ Q x g5 + ] , [ K h8 ]  Look at the board I have *no* pawn cover for my king and oh joy he has an open file to shuttle his pieces down.
 [ g4 ] , [ g6 ]  If White exchanges Pawns I could possibly get rid of a pair of Rooks...
 [ f x e3 ] , [ B x b2 ]  forcing his queen out of the way....
 [ Q d3 ] , [ e6 ]  Kicking the knight so that it won't have the opportunity to fork my king and rook on [ d7 ] when I need to move my queen.
 [ N e2 g3 ] , [ N d5 ]  I simply declined my decision to play 8...[ N x e4 ] because it would proceed as 9.[ f x e4 ] [ B g6 ] 10.[ B e2 ] would make my bishop useless and white might dominate a strong centre. So I had thought to attack the undefended bishop on f4.
 [ B x e1 ]  [ R x g1 ]  [ Q e3 ]  [ R x g2 ]  [ N d2 ] , [ g3 ]  going for queen
 [ B d6 ]  [ R e1 ] , [ N g4 ]  And pressure seemingly from nowhere. White needs to be very careful not to get mated. I'd like to try [ B x h2 ] at some point as well with this as the follow up as that also seems dangerous.
 [ O-O-O ] , [ b5 ]  
 [ N c5 + ]  [ K d6 ]  [ N x a4 ] , [ K x d5 ]  White just won two pawns for one closing the gap in material but the black king is in position to annihilate white's remaining pawns and there's not much white can do about it.
 [ N f6 ]  [ h3 ]  [ B e7 ] , [ g4 ]  The key move. Best for black is to develop and castle queenside.
 [ b x c6 ]  [ K c2 ] , [ N e7 ]  Perhaps black should have pressed his advantage by attacking the [ e5 ] square with f6. It removes a strategically placed pawn and begins to open up a file for his light square bishop.
 [ Q g5 ] , [ N c5 ]  ! Threatens a fork if 18...[ B e8 ] and forces Black into a very unnatural move...
 [ B x f5 ]  [ e x f5 ]  [ Q d7 ]  [ Q x g4 ]  [ g6 ]  [ Q f3 ]  [ g x f5 ]  [ b4 ]  [ N b7 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ O-O-O ] , [ a4 ]  Trying to open the queenside.
 [ h5 ] , [ K g7 ]  The plain [ h x g6 ] is answered with [ f x g6 ] and I have nothing really. I have to build some more.
 [ c x d4 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ B x g7 ]  [ K x g7 ]  [ B b3 ] , [ B a6 ]  It was a toss up between this square and [ b7 ] I thought this diagonal was probably best.
 [ g4 ] , [ B h4 + ]  15. ......... [ B h4 ] - this check makes room for Henry to go to e7. Ion puts his king on [ e2 ] and I now back off my rook to [ f7 ] defending [ g7 ] against a possible check on [ g6 ] by the Wicked Witch of the West. But Ion has a much stronger continuation ............
 [ e x d4 ]  [ Q x d4 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ Q d1 ] , [ B e6 ]  As yet White appears to have gained nothing from the apparent sacrifice.
 [ d5 ] , [ B d3 ]  No option but to move it and [ d3 ] seems to be the best outpost for the time
 [ O-O ]  [ e5 ]  [ R e1 ] , [ N c6 ]  black king is still in the center and its a bit dangerous.
 [ N g x e2 ] , [ N f d7 ]  Skipping away from the pawn
 [ e5 ]  [ d4 ]  [ B f2 ]  [ N f5 ] , [ h3 ]  preparing g4: Black will play [ N e3 ] anyway...
 [ K f8 ] , [ Q h7 ]  threating both with [ Q x d7 ] and [ Q h8 ] then [ Q x a8 ]  [ g6 ] , [ N g5 ]  now blacks thinks that with giving the knight he could stop the attack. but as we will see in few moves it was wrong. 36...[ K f8 ] was the last escaping chance of black.
 [ B c1 ]  [ N d1 ]  [ B e4 ]  [ B a4 ] , [ N e5 ]  Mistake much better was 34...Ra8!.35.Bxe8-Rxa3.36.bxa3-Ne5!! and black with better endgame 35.Kg3-Bf4+.36.Kg4-h5+.37.fxh6(U.P.) -f5+.... not 36....Ne1+.3.Kf2-Nxf3.38.Nc3-Bxg5.39.Nxe4-Bxe7.40.Kxf3-[ B x f3 = ] .
 [ R f2 ]  [ a5 ]  [ Q d6 ] , [ Q e5 ]  Can you find the game winning move?
 [ R x f7 + ] , [ K e8 ]  [ K g8 ] would have allowed me to capture the queen with the discovered check with Rd7+.
 [ R a c1 ]  [ a5 ]  [ R f d1 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N f1 ]  [ K e7 ]  [ N e3 ]  [ B e4 ]  [ N g5 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ N x f5 + ]  [ e x f5 ] , [ f4 ]  yes... I now have tha pair of bishops White are better.
 [ N x e5 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ b x c3 ]  [ B x c3 ]  [ N x c3 ]  [ Q x c3 ]  [ Q d4 + ]  [ Q x d4 ]  [ c x d4 ] , [ N c6 ]  White has a lot of advantages in this middlegame/endgame. He has a strong passed a-pawn while I have a weak backward e-pawn. White's isolated d-pawn seems to have enough potential defenders. I should be lucky to draw this ending but I swindled him at the end because of my superior endgame calculation.
 [ Q x e4 ] , [ d5 ]  The fork. Can you see white's only (and good) move?
 [ B x c4 ] , [ d3 ]  Thinking about how to get back a piece and trying to get ahead in development I play this. My goal although it won't work is to try and get back in the game.
 [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ d x c4 ] , [ e4 ]  I chose [ e4 ] instead of Nf3.
 [ c4 ]  [ d x c4 ]  [ N d x e5 ] , [ Q h3 ]  12. ... [ h6 ] is yet again the best option for black but again is overlooked for a vain attack on the white bishop who yet again is able to flee. However the pawn capture is not an exchange on [ c4 ] with a threat by the knight to capture the queen instead. Who will flee to where she was heading anyway h3.
 [ K c8 ] , [ N d6 + ]  48. [ N d6 + ] - the killer - #4.
 [ R b8 ]  [ B x a3 ]  [ K d2 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ g4 ]  [ B d5 ]  [ K c2 ]  [ B x f3 ]  [ R x b2 ]  [ B x b2 ]  [ K x b2 ]  [ f5 ]  [ g x f5 ]  [ g x f5 ]  [ c4 ]  [ K f7 ]  [ K c3 ]  [ K e7 ]  [ K d4 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ K e5 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ c5 ]  [ K d7 ]  [ K d5 ] , [ B c2 ]  
 [ N c5 ] , [ d4 ]  Pushing the knight further away.
 [ Q c7 ] , [ R c1 ]  Trying to win my [ c6 ] pawn but I underestimated the situation. The threat that I was weary of was him winning extra material P+N with something like 19.Qx[ c6 ] with the idea now of 19...Qx[ c6 ] 20.[ R x c6 + ] where he forks and get the Na6.
 [ b x c5 ] , [ B a3 ]  Finally developing a piece but I'm not sure what this accomplishes. Maybe looking to trade on [ f8 ] if black plays ...[ c x d4 ] but that trade doesn't really do anything for white.
 [ R c8 ]  [ R f d1 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ Q b3 ] , [ N e7 ]  Blunder simply blocks in the R and takes the N out of the game. Better was [ N a5 ] protecting [ b7 ] and attacking the Q
 [ N a3 ] , [ b5 ]  10. .... [ b5 ] - suddenly a nice neat pawn wall on the queenside.
 [ N b d2 ] , [ Q d6 ]  Joe: I'm not sure what to do here. One move that I'm taking into consideration though is 11.[ Q e2 ] to mobilize my Queen and connect my Rooks. Ken: There is nothing to attack at all. You need to play what the professional players call a 'high class waiting move. Joe: I know about waiting moves but what is High Class? Ken: very good Joe: Then I think that a High Class move which just came to mind is 11.[ R e1 ] It centralizes the Rook but also adds a defender should I decide to play e4. If I did that it would mean the loss of a pawn but the Rook there they just get exchanged. I'm not sure but I'd say that it's the best move unless there's one that I'm missing which often happens to me. Ken: It's reasonably good choice. I don't see anything that stands out as very much better.
 [ Q e3 ]  [ Q g7 ]  [ b3 ] , [ B d7 ]  21. .......... [ B d7 ] - this bishop develops at last but he will be severely hemmed in from now on in.
 [ f4 ] , [ b6 ]  Preparing to develop the bishop
 [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B b4 ]  [ B d2 ]  [ b6 ]  [ e3 ] , [ B b7 ]  All perfectly natural progressions up until this point. The Fianchettoing of the bishop caught me slightly off guard. Not too much though I'd seen it before.
 [ a x b4 ]  [ a x b4 ]  [ f5 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ g4 ] , [ R a3 ]  at least black has two passed pawns...
 [ B x g5 ]  [ N x g5 ] , [ R f5 ]  ? Knowing that and feeling like he might try to do something I kick Til's Knight. What I forgot is that this move is going to cost me a pawn. Much better was 18...e5.
 [ B g3 ]  [ K f3 ]  [ h4 ]  [ N d2 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ N f1 ]  [ B e5 ]  [ N d2 ]  [ B h2 ]  [ N c4 ]  [ B g3 ] , [ N b2 ]  This time Black accepts. A well-played game by both sides and a deserved result.
 [ Q a4 ] , [ Q c4 ]  ?! I think moving the knight would have been better here.
 [ B g5 ]  [ R c2 x c6 ]  [ B x c1 ]  [ R x a6 + ]  [ K e7 ] , [ R x a8 ]  
 [ R b7 + ]  [ K c8 ] , [ R a7 ]  Threatening mate with Ra8#; black's response defends against this threat but misses the other one...
 [ K e2 ] , [ B a5 ]  So this is to prevent [ N c7 ] to see if you'd play Nf6(???).
 [ Q g2 ] , [ K h8 ]  Move king aside to allow rook to align itself with white's queen and king.
 [ c x d5 ] , [ e x d5 ]  Now Black has the "hanging pawns" in the center
 [ R x e2 ]  [ R x f5 ]  [ e3 ]  [ R f3 ] , [ R x a2 ]  I had calculated 40. [ N b4 ] [ e2 ] 41. [ N x a2 ] [ e1 Q ] 42. [ N x c1 ] [ Q x c1 ] with a very easy win for Black. The winning plan is to push the f-pawn and squeeze the King into the corner then capture either the f-pawn or the Rook if it goes to a bad square. But White didn't feel like playing anymore and resigned here.
 [ N f3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ e3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ N b d7 ]  [ N b d2 ]  [ c6 ]  [ h3 ]  [ h6 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ c3 ]  [ N h5 ]  [ B h2 ]  [ e5 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ B x e5 ]  [ B x h5 ]  [ B x h2 + ]  [ K x h2 ]  [ Q c7 + ]  [ g3 ]  [ g x h5 ] , [ Q x h5 ]  All of this was reeled off in about 3 minutes. Black is a pawn down but White has no quickly accessible attacking lines.
 [ c x b5 ]  [ c x b5 ]  [ B x b5 + ] , [ K e7 ]  besides the move I did is [ N e5 ] as good as it looked at the time with possible Nc6+?
 [ b3 ] , [ B a6 ]  Centralizing might have been wiser but I liked keeping white from castling. Even if it won't last.
 [ B x d5 + ] , [ K g7 ]  My plan was to try to hide my king in the corner and surround it with pieces. As it turns out I don't have time in view of this 8 ... [ K e8 ] might be a better try
 [ Q b2 ]  [ N g5 ]  [ Q x a1 ]  [ R x f6 ]  [ Q x b1 ]  [ R x f7 ] , [ R d3 x d2 + ]  I didn't take his rook because it would have been a distraction.
 [ f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ B d7 ] , [ O-O-O ]  Perfectly normal altough there are alternatives most popular seems to be a h-pawn hack. This move has however scored better in practise.
 [ B x f3 ]  [ e5 ] , [ d5 ]  settling at the center
 [ d4 ] , [ f5 ]  Black chooses the "tight-agressive" Dutch Opening an opening not very familiar to black.
 [ e x f3 ]  [ e ]  [ p ]  [ Q x f3 ]  [ K d2 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ K d1 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ K e1 ] , [ Q h1 + ]  ....and black resigns. Give it up to the 'D' players of the world! Even a mighty Caesar can be taken down!
 [ B x g3 ]  [ f x g3 ]  [ h5 ]  [ b4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ h x g4 ]  [ h4 ]  [ Q g6 ] , [ a4 ]  When in doubt push a pawn? [ R f4 ] seems stronger.
 [ B x g6 ] , [ N x g6 ]  Pressuring f4.
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ b6 ]  [ e4 ] , [ B b7 ]  This is an odd way to get into an Owen's Defense setup. Usually [ B b4 ] is played to pin the [ N c3 ] but the move order was different here.
 [ Q e8 ] , [ Q h4 ]  ...of course.
 [ K d3 ]  [ K b3 ]  [ K d4 ]  [ K b4 ]  [ K d3 ] , [ c5 ]  ...but I wasted a couple of moves here working out how to promote my pawn finally moving it up to the 4th rank...
 [ b x a5 ]  [ B x a5 ]  [ c6 ] , [ B c3 ]  34. [ B c3 ] - Fou Lenoir protects the [ b2 ] pawn and blockades the black doubletons on the c column.
 [ e5 ]  [ B b5 ] , [ B g4 ]  9...Bg4. The two flank attacks are already forming one on the Queen side for White and one on the King side for Black.
 [ K h3 ]  [ f x e5 ] , [ f x e5 ]  Fortunately I have another ready to step into its place.
 [ f3 + ]  [ N g3 ]  [ f x g2 ]  [ K x g2 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ d4 ] , [ Q e6 ]  Charging the battery!
 [ R f1 x f4 ] , [ Q d7 + ]  Now it's my turn for a check or two though Black still has incredibly a forced mate. But it's in 12 moves so I escaped.
 [ N x e4 ]  [ B x e4 ] , [ d x e4 ]  White is one pawn late but I hoped the advance on the kingside would compensate it.
 [ N f5 + ]  [ K f6 ]  [ R c6 + ]  [ K e5 ] , [ K e3 ]  Getting the opposition which is very useful in endgames.
 [ K c2 ] , [ B f5 + ]  Still notice that my queen is sleeping...
 [ h4 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ g5 ] , [ f6 ]  Discovered checks are nasty but this one is quite benign.
 [ Q b8 ]  [ N f5 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ Q a4 ]  Moving the queen to the nice open 4th rank. As both my bishops and my knight are threatening the area around the black king I can easily bring my queen into the action too.
 [ K g7 ] , [ Q h5 ]  Finally a chance to put a bit of pressure of my own.
 [ e6 ] , [ B b5 + ]  [ N f3 ] is probably better. There are not many openings in the database with this move and the few there are black tends to do quite well.
 [ K g1 ]  [ B h5 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ Q x f4 ]  He does win a Pawn.
 [ N c3 ]  [ Q x h2 + ]  [ K f1 ]  [ Q h1 + ]  [ K e2 ]  [ Q x g2 ] , [ B e3 ]  Preventing 16...[ R g1 + ] as black would have a forced mate. 17.[ K d2 ] (forced) [ B g5 # ]  [ B x g3 ]  [ f x g3 ] , [ R a e8 ]  After the exchange he indirectly pins my Be3.
 [ b6 ]  [ f4 ]  [ a4 ]  [ f5 ]  [ a3 ] , [ R e2 ]  Now I cant protect my pawn
 [ R a d1 ]  [ f5 ]  [ R x d8 + ] , [ K x d8 ]  Now it's a Rook/Knight vs Bishop/Knight.
 [ Q x h4 ]  [ Q e5 ]  [ R a e8 ]  [ Q d4 ] , [ Q h6 + ]  ! an important inbetween move.
 [ K f1 ]  [ Q h1 + ] , [ K e2 ]  Suddenly it's White's king that's on the run. What a turnaround...
 [ R x c6 ] , [ Q x c6 ]  +13 points (+12 if Bxb4) and Black resigns.
 [ e4 ] , [ b6 ]  Right away I go out of "book".
 [ N x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ a6 ] , [ B e2 ]  With the goal of going to f3.
 [ f4 ] , [ K h3 ]  I don't know why he did that - he might have done it hindering 21 ... [ B f2 ] but still that Bishop is met by the White Queen and my lady is still not going anywhere.
 [ Q x d6 ] , [ c3 ]  11. [ c3 ] - closes off the diagonal of Freddy's dsb.
 [ R x e7 + ]  [ K d6 ] , [ R a e1 ]  As said before my plan was to march down the pawns. With the pawn blunder and now my rooks out of action it seems like White could possibly draw the game or at least even up some material.
 [ f x g4 ]  [ Q x g5 ]  [ Q e1 + ]  [ K f8 ]  [ N d4 ] , [ R e8 ]  Seizing the open file with a rook and doing so with tempo as white must now save his queen.
 [ Q d6 ] , [ B x d5 ]  Here black must defend [ f7 ] and [ d7 ] to avoid mate. No feasible way to defend.
 [ B x e4 ]  [ Q e3 ] , [ B x d4 ]  I decide to take another Pawn. White can't recapture my Bishop with the pawn due to the pawn being pinned by my Queen.
 [ a6 ] , [ R b1 ]  ..typical move in the English....gives flexibility of queenside advance ..
 [ b x c4 ]  [ B x a4 ]  [ N f2 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ N d2 ] , [ b5 ]  Alekhine is continuing to seize space. With a positional and material advantage it's now a matter of technique.
 [ B e6 ]  [ N x e6 ]  [ f x e6 ] , [ B x e6 ]  This Bishop now dominates the board.
 [ Q x d5 ] , [ R f d1 ]  Computer agrees with these moves and says White has a decisive advantage.
 [ d x c5 ] , [ R x c5 ]  Alternative variation: 51... [ K e5 ] 52. [ K d3 ] (52. [ R c3 ] [ICC:] [ R x [ a5 ] ] 53. [ c6 ] bx[ c6 ] 54. Rx[ c6 ] [ R [ a3 ] + ] 55. [ K d2 ] [ a5 ] 56. [ K c2 ] [ a4 ] 57. [ R a6 ] [ R a1 ] 58. [ K d3 ] [ a3 ] 59. [ R a5 + ] [ K f4 ] 60. [ R f5 + ] [ K g3 ] $19) 52... [ R x c5 ] 53. [ R a1 ] [Deep Rybka 4.]
 [ g x f3 ] , [ N e6 ]  I still had to move my knight out of danger and this was the most active spot. The [ b7 ] pawn could not be saved anyway.
 [ N a4 ]  [ R x b7 ] , [ B x c5 ]  Black's eyes get big at the prospect of 26. Bc5?? [ N c5 ] winning the Rook. In stead White improves his position while aborting the threat.
 [ g3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ B g4 ]  When playing against understated systems like the Reti I like to play hypermodern
 [ Q b3 ]  [ B f5 ] , [ Q x b7 ]  NOw he's 2 pawns up for nothing.
 [ b4 ]  [ Q a6 ] , [ B c3 + ]  38. ....... Bc3+!! - the killer.
 [ Q f6 ]  [ N x h8 ] , [ Q x d4 + ]  In this place black pieces are not in bad position near the king queen attacks directly intrepid black Knight is not dead
 [ N c d7 ] , [ O-O ]  wisking the king to safety.
 [ K f7 ] , [ B h5 + ]  time to wrap this up...
 [ Q b2 + ] , [ N d2 ]  blocks the check and doesn't allow him to check anymore my queen also defends [ a1 ] and at the moment is threatening his knight and pawn one of which will be won
 [ Q h5 + ]  [ K e7 ] , [ Q x e5 + ]  Forcing black in a corner.
 [ B x c4 ] , [ e6 ]  When I googled this opening I found a 'game to memorize' between Portisch and Spassky Geneva 1977.
 [ N c4 ] , [ R b1 ]  Forced. Play can actually proceed with 28.[ R x c4 ] [ b x c4 + ] 29.[ K x c4 ] but I still believe that play favors Black.
 [ B x c3 ] , [ Q x c3 + ]  Ah! that was excellent!
 [ R b2 ]  [ R a b1 ]  [ R d2 ]  [ R b3 + ]  [ K e2 ]  [ R x d2 + ]  [ K x d2 ] , [ N c6 ]  locking in his remaining minor piece
 [ N x e7 + ]  [ K h8 ]  [ R x d2 ]  [ B e6 ] , [ B x f6 ]  I was trying to get my knight back to d5. In retrospect 15.[ N [ d5 ] ] is probably better. I will have to recapture on [ d5 ] with a pawn but will avoid opposite color bishop endings.
 [ B g3 ]  [ N x g3 ]  [ h x g3 ] , [ Q a5 ]  With this move I decide to move pawns and possibly N trying to close Queen's side or to control a possible opened line after with my R and Q. I already think i will not castle and think (or hope!) [ e2 ] will be a good square for my King.
 [ d4 ] , [ e x f3 ]  he gets an open file for the knight
 [ a6 ] , [ B b4 ]  he attacks my queen and wins my knight
 [ N x b3 ]  [ a x b3 ]  [ R f e8 ] , [ R b1 ]  Just in case he pushes [ d5 ]  [ c3 ]  [ b x c3 ]  [ b x c3 ]  [ a5 ] , [ R e1 ]  refortify the center just in case of a counter-strike.
 [ R a f8 ]  [ g3 ] , [ e5 ]  Stunning advance of the [ e6 ] pawn. Black is ready to open the center as his pieces are better placed for attack.
 [ K g7 ]  [ N b3 ]  [ g4 ] , [ d x e5 ]  i think this move also helped me...
 [ N x e4 ]  [ B x e4 ] , [ f3 ]  [ Q h4 + ] [ B g3 ] is now possible and holds. For the time being.
 [ B g2 ]  [ B e4 ]  [ R e8 ] , [ B x f3 ]  My brother chooses to simplify further. While this accentuates the Pawn edge I do maintain some drawing chances because of the opposite colored Bishops.
 [ Q c6 + ] , [ K d8 ]  The only good move.
 [ Q c1 + ]  [ K h2 ]  [ Q c6 ]  [ Q g4 ]  [ Q f6 ] , [ R x b7 ]  a welcome pawn :-) Only a bishop down now ...
 [ B x d5 ] , [ e x d5 ]  Good idea capturing with e pawn because if he opens c file i ve a good counterplay.
 [ Q e1 + ]  [ R f1 ]  [ B x f1 ]  [ Q x f1 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ d6 ]  [ f5 ]  [ d7 ]  [ Q x d7 ]  [ Q f2 ]  [ Q d3 ]  [ Q b2 ]  [ K f6 ]  [ Q b8 ]  [ e3 ]  [ Q h8 + ]  [ K e6 ]  [ Q e8 + ]  [ K d5 ]  [ Q d7 + ] , [ K c4 ]  If white takes the queen the pawn can go to e8.
 [ e4 ] , [ c6 ]  The Caro-Kann is my favourite defense.
 [ B g5 ]  [ Q b6 ] , [ B x f6 ]  I almost considered not playing this move. But it does break up black structure which is a key to my attack later on.
 [ B e7 ]  [ d3 ]  [ O-O ] , [ N b d2 ]  On the way to g3.
 [ B f5 ]  [ N h8 ]  [ K d4 ] , [ N f7 ]  44. ......... [ N f7 ] - black is reduced to shunting his knight between [ h8 ] and f7.
 [ Q c6 ]  [ K h2 ]  [ Q d7 ]  [ K g3 ]  [ K f8 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ Q e7 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ Q d7 ]  [ h4 ]  [ K e7 ]  [ R e e2 ]  [ K f8 ] , [ g5 ]  Blockades whites advance. My LSb will now be very powerful.
 [ Q x g5 ] , [ Q g2 ]  This essentially forces the exchange of queens. I'm threatening [ R x c2 ] and the queen with my queen.
 [ K h7 ]  [ R f2 ]  [ Q g6 ]  [ Q f6 ]  [ Q b1 + ]  [ K h2 ]  [ Q x b4 ]  [ Q x e6 ]  [ Q e1 ]  [ Q f5 + ]  [ K h8 ]  [ Q f4 ]  [ K h7 ]  [ a4 ]  [ c6 ]  [ R f1 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ Q f5 + ]  [ R g6 ]  [ Q f2 ]  [ Q d3 ]  [ Q f4 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ R f2 ]  [ Q e1 ]  [ Q c7 + ]  [ R g7 ]  [ R f7 ]  [ R x f7 ]  [ Q x f7 + ]  [ K h8 ]  [ Q f4 ]  [ K h7 ]  [ Q e5 ]  [ Q f2 ]  [ e4 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ Q x e4 + ]  [ K h8 ]  [ Q e5 + ]  [ K h7 ]  [ Q d6 ]  [ Q f7 ]  [ a5 ]  [ Q g7 ]  [ d5 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ Q x d5 ]  [ Q c7 + ]  [ K h1 ]  [ K g7 ]  [ K g1 ] , [ Q e7 ]  Black is obviously playing not to lose at this point with the vulnerability of White's King giving him reason to hope for a draw.
 [ B d6 ] , [ O-O ]  castling into trouble as far as I see this...
 [ h x g5 ]  [ R f x g5 ]  [ Q f2 ] , [ R g5 x g2 ]  [ N g2 ] doesn't threaten the queen. And I want to keep the Queen moving it prevents white from getting his rooks into the game.
 [ B c5 ] , [ R x e4 ]  ...and remove it...
 [ a3 ] , [ b3 ]  My aim is to close this part of the chessboard.
 [ N e4 ]  [ Q e3 ]  [ N x b4 ] , [ R a7 ]  gotta avoid the fork
 [ N c3 ]  [ B g7 ] , [ B e2 ]  [ h3 ] is playable
 [ R e1 ] , [ B g4 ]  Pinning the Knight to the Queen to remove its support of e5.
 [ N e4 ] , [ B d7 ]  Let's see if this can compensate.
 [ R d8 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ Q d4 ]  [ Q c1 ]  [ f5 ]  [ Q e1 ]  [ Q e5 + ]  [ K f2 ]  [ Q x e1 + ] , [ K x e1 ]  Loosing the queen and the only hope to get back I finally resigned...
 [ N e7 ] , [ R b d1 ]  CM: "Disengages the pin on White's pawn at [ d5 ] and moves it behind the passed pawn at d5." Despite what Chessmaster says the pin stands.
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ B b5 ]  3. [ B b5 ] - I will see how Ion copes with The Spanish Torture.
 [ g x f3 ] , [ Q f8 ]  Black neutralises the threat of [ Q h6 ] but perhaps this could have been delayed till White was committed?
 [ N x c6 ]  [ d x c6 ] , [ N e5 ]  White establishes an outpost on [ g6 ] and black must be very careful to avoid dropping the exchange.
 [ Q e2 ] , [ N d3 + ]  That is a very snug home for the knight and makes development of the bishop even harder whilst simultaneously continuing the attack.
 [ d x c5 ]  [ Q x f4 ]  [ b4 ] , [ N x e5 ]  I had to be prepared to throw one pawn away and I had to decide which. All this while I had hoped for an opportunity to execute a "cheap" trick of [ B c2 ] followed by [ Q d3 ] for a mate threat. Of course against a player of this caliber he'd have seen it miles away.
 [ N x d5 ]  [ B e6 ] , [ N x c7 + ]  Another mistake by Black allows me to take a pawn and make this move. A better move might have been [ B d6 ] to protect that space until he could move the other pieces (mostly the knight that blocks the rook) to prevent this move.
 [ N c3 ] , [ a6 ]  Ok blocks my knight or I go in through a4-[ b6 ] but... to where? I dind't find it a great plan. So the best plan maybe was [ K d7 ] and push the central pawns [ e4 ] f4... but I feared to get only a blocked center or worse an open column it was not completely clear to whom would have been an advantage to. So I went to another direction among the many possible (e. g. o-o-o): [ b4 ] pushing and try to get advantage of the weakness of his 7º rank due to the bad collocation of his pieces. This one I eventually reached but probably a move too late since I played the knight in order to go e2-[ f4 ] to support an incursion in [ g6 ] either by the bishop or the knight. Another plan...
 [ Q f5 ] , [ R g1 ]  26. Rg1. Here is the defining moment. Can B afford the time to free his Queen with Qb5? It certainly allows the Queen the escape valve she needs plus maybe one or two spite checks on the W King. But I wanted to allow that finally because I had some serious fire-power trained on B's King-side now. B's King looks very vulnerable between the Rook h-Pawn and all the minor pieces aiming at that corner.
 [ R d4 ] , [ B b5 ]  Securing the B in a safe spot.
 [ N d3 ]  [ R c2 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ b4 ]  [ R a c8 ] , [ N f4 ]  Perhaps a good change for White giving the circumstances this Knight protecting c-file is a nightmare for the Rook on [ c2 ]  [ N x f4 ] , [ e x f4 ]  It's very risky considering the pass pawn and a half-open-e-file supported by the B-Queen. In the other hand the change of Black e-pawn could give value to the Bishop on both the a2-[ g8 ] or h3-[ c8 ] diagonals and to the Black Knight if placed on [ e4 ]  [ R c6 ] , [ R e1 ]  White seems to forget c-file thinking on not-yet-open e-file but perhaps the following positional dialogue is interesting
 [ Q f4 + ]  [ K h1 ] , [ K x d6 ]  41. ....... [ K x d6 ] - after this capture provided I do not lose or move my pawns or lose my rook it is now down to the 50 move rule. If the pawns stay in the same place and my rook is still on the board and Henry is not about to be murdered by the Witch then on Move 91 I can claim a draw.
 [ Q g6 ] , [ b3 ]  to give pass to my B
 [ B x g7 ] , [ c3 ]  planning [ d4 ] to control the center
 [ N d3 + ] , [ K d1 ]  Now my king is in the middle of the board too. But the knight isn't pinned any more.
 [ a6 ] , [ N a3 ]  I still do not understand Carlsen's ideas. He clearly played so much better and have much more comfortable positions when he took Caruana out of his home preparation. So why continue to go to the Lion's den and poke at the Lion? 🦁
 [ N x g4 ]  [ B e6 + ]  [ K c6 ]  [ B x g4 ] , [ B g7 ]  I find this move to be the most logical follow up and probably will end up being the main line during this tournament. It takes advantage of blacks [ g7 ] move early in this game.
 [ Q c7 ] , [ R c4 ]  The computer much prefers that white pile up on the doubled a-pawns with 25. Rfa1. But I think seizing the c-file puts the same cramp on black's queen side and gives me a way to launch an attack on the other wing too.
 [ a5 ]  [ K a1 ]  [ N e5 ] , [ R e f1 ]  22. [ R f1 ] - to guard the f pawn.
 [ N h2 ] , [ Q d6 ]  Breaking the pin centralizing the Q and positioning it to help guard [ h6 ] in some variations. Threats along the c-file now also favor Black.
 [ Q e7 ]  [ O-O ]  [ b5 ] , [ B b3 ]  I don't want to go to [ c2 ] yet. I wanted to attack Black's weakened a2-[ g8 ] diagonal.
 [ B d5 ] , [ N x e4 ]  Computer actually prefers [ R d1 ] but both moves seem good to me.
 [ B g7 ] , [ f3 ]  With this move we come to position known as Yugoslav Attack(old name Rauzer Attack) white has long castle and a pawn storm in his mind on kingside. Less common replies in use here are 7...[ N c6 ] and 7...a6(which are sometimes called anti-rauzer cause black delays castling counting on other benefits like first bringing pieces on queenside where white intends to castle).
 [ d x e5 ]  [ f x e4 ] , [ N g5 ]  This Knight will be hard to drive. Also Black must be wary of White's threatened Q-R5ch.
 [ d x c4 ] , [ d5 ]  ?? I think Jkarp saw the discovery attack on my queen but of course the queen has an escape.
 [ e x d4 ] , [ Q x d4 ]  My queen was brought out into battle too early from my perspective in retrospect
 [ N f3 ] , [ e5 ]  I think white's plan here was to try to get his knight to attack the pinned black rook. But it has no path to get there that isn't covered by black's bishops or pawns. The route via [ h5 ] to [ f6 ] will still take a full 5 moves to achieve during which time black's DSB will find a way to [ e7 ] and shut white down.
 [ Q d2 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ f3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O-O ] , [ c5 ]  A pawn push often made by weak players. Here it's definitely a blunder.
 [ B d5 + ]  [ K d7 ] , [ c3 ]  Trying to advance the pawns.
 [ R f3 + ]  [ K d4 ]  [ R x h3 ] , [ a4 ]  I wanted to preclude [ b6 ] to the black king with [ a6 ] even if it will cost me another pawn. But I miss a tempo to open a way for my king to advance after [ R x g4 + ] - shortly coming.
 [ R e7 ]  [ R c6 ]  [ g4 ]  [ R c3 ]  [ R g7 ]  [ R g3 ] , [ K h7 ]  The knight can not participate in attacking the rook because of the a pawn.
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ c4 ] , [ b6 ]  Not a very good move since it doesn't support the [ d5 ] pawn.
 [ a3 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ B a5 ]  [ b4 ]  [ B b6 ] , [ N a4 ]  ? Not paying attention to black's threats against [ d4 ] and a3. [ a4 ] was better.
 [ d4 ]  [ f5 ]  [ e3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ c4 ]  [ d6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ c6 ]  Up to this point we have been playing a reasonably normal dutch defense opening although I found it is rather uncommon that white does not fianchetto on [ g2 ] developing the bishop on [ d3 ] is by no means bad. I play [ c6 ] here to reinforce control of [ d5 ] but since [ e7 ] is often a weakness in the Dutch defense it may have been better to prioritize on preparing for [ e5 ]  [ f x e4 ]  [ N x e4 ] , [ d5 ]  chases the knight away from its active square but has the downside of make the situation of the e-pawn even more problematic.
 [ b x c3 ]  [ N c5 ]  [ Q x e7 + ]  [ N x e7 ]  [ N g5 ]  [ R g8 ]  [ B x f4 ] , [ K d7 ]  I didn't rush into defending my pawns because I felt I could recover them while gaining more ground as can be seen the next few moves.
 [ N f3 ] , [ N x f3 + ]  but mk decided to help me here.
 [ R d8 + ] , [ K g7 ]  So white tried a desperation check but to no avail. He is now out of checks (other than the suicidal 36. Rg8+) and all of black's threats remain. In fact after black plays 35. ... [ K g7 ] he announces checkmate in 3.
 [ N x f5 + ] , [ B x f5 ]  he resigned in this position. I could not believe won when losing by a queen.
 [ R x e2 ] , [ Q f6 ]  Marking the end of the middle game phase and beginning the 'early end game' phase. Almost 70 moves remain to this game and it might even have been longer but keep reading. There will be further points of interest along the way...
 [ O-O ]  [ d4 ]  [ N d7 ] , [ Q e2 ]  White is looking like winning a pawn by [ c4 ]  [ c4 ]  [ N d5 b6 ] , [ h4 ]  ! White starts to open up Kingside
 [ Q c7 ] , [ Q h5 ]  I at first not like this move but due to bad calculate on my part I fail to see real threat. It turn out it really is a good move. I only see the weak 2 rank due to the queen come out. I not see how bad my kingside become.
 [ b x c4 ] , [ b x c4 ]  Now I have a passed QBP.
 [ Q x e5 ] , [ f3 ]  Attacking the pinned piece
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ] , [ c3 ]  My preferred system versus the sicilian
 [ K e2 ] , [ Q d4 ]  ...and white is lost. I'll check it... thank you for reading. Hope you had some fun at least.
 [ R c8 ] , [ B d2 ]  kicks R out of white's side of the board.
 [ K e3 ]  [ d4 + ]  [ K e4 ]  [ R e6 ] , [ f7 ]  ...and the game is over! Good fight! My opponent was about 1300 ELO rated. I think he played well above this rating. What do you think?
 [ B x a6 ]  [ R x a6 ]  [ b3 ]  [ B f6 ]  [ R f e1 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ Q f5 ]  [ R a8 ]  [ K f1 ]  [ R x e1 + ]  [ R x e1 ] , [ Q c8 ]  another option was g6...
 [ O-O ] , [ b6 ]  Presuambly a bit worried about castling kingside with the [ [ f6 ] ] knight kicked and pieces pointing that way. It's still ok to castle (8...O-O 9. Bxh7+? KxB 10. NxB+ BxN 11. [ Q h5 + ] [ B h6 ] - the Greek gift doesn't work) provided care is taken. Black can go for an [ [ f6 ] ] break straight after. The text is a bit slow.
 [ O-O ]  [ B e5 ] , [ B g5 ]  a feeble pin.
 [ K c6 ]  [ R b5 ]  [ N d6 ] , [ R e5 ]  Exchanging Rooks on the 2nd rank is no longer an option but an exchange on the fifth rank can now be forced. After reveiwing the board I decided that his h pawn could be handled.
 [ a4 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ B x f7 + ]  [ R x f7 ]  [ N x e4 ] , [ d5 ]  10. ..... [ d5 ] - after a wacko last 3 moves I now get an established central pawn.
 [ a6 ] , [ h4 ]  The overextended g-pawn has to be supported. Such is the trade off for super sonic pawn moves like this. In the end I banking the hope that black feel constantly under pressure and never has time to implement his own ideas. Just is in the blitzkrieg tactic it's major drawback is that the force can advance beyond it's supply lines. This leaves the front most troops vulnerable to attack on the flanks and rear. The end result is you cut off and surrounded.
 [ B x f6 ]  [ g x f6 ] , [ Q h5 ]  ?! - such a risk - White is hoping for 10...[ B x c3 + ] 11. [ b x c3 ] [ Q x c3 + ] 12. [ K e2 ] Qxa1?? 13. Qf7#.
 [ h x g4 ]  [ B x g4 ] , [ Q g2 ]  figured the next move would be h5.......
 [ N x d4 ] , [ Q x f7 + ]  Wow I had expected black to protect [ f7 ] not to gobble a free pawn. 16. ... [ R f8 ] was probably best. 16. ... [ R e7 ] loses at least a pawn since after 18 [ Q x c7 ] black cannot play [ N x d4 ] because of 19 [ N x d4 ] and now if 19 [ Q x d4 ] 20 [ Q d8 ] loses black's rook. But [ N x d4 ] was not the best solution. Turns out 13. ...[ h6 ] saved black's life but he decided he had had enough at this point.
 [ N x f3 + ] , [ N x f3 ]  Black's knight has achieved nothing other than allowing itself to be exchanged for a knight that was effectively already out of the game. A very good counter by white.
 [ K f2 ]  [ f3 ]  [ K g1 ]  [ K g3 ]  [ K f1 ] , [ f2 ]  53.......... [ f2 ] - the killer - the white king has only 1 legal move - e2.
 [ O-O-O ] , [ R a e8 ]  Making more power on the e-file and defending the isolated e-pawn.
 [ Q h5 + ]  [ K e7 ] , [ d4 ]  Sacrificing a Pawn to open the line for B-N5ch.
 [ N c4 ]  [ Q c3 ]  [ N x a5 ] , [ N f6 ]  Headed to g4. From there this knight can hold white largely at bay on the kingside.
 [ B x f7 ] , [ e x d3 ]  17. ..... exd3! - He took the bait and now I open up the e file and Glenda who is seemingly minding her own business on [ e7 ] is up to summat. What do you think she is stirring up in her cauldron? What square would she just lurve to land on?
 [ a5 ]  [ K g5 ]  [ B x d4 ] , [ c1 = Q + ]  44. ...... c1/Q+ - Glenda makes a brief appearance to drag the WK one square up the board and make him lose a vital tempo.
 [ c6 ] , [ d5 ]  !?
 [ c4 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ e6 ]  black start with a rather unusual moves and it looks like they are loosing the center
 [ c4 ] , [ g6 ]  This time Alex decides to play 2..[ g6 ] instead of 2..e6.
 [ K x b5 ] , [ B x c6 + ]  I think there are better moves than this but I saw a tactical shot that I couldn't resist...
 [ Q b5 + ]  [ B d7 ]  [ Q x b7 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ a4 ]  [ N a5 ]  [ Q a6 ]  [ B b4 ]  [ B d2 ]  [ O-O ] , [ N e5 ]  
 [ b x a4 ] , [ c3 ]  I got greedy -- why not try to hold on to the pawn ?
 [ R c5 ]  [ f6 ]  [ R a5 ]  [ R d4 ]  [ R a7 + ] , [ B d7 ]  Attack and riposte.
 [ a3 ] , [ K g8 ]  preparing the attack by avoiding a check on [ h8 ] diagonal.
 [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ] , [ e6 ]  2...[ d5 ] would have been favourable for white in view of 3.cx[ d5 ] Nx[ d5 ] 4.e4.
 [ h4 ] , [ f5 ]  Consistent but merely weakening Black's defences further.
 [ N x d4 ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ Q x d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ g6 ] , [ B g5 ]  So far white has played very well how did he lose from here?
 [ K e8 ] , [ e6 ]  Black is lost. If ...BxP the piece is lost and the king is exposed to a withering attack. If the bishop retreats [ Q d8 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ d4 ]  [ e x d4 ] , [ B g5 ]  White has a few stronger moves than the Bg5. White could have taken strong control over the center with [ N x d4 ] or created some additional attacking options with Bc4. This bishop move allows Black to move to the offensive.
 [ c x d4 ] , [ c x d4 ]  15. N[ e x d4 ] was much better. I don't know what I was thinking when I played 15. cxd4. Temporary insanity! At least I hope its temporary!
 [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ] , [ e6 ]  The game began with an Indian Defense response from my opponent.
 [ Q f2 ]  [ R a8 ]  [ h4 ]  [ Q h5 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ Q h6 ]  [ e5 ] , [ N e4 ]  Black's knight forks my bishop and queen; what to do? Seeing pending knight forks is something I really need to work on!
 [ b x c3 ] , [ b x c3 ]  isolated and weak but he is forced to give full attention.
 [ K b1 ]  [ Q x f7 ]  [ R g3 x g7 ]  [ Q x g7 ]  [ R x g7 ]  [ K x g7 ]  [ f6 + ]  [ K x f6 ]  [ Q x h6 + ]  [ K e7 ]  [ Q g7 + ]  [ K d6 ]  [ h6 ]  [ R b8 ]  [ h7 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ Q f6 ]  [ K d7 ]  [ Q g7 + ]  [ K d6 ]  [ Q g1 ]  [ a4 ]  [ h8 = Q ]  [ R x h8 ]  [ K x b2 ]  [ R h3 ]  [ Q e1 ]  [ a3 + ]  [ K a1 ]  [ K c6 ]  [ Q f1 ]  [ K b6 ]  [ K b1 ]  [ K a5 ] , [ Q e1 + ]  We are still at this point even in the material world but working against a Queen with multiple pieces is always a touchy endeavor. The Queen needs space to maneuver and my pieces need to be where the Queen is limited in movement. I can also use my King to ensure this...
 [ N b4 ] , [ N g f5 ]  No point rushing in with 36. ... [ N d1 + ] when I have to fear [ N d5 + ] and the loss of my f-pawn.
 [ R b6 ]  [ b3 ]  [ K c7 ] , [ N e7 ]  Oops 25. ... Kc7? loses the exchange. This one wasn't hindsight either.
 [ Q x f8 + ]  [ K h7 ]  [ Q f7 + ]  [ K h8 ] , [ Q f6 + ]  force black to exchange ladies
 [ e5 ]  [ N x f7 ]  [ e x d6 + ]  [ K x d6 ]  [ R f6 + ]  [ K d5 ] , [ N x f7 ]  Finally Nakamura regains material also leaving Andreiksen's king exposed.
 [ N c3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ d3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ N g e2 ]  Clearly a pre-prepared move I hadn't faced this before. I would normally expect [ N f3 ] or [ B g5 ] but as the game develops it becomes clear why white chose this. Looking through variations now [ N g4 ] looks interesting. If 1) 6. [ d4 ] ex[ d4 ] 7. [ N a4 ] with a small advantage to black 2) 6. 0-0 [ Q h4 ] (possible since knight isn't on f3) 7. [ h3 ] (avoiding # on h2) [ N x f2 ] looks pretty good for black since black is going to have to give up the exchange
 [ Q c8 ] , [ Q e3 ]  Here i simply put up the dangerous future trap of Bxh6. That's the second reason....[ h6 ] does both surrender a tempo and weaken blacks kingside. Of course white's e-pawn looks a little uncomfortable.
 [ f4 ]  [ R g2 ]  [ B x h3 ]  [ R h2 ]  [ Q g4 + ]  [ K h1 ]  [ Q f3 + ]  [ K g1 ] , [ R f6 ]  and despite the fact that the obviously threatened ...[ R g6 ] doesn't work yet due to [ B x g6 ] White resigned. I was planning ... [ N f5 ] next which should have been good enough.
 [ h x g4 ]  [ Q e6 ]  [ K h3 ]  [ Q h6 + ]  [ K g2 ] , [ R g6 ]  Interestingly enough black didn't take [ e3 ] inmediately: QxR [ Q e2 + ] and it's not for a blitz game to see if it wins even if I suspect it does for black.
 [ Q g5 ] , [ R a b1 ]  planning on doubling up my rooks on the b file to attack b7.
 [ g5 ]  [ Q e3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ Q c3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ Q c4 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ Q a4 ] , [ N d7 ]  Black becomes aware of the fact that his defense has been weakened too much and retreats with his knight to add protection to the b8-square.
 [ B x d1 ] , [ R x d1 ]  the only try for any sort of advantage
 [ f3 + ]  [ K g3 ] , [ R d g8 ]  It comes tactics. [ K x g4 ] [ B h5 + + ] followed later by f2... still not an insurance!
 [ N f3 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ c3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ b4 ]  [ B b6 ] , [ a4 ]  7. [ a4 ] - thee has been a series of pawn pushing. I see the sense in this pawn roll though. Chris is trying to trap Gerhard's dsb.
 [ N f6 ]  [ d4 ] , [ d5 ]  3. ... [ N f6 ] 4.[ d4 ] d5?! This was a very pleasant surprise to me because it should lead to White’s domination of the center. A better move was 4…cx[ d4 ] which leads to conventional variations.
 [ R e3 ]  [ R x e3 + ]  [ K x e3 ] , [ a5 ]  Holding back both the a and b pawns.
 [ O-O ] , [ f4 ]  Didn't see this one coming but it fits our vision to always play for a win.. I'm not sure how this attack would work but it'll be interesting to see how he pulls it off. I think adding more pawns to the attack is too dangerous but probably neccesary if you go all-out. His king has already become quite a bit more vulnerable now though. I think it was better for white to just develop and play some positional chess ( though that's the type of chess he dislikes and I'm best at ). It's not quite clear how black should proceed from here.
 [ N c6 ]  [ R a d1 ]  [ R a d8 ]  [ R d e1 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ R e d1 ]  [ N x b3 ] , [ c x b3 ]  My thought here is that I am a pawn ahead with a better pawn structure as well.
 [ B b7 ] , [ N c2 ]  Preparing to win a pawn by starting a bloodbath in the center.
 [ B d6 ] , [ Q a7 ]  According to Chessmaster8000 this was the only mistake I had made thus far. Still I hardly saw it as a mistake and had thought I had many small errors further back. I eventually moved my queen back to [ d4 ] after his [ c1 ] rook attacked. I sought to further defend the 7th rank as well as my rook.
 [ h3 ]  [ N g x e5 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ R x e5 ]  [ d6 ] , [ Q f3 ]  Threatens to flush the king from his home all the way to a vulnerable position on the queenside he cannot have that
 [ O-O-O ] , [ a3 ]  Now white needs to
 [ N c3 ]  [ B b4 ]  [ B g5 ] , [ B b7 ]  5. ...... [ B b7 ] - completing the fianchetto.
 [ B x g4 ] , [ d3 ]  Not sure what that move was supposed to accomplish
 [ K e6 ]  [ Q e8 + ]  [ K f5 ]  [ Q e5 + ]  [ K g6 ]  [ Q e4 + ]  [ K h5 ]  [ Q h4 + ]  [ K g6 ] , [ Q e4 + ]  I can keep this up forever.
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ g3 ]  Then from here I notice that he will not use that attack....
 [ N b4 ]  [ a3 ] , [ B x f3 ]  The right move doubling White's pawns. White might have played 7. Be2.
 [ R a c1 ] , [ b5 ]  !
 [ B x f5 ]  [ N f8 ] , [ Q h6 ]  Cobo's defences are crumbling fast.
 [ R e8 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ K g7 ]  [ B f3 ] , [ a5 ]  ! Black has only one real area of opportunity so he presses it. The [ N b8 ] now has a square to develop to. The next sequence of moves turns out to be pretty advantageous to black. There are 12 exchanges over the next 9 moves that brings black right back into the game. In replaying this game I simply can't believe how I let such a promising position get flushed right down the toilet. Many congratulations to ricardopr for engineering the bloodbath which follows! It really is pretty awesome......
 [ O-O-O ] , [ K g7 ]  good move to decrease the movement capability of whites queen.
 [ N h4 ]  [ Q h6 ] , [ N h f3 ]  a stupid attempt... to lose a tempo
 [ B c4 ]  [ R b8 ]  [ R f b1 ]  [ b3 ]  [ c x b3 ] , [ a x b3 ]  Black has given me a passed pawn on the a file. Now I just have to keep it.
 [ N x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ] , [ Q x d5 ]  He exchanges knights to bring my queen out early
 [ K d4 ]  [ c5 + ]  [ K c3 ] , [ N f6 ]  [ N f8 ] may have worked a bit better though it sounds strange by virtue of allowing h6. Of course if white responds with [ h4 ] preventing [ [ g5 ] ] from black black still needs to bring his king to the KS to support [ [ g5 ] ] but since white can't really progress his king regardless this plan may actually be fine.
 [ f x e5 ] , [ Q d4 + ]  whatever the odds [ Q c6 ] [ N x d7 + ] [ K e7 ] [ N f6 ] [ R x g7 ] [ R h3 ] [ R x g5 + ] [ B x g5 ] [ B x g5 ] looks more promising...
 [ B b6 ]  [ B b2 ] , [ d6 ]  and my bishop is free at last
 [ d3 ]  [ B d6 ] , [ h3 ]  Play this only if forced to and better as a response than profilactic... anyway it's in white's agenda.
 [ e5 ]  [ B x c6 ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ B x b7 ] , [ d x c3 ]  And the thing I thought would work better is. . . sacrifice my rook for a knight?! I'm now looking at a larger picture after losing my rook I can take the pawn at [ b2 ] threatening promotion and white's rook
 [ f x g5 ]  [ R x f8 + ]  [ K x g7 ] , [ Q f2 ]  The essential move in the combination.
 [ Q c4 ] , [ B x d2 ]  Because of White's dubious move I eliminated White's bishop.
 [ K f3 ] , [ f4 ]  to open some lines or to support the e pawn it all depends on white's reply
 [ B e3 ]  [ Q e7 ] , [ N c3 ]  you see now White's position is pretty good whereas Black's positoin is weeping his kingside is totally packed specailly his pieces do not finding good squares to go Black can castle long but he cannot do it so early as [ [ a7 ] ] pawn will hang plus white queen can threat any unwanted attack going to [ [ a7 ] ] and a8.
 [ N e8 ] , [ R x b7 ]  Winning a second pawn.
 [ B x d3 ]  [ Q x d3 ]  [ R e8 ] , [ a3 ]  challenging the black squared bishop. will he take or move?
 [ N e7 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ N f5 ]  [ B x f5 ]  [ e x f5 ]  [ b3 ]  [ a x b3 ]  [ Q x b3 ]  [ f4 ]  [ B d2 ]  [ B c8 ]  [ a4 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ d5 ]  [ c x d5 ] , [ Q x b5 + ]  I was considering [ N x d5 ] with exchanges but the Q move seemed the best
 [ K c7 ]  [ K a4 ]  [ N f7 ]  [ K b4 ] , [ N d8 ]  ! Still protecting [ f7 ] and preparing to throw a check if needed.
 [ c3 ] , [ d6 ]  The usual move here is 4. ...d5. The text is solid enough but passive.
 [ B d7 ]  [ R d1 ] , [ B b5 ]  !
 [ R e8 ] , [ N h5 ]  This will do! The beauty of it is [ g7 ] is undefendable due to [ R g8 ] [ N f6 ] !! Black is forced to take the pawn and I win 2 pawns for it to go 2 pawns up.
 [ e6 ] , [ e4 ]  at this point im thinking about getting one of those center pawns to the 5th rank
 [ a6 ] , [ R x d5 ]  ! Now the pawn can be taken with devasting effect.
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ] , [ B c4 ]  I like [ d6 ] as the black response. Makes it much easier for me.....
 [ B b3 ]  [ B e6 ] , [ R e1 ]  must play [ N d2 ] an free the queen side rook.
 [ R c8 + ]  [ Q d8 ] , [ Q f7 # ]  
 [ Q d3 ]  [ a6 ]  [ O-O-O ]  [ B e7 ]  [ g3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ f4 ]  [ Q c7 ] , [ B h3 ]  The obvious one was [ B g2 ] but it didn't give me any attack. The game is lost so I have to surprise my opponent. I am without any hope of course.
 [ N b8 ]  [ N f4 ]  [ Q d7 ] , [ O-O ]  The logical continuation was 16.[ c4 ] putting more pressure on those central pawns. Nothing wrong with 16.0-0 though.
 [ B e3 ]  [ R f d8 ]  [ R d3 ] , [ N d6 ]  Black is not quite ready to exchange rooks especially at the cost of fixing most of white's pawn troubles.
 [ O-O ]  [ O-O ] , [ B x c3 ]  Oops ! thrice a bishop move but making double pawns.
 [ f4 ] , [ R e d5 ]  28...[ R e4 ] 29.[ N x f5 ] [ R x f4 ] wins a pawn!
 [ R f3 ] , [ R b1 ]  I move back to attack b3!
 [ B x f8 ]  [ R e x f8 ]  [ K g1 ]  [ h6 ]  [ b3 ] , [ B c6 ]  I like my pawn structure at the moment.
 [ O-O ] , [ R a d8 ]  black can even play the sacrifice [ B x h3 ] here as white is so poorly developed
 [ K e3 ]  [ g5 ] , [ f4 ]  Also drawing was 50. [ g4 ] fixing the g pawn on a dark square so Black's bishop cannot defend it
 [ g4 ]  [ B x a4 ]  [ N x a4 ] , [ R x a4 ]  I didn't expect the knight-for-bishop trade while black is suffering such a pawn deficit. However it does eliminate my light-colored bishop who after eating the pawn at [ a4 ] was covering [ e8 ] where that pawn wants to promote.
 [ c4 ] , [ g5 ]  I need space! So I sacrifice a pawn hoping for open lines I can use.
 [ g x f3 ] , [ Q x f3 ]  I had thought this was a mistake considering that there was no way for Black to meet White's threat of winning the pinned Bishop - other than by going in for the perpetual check after the White queen moves (with ...[ Q d1 ] and ...[ Q g4 ] ) something I was perfectly content with given my positional difficulties.
 [ R f8 ] , [ Q f3 ]  Yes I see the check.
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ] , [ e x d5 ]  The French exchange variation which leads quite often to a draw (37% according to the GameKnot "World" database).
 [ N f3 ] , [ d6 ]  4...[ [ d5 ] ] is better - this move wastes a tempo since Black will want to play ...[ [ d5 ] ] at some point anyway.
 [ e3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ N e4 ]  A second move with the Knight forces me to be trade dark square Bishops but I've found that is usually good for White in the QGD.
 [ d6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d5 ] , [ e5 ]  I played [ e6 ] to get some asvantage (I think).
 [ B x b7 ] , [ R a b8 ]  ? It's very understandable why Sue moved here. But the problem is that it loses yet another pawn. Best was 10...[ R a7 ] and not only is the pawn protected but my B is attacked. So she does get tempo in return.
 [ B f7 + ]  [ K d8 ] , [ N c4 ]  Attacks the queen and moves a piece closer to the BK
 [ R a1 ]  [ R x c2 ]  [ Q x c2 ] , [ R c8 ]  The only advantage black can get but...
 [ N d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ e3 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ B x d4 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ c4 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N c3 ] , [ c5 ]  No place to retreat the bishop so I'll have to trade it off. Hate to do that.
 [ c x b5 ] , [ c x b5 ]  I believe now this game can end in a draw
 [ b6 ] , [ B x c5 ]  Dangerous - it gives him attacking chances but I played this out a few times and think I can hold onto the pawn
 [ N f3 ]  [ a4 ]  [ N g5 ] , [ O-O ]  Here my opponent realized the danger and castled kingside which is even more dangerious.
 [ K c7 ] , [ N a6 + ]  It's bad to threaten my bishop with [ K a6 ] because the simple [ B c3 ] retreat wins immediately since [ K a7 ] is the only move that defends the knight then [ B d4 ] wins the knight.
 [ N x c7 + ]  [ K d7 ] , [ Q x f7 ]  He resigned here.
 [ R f c8 ]  [ Q e3 ]  [ K f7 ]  [ h3 ]  [ a6 ] , [ R c c1 ]  A Queen based structure
 [ R f8 ] , [ Q h5 ]  Was tempted to do [ Q e3 ] but this puts more pressure on the king's castled position.
 [ d4 ]  [ N b1 ]  [ B e7 ] , [ d3 ]  I was interested to see that you chose not to castle. I thought about moving my bishop [ e2 ] to [ c4 ] as you left a lovely gap. However In thought better of it since my black bishop and b knight were still hemmed in. I will continue to develop before attacking
 [ Q h6 ] , [ R f g8 ]  Also necessary.
 [ a6 ]  [ B x c6 ] , [ d x c6 ]  Exchange variation. It is quite good OTB (over the board) as black can generate lots of threats
 [ R f2 ] , [ Q e6 ]  ...Her Royal Highness.
 [ e4 ]  [ g6 ] , [ B c4 ]  White's plan is to solidly play in the center and avoid to much complications in the opening. Evan more solid would have been to first develop a knight.
 [ d4 ]  [ e x d4 ] , [ c x d4 ]  The last two moves leading up to this capture are good moves by white. White can now exert influence into the center without pawns in the way.
 [ b4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ B b2 ]  [ B x b4 ]  [ B x e5 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ e3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ c5 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B b2 ] , [ R e8 ]  All the games begin here.
 [ Q h6 ] , [ Q c3 ]  Now for some reason I think about attacking the defended bishop to keep black's queen from taking my [ f4 ] pawn. I didn't give 28....[ f6 ] any thought whatsoever.
 [ g5 ]  [ h3 ]  [ h5 ]  [ g3 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ N x d5 ] , [ B x d5 + ]  The Bishop pair already exerting their influence across the board
 [ B e3 ]  [ B b4 + ]  [ N b d2 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B d3 ] , [ d6 ]  but the [ c8 ] bishop is not in the game. by that diference white has a great center.
 [ B e6 ] , [ B f4 ]  The fight for the [ e5 ] point has begun and whiteh will immobilise all his forces for this
 [ R e3 ]  [ N d7 ] , [ N e5 ]  Exchanging off the liability.
 [ B x g7 ]  [ R g8 ] , [ R b1 ]  17. [ R b1 ] - after this move there are just too many black pieces en prise and not enough white! After a final tot up I saw that there was no way I could avoid being a piece light so I decided there and then to wave the white flag.
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N b d7 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ d5 ]  [ B e7 ] , [ b4 ]  ? I wanted to stop [ N c5 ] .
 [ K f5 ]  [ R x h5 + ]  [ K f4 ]  [ d4 ] , [ g3 ]  Black has nothing.
 [ Q x h5 ]  [ B x h5 ] , [ N x g5 ]  So now I've lost my knight and sacrificed a bishop (for two pawns) and while black's kingside is demolished the only troops I've got over there are a bishop.
 [ O-O ] , [ N a4 ]  ! The knight is headed for [ c5 ] and it can;t be stopped. That was what 13.[ N x c6 ] achieved for White - there are no pawns to chase the knight away
 [ R g3 + ] , [ K f8 ]  The computer analysis of King to [ h8 ] shows a better outcome with [ f8 ] I leave my rook on [ a8 ] unprotected.
 [ N d4 ]  [ O-O ] , [ N x e2 + ]  I'm not sure how this exchange helps Blacks position. The bishop was doing very little.
 [ N e5 ] , [ N d6 ]  Uh-oh. So easy to see it now... :-(
 [ B g5 ]  [ N h5 ] , [ B c2 ]  Now [ d4 ] is a threat
 [ B f6 ]  [ R h1 ]  [ K f7 ] , [ B h5 + ]  Freeing the B with a check.
 [ Q c2 ]  [ d6 ]  [ a3 ]  [ B x c3 + ] , [ Q x c3 ]  So now the position is getting closer to the one I had calculated. I just need to prepare the [ e5 ] break to challenge the centre and then I'm happy.
 [ N x b7 ]  [ Q b6 ] , [ N c5 ]  First he takes the pawn then he attacks the bishop.
 [ d5 ]  [ c4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B b4 ]  [ B d2 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ a3 ] , [ B d6 ]  This was a odd move. perhaps the bishop should have gone to [ e7 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ h3 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ B x e7 ]  [ Q x e7 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ e3 ]  [ c5 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ Q c5 ]  [ Q d6 ] , [ Q a5 + ]  Here i think black made well to not to exchange queens because [ d6 ] pawn could be dangerous.
 [ N b d7 ]  [ R a c1 ]  [ R c8 ] , [ R c2 ]  I want to double my rooks then rip up the c file.
 [ b3 ]  [ Q b5 ]  [ c4 ] , [ Q a6 ]  As now I have a solid pawn chain from a2-c4. That was also the idea behind attacking the Q.
 [ B x d3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c5 ]  [ K c7 ]  [ b4 ]  [ N h5 ]  [ R h1 ]  [ N g3 ]  [ R g1 ]  [ N f5 ]  [ f4 ]  [ h5 ]  [ K d2 ]  [ g6 ]  [ a4 ]  [ R d b8 ]  [ R c1 ]  [ h4 ]  [ K e1 ]  [ h3 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ h2 ]  [ B f3 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ B h1 ] , [ b6 ]  DOH! 40. [ N a3 ] costs my rook for a knight
 [ Q d2 ]  [ K g2 ]  [ Q x c2 ]  [ Q x a7 ]  [ Q c6 + ]  [ K h2 ]  [ Q f3 ]  [ Q b7 ]  [ Q x f2 + ] , [ Q g2 ]  
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ g3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ B g2 ]  [ c6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N b d7 ]  [ Q c2 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ N b d2 ] , [ b6 ]  All the games start here.
 [ f5 ]  [ N g3 ]  [ Q h6 ] , [ K g1 ]  27. [ K [ g1 ] ] - Henry must go back to [ g1 ] to protect the [ h2 ] pawn.
 [ a3 ] , [ B x h6 + ]  That pawn on [ a3 ] isn't going anywhere soon so there is no reason to break up a defensible pawn structure with bxa3. Time to gobble a little more material with a little zwischenzug.
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ N f6 ]  Petrov defence. I always found that taking the pawn result in a good position for white
 [ g3 ] , [ h3 ]  ?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?
 [ K x d5 ]  [ R x e4 ] , [ K x e4 ]  At this stage black has good drawing chances as his king is very centralized.
 [ R x f7 ]  [ B x f7 ]  [ Q x f7 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ h6 ]  [ h4 ] , [ h x g5 ]  not good: Black is trying to force his way into Whites' position...
 [ N x f3 + ] , [ g x f3 ]  Now the menace of [ B h3 ] and [ Q g5 ] is here to stay.
 [ N c4 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ b3 ]  [ N a3 + ] , [ K d3 ]  Check is not always the best thing. Black's king is actually better positioned now so if white DOES manage to sneak his king in and get both pawns black can quickly get his king to the other side of the board and start capturing pawns. Playing back and forth between the left and right is an important part of the endgame.
 [ e x f6 ]  [ e ] , [ p ]  Best is Qd2... Black can no longer play [ d5 ] due to Nc3...
 [ R a6 ] , [ R c3 ]  Rook goes behind the passer naturally enough...
 [ e5 ] , [ B e7 ]  Black chooses to lose his knight. Moving his bishop was a good choice because it allows the d-pawn to move.
 [ R c1 ] , [ R b8 ]  Perhaps dreaming of breaking with [ b5 ] at some stage?
 [ e x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ] , [ c x d5 ]  OK the trade is over ! White's knight can hardly be fired. White has developpement advance but has not castled and his king is weak.
 [ B x e4 ] , [ f x e4 ]  After the game my opponent mentioned he expected [ c x b4 ] followed by [ B x c6 ] [ d x c6 ] and axb4. That looks ok but this looks better with a promising open f-file.
 [ e6 ]  [ Q e2 ] , [ N b6 ]  Preparing to drive the advanced White Knight.
 [ B x g5 ]  [ f x g5 ] , [ N e3 ]  I'm not sure why he didn't play Nxb4. Maybe he's hoping he can check me on [ c1 ] and eventually win my bishop. I plotted out the course after 45. [ B x e3 ] [ R x e3 ] 46. [ e6 + ] [ R x e6 ] 47 [ R x e6 ] [ K x e6 ] several times. It looks like I can get his last two kingside pawns while he chases down the b-pawn and I can queen a pawn but maybe he plays 46. ... [ K e7 ] to just block that pawn instead of capturing it. I think I can do it but then I found an easier way.
 [ Q b2 ] , [ N c4 ]  After the game I realized that I was able to play right away 24. ... [ R x e2 + ] 25. [ Q x e2 ] [ R c1 + ] 26. [ Q d1 ] [ R x d1 # ]  [ e4 ]  [ c5 ] , [ d4 ]  I would've played 2.[ N f3 ] because that's what I'm most used to as I like the open variation. But I'm very used to the Morra Gambit as I have played against this even against ION.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ a6 ]  [ B a4 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ d3 ]  I decided to play slow I guess lol
 [ Q g4 + ]  [ K f1 ] , [ N h2 + ]  Sets a trap: 19. Rxh2? [ Q x d1 ] .
 [ N f6 ] , [ e3 ]  3. [ e3 ] this is a passive move for what to adopt locking in the black bishop. But not bad per se.
 [ N c6 ] , [ d4 + ]  Looks like pawn check was final move of this magnificent attacking game... Not because I won but because my opponent's mistakes made this game attractive
 [ h4 ] , [ f5 ]  ...but now I can fork the knight and a pawn with my pawn...
 [ B c4 ] , [ b5 ]  I don't see the point in Jack attacking again. Although it could be from Glacoma as maybe he thought that this was the Noah's Ark with which my B would be trapped. But I have a couple of places to go as my next move will show.
 [ R e1 ] , [ R f3 f2 + ]  White moves rook along to [ e1 ] attacking bishop on [ e3 ] and black moves rook to [ f2 ] to check king supported by DB and knight.
 [ Q e4 ]  [ R f g1 ]  [ N h4 + ]  [ R g2 ] , [ R f3 ]  24. ...... [ R f3 ] and piling on the agony!!
 [ R c1 ]  [ N c4 ] , [ N b3 ]  She's reacting to all my moves. Something you shouldn't do unless forced.
 [ Q x a8 ]  [ B c6 + ]  [ Q x c6 ]  [ R x c6 ]  [ R f e1 ]  [ R c f6 ]  [ f4 ] , [ h6 ]  Otherwise white will hammer black's back-rank weakness.
 [ B e6 ] , [ N d5 ]  Clearly [ c x d5 ] loses to [ Q x c7 ]  [ K b1 ]  [ c x d5 ] , [ Q b5 + ]  I played this in preference to [ B a4 + ] as it keeps open the option of [ B x d5 ]  [ B d7 ] , [ Q x b7 ]  Possibly not the best Rh-[ e1 + ] might have been better
 [ f4 + ]  [ g x f4 ]  [ g x f4 + ]  [ K e2 ]  [ R d5 ]  [ K f2 ] , [ h4 ]  no way back: Black is winning...
 [ R x a6 ] , [ N d6 ]  Another 4th Knight move.The mistake we do when we are playing 30 games is that we tend to want to increase our rating at once.I play 10-15 games at a time and focus.Black seems to be distracted.You know online games are like that
 [ B x d4 ]  [ R x d4 ] , [ Q c8 ]  Trading queens is ok but I have a better move
 [ f x e4 ]  [ B x h4 + ]  [ B f2 ]  [ B x f2 + ] , [ K e2 ]  King can't take the bishop without loosing the queen.
 [ N x e5 ] , [ B e2 ]  The exchange of this bishop will leave Black controlling all of the important light squares especially arouind the White King.
 [ B g6 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ N d7 ] , [ N g3 ]  The plan is to move the knight to the nice [ f5 ] square. White is slowly building his attack while Black is developing and defending. It seems as if Black holds for the moment.
 [ g6 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ B g7 ] , [ f4 ]  5. [ [ f4 ] ] - standard developing moves and the push to [ [ f4 ] ] make this the 3 pawns attack variation of the Pirc as pointed out to me by my opponent.
 [ B d2 ] , [ Q d1 + ]  I move my only piece the DB. to [ d2 ] to get on the diagonal and black's queen comes to [ d1 ] to check the king and with the rook at [ f8 ] I know that the game is up and its time to give in to black's unquestionable superiority.
 [ N f d5 ] , [ Q e4 ]  And I try to relieve pressure prematurely here post-hoc computer analysis has instead White DSB x b6. Seems decent enough hell would have broken loose and I would have had a rook in the center of the board by itself but still be down 1 pawn.
 [ R c2 ]  [ R d1 + ]  [ K g2 ] , [ R b1 ]  Black attempts to keep the QNP on the board.
 [ f6 ] , [ Q b3 + ]  To create a passed pawn on e6.
 [ N x b3 ]  [ d x c3 ] , [ Q x c3 ]  I took the pawn with queen because I didnt want to spoil my pawn structure.
 [ B x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ Q d3 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ N e4 ] , [ a5 ]  Securing [ b4 ] but more importantly getting out of the line of fire so the black rooks can get more active on the open files.
 [ B g5 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ e3 ]  [ B b7 ] , [ c x d5 ]  wanting to block the a8-[ h1 ] diagonal.
 [ N x d4 ]  [ B x d4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ f x e5 ]  [ d x e5 ] , [ B e3 ]  Winning the pawn on h3.
 [ h4 ] , [ R a b1 ]  His c pawn is pinned to his king so if I advance my pawn and he exchanges I get a rook in a dominant position.
 [ Q x e2 ] , [ N x d4 ]  Sac 2: The Knight!!
 [ K e3 ]  [ K e6 ]  [ N b4 ] , [ N b7 ]  I offered a draw again which my opponent accepted.This is not the most exciting of my games but this excited me.I beat a 1760 but he blundered a rook so this was first blunder-free(no horrible blunders were made) non-loss for me.
 [ Q h7 + ]  [ K f8 ] , [ K b1 ]  better safe than sorry; Black has some annoying checks...
 [ g4 ]  [ N f d4 ] , [ B e4 ]  Now I spent a lot of time thinking about f2-[ [ f3 ] ] even in answering g4-[ [ g3 ] ] and if [ [ f3 ] ] takes the bishop in [ e4 ] g3[ x h2 ] my queen can go to [ [ g3 ] ] and then my rock supports it... anyway a lot of garbage because...
 [ B g4 ]  [ R x b8 ]  [ B x d1 ]  [ R x b7 ]  [ c2 ] , [ R c7 ]  And now the question is: Am I winning?! The c-pawn can go nowhere and now I have two choices which should lead to victory: 1) protect and push the d pawn; or 2) abandon it and exchange the knight for the bishop and c-pawn giving me a won rook pawns v. knight pawns endgame. Gm_dursley was off-line at this point which gave me time to play through both lines. In the end I chose the former which I believe is the more difficult but leads to the quicker win.
 [ Q c2 ] , [ R c8 ]  Although black is down two pawns I have finally regained the initiative; white has no playable checks.
 [ B c4 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ B x e6 ] , [ f x e6 ]  Now White can claim some advantage from the doubled pawns of Black. The trouble being the doubling only hurts black from any winning chances since his pawns on the King side now have little chance of making any advantage there from creation of a passed pawn which is highly unlikely. But this does not help WT since defensively the K-side BL pawns are still functional.
 [ K c7 ]  [ Q c5 + ]  [ K d7 ]  [ b5 ] , [ R e3 e6 ]  At least Arthur doesn't have to stay and protect the d heroïc footman
 [ B b3 ]  [ Q e5 + ]  [ Q e2 ]  [ R h d8 ]  [ Q x e5 ]  [ B x e5 ] , [ O-O ]  So far Black is simplifying to take advantage of the doubled pawn. Although Black has an isolated QBP the disadvantages should at worst cancel. White connects his rooks and attempts to secure his King.
 [ R x d5 ]  [ R x a6 ] , [ R d2 ]  White's forces lack coordination and Black is much more active. Black must be better here. Fritz suggests 39...[ K h6 ] probably to be able to attack with the pawns on the kingside.
 [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ f6 ]  [ O-O ] , [ B c5 + ]  Started to develop fast
 [ K x c1 ]  [ R e1 + ]  [ K d2 ]  [ R e2 + ]  [ K c3 ]  [ R e3 + ] , [ K b4 ]  The checks are over white wins.
 [ Q x h7 ] , [ K e8 ]  Preventing the immediate 28.[ Q h8 # ]  [ e4 ]  [ e5 ] , [ N f3 ]  King's knight opening.
 [ N c6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N c e7 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ a6 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ b5 ]  [ B b3 ]  [ g5 ]  [ h3 ]  [ g4 ]  [ h x g4 ] , [ B x g4 ]  Quite pleased so far. Developmentally felt I was much the better though that bishop worries me a little.
 [ B x c6 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ B d5 ] , [ Q h5 ]  This is what I imagined as defending position. The Black LSB is a powerhouse but one diagonal is closed. At this point I was aiming at sacrificing a rook for the LSB hopefully destroying the pawn chain. If White manages to exchange the Queens the DSB and the Knight will give White chances to hold out. If Black gives the DSB for the Knight White's position also improves.
 [ e3 ]  [ e6 ] , [ a3 ]  Another waste of time.
 [ B x f6 ]  [ g x f6 ]  [ N d5 ] , [ Q a5 + ]  [ Q a5 ] ?? Very bad mistake by me. I thought to take the B but i didn't see [ N c7 ]  [ N x f6 + ]  [ K f8 ] , [ N x d7 + ]  White wants to exchange as more as possible cause he's up.
 [ R x a4 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ R a3 ]  ...but they are not necessarily good for me... now look...
 [ K e6 ]  [ N x b6 ] , [ a x b6 ]  Now is the time to assess the situation. White is the rough equivalent of a piece ahead: Rook and pawn for a Knight. But the extra pawn is doubled and a Rook's pawn at that. Further Black's pieces are all nicely centralised with plenty of collaborative potential. White's for the moment remain scattered. And there is that niggling problem of the Black K-side majority well advanced and ready to go if given the chance. I'm not saying Black has enough to hold on even for a draw; but he's got plenty to have a good old crack at it and even maybe turn the tables. White has to tread very carefully and yet play decisively enough not to let slip her own chances to win. Game on!
 [ Q x c6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ R a d8 ]  [ R a c1 ]  [ R d2 ]  [ B f3 ]  [ Q d7 ] , [ c4 ]  ? cedes control of [ d4 ]  [ Q d4 + ]  [ K h1 ] , [ R f2 ]  Black seeks to force more exchanges and force home his c-pawn.
 [ a5 + ]  [ K x a5 ] , [ K x c5 ]  
 [ f3 ] , [ K b4 ]  ...and attack them although I cannot yet take them...
 [ R c6 ]  [ N b8 ] , [ N e5 ]  Again: attacking instead of defending following a tactic which has in this situation no hope for success
 [ N g f3 ] , [ b5 ]  So my usual qside castling is out of question. Now I can try to hold this by playing [ a3 ] but it is kind of passive play neglecting developement... no way.
 [ Q f1 + ] , [ R c1 ]  Black could trade rooks with BxRc1.
 [ d4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ h6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ N b d2 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ h3 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ e4 ]  [ N h7 ]  [ B d3 ] , [ f6 ]  The exceptionally close black's position makes it difficult to attack.
 [ B d2 + ] , [ K c2 ]  
 [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ a6 ]  5. ..... [ a6 ] - this move characterises the Sicilian Naijorf. Prepares a [ b5 ] onslaught should I go queenside.
 [ N x c4 ]  [ Q x c4 ]  [ B e6 ] , [ d5 ]  ! I don't know what got into me this game but I made this move with minimal thought. As it turns out it deserves an exclamation mark for the pressure it puts on black and is eventually a very important pawn in allowing 17. [ N x g5 ] to win. If [ B x e5 ] then 14. [ d x e6 ] generating pressure on black's king. (14. ... [ f x e6 ] [ Q x e6 + ] wins a bishop)
 [ N x b3 ]  [ a x b3 ]  [ O-O ] , [ O-O ]  We both Castle
 [ f x e5 ] , [ Q e7 ]  still not enought...i will take the knight and propose queen exchange...
 [ a3 ] , [ B d6 ]  Black maintains an aggressive posture with this bishop.
 [ K f4 ] , [ N x f5 ]  And now black's kingside is perfectly secure white has no perpetual check while black can safely hide on his own back rank or safely block with his knight. And black's pawn at [ a4 ] is clear to advance.
 [ K f3 ] , [ Q g4 + ]  Here I make a play for the [ f5 ] pawn. Perhaps [ Q c3 + ] would have been better with the chance for 2 pawns instead of 1.
 [ R f7 ]  [ B h5 ]  [ g6 ]  [ B x g6 ]  [ h x g6 ]  [ R x g6 + ]  [ K h8 ] , [ Q e2 ]  25. [ Q h5 ] seems the logical progression here giving a nasty check with [ B g7 ] . 24... [ R h7 ] 25. [ Q h5 ] [ R g8 ] seems to prevent 26. [ B h7 ] 26. [ R g7 ] or 26. [ R x g8 ] from bearing fruit so this is my aim for the defence of my corner.
 [ R x f3 ]  [ R h1 + ]  [ B e1 ]  [ R x e1 + ] , [ K d2 ]  Even though the bishops are gone I can stil try for an attempt to win White's weak [ g4 ] pawn because my king is closer than his.
 [ K e8 ]  [ B b5 + ]  [ K f8 ]  [ B x h6 + ]  [ N x h6 ]  [ Q e7 + ]  [ K g8 ] , [ N x f6 # ]  And mate. Black made a few errors in the opening that allowed me to mate. The first was not realizing all possibilities on the board and taking too many risks which allowed me to capture several key pieces. The second was that he quickly lost almost all his pawns and the king had zero protection.
 [ N x e4 ]  [ d x e4 ] , [ f3 ]  If I were white 6.Nf3?? would have come into consideration. However I would not have played that on the grounds of 6...[ e x f3 ] 7.[ g x f3 ] losing a piece for a pawn. So I would I even look at a bad move. Well in chess one should always be thinking about a way to develop. That's because it's a good idea to develop all of your pieces early in the game until your left with a Q and both R's.
 [ B x d1 ]  [ K x d1 ] , [ N h5 ]  Despite being far ahead one should still follow the basics and the theory and concepts. Unfortunately this doesn't due to one fact. And as you get more experience it doesn't matter as much but @Erika: Remember that a Knight on the rim is dim. Meaning that it should not be on the endfiles. Otherwise the opponent has more opportunities to attack it whereas there's less room for the N to escape. Plus it makes the N worth less.
 [ d5 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ c5 ]  The correct black move and nearly the only one that doesn't allow white to lead the game.
 [ b3 ] , [ Q f6 ]  Looking for an angle on the other rook.
 [ K f6 ] , [ a4 ]  made a mistake here: I should have pushed [ b4 ] first.
 [ B a3 ]  [ R b1 ] , [ R c5 c1 ]  Finally I start moving my pieces to erode the walls his R's have emplaced around my K.
 [ R x h8 ]  [ R x h8 ] , [ g5 ]  Black cannot play [ f x g5 ] due to Bxh8.
 [ B d2 ]  [ N x d2 ]  [ N x d2 ] , [ N c6 ]  Now my opponent attacks my e pawn
 [ Q b3 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ R a e1 ]  [ R c8 ]  [ Q b4 ] , [ N x g4 ]  Black now has a bishop vs knight game with center control. White's attack has not started.
 [ B x c5 ]  [ b4 ]  [ B b6 ] , [ O-O ]  White's development is almost complete he has a pawn majority (and space) on the Q-side and the [ e4 ] pawn is a little isolated. 11. ... 0-0 simply moves the king away from his minor pieces whilst [ [ d6 ] ] is already looking somewhat weak. Perhaps 10. ... [ B e7 ] controlling [ [ d6 ] ] is better but it looks rather passive and the [ B d7 ] isn't going anywhere.
 [ R h8 ]  [ g x f5 ]  [ g x f5 ] , [ Q x f5 + ]  Obvious continuations.
 [ R c6 ]  [ b x c5 + ]  [ K a6 ]  [ N x f8 ] , [ R x f8 ]  17. ...... [ R x f8 ] - I was reluctant to trade off the knight for the bishop but the knight was untenable on that [ e6 ] square. At least I only have a material deficit of just -1.
 [ B d6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ b x c4 ]  [ B x c4 ] , [ B f7 ]  Now I earned an attacking position. So then why not go with the Queen. But how?
 [ B e6 ] , [ B x e6 ]  to break the pawns shine.
 [ B x f3 ]  [ K x f3 ]  [ K e6 ]  [ h5 ] , [ d5 ]  35. ..... [ [ d5 ] ] - Over the last two moves Henry and my d pawn have formed a dynamic duo to correct the backward pawn scenario. My pawn finally gets to [ [ d5 ] ] and if it is traded off then Henry is beautifully centralised for the endgame.
 [ B e2 ]  [ R d8 ]  [ g4 ] , [ B d3 ]  missing the gravity of the situation Black gets careless: best was [ B c8 ] [ h3 ] [ f6 ] or at least [ h6 ] [ N x f7 ] [ K x f7 ] [ g x f5 ] gxf5...
 [ g6 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ N x e4 ] , [ N x e4 ]  With a weakened king side and poor developement Black tries a counter-attack.
 [ B d6 ] , [ N h2 ]  He moves the knight again!
 [ B e7 ] , [ g3 ]  seemed the next logical move getting ready to 0-0
 [ O-O ] , [ B d2 ]  ?? More pressing is Rd1! Or [ B e3 ] as a second best
 [ b5 ] , [ N e3 ]  Challenging Black's centralized Knight.
 [ K x f6 ]  [ K e3 ] , [ K e5 ]  There's no way for either side to make progress. White would have had some winning chances after other king moves but as it is both sides are locked down and so a draw results.
 [ d3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ B f4 ] , [ N g e7 ]  White has developed all his minor pieces while black has only just developed his second knight but black's pawns are well situated to deny white any real advantage from his speedy development.
 [ N c4 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ K h8 ]  [ R e7 ]  [ K h7 ]  [ f4 ]  [ N a5 ]  [ B g6 + ]  [ K g8 ] , [ B x f5 ]  for the win!
 [ Q x f7 + ]  [ K h8 ] , [ N g6 # ]  
 [ R d8 ]  [ Q e2 ] , [ R d3 ]  I think it was the right way to go on with the attack threatening Re3.
 [ R x e2 ]  [ B d5 ]  [ R c5 ]  [ R x c5 ] , [ b x c5 ]  all forced sequence but i have doubts about the next forced queen move... the candidate moves to chose from: a) [ Q f4 ] attacking [ f7 ] seams not to have much of a future then what black can simply defend the f pawn or even worst force the exchange of queens with [ Q f6 ] (aimed at [ f2 ] thus forcing the exchange) b) [ Q c3 ] to prevent [ R [ b2 ] ] seams the best but also I don't see any long term plan... c) [ Q d3 ] to attack black's rook this seams to me the least relevant one as black has several good alternatives either to back-up his rook in the open e column or move it along the e column to an unattacked square or even the best in my opinion move it to [ b2 ] were threatens [ R b4 ] attacking [ a4 ] and preventing any support from behind to my passed b pawn
 [ N e4 ] , [ R a5 ]  the pawn will fall!
 [ K c7 ] , [ R f7 + ]  !
 [ O-O ] , [ g5 ]  Here come the pawns anyway. This seems to be easier for Black to achieve with the Dutch than with say the King's Indian since Black doesn't have to muck about with his KN to enable his f-pawn to advance. The computer prefers 9...0-0
 [ R b8 + ]  [ K a4 ] , [ R a8 + ]  The game was adjourned again but the crisis has passed.
 [ N x c7 ] , [ R g1 + ]  A petty check that acheives little and only delays the inevitable.
 [ R d8 ] , [ B d4 ]  This puts presure on blacks kingside opens the e-file for my rook(s) and makes way for the knight to come to [ e3 ] to attack the f5-pawn.
 [ N b4 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ N d3 + ]  [ K f1 ]  [ R a f8 ]  [ K g1 ]  [ N x f2 ]  [ B x f2 ]  [ R f5 x f2 ]  [ Q x f2 ]  [ R x f2 ]  [ K x f2 ]  [ Q e2 + ]  [ K g3 ]  [ Q x e3 + ]  [ K g4 ]  [ B e2 + ]  [ K h4 ] , [ g5 # ]  
 [ B g4 ]  [ N c7 ] , [ R c1 ]  Now if [ N x b5 ] the rook gets an open file all to itself.
 [ R d7 ] , [ h4 ]  39. [ h4 ] - a pawn move - is Freddy threatening [ h5 ] threatening to open up the f or h file. Notice that if he did then gh?? would be suicide as Glenda would be pinned to Henry by a white rook moving to g4.
 [ c x d4 ] , [ B b6 ]  Keeping the pressure on the d-pawn. However it is obvios that White has the edge in this positiion.
 [ N c6 ] , [ B b5 ]  And that's exactly what I wanted so that she would get used to playing against the Ruy Lopez. The moral to this is that you expect the unexpected and that you never know what the opponent is going. So you have to plan ahead and be ready for anything that might come at you. I realize that this is a good way for her to learn this since it is a one on one training sessions. The more she can handle the better she'll become. Right now I am very impressed with the way black is playing.
 [ B x g5 ] , [ e5 ]  19. [ e5 ] - Freddy certainly ain't gonna topple his king here he is trying to counter-attack by going for the throat.
 [ B f4 ] , [ N e8 ]  11. ... [ d6 ] would have been better as White's two bishops will now encounter minimal resistance and Black will have a hard time bringing his rook on [ f8 ] into the game.
 [ Q x d6 + ]  [ Q e7 ] , [ Q x g3 ]  Now the situation is dire for Black. The Queenside pawn majority is strong but the exposed position of the king eventually brings about the end of the game.
 [ N x e5 ] , [ B x e5 ]  threatens [ B x c3 ] winning pawn and further threatening [ B x a1 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ B x d2 + ]  [ K x d2 ]  [ c3 + ]  [ K e2 ] , [ Q g6 ]  threaten c2. if [ B x c2 ] then [ Q x c2 ] and trouble
 [ N d3 + ]  [ B x d3 ]  [ Q x g2 ] , [ Q h5 + ]  Alternative variation: 18.[ R f1 ] [ Q g3 + ] 19.[ R f2 ] [ Q x d3 ] $19
 [ N x e5 ] , [ f6 ]  if there are two knights in the same raw is a great attack
 [ B e2 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ h3 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ B f3 ] , [ B c6 ]  how freaked-out is that!
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N d2 ]  [ c5 ]  [ c3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ f4 ]  This is the starting position of the mini-tournament; White has adopted the stonewall setup characterised by the pawns on [ c3 ] [ d4 ] [ e3 ] and f4. In this opening White wants to post a knight on [ e5 ] and create a lot of pressure on the kingside.
 [ R e1 ] , [ B b4 ]  Best move although [ h5 ] again could be considered
 [ B x d7 + ] , [ Q x d7 ]  (?!) Probably 7...[ N x d7 ] ought after all to have been preferred here. That knight was to prove hard to get moving subsequently and even then sat out the war on [ a3 ] 'awaiting orders'.
 [ R x f2 ] , [ Q c3 ]  So Q attacks both [ R h1 ] and [ d4 ] pawn.
 [ Q e2 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ Q x e5 ] , [ B x c8 ]  24. [ B x c8 ] - this trade - Fou Lenoir for black's queen rook narrows the deficit down to -2 but vital wood has left the board.
 [ R a e2 ] , [ R e3 x e2 + ]  Now white moves a rook to [ e2 ] and this is taken by black rook.
 [ R x a2 ] , [ K d3 ]  Joann is doing what she can to hang in by advancing the K again. I'm also familiar with this since in an endgame you want to bring the K up. Unfortunately it's too little too late because of Sasha's next move. As this is where she's going to sac her R for B for a passed pawn which she got by taking on a2.
 [ N e4 ]  [ Q b6 ] , [ N g5 ]  With this move I lost in exchange and almost a lost position!!
 [ K d2 ]  [ Q x a2 + ]  [ K d3 ] , [ Q b3 + ]  Although if we were to go to the other side I'd also feel optimistic as white.
 [ a3 ] , [ N c2 ]  ...and again...
 [ N a4 ] , [ B h3 ]  If [ B f1 ] then [ N x f6 ] and Black has too many tactics.
 [ c x d5 ]  [ Q x d5 ] , [ Q c7 ]  Now I have gained my compensation for lost pawn as I can attack whites queenside from open lines with support of my bishops.
 [ h x g4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ g5 ]  [ N h5 ] , [ B c4 ]  terrible move allows my knights to run wild
 [ B x h2 + ] , [ K x h2 ]  ?? As you might expect I did not look at any possiblities. I was pretty confident though that "To take is a mistake" due to studying similar positions. But in this case I thought that I did not have a good move left. In other words I felt that there was nothing better or anything else to lose. If for example I had played 17.[ K f1 ] (which was my second instinct) black would play 17...Rxd2. So the inference is that I'd lose my Queen one way or another. This kind of thing happens without analyze the board (which is why Wizard Chess is good practice as that doesn't exist.) But had white been more careful and played through a little more I would've seen 18.Nxd2. Despite losing the Queen I'd get a Rook as compensation. At which point resignation would not be an option yet. But by taking as opposed to calculating that Queen is free as we're about to see.
 [ Q e2 ]  [ B d7 ] , [ Q f3 ]  Trying to attack [ f5 ] and protect [ f2 ] from black bishop
 [ Q d1 + ]  [ K h2 ]  [ Q d6 + ]  [ K h1 ] , [ Q f8 ]  making his way to help defend his king.
 [ b x c5 ]  [ R c2 ]  [ R a c7 ]  [ R e c1 ] , [ c4 ]  After this boost I should have a slight advantage but not a huge one
 [ e5 ] , [ B g4 ]  [ g6 ] is not possible because of Qh6. Black is going for Queen exchange.
 [ R x c1 + ] , [ Q x c1 ]  Now [ Q b6 ] is still good.
 [ B e3 ] , [ R g8 ]  Black eyes a sneaky checkmate should the queen leave her defence of the knight. Seems a vain hope now though. Might have been better to get the Queen out in preparation for castling long.
 [ b x c3 ]  [ N e7 ] , [ Q g4 ]  More aggressive than the main alternative [ N f3 ] though the database gives a similar success rate for each move.
 [ N d3 ] , [ R a1 ]  this ends the ride the game was resigned here
 [ B h3 ]  [ K f7 ] , [ R f1 ]  trying to be in the open c file and to be in the powerful attacking position in [ c7 ] after that.
 [ a6 ] , [ N d6 + ]  ??
 [ R d g1 ]  [ B f6 ] , [ f4 ]  An interesting move. Pushing my f-pawn removes a defender from [ g4 ] but is there a reason?
 [ h4 ]  [ B d1 ] , [ g4 ]  Forces white's hand
 [ Q f3 + ]  [ K h4 ] , [ B f2 # ]  A convincing win for the master but I had a good game until my blunder at move 16. Thanks for reading I'd like to receive some comments. Ion thanks for this lesson I hope we can play another game soon.
 [ R d1 ] , [ R d5 ]  And now white goes for it and black denies it. No white rook on the 7th today not now anyway.
 [ N e2 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B c3 ] , [ a5 ]  Not sure why I did this instead of Nb4. I might have been greedy to try and gain an open a-file and move the a pawn to the b file. Perhaps I was not keen on "demoting" the c pawn to the b file.
 [ e x d5 ] , [ e x d5 ]  By move 5 Black is better because he has opened the lines for both Bishops and the Queen and has develloped a Knight not mencionning the two hanging pawns. White only has one develloped Knight that is hanging in the centre.
 [ R f3 ] , [ Q g2 ]  Black resigned here. Black has a significant material deficit and White can now exchange down into a comfortably won endgame.
 [ K x g7 ] , [ g4 ]  playing [ h5 ] immediately wouldn't help since he can just take the pawn with the knight so playing this move helps white a lot.
 [ b x c3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ c x d5 ] , [ Q x f6 ]  Another trade which helps me this time we remain equal in material when my opponent could have gained a pawn.
 [ K e7 ]  [ Q x g7 + ]  [ R f7 ] , [ Q g5 + ]  it is over...
 [ h3 ]  [ N h6 ]  [ N h2 ]  [ g6 ]  [ B x h6 ]  [ R x h6 ]  [ f4 ]  [ f5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ h4 ]  [ e x f5 ]  [ g x f5 ]  [ Q e2 ]  [ Q f6 ] , [ N g5 ]  White has a significant lead in development due to Black spending some extra tempos in the opening. Black's K is also somewhat exposed. There is no cover to be had by castling Kingside and potential castling Queenside is a few moves away.
 [ Q f3 ] , [ R e d6 ]  ?? I just blundered the bishop. Mi opponent though about who ever knows what a hidden trap and didn't take it!
 [ N g5 ] , [ h6 ]  Black is not impressed: [ N x f7 ] is in Blacks' favor...
 [ B x c6 ]  [ B x c6 ] , [ Q a3 ]  ! As I've pointed out the important squares for white to attack are the dark squares with this move white gets good control of the third rank and threatens infiltration to e7.
 [ Q h1 + ]  [ K e2 ] , [ Q x g2 + ]  Now black probably wins but it still to be demostrated. My opponend abandoned the game.
 [ R x e8 ]  [ R x e8 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ R x e1 + ] , [ B x e1 ]  White's strategy has been to exchange pieces hoping that the Q can be constrained.
 [ h5 ]  [ b4 + ] , [ K b2 ]  Starting to look like there is some hope. Though it will be difficult pushing the pawns any further. I should have been thinking about protecting the kingside which I though was lost because of the presence of the knight
 [ K x f4 ]  [ R d6 ]  [ K x e5 ]  [ R x e6 + ]  [ K x e6 ] , [ K x a6 ]  ?? this is pure blunder!
 [ R a4 ] , [ N c4 ]  Complicating the way i like it. Black has to think again how to justify Ra4.
 [ N f8 ] , [ B e3 ]  Black's pieces keep getting in each other's way. [ f8 ] is not a happy square for a knight.
 [ N x e4 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ N c4 ]  [ B c7 ] , [ Q g4 ]  Threatenin e5-pawn and g7-pawn
 [ R x a2 ]  [ R h7 + ]  [ K d8 ]  [ d6 ] , [ N b5 ]  The threat was [ N f6 ] and Rh8%2B mate.
 [ d6 ]  [ N f4 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ B d7 ] , [ N d5 ]  White's knight has found a good post on [ d5 ] while Black catches up on development. The white DSB is poised to control the long diagonal now that black will have a harder time contesting it.
 [ N b7 + ]  [ K d4 ]  [ f x e5 + ]  [ K x e5 ] , [ e x f5 ]  Here probably my losing mistake. Which pawn should I take?
 [ K g2 ] , [ B x g1 ]  Trading my active bishop for white's passive knight was not worth the one pawn I should have won.
 [ R x c3 ] , [ Q x c3 + ]  There are several lines from here all of which are highly in my favor. Either 18.[ K f2 ] [ N e4 + ] 19.[ K f1 ] [ Q d3 + ] 20.[ K e1 ] [ Q d1 # ] (or 20. [ N e2 ] [ Q x e2 + ] 21.[ K g1 ] [ Q d1 + ] 22.[ Q e1 ] Qxe1#) 18. [ B d2 ] [ Q a1 ] 19. [ K f2 ] [ N e4 + ] 20.[ K e3 ] [ N x g3 ] (19.[ B c1 ] would delay it one more move but only changes [ N e4 ] from check to checkmate.) 18. [ K f1 ] [ Q d3 + ] 19. [ K e1 ] [ Q d1 + ] 20.[ K f2 ] [ N e4 # ] (or 19. [ K f2 ] [ N e4 + ] 20. [ K e1 ] Qd1#) or 18.[ K f1 ] [ Q d3 + ] 19. [ N e2 ] [ Q x e2 + ] 20. [ K g1 ] [ Q d1 + ] 21.[ Q e1 ] Qxe1#.
 [ R g x f1 ] , [ B x e5 ]  free pawn.If RXR ill be happy trading down.my pieces are more active
 [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N b5 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N b1 c3 ]  [ B b4 ]  [ a3 ]  [ B x c3 + ]  [ N x c3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ B e6 ] , [ B e2 ]  The last move from the games database - the real challenge starts here!
 [ N a5 ] , [ B x f7 + ]  I decided to sac the white bishop for a little play on the fact that he could not castle to safety.
 [ g x f6 ] , [ Q h7 # ]  Thanks for watching my annotation. Hope this illustrated to you the power of the pieces. Hope to see you next time! Thanks for watching!
 [ B x b4 ] , [ a x b4 ]  Whites idea now seems to counterattack at my back rank but it is well defended.
 [ K e7 ] , [ N h4 ]  There are a few traps here
 [ N f3 ]  [ Q g3 + ]  [ K h1 ] , [ B x f2 ]  White resigns. The threat is 18... Q-[ R6 ] ch 19 N-[ R2 ] QxN mate. If 18 RxB NxR mate. If 18 B-[ B4 ] QxB White is three Pawns down and has no good way to stop 19... Q-N6.
 [ R x h6 ] , [ Q g7 ]  I figured that was the safest place considering the double attack on the knight.
 [ N c6 ]  [ a3 ] , [ B x c3 + ]  The check buys me the time I need to take care of the threat at [ b7 ]  [ O-O ] , [ K h8 ]  I plan to open up the diagonal and don't want my king there.
 [ Q d2 ] , [ B f5 ]  Adding pieces to the fray threatening the pawn at d3.
 [ R b7 ] , [ h5 ]  I think this is where it starts to go wrong. White will win a straight race so Black needs an alternative strategy. He should probably move his rook to a better position before he starts advancing his pawns.
 [ N x c8 ]  [ R a x c8 ] , [ c3 ]  ? the first mistake?
 [ B e7 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ B e6 ] , [ Q e2 ]  10.[ B b3 ] may have been better since black sends it there with the text anyways.
 [ N f3 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ N g5 ] , [ B b4 + ]  Wrong move I guess. He should have protected his king.
 [ B e5 ] , [ B x f3 ]  I thought I could win back the pawn here if he took back with the queen. Once again I overlooked a move!
 [ R h6 ] , [ a3 ]  Stopping the Knight but giving me more time.
 [ B e1 ]  [ K e6 ]  [ K c4 ]  [ R b5 ]  [ K d4 ]  [ N c5 ]  [ K c4 ] , [ N d3 ]  If this was a real game and i was short of time I would swap the rook for the bishop to make it easier.
 [ R e7 ] , [ R e1 ]  Putting pressure on his Ne4.
 [ N x f6 + ]  [ g x f6 ] , [ R x f6 ]  the fortold pawn give away
 [ K b1 ]  [ R f2 + ]  [ K a1 ] , [ R x f6 ]  He resigns Good game rakbeater. Please drop a comment and rate.
 [ N h7 ]  [ K g2 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 + ]  [ c x d5 ] , [ c4 ]  If 31... [ d4 ] then 32.[ N d5 ] and white can create a big force of pawns on the queenside. Black cannot advance with [ e4 ] and the knight will be hard pressed to look after both sides at once. 31... [ d x c4 ] 32. [ d x c4 ] seems a lot better but it is still a guaranteed passed pawn on the c file with good support on the a and b files.
 [ R f5 ]  [ R e7 + ]  [ K c6 ]  [ K c3 ]  [ R g5 ]  [ a4 ]  [ R g2 ] , [ h4 ]  I wasted time here and should have concentrated on his king
 [ Q x d8 ]  [ R x d8 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ f5 ] , [ N c5 ]  The knight's pretty useless and constricted here.
 [ d5 ] , [ e5 ]  The advance variation. I do not like this for Black. I don't know why I just don't like the sort of game it brings about. I like more 3. [ N c3 ] [ d x e4 ] 4. [ N x e4 ] [ N d7 ] leading to a more interesting game in my own opinion. 3. [ [ f3 ] ] is interesting as well to say the least. Leads to 3. ... [ e6 ] 4. [ B e3 ] [ N f6 ] 5. [ e5 ] [ N f d7 ] and White has a lot of space. Also Black's [ c8 ] Bishop is hemmed in. 3. [ [ f3 ] ] is the Tarkatower fantasy variation.
 [ N e5 ]  [ h6 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ Q x f6 ]  [ R c1 ]  [ R c8 ] , [ b4 ]  Not allowing the freeing move c5.
 [ O-O ]  [ B d5 ]  [ Q b2 ] , [ N x a2 ]  Taking with the knight gave me multiple threats attacking the knight on [ d2 ] and threatening the fork if white responds with Qxb5.
 [ Q c1 ]  [ Q b3 ] , [ Q e1 ]  28. [ Q e1 ] - defends pawn on b4.
 [ Q g5 ] , [ K h8 ]  After 17. [ B x g7 ] [ N x g7 ] I have ideas of putting my rook on g8.
 [ N a4 ]  [ Q c2 ] , [ b5 ]  I have the queen side obviously
 [ c3 ]  [ N c2 ]  [ K c4 ]  [ K e4 ]  [ K b3 ]  [ K d3 ] , [ N c5 + ]  Now I can remove the protection from the knight...
 [ B e3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ f3 ]  [ B b3 ] isn't necessary due to the early d6. We are now in a normal dragon as opposed to an accelerated
 [ h3 ] , [ c6 ]  Attacks White's pawn which is now attacked twice (by the pawn at [ c6 ] and the bishop at d7) and protected only once.
 [ g6 ]  [ f4 ] , [ B g4 ]  Striving for counterplay.
 [ O-O ]  [ b5 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ B b7 ] , [ B e3 ]  ?! Moving another piece twice in the opening. The computer likes 12.a4.
 [ Q x a5 ] , [ R x b7 ]  White exchanges presumably to try and save the a pawn; but at this point it is already impossible.
 [ B f4 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ B x d6 ]  [ Q x d6 ] , [ e3 ]  Is my position inferior? Just for one piece less developed?
 [ K e7 ]  [ K f2 ]  [ B c7 ]  [ g3 ] , [ a5 ]  Finally Black gets to break up those pesky White pawns.
 [ c4 ]  [ a6 ]  [ B x d7 + ]  [ Q x d7 ]  [ N e2 ] , [ O-O-O ]  8. ............ 0-0-0 - black has an enormous lead in development for the pawn I spend the next two moves catching up.
 [ B f6 ] , [ R e4 ]  I give up the pawn advantage for a even bigger plus-central dominance. Though in a few short moves I regain the pawn advantage.
 [ N x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ c x d4 ] , [ Q x d4 ]  Should I have brought out my queen this early?
 [ Q d4 ] , [ R x a7 ]  Exchanging 2 pieces for a rook.
 [ R x h2 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ g4 ] , [ N e3 ]  in playing this move black had to be willing to have the queens come off the board and gradually try to realize his material advantage.
 [ Q e3 ]  [ Q a5 + ] , [ c3 ]  Blocks the check but also prevents bb4.
 [ N a5 ] , [ B d3 ]  Black weakly moves his knight to the edge of the board where it has nothing to do and no safe squares to move to other than back to c6. While it does open his bishop's diagonal black may have been better served by 6. ... Nc6[ e7 ] followed soon by [ N g6 ] where it can threaten the white bishop on [ [ f4 ] ] and can support a kingside attack. White responds with a fairly weak bishop move. It does clear the way for the kngside castle but it doesn't really threaten anything. It may have been better placed on [ [ f4 ] ] but black's 6. ... [ N a5 ] contests that square. Another line of play might have been 7. [ a3 ] threatening 8. [ b4 ] to fork black's two pieces. Just the threat of the fork should cause black to retreat one or both pieces gaining tempo for white.
 [ K e7 ]  [ Q g7 + ]  [ K e8 ]  [ Q f7 + ]  [ K d8 ] , [ Q d7 # ]  Good game Jimrocks22!
 [ e x d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ b5 ]  [ B b3 ]  [ g6 ] , [ N g5 ]  Pretty blunt but why not? Although it occurs to me as I write this that 9. [ B f7 ] was a shot: 9. [ B f7 ] [ K f7 ] 10. [ Q f3 + ] and ...[ B f5 ] regains the piece while 10. ...[ K e8 ] 11. [ Q f7 ] [ K d7 ] 12. [ N h7 ] with the threat of [ N f6 ] mate. Combinations like this make a lot of C-players blanch. ;-) ---- Whoops: it was pointed out to me that I got my analysis wrong and the reader is correct. Disregard all of the above. Thanks.
 [ K e6 ] , [ K e4 ]  Black Resigns.
 [ b x c6 ] , [ N g e2 ]  Now Terry continues with his development and prepares to castle but as Joe implied after the 10th and 13th move it's too little too late.
 [ B d7 ] , [ a4 ]  this is a free pawn but...
 [ Q f1 ]  [ N x h1 ]  [ Q x h1 ]  [ B e4 ]  [ B d5 ]  [ B x d5 ]  [ R x d5 ]  [ N b4 ] , [ N x e5 ]  !
 [ N c5 ]  [ R d6 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ R x d8 ]  [ R x d8 ]  [ c4 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ N e5 ]  DUMB DUMB DUMB by me. Now I'm in for a royal forking.
 [ b x c3 ] , [ d6 ]  extra protection for that pawn so the queen is free
 [ R d e1 ]  [ B x f3 ] , [ B x f3 ]  22. [ B x f3 ] - another B for N trade occurs. Suddenly we have opposite colour bishops. Michael defends the [ e6 ] pawn by moving his king.
 [ R x d8 ]  [ R x d8 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ h6 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ f5 ] , [ f4 ]  If White were to allow ...P-[ K B5 ] he would be completely hemmed in.
 [ N e3 + ]  [ K g3 ]  [ Q g5 + ]  [ K f2 ]  [ Q f4 + ] , [ K e2 ]  Now the chats are over so I had three spots to move the monarch. And I was trying to figure out where. Other moves I saw a quick mate and I saw it here. But for me this appeared a little easier to miss a mate so I was hoping that Joe wouldn't play his next move. My hope was 32.Qf1+?? where it's not mate. But only a second after this move I realized that this won't happen since I overlooked that this would allow me to compensate with 32...[ K x e3 ] which is how I would've answered. So his next move was what predicted since it wins quickly.
 [ N g4 ] , [ h3 ]  I'm kicking his knight out. Did I need to do this at this point or would have a developing move been better?
 [ Q d8 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ Q c7 ] , [ Q e6 + ]  Mate in 1 Black Resigns
 [ c x d4 ] , [ N x d4 ]  This is a classic Sicilian position where White opens the centre to get faster and easier development while Black is more cramped but has a solid position.
 [ K d2 ]  [ K x a4 ]  [ K c3 ] , [ K b5 ]  Now to maintain the threat to take Black's pawn White has to move one of his other pawns.
 [ B x c7 ] , [ B x c2 ]  And after some time White accepts the queen trade. Black must accept as well.
 [ e4 ] , [ c5 ]  Sicilian defense i only have started to explore this opening
 [ N x b7 ]  [ R d7 ] , [ N d6 ]  Back to the womb as it were
 [ R d5 ]  [ R e3 ] , [ R d4 ]  There's a lot of shuffling going on and I see what Black's plan is - he wants to exchange but be able to recapture with his Rook so he doesn't have a passed Rook pawn which is harder to Queen than the g-pawn would be. I can't see any way of stopping this plan.
 [ B d7 ] , [ N c3 ]  Without 4. ... [ B d7 ] white could have played 5. [ B x c6 ] [ b x c6 ] 6. [ d x e5 ] [ d x e5 ] 7. [ N x e5 ] to win a pawn but now black responds 5. [ B x c6 ] recapturing with the bishop and therefore is able to play 7. ... [ B x [ e4 ] ] regaining the pawn although that simplified move order endangers the black bishop at [ e4 ] so a zwischenzug with 7. ... [ Q e7 ] followed by 8. ... [ B x [ e4 ] ] is required.
 [ d4 ]  [ f5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ e3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ c4 ]  [ e6 ] , [ c5 ]  Just to play differently.
 [ B b7 ]  [ R a d1 ]  [ R d8 ]  [ N g5 ] , [ B x d5 + ]  A saw the opening to force pressure on the white king
 [ N f3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ Q b3 ]  [ e6 ] , [ B g5 ]  Awkward move for me. I did not like it but there it was and I had to deal with it. I took my time to play my next move.
 [ c5 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e6 ]  [ d x e6 ] , [ f x e6 ]  Alternative variation: 8... [ B x e6 ] [This is another possible reply]
 [ R e e8 ] , [ Q f4 ]  Simple. Can black stop me? Well the answer is partly positive.
 [ h3 ]  [ B h5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ d x c4 ] , [ N f3 ]  here i unpinned my e pawn but changed it to a night pin....
 [ Q x e8 ]  [ f x g3 ]  [ B x d4 + ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ Q e3 + ]  [ K h2 ]  [ R g5 ]  [ g4 ]  [ h5 ]  [ a4 ]  [ h x g4 ]  [ R a3 ]  [ Q e5 + ]  [ g3 ]  [ g x h3 ]  [ Q d3 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N b5 ]  [ Q b2 + ]  [ N d2 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ Q x d6 ]  [ R g4 ]  [ R f3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ N c7 ]  [ R d4 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ Q x d2 + ]  [ K h1 ] , [ Q g2 # ]  I think I was a bit lucky to get away with this one.
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c5 ] , [ N d2 ]  I like this it has blocked the black squared bishop I continue
 [ B a3 ] , [ R b e4 ]  I double up here...
 [ Q d6 ] , [ N f d2 ]  I don't know why he did that but it turned out great for him. That knight is what really began my problems.
 [ B x f1 ]  [ K x f1 ]  [ d6 ] , [ g3 ]  This is the idea: the king will hide on [ g2 ] allowing the rook to enter the free (after the knight has developed).
 [ Q x d5 ] , [ c4 ]  Attacks blacks queen and jumps on center
 [ N h4 ] , [ R g1 ]  Defending the threatened B and looking to drive the Black Q off the KN file.
 [ e x f6 ]  [ Q x f6 ]  [ Q x h7 + ]  [ K f8 ] , [ N c e4 ]  Black is being attacked left and right and can barely keep up
 [ N b4 ] , [ N d4 ]  White wishes to keep his opportunity to castle so [ N d4 ] is the only real option to prevent the king rook fork on c2. However it will be difficult for white to protect these pieces if black is able to get his bishop to g7.
 [ N c3 ]  [ Q e1 ]  [ N x e2 + ]  [ Q x e2 ] , [ c3 ]  See the queen and the knight both attacked?
 [ b6 ] , [ d4 ]  I played [ b6 ] so that I could recapture [ c5 ] with a b-pawn which brings a flank pawn to the center rather than playing dx[ c5 ] which weakens my center and goes into a drawish position where the pawn structures are symmetrical
 [ N d5 ] , [ N x b3 + ]  Black does White a favor here by exchanging pieces while still being a pawn down even though White's castled queenside pawn structure is slightly weakened in the process...
 [ K d2 ] , [ N f4 ]  Attacking the Bishop Again.
 [ Q d7 ]  [ B h6 ]  [ R f e8 ]  [ Q g3 ]  [ N x d4 ] , [ c x d4 ]  16. [ c x d4 ] - now neither side has a horse.
 [ B x e4 ] , [ B f6 ]  Or bringing his bishop here which is also good. Now it seems we have reached a theme position here but I cannot find the goldmine.
 [ K e1 ]  [ N x f3 + ]  [ N x f3 ] , [ B x g4 ]  Not only is Black up a Pawn White's Knight is now pinned as well. Too many pins to overcome -- the danger of a cramped immobile position.
 [ c6 ]  [ B e6 ] , [ d4 ]  Threatening to block the bishop with [ d5 ]  [ B b3 ]  [ e5 ] , [ Q f5 ]  If [ f x e5 ] then 39.Qxg5ch
 [ c4 ]  [ d x c4 ] , [ B x c4 ]  ...then we exchange pawns for the first time...
 [ g4 ] , [ e5 ]  So I decide to advance on the King side. His [ a6 ] rather put me off queen's side castling - he can sacrifice a pawn with [ b5 ] and get some open files against my king. I was thinking of putting my king on [ f2 ] - especially as he had moved his rook from f8.
 [ e4 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ e5 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ Q x d1 + ] , [ K x d1 ]  A wake-up call!
 [ Q d4 ] , [ R f8 ]  I bring my queen to [ d4 ] attacking black's [ [ h8 ] ] rook. Black moves [ [ h8 ] ] rook to f8.
 [ Q x d3 ]  [ b3 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ b4 ]  [ B d6 ] , [ B b2 ]  ?? Ok the move here looks very good because he does develop his last piece on this square. But as you'll see with the next move what looks good might be bad.
 [ N x d5 ]  [ B x d5 ]  [ R b6 ]  [ O-O ] , [ R b8 ]  I moved back because i saw his bishop on E3. I thought i would lose a rook if he tried to counter
 [ c5 ]  [ B x g3 ] , [ f x g3 ]  This position doesn't look very healthy for white but it gives me a lot of tactical options. The Knight on [ d7 ] doesnt have many squares to go too as example his position is kind a locked.
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ d4 ]  Petroff's Defense. Mainline says to take the pawn. 3. [ N f3 ] and 3. [ B c4 ] are also playable. The Game DB seems to favor 3. [ d4 ] (The Steinitz Attack) so I went with it. My esteemed opponent is rated 723 points higher than I am so I'm reluctant to branch out on my own sooner than I have to.
 [ R c4 ] , [ f4 ]  [ f4 ] is the only way to prevent the loss of a pawn but now the [ B c1 ] has less squares to go to
 [ N x e2 ]  [ B x e2 ] , [ g6 ]  I do not know why I chose that candidate so this move is !? in my opinion.
 [ K h1 ]  [ R g7 ]  [ Q h6 ]  [ K f8 ]  [ R f3 ]  [ K g8 ]  [ R g3 ]  [ R x g3 ]  [ N x g3 ]  [ N f8 ]  [ N h5 ]  [ N e6 ] , [ c5 ]  This move allowed me to pretty much finish you off. Obviously this move forces you to move your queen and allows me to kill your knight - which was protecting you from checkmate. From here on out there wasn't really much you could do to prevent yourself from losing.
 [ Q x b5 + ]  [ K d8 ] , [ N x f7 # ]  Black's king is very exposed and my developing active pieces were crushing. Black didn't have time to develop the kingside because I had so many tactical threats on the queenside.
 [ K c2 ]  [ Q e4 + ]  [ K d2 ]  [ Q f4 + ] , [ K e1 ]  ? My plan is to make him land on a black square or something so to save my B and prevent him to harass my K. Yes I can win the [ R a1 ] ([ Q c1 + ] [ K e2 ] [ Q x b2 + ] K moves QxR) but this leaves my B and my K in a very difficult position - or at least I assumed it was! So...
 [ d x c5 ]  [ Q x c5 ] , [ Q e1 ]  ?? I'm not sure why Erika pulled back but this is a terrible blunder. As this now allows black to win the exchange being a Rook for Bishop on her next move as your [ R f1 ] is now trapped. Much better would've been to your Rook away from the f file Erika or find something. For example I would've attacked with 29.[ R b c1 ] and after black retreats I'd answer with 30.[ R f e1 ] or 30.[ R f d1 ] to centralize the Rook.
 [ c x d4 ] , [ B x d4 ]  The Bishop is looking a bit more lively.
 [ Q x e4 ] , [ B x f3 ]  Ted takes back either thinking that it was just an even exchange or maybe having the idea of exposing my K which would allow his Q to swarm in. And he'd be able to use some of his other pieces like what I saw with bhidragon. I think it's more likely that he thought it was even again.
 [ B f6 ] , [ N e4 ]  I figured that this candidate was the best way to protect my pawn on [ d3 ] but I was wrong. Instead I should have played Rd1. Now he will get a free pawn after the exchange and I will be at -2. I am referring to [ B x e4 ] followed by 15.[ R x e4 ] Qxd2.
 [ B b3 ] , [ c5 ]  This creates some weakness on light squares when I have a light bishop.
 [ K x f5 ] , [ Q e2 ]  I look to trap the King in a common K and Q ending I don't mind about the pawn. It will make the ending easier if its not there
 [ K f8 ] , [ N x c8 ]  once again a hanging bishop
 [ h4 ]  [ N b6 ] , [ R g1 ]  The g file will become at least half open after [ [ g5 ] ] so white moves the rook there before playing the [ [ g5 ] ] advance
 [ Q d3 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ B x f3 ] , [ Q x f3 ]  Spassky's position is still tenable...
 [ Q x e5 ] , [ O-O ]  White is happy to take the center pawn gift while Black is happy to castle his King into safety. Garry Kasparov noted that losing a pawn in material for the sake of King safety can oftentimes be the difference between forcing a draw or even winning a game from a lost position as opposed to being checkmated very quickly.
 [ e5 ] , [ h3 ]  White finally waved the flag here but not without a super effort.
 [ B h5 ]  [ B c2 ]  [ N f4 ] , [ N g1 ]  good move . 21.Ng1!avoids the penetration of the black Rook to [ e2 ] and opens for white options of developments for his other Pisces by [ N d f3 ] and [ B d2 ] for example .
 [ N e2 ]  [ O-O ] , [ O-O ]  Now with our kings safely tucked away battle can commence!
 [ N b6 ] , [ a5 ]  Leaves the bishop unprotected and drives the knight to a more central square. If you look at which piece is doing least it's the queen. So [ Q b3 ] is the best move.
 [ g5 ]  [ O-O ] , [ g4 ]  7. ..... [ g4 ] - now here is something to expect from Freddy. He is a bit like The Dentist in that he lurves pushing those g and h pawns. However Freddy somehow seems to know just when the time is right to do it!
 [ N c5 ] , [ R a8 ]  Undoubtedly the safest move here. If 33...[ B h4 ] so 34 Be3. Risky for both sides would be 33...[ B h4 ] 34 [ N x e6 ] [ B f2 + ] 35 [ K f1 ] fe 36 [ R c8 + ] [ K f7 ] 37 [ R f8 + ] [ K e7 ] 38 [ R x f2 ] [ b3 ] 39 [ B f8 + ] [ K d7 ] 40 [ B a3 ] [ R x a3 ] 41 [ R [ b2 ] ] [ R a1 + ] 42 [ K e2 ] [ R a2 ] 43 [ R d2 ] [ b2 ] and Black wins. Or instead of 39 [ B f8 ] White plays 39 [ B c1 ] [ R a1 ] 40 [ K e2 ] [ R x c1 ] 41 [ K d3 ] [ R h1 ] 42 [ K c3 ] [ R x h3 + ] 43 K[ b2 ] [ R g3 ] better for Black.
 [ K f7 ] , [ R b6 + ]  resign. any thoughts would be really appreciated. thanks.
 [ B b7 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ c5 ] , [ e4 ]  White come to standard three centered pawns.
 [ O-O-O ] , [ Q a3 + ]  I catch a breakQe7-[ a3 + ]  [ K b1 ] , [ c x b3 ]  I take pawn hoping somehow putting pressure on his king
 [ K b6 ] , [ N c3 ]  Developing is vital if white is to stand a chance against blacks stronger army. Threatens [ d5 + ] and indirectly protects the f-pawn.
 [ K h1 ]  [ R g8 ] , [ d x c6 ]  Exploits the virtual pin on the bishop
 [ R d3 ] , [ R x d3 # ]  Finis. White's problems started with Na4. Before that the position was quite solid. With a pawn advantage the goal should be just to play solid and try to get to a favorable endgame. Perhaps White just tried to do too much.
 [ c5 ]  [ N b c6 ]  [ e3 ]  [ b6 ]  [ a3 ] , [ B a6 ]  this seemingly innocuous move proves to trouble white for most of the match.
 [ B x c3 ] , [ R c1 ]  A natural move for White - kicking back the bishop and taking command over the open c-file but damping options for the [ a3 ] bishop.
 [ R d1 ]  [ Q d6 ]  [ Q x d6 ]  [ B x d6 ]  [ B x d6 ] , [ R x d6 ]  "The fewer pieces there are on the board the more the passed pawn gains in strength." -- Jose Raul Capablanca
 [ Q f2 ]  [ R e2 ]  [ K f1 ]  [ Q d1 + ]  [ K g2 ]  [ R x f2 + ]  [ K x f2 ]  [ Q e2 + ]  [ K g1 ] , [ R d1 # ]  
 [ a4 ] , [ R x e3 ]  Threatening [ R e2 + ] winning the [ g2 ] pawn
 [ d6 ] , [ N c3 ]  ?! I hate to criticize this move because it is 100% consistent with basic opening principles. [ N [ c3 ] ] is not really a bad move per se but it is unambitious and leads to a potentially dull and boring game. More promising options would be [ c3 ] aiming for either [ b4 ] or [ d4 ] castling to leave options open or [ h3 ] preventing White's next move.
 [ a5 ]  [ N d3 ] , [ a4 ]  33. ..... [ a4 ] - onward little soldier!
 [ g x f6 ]  [ R x f6 ] , [ R c f7 ]  Here I could get rid of the Rook but better give some company to the Rook at f6.
 [ f x e4 ]  [ N x e4 + ] , [ K e2 ]  Exchanging the pieces would lose.
 [ R c1 ]  [ Q b6 ] , [ R e2 ]  Now White loses a piece after [ b x a4 ] due to the double attack on [ b3 ] and e2.
 [ B x f1 ] , [ K x f1 ]  Now I begin to see a rook mate.
 [ B b5 + ] , [ c6 ]  Just as planned.
 [ K d7 ] , [ N b7 ]  and back...
 [ K x b2 ]  [ Q c2 + ]  [ K a1 ] , [ N b3 + ]  Winning the queen and the game!
 [ B e2 ]  [ Q d7 ]  [ Q b3 ]  [ e6 ] , [ O-O-O ]  Usually White doesn't castle queenside in this variation and you have massive attacks as each side throws pawns at the other's castled position. I'm thinking this may be a more careful game than you usually get in this variation since we'll both have somewhat exposed kings.
 [ Q c3 ] , [ Q a7 ]  Also I do not see the point in this move.
 [ B x f3 ]  [ g5 ]  [ B e3 ] , [ g4 ]  An oversight perhaps. Paul gratefully captures the loose Pawn.
 [ R x e8 + ]  [ B x e8 ]  [ R x c3 ]  [ R d2 + ]  [ K g1 ] , [ R a2 ]  ... [ a5 ] was best.
 [ K f7 ] , [ N f6 ]  clearly the blootstein has been successful as my position continues to improve.
 [ K e2 ]  [ K d6 ]  [ K f3 ]  [ N d5 ] , [ c4 ]  ...and I pressure the knight with my QBP...
 [ B e2 ]  [ O-O ]  [ a4 ] , [ Q g5 ]  Interesting
 [ B x b6 ]  [ c x b6 ] , [ N g4 ]  ! There is no good way to meet the threat of ...Qxf2+.
 [ B d3 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ c4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ c6 ]  I think my Oppent should play [ c5 ] or xd5.
 [ R g7 ]  [ Q x d5 ]  [ e6 ]  [ Q x a5 + ] , [ K e7 ]  I looked at this position for a long time because I noticed that if I bring my knight forward with [ N e4 ] or [ N x c4 ] and attack his queen his queen only has 1 square to escape to in either case. In the first case she can escape to [ Q b6 ] offering to exchange queens which I do not want (I'm many pieces up but 2 of them aren't even playing). In the second case she escapes to [ Q g3 ] threatening checkmate. Instead I choose to play it safe here and bring my rook back to defend his counter attack.
 [ e6 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ e x d5 ]  This is the Florentine Gambit says the DB on Gameknot. Personally I've never heard of it! Let me know if you have and why it's considered a 'gambit'.
 [ R x b7 ] , [ B c4 ]  i want that pawn to stay there hendering the black bishop.
 [ Q b3 ]  [ R g7 + ] , [ K e8 ]  And Black resigns in the face of 43.[ B g6 + ] [ K d8 ] 44.Bf6++. Nor would 42...[ K e6 ] be any better: 43.[ N g5 + ] [ K d5 ] 44.[ R d7 + ] [ K c6 ] 45.[ R d6 + ] [ K c7 ] 46.[ N e6 + ] [ K b8 ] 47.[ R d8 + ] [ B c7 ] 48.[ B x c7 + ] [ K a8 ] 49.[ R x c8 + + ]  [ e5 ]  [ f4 ] , [ f5 ]  Interesting response for a King's Gambit. I'd never seen this one before so decided to have a little fun. This move opens up the king to potential check down the road depending upon moves made. By making this move Black is exposing his King in order for faster development.
 [ Q g6 ] , [ O-O ]  Once again I think that 10. [ d5 ] would have been better.
 [ N f3 ] , [ B g7 ]  as predicted
 [ Q x d8 ] , [ Q x c5 ]  A blunder. White must cover d2.
 [ N g5 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ f4 ]  [ h6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ R f e8 ]  [ c3 ]  [ R e2 ]  [ R d2 ]  [ R a e8 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ R e2 e1 + ]  [ R x e1 ]  [ R x e1 + ]  [ R d1 ]  [ R x d1 + ] , [ K x d1 ]  All even again. This becomes a pawn structure endgame.
 [ K h5 ]  [ K f6 ] , [ N c3 ]  Please let me play [ N d5 ] check! or why not play [ R d6 ] to stop the check so I can play [ N e4 ] check instead!
 [ B x d8 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ R f8 ]  [ B x d8 ]  [ N x d8 ]  [ R d7 ]  [ K c8 ]  [ R a d1 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ b4 ]  [ f4 ]  [ g x f4 ]  [ R x f4 ]  [ b5 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ R d7 d8 + ]  [ K c7 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ R f5 ]  [ N d5 + ] , [ K d7 ]  Attacking rook but white can go [ N e4 + ] or [ N e7 + ] and it is rook + knight + king v. knight + king all with a few pawns.
 [ Q d8 ]  [ B x h6 ]  [ Q e7 ] , [ N g5 ]  And black is lost. Thank you Roman for your great lesson on the french!
 [ Q g7 ] , [ B d4 ]  The Black Queen cannot avoid harassment without completely removing herself from the action.
 [ K f8 ] , [ R e8 # ]  The game is over taking quite a long time. A real wake up call on the 45th move.
 [ d5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ N x e4 ] , [ N f6 ]  Not sure that is best choice
 [ B e6 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ B x a2 ]  [ R b2 ] , [ B e6 ]  27...Bd5?? fails to 28.[ B x d5 ] [ N x d5 ] 29. Nd7! forking the Rooks.
 [ B d6 ] , [ a3 ]  9. [ a3 ] - discouraging a move such as [ N [ b4 ] ] and opening up the possibility of playing [ b4 ] myself.
 [ Q x d8 + ] , [ R x d8 ]  yep staying put on this line and if need be move my king tip toe style...
 [ g x f3 ] , [ R x f3 ]  As Darknite13 said himself: "This move of mine is a bit of an advanced strategy". He's totally right.. My position collapses and I would either loose my Queen or being checkmated. There's a wise lesson to be learned ! The following weeks I should attend more time on strategy tactics and development ! Thanks Ken for the patient approach and for the time spending on me and my training :)
 [ K f7 ]  [ R x e8 ] , [ K x e8 ]  25. .............. [ K x e8 ] - black deciding to bring his king closer to the centre chooses to move it to f7. This allows me to simplify further by exchanging the last pair of rooks. But the resulting B v Kt ending is not as simple as it looks.
 [ B x h6 ]  [ Q x h6 ]  [ R f c8 ] , [ R d3 ]  good move white brings the rook to the game while the rook defends the knight on [ [ c3 ] ] and avoids blacks any attempts to scarifies quality [ [ c3 ] ] to expose the white king . and in future maneuver the rook (d) to [ h3 ] and double it on H file. another strong move was 19.Rd5! black cant capture the rook on [ d5 ] because of mate threat [ Q x h7 + ] for example :19.Rd5!-Nxd5??.20.Qxh7+-Kf8.21.[ Q h8 # ] however after 19...Qd8-.20.g5-Nh5.21.Ng3-Qf8!.22.Qxf8+-Rxf8!.23.Nxh5-gxh5.24.Rxh5-f5! with little bit better position for black
 [ h5 ] , [ B x h5 ]  38. .... [ B x h5 ] - I am prepared to give up Fou Leblanc just to get rid of that e pawn. I will be still 2 material points ahead enough to force a win in the endgame.
 [ R g5 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ R g8 + ]  [ K c7 ]  [ g3 ]  [ B h6 ] , [ g4 ]  Ok now I hoped for him to fall for [ g5 ] when a knight fork makes him lose the pawn overlooking...
 [ R e1 ]  [ R x c4 ] , [ R d1 ]  Maybe 30.[ R d1 ] was better? White is unable to defend the [ [ c2 ] ] pawn now. The pawn structure is going from bad to gone. After 30.[ R d1 ] White could defend [ [ c2 ] ] although his position would be fast becoming very non-dynamic. Lacking dynamic counterplay when down material is not a good thing!
 [ R b3 + ]  [ K f2 ]  [ K g4 ] , [ R x a7 ]  We now reach an ending with a total of 6 pieces so after the game I was able to analyse this using a free on-line chess ending database. As I suspected it is drawn but it is hard to draw!
 [ b3 ]  [ Q b4 + ]  [ Q d2 ] , [ Q e4 ]  move to safety and take a central position
 [ B e8 ] , [ h5 ]  Finally I got a possibility to break up the position but I would have needed it earlier...
 [ R d4 ]  [ R a1 ] , [ d2 ]  Less dangerous than it seems.
 [ K b6 ] , [ B c6 ]  2
 [ B f5 ] , [ h6 ]  .
 [ Q g2 ] , [ Q d1 + ]  39. ...... [ Q d1 + ] - once the Witch goes to [ b1 ] there is a very tempting much bigger piece of jewellery on c2. But wait Glenda now sees her chance to go for the crown jewels!
 [ R x d4 ] , [ R x a6 ]  Perhaps this was over cautious but at this point I didn't want to risk a draw.
 [ B x g4 ] , [ N e5 ]  attacking the bishop
 [ B g5 ]  [ Q g6 ]  [ e x f5 ]  [ e x f5 ] , [ h x g4 ]  ?? Nope this move is still bad. Instead [ N x e5 ] [ Q x g5 ] 18. [ N x g4 + ] (White could go after the Rook with [ N g6 + ] but that seems risky; of course [ N f3 + ] fails to …Qe7) …[ Q e7 ] [ N e5 ] keeps a slight edge for White.
 [ R d2 ] , [ N f3 + ]  his chance to make that bishop finally useful.
 [ f1 = Q ] , [ e8 = Q + ]  What can black do here to salvage a draw? or is this a win for white? bearing in mind i had 3 mins left on time i accepted the draw
 [ Q c4 + ] , [ K f2 ]  This seems best.
 [ B h6 ]  [ N x d4 ] , [ Q g4 ]  Not wanting to yield [ e2 ] or f3.
 [ h3 ] , [ B d6 ]  ...and I bring up my dark-square bishop to undouble my pawns on the e-file as advancing my king's pawn would attack the pawn on [ f4 ] causing it to disappear...
 [ N f6 ] , [ c3 ]  Mainly played this to free up the queen that was tied to the defence of [ c2 ] this also allows the queen and [ f3 ] knight the opportunity to go elsewhere should the need arise [ Q b3 ] as a follow up looked interesting although the response ..[ b5 ] makes life a bit awkward after that.
 [ B d7 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ N x d4 ]  Probably better is [ e x d4 ] or [ N f6 ] as [ N x d4 ] this gives up control of the center.
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ d6 ]  [ h3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ N b d2 ]  [ c6 ]  [ e4 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B d3 ]  [ N b d7 ]  [ c3 ]  [ b5 ]  [ a3 ]  [ a5 ] , [ e5 ]  I lost some edge in the opening and I have to react someway.
 [ d5 ]  [ f4 ] , [ c5 ]  Black is playing aggresive. really interesting play from both sides :)
 [ d6 ]  [ b5 ]  [ K e7 ]  [ b4 ]  [ d7 ]  [ b3 ]  [ d8 = Q ] , [ Q x d8 + ]  
 [ c5 ]  [ Q e7 ]  [ b4 ]  [ h4 ]  [ a4 ] , [ e5 ]  would be great if he would exchange this pawn but white handles this wisely by ignoring this.
 [ h3 ] , [ f6 ]  Very risky but I was playing for fun.
 [ B c6 ] , [ R a e1 ]  Bring the rooks together to either attack or defend.
 [ R x f8 ]  [ e x f8 = Q + ]  [ B x f8 ]  [ K f5 ] , [ h4 ]  Would [ B e7 ] have won this for black? protect the pawn til the black king was in place to support the march from the front? I knew that with [ h4 ] that this was a drawn position.
 [ Q e2 ] , [ N c6 ]  My N is dreaming on [ c2 + ] and tempts white into the naive fork...
 [ Q x a4 ]  [ R d g8 ]  [ Q d4 ]  [ R x g3 ] , [ h x g3 ]  Another simplification only puts my weaknesses into sharper focus. I have a N for three pawns but it will take some gymnastics to get that piece into the game.
 [ N f5 ]  [ N c5 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ B x f5 ]  [ Q x f5 ]  [ N x a4 ]  [ b3 ]  [ N c5 ] , [ Q h3 ]  Queen to the corner? It seemed fine where it was.
 [ B x f4 ] , [ Q x d1 ]  how rude!
 [ a6 ]  [ B x c6 ] , [ b x c6 ]  ...and I get the opposite exchange this time my knight for his bishop. OK I've now isolated my rook's pawn on the queenside but it is currently defended by my rook and by my bishop but I am ahead on material even if it is only a pawn and the light squares are now slightly safer.
 [ K d1 ]  [ N x f2 + ]  [ K c1 ] , [ N d3 + ]  One of the hazards of scattered forces when your opponent has all the play. Forks turn up all over the place...
 [ R x a8 ] , [ B x f3 ]  So Black doesn't lose a whole rook after all. I'll append the rest of the game without much further comment.
 [ Q x c7 ] , [ N g6 ]  retreat of knight seems defensive but actually repositioning for a last attempt at a sneak checkmate
 [ e6 ] , [ N d b8 ]  One pawn down. Need to think about damage control now. What is my advantage? Developed pieces. Let's continue developing the pieces. As Bronstein used to say: "I'll give him a pawn he will use a tempo to take it I will make a useful move...".
 [ d4 ] , [ d5 ]  what can we do to prove that a blitz game actually happened and that you won? above we have the PGN notation taken from a recent game... about the only way to prove this game actually happened...
 [ N x h8 ] , [ d6 ]  I guess there was no rush to take the knight because it couldn't go anywhere without being taken.
 [ Q f4 ] , [ K e8 ]  By this point Black figured out the possibility to mate but now had to defend against a potentially devastating attack from the queen.
 [ O-O ] , [ O-O ]  Castling from both sides.
 [ N e2 ] , [ b6 ]  I brought my C knight back to [ e2 ] as I want to bring them together at [ f3 ] and g3. Black moved pawn out to [ b6 ] supporting his c and a pawns.
 [ Q e7 ]  [ N b5 ] , [ O-O ]  A nice chance given by black for white to get back into the game. 15. [ B x f6 ] [ N x f6 ] 16. [ Q h4 ] ... and white can develop his bishop and start to get the second rook into play.
 [ B f5 ]  [ R f4 ] , [ R e7 ]  White should not have left that open file.
 [ R b1 ]  [ R x b1 ]  [ B x b1 ]  [ f4 ]  [ K c5 ]  [ K f2 ] , [ B e4 ]  here [ K d4 ] was missed.
 [ R b6 x b7 ] , [ R c2 + ]  It's all over.
 [ b x c4 ]  [ d x c4 ]  [ B x c4 ]  [ N b6 ]  [ Q x b4 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ Q b2 ]  [ N x c4 ]  [ Q x b7 ]  [ N c4 a5 ]  [ Q b2 ] , [ B f8 ]  don't know what he thinking on the game but making O-O was good or may try [ R b8 ] here
 [ Q x d5 ] , [ B e4 ]  Taking control of the light squared diagonal as planned.
 [ c x d4 ]  [ Q x d4 ] , [ c5 ]  Now it becomes obvious - the black pawns on [ d4 ] and [ c4 ] control the center.
 [ Q f5 ] , [ R h2 + ]  check tempo
 [ B d7 ]  [ N x d7 ]  [ Q x d7 ]  [ R e7 ]  [ Q x a4 ]  [ b3 ]  [ Q b4 ] , [ Q x b4 ]  Black resign there is no defence to [ d7 ] - he will loose at least a rook.
 [ B f4 ] , [ B x d5 ]  Sees the threat
 [ K g2 ]  [ R b2 ]  [ Q c8 + ]  [ K g7 ] , [ Q f5 ]  My heart dropped after this. it was now that I realised what I had done.
 [ K d2 ]  [ N x h1 ]  [ R x h1 ]  [ R d4 ]  [ B c5 ] , [ R h d8 ]  ?? error (again) or stubborness?
 [ R f1 ] , [ N e7 ]  getting his knight out of harm's way and protecting the [ g6 ] pawn as it's defender will be gone very soon....
 [ d x e4 ]  [ Q x e4 ] , [ N e7 ]  17. ….. Ne7? - GASP!! here is the error - it loses a pawn and allows Glenda a decisive penetration into black's position!
 [ R c b1 ]  [ Q e7 ] , [ R f c1 ]  whites task is to hold that pawn from reaching the first rank. exchanging pieces along the way is acceptable since passed isolated pawns are weaker in the endings.
 [ R f4 ]  [ K g7 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N e8 ]  [ R e6 ]  [ N c7 ] , [ R e7 + ]  And black resigned because (Leontxo says) of the following moves that were not played.
 [ K d3 ]  [ R e3 + ]  [ K c4 ]  [ b5 + ]  [ K b3 ]  [ a5 ]  [ a3 ]  [ R e2 ]  [ K a2 ]  [ B x c3 ]  [ R b1 ]  [ B f d4 ]  [ K b3 ]  [ B c x b2 ]  [ R x b2 ] , [ R x b2 # ]  
 [ Q x c3 ] , [ a4 ]  My own QRP was under fire.
 [ N x d4 ]  [ Q x d4 ] , [ N f6 ]  I was expecting Black to try to force my queen out with tempo by playing something along the lines of c5. But in hindsight that would have caused issues for the development of Black's DSB. I'm actually not too sure what Black's best option would have been here so if someone in the comments could help that'd be wonderful.
 [ e5 ] , [ f4 ]  The King's gambit was one of the most important opening in the romantic age of chess. The theory teach us that accepting white's sacrifice is a better choice than refusing it with 2. ... [ B c5 ] or 2. ... d6.
 [ e5 ]  [ c3 ]  [ e x d4 ] , [ c x d4 ]  white is left with a strong center.
 [ N f6 ]  [ e3 ] , [ e5 ]  3. ....... [ e5 ] - hmm Freddy is allowing his opponent a lot of space in the centre.
 [ h x g4 ]  [ Q x g4 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ R x e5 ]  [ R f6 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ g x f6 ] , [ R x e7 + ]  !! great "sacrifice" it's still +9 for white
 [ B b4 + ]  [ B c3 ] , [ R c8 ]  Pinning the bishop to the queen.
 [ O-O ] , [ K f8 ]  ?! This is a bit of a waste of time now since white has already castled. Alternative variation: 17... [ B d4 + ] [!] 18. [ K h1 ] [ N f6 ] with the intention of playing ...[ K f7 ] on the next move
 [ g x h5 ] , [ a3 ]  Threatening 38 ... b3.
 [ Q e6 ] , [ e3 ]  This is better than Nc7. White now needs to castle. This frees up the bishop and shields the pawn. Plus black cannot stop [ N c7 ] at his point anyway. Note.. 13 moves in and black still hasn´t threatened white´s queen.
 [ d4 ]  [ e x d4 ] , [ N x d4 ]  take back the pawn and gain center
 [ R g6 ]  [ Q e5 ]  [ R c8 ]  [ R c1 ]  [ Q g8 ] , [ g3 ]  Stopping his counterattack. An endgame seems to be approaching.
 [ N c5 ]  [ b6 ]  [ N e4 ] , [ B e7 ]  At this point I'm wondering how my opponent is going to attack and if I should go super aggressive since my endgame will be rough.
 [ B x h5 ]  [ g x h5 ]  [ h4 ] , [ B g4 ]  Now I have a strong spy in White's kingside
 [ R a e1 ] , [ B f6 ]  Attacking my bishop and I just move it away still keeping the pin on his knight.
 [ O-O ]  [ B g2 ] , [ B b7 ]  And Black plays his bishop on the same diagonal to oppose mine.
 [ N e2 ] , [ Q d7 ]  Forcing more exchanges.
 [ c5 ] , [ Q f3 ]  !! -- The killer. Black is now forced to drop his Rook or a Knight or trade Queens and there's just no healthy way to swap ladies.
 [ h6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N c6 ]  [ c3 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ d x c5 ]  [ B c7 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ B d4 ]  [ N x f3 + ]  [ Q x f3 ]  [ Q x f3 ] , [ g x f3 ]  15. [ g x f3 ] - after blundering a pawn on my 10th move I try and negate white's advantage by shattering her kingside pawn structure.
 [ N f6 ]  [ f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ a6 ]  6. ..... [ a6 ] - this move characterises the Naijdorf. A credible alternative to this move is [ g6 ] which leads to the Sicilian Dragon. However I am quite OK with the Naijdorf and I choose the db option which steers me into the Naijdorf/Byrne Attack.
 [ R d8 ] , [ Q e3 ]  Threatening [ Q x e7 ] and Bb6.
 [ h x g4 ]  [ N d2 ] , [ B g7 ]  The idea is simply to attack the [ d5 ] pawn while protecting the [ h8 ] rook while attacking the [ h1 ] rook. The pawn can not be taken until the [ g3 ] bishop has departed but the move does apply pressure at 2 points on the board.
 [ f3 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ N x f5 ]  [ N x f5 ] , [ Q d2 ]  Allowing the castle protecting the c knight but blunder.
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ d6 ] , [ h3 ]  White loses a tempo. O-O is the standard line.
 [ g x h4 ]  [ B x h8 ]  [ h x g3 ]  [ f x g3 ]  [ B x g3 ] , [ R f1 ]  The bishop is lost anyway
 [ B x d6 ]  [ B x c6 + ] , [ b x c6 ]  2 pawns on the same line: I had to do it.
 [ B e3 ] , [ Q b6 ]  is a standard yet aggressive move by Black. Invites White to develop his Jumper (as they say in the Netherlands) to A4 and protecting it by c3- in the event Black checks with Qa5.
 [ Q a7 + ]  [ K d8 ]  [ Q b6 + ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ Q d4 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ R a d1 ] , [ K d7 ]  the pressure continue but the black now can develop all his pieces
 [ d5 ] , [ N x c5 ]  Maybe the pawn would have been easier but I have a thing for killing bishops
 [ B x e5 ] , [ g5 ]  Both players still missed the fact that black's bishop is attacking white's knight. White should have played 40. [ N x e5 ] to gain the pawn free and clear. Black defends his knight from the white bishop a move that is not his best option (even if 40. [ B x c6 ] were not on the board). As played white can exchange bishop for knight and when black recaptures the black pawns will be isolated and can no longer support each other. Of course [ B x c6 ] changes everything if only someobody will see it.
 [ N g6 ]  [ N d6 ]  [ R e d8 ] , [ a4 ]  the white Bishop will not let the black pawn go ahead.
 [ B e2 ] , [ a6 ]  the start of a very wrong idea...
 [ R x b8 ]  [ N x b8 ] , [ N b3 ]  ! Now it is over but this move is true beauty! 28.[ a x b3 ] [ Q a1 + ] leads into mate.
 [ Q d6 ] , [ N x c5 ]  White trades
 [ B x f4 ]  [ R e8 + ]  [ N e2 ]  [ N x e2 ]  [ B x e2 ] , [ B g4 ]  Decent pin but not much to do with it yet.
 [ N x b4 ] , [ Q x a7 ]  My first thought was [ B x b4 ] pressuring [ e7 ] and buying white time. The white idea seems to be 14.[ Q a8 + ] [ K d7 ] 15.[ N e5 + ] [ K e8 ] 16.[ Q x d8 + ] [ K x d8 ] 17.[ N x c6 + ] [ c x c6 ] but white misses black's next move.
 [ e5 ] , [ g3 ]  Planning on a flanchetto on king side.
 [ K g7 ]  [ Q x a6 ]  [ Q b2 ]  [ R a5 ]  [ Q c3 ]  [ R e7 ]  [ N f5 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ Q a1 + ]  [ K g2 ]  [ N x g3 ]  [ K x g3 ]  [ Q g1 + ]  [ K f3 ]  [ Q d1 + ]  [ K g2 ]  [ Q d7 ]  [ Q a8 ] , [ c6 ]  Probably the best move so far keeps white's queen out of things!
 [ B h4 ]  [ R f3 ]  [ R x e5 ]  [ R a f1 ] , [ R h5 ]  no real threat from black. white can slowly push black back and win due to material advantage.
 [ d x c6 ]  [ b x c6 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ Q x f6 ]  [ N e4 ] , [ Q d8 ]  White is I think slightly ahead on development and this forced retreat is not welcome.
 [ K d6 ]  [ K f8 ] , [ K d7 ]  And Black resigns.
 [ e3 ]  [ Q b6 ]  [ Q c1 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ c3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N b d2 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ h6 ]  [ h3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ B d7 ] , [ N e5 ]  Like the idea of my knight on this square
 [ N c3 ]  [ c5 ] , [ N f3 ]  According to the data base chances for white and black are close to even now. ( 49% to 47% )
 [ R d1 ] , [ N g3 ]  
 [ g6 ]  [ Q h4 ]  [ f6 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ B e6 ]  Black wants to exchange off the bishop.
 [ N x e3 ]  [ R x e3 ] , [ Q d8 ]  Attacking my knight.
 [ N e5 ] , [ N c d4 ]  26. [ N c d4 ] - a white centralised knight - whoppee doo!
 [ e x d4 ]  [ Q x d4 ]  [ Q x d4 ] , [ N x d4 ]  black is undeveloped while white has opened the table
 [ N x b3 + ]  [ N x b3 ]  [ a5 ] , [ N d4 ]  Do not underestimate the power of a central blockading knight.
 [ K f4 ]  [ e5 + ]  [ d x e5 + ]  [ d x e5 + ]  [ K e3 ]  [ K g5 ]  [ K d3 ]  [ f5 ]  [ K e3 ]  [ f4 + ]  [ K f3 ]  [ b5 ]  [ K e2 ]  [ b4 ]  [ h3 ]  [ b3 ]  [ K d2 ] , [ f3 ]  White cannot stop both passed pawns so he resigned here.
 [ Q e2 ]  [ Q x h1 ]  [ B g2 ] , [ Q x h2 ]  Black does not take the dare in taking Ng1: the Queen is getting awfully alone...
 [ R x a3 ] , [ B f5 + ]  Now white is a whole bishop up.
 [ N b d7 ] , [ c3 ]  Instead of the normal [ c4 ] white tries to limitate black's action.
 [ Q c7 ] , [ f x e4 ]  Not much black can do about the queenside pawns so might as well get some kingside captures.
 [ f3 ] , [ B d5 ]  Maybe better is 28. ...[ B b1 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ h6 ]  [ h3 ] , [ K f8 ]  Now that the kingside is stable Black king starts the long march towards the queenside. The first step is to defend the weak pawn structure and after try to win a pawn helped by the bishops and the knight.
 [ K e3 ] , [ B a6 ]  Too soon! It had to play first [ K e7 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ c6 ]  I think my opponent makes a mistake here. He's giving up a pawn in hopes of a quick development to Nc6...but i think he weakens his Queenside a lot in the process. But it was a point i never got to prove....
 [ c3 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ a3 ] , [ N e5 ]  17. ...... [ N e5 ] - I return my knight to its outpost.
 [ R c1 ] , [ b4 ]  If the c pawn falls the d pawn will follow and black will get one passed pawn.
 [ Q h6 ]  [ K e7 ]  [ f x g6 ]  [ R e h8 ]  [ Q g5 ]  [ Q x g5 ]  [ R x g5 ] , [ f6 ]  40. .......... [ f6 ] - the exchange of queens does not improve my position and I am now 2 pawns down. I play on for a few more moves with a heavy heart.
 [ f x g6 ]  [ f x g6 ] , [ R f2 ]  Rooks are preparing for an assault against Black king. Something must be done.
 [ N c x d6 ] , [ f5 ]  Now I knew it was over.........
 [ B f4 ] , [ d6 ]  I can go directly to [ d4 ] here. Still I stayed in my confort zone.
 [ c x d4 ] , [ N d5 ]  Following the capture of my [ d4 ] pawn I move my c knight to [ d5 ]  [ N x d5 ] , [ B d2 ]  As usual instead of retaking the knight following my knight's capture I move my bishop to d2. Aaargh I infuriate myself.
 [ B x a8 ] , [ Q x a8 ]  now his N on [ c3 ] is attacked. Why not move it? 15.Nd5? Ne2+. You can calculate the rest.
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ g3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ B g2 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ d3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ B e3 ] , [ Q a5 ]  An unusual move that caught me unprepared.
 [ B c6 ]  [ N c4 ]  [ Q c7 ] , [ N d6 ]  The knight is very happy there
 [ c6 ] , [ K e2 ]  ???? loses the bishop
 [ Q x h7 ]  [ K f7 ]  [ Q h5 + ]  [ K g8 ] , [ Q g6 ]  And I resigned. The only resource against the advance of the h-pawn is [ R d7 ] and this loses to [ R e8 ] check.
 [ Q d2 ] , [ N g6 ]  Now White has more freedom to develop. I would like to generate a firm attacking strategy but at the same time I need to connect my rooks and develop my B knight. [ N c3 ] seems week as it blocks the bishop and has a hard time getting to a more useful position. I would rather [ N d2 ] allowing [ N f1 ] and [ N g3 ] if needs be but the queen is in the way. I have gone with [ Q c3 ] as it allows the powerful [ d5 ] advance (threating mate and attacking the [ c6 ] knight) and allows Nb-d2.
 [ R b7 + ] , [ K a3 ]  running right into trouble: after [ K c4 ] [ R c7 + ] Kb5! [ B x b2 ] g5! Black can fight on...
 [ Q c6 ]  [ B x f8 ]  [ B x f8 ] , [ N e5 ]  advancing the knight
 [ R c1 ]  [ Q e2 ]  [ Q e5 ] , [ Q h5 ]  29. ...... [ Q h5 ] - in retrospect maybe I should have played a5.
 [ f x e5 ]  [ d x e5 ] , [ B h6 ]  And so the f-pawn never does get taken because white's next move is the last move of the game.
 [ N f6 ]  [ N x f6 + ] , [ e x f6 ]  17. ...... [ e x f6 ] - knight trade.
 [ K f5 ]  [ K g1 ]  [ Q c5 + ] , [ K h2 ]  52. [ K [ h2 ] ] - Henry takes refuge on [ h2 ] again.
 [ K e7 ] , [ N g3 ]  I am still protecting [ f5 ] and the g pawn seems blocked
 [ R d e2 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ g4 ]  [ h x g4 ]  [ f x g4 ]  [ B x g4 ]  [ R e2 e1 ] , [ B f5 ]  I still need to make accurate moves or this could end to draw.
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ g6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ e4 ]  [ d6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ O-O ] , [ B d3 ]  better was 6.[ B e2 ] the problem of 2.[ B d3 ] is that whites LSBs position is misplaced because of [ e4 ] pawn which blocks him that's why 6.[ B e2 ] is better because the bishop doesn't interrupts his own pieces .
 [ K h8 ] , [ N f3 ]  ...so the horsie goes in help charged with poison.
 [ d x e5 ] , [ Q h5 ]  White threatens mate on f7.
 [ N c3 ]  [ B g7 ] , [ f4 ]  4. f4. I come to like and regret this move equally the main downside being that several squares ([ e4 ] [ g3 ] [ g4 ] and f3) are weakened. Benefits similar to d4.
 [ R b8 ]  [ Q x a6 ]  [ B x f3 ] , [ g x f3 ]  Not really a weakness as it simply strengthens White's center and his king is perfectly safe.
 [ d4 ] , [ g6 ]  Ive been experimenting with 1 [ g6 ] as a answer to 1 [ d4 ] recently.
 [ b3 ] , [ N d6 ]  Due to my preventive overprotection of the central pawns his lsb is not playing at all.
 [ R e8 ]  [ e x f5 ]  [ B x f5 ]  [ B x f5 ] , [ N x f5 ]  This is one reason why I moved my knight to d4. I didn't want to have to retake with my pawn on g6.
 [ d5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ f6 ]  [ e3 ]  [ e6 ] , [ B e2 ]  My idea here is to play it somewhat like the Dutch with the colors reversed.
 [ Q a4 ]  [ Q x a4 ] , [ B x a4 ]  So I'm now 2 pawns up but in a tricky position with K exposed against 2 bishops and 2 rooks..... I need to simplify further and I can now afford to sacrifice a pawn to do so because I'll still be a pawn up for the endgame
 [ a3 ]  [ B a5 ] , [ B d3 ]  Preparing to castle but also commanding the diagonal b1-[ h7 ] again attacking the area around where the black king will be after he castles.
 [ B b7 ]  [ d4 ]  [ R e8 ] , [ N b d2 ]  This knight is heading for [ f1 ] and then g3. (A common motif for white in the Ruy Lopez.)
 [ R x d4 ]  [ c x d4 ] , [ a7 ]  Black resigns.
 [ R g8 + ] , [ K h1 ]  Was bound to come sooner or later!
 [ R x e7 + ]  [ N x e7 ]  [ Q x d7 + ]  [ K x d7 ] , [ B f5 + ]  Now we get to see the importance of the [ R a d1 ] move not so much for the discovered check but if it was not there then Black could escape to [ c6 ] without the threat of checkmate and Black would ultimately win. Perhaps Dufresne saw this combination earlier too but just assumed [ B b5 ] which would have led to victory for Black also.
 [ B c3 ]  [ B e5 ] , [ B d2 ]  he refuse
 [ N x e4 ] , [ c4 ]  Since [ c3 ] was under a double attack I couldn't see anything better. Black can of course force the DSB off now.
 [ Q c2 + ] , [ R c3 ]  The only move.
 [ R h d1 ]  [ B x d2 ] , [ R x d2 ]  The Knight was the only defender of the [ c4 ] pawn. Now I can reclaim my material disadvantage (though not my positional one)
 [ e x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ] , [ Q e2 + ]  ?! Not sure about this as it blocks in my B and leaves [ d4 ] undefended.
 [ N x h4 ]  [ R g1 + ]  [ K e2 ]  [ R x d1 ]  [ R x d1 ] , [ e6 ]  preventing the [ d4 ] push and increasing control over [ f5 ]  [ R g1 ] , [ N d7 ]  I am preparing to develop my bishop along the b7-[ h1 ] diagonal to increase control over the [ e4 ] square and to defend against [ R g1 ]  [ R g8 ]  [ b6 ]  [ B e4 ] , [ B b7 ]  The battle of the bishops is on
 [ N x d5 + ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ B d3 ] , [ Q d4 ]  Saving the d-pawn which like so much of my pawn-structure has become isolated. But am ahead by knight and bishop to two pawns so this does not matter much to me.
 [ K g7 ]  [ R e a1 ]  [ K g6 ] , [ R a2 a7 ]  Black is using his king actively rather than passively sitting back waiting to be hunted. It's kind of like bringing the goalie out of the goal box - it adds one more piece to black's arsenal. Still his pieces are in each others' way and he's probably feeling a little cramped. White should be able to exploit that.
 [ Q g5 ]  [ R d1 + ]  [ K e6 ] , [ Q e3 + ]  White forces the Queen trade and the rest is pretty simple
 [ R d8 ]  [ Q x e4 ] , [ f5 ]  Thinking that all was lost I start being super aggressive and push pawns
 [ N e7 ]  [ h4 ]  [ N c8 ]  [ h5 ]  [ N c b6 ] , [ f5 ]  White can even have some attack!
 [ R b1 ] , [ N x f2 ]  Creating an advanced passed Pawn.
 [ K f8 ]  [ N x f6 ]  [ g x f6 ] , [ Q h5 ]  Although the game continued for a little longer it does not last more then 5 moves from now. In fact I think that it ends in 2-3 moves at this point. With that in mind I resign very shortly after this. So why didn't I annotate anymore? Because unlike before this time the positions are identical to the actual game except for this move. After that however I completely lost track of what was played because he started showing me what went wrong as I was getting ready to resign. BTW that does not usually happen but this is an extenuating circumstance. Around this point things have to end or there will be no time to see the game that Jack wants to show and I would certainly do anything to see it even if I had to end things early. But how was this game lost? Well he plays something like [ Q x h7 ] winning a free pawn and that is the very least of my problems. After that his Queen does reach the 8th rank resulting in a very serious check but I am not exactly sure exactly how it happened. And it's not quite the same as this position which is why I did not continue the annotation. What I do know however is that after the check I would have been forced to give up my Rook in order to avoid mate. After that he told me that I would be too far behind in material to have any hope of catching up so the game is dead lost at this point even with best play. Now he taught me something very interesting after showing the game and this happened while we were packing up and saying goodbye for this week. What he told me is the moral of this game and pretty similar to the game he showed about the importance of paying attention. Therefore what is the lesson? Well in chess you always have to pay attention and concentrate not just on the position but your opponents mistake as well which is why he tests people. If I had focused a little more I would have seen his mistake and won the Queen so like my game against bigpeta I had a win that I threw away. However there is more then meets the eye. Paying attention to and understanding the positions take time. As he said "It doesn't happen in just one second". So the idea is to take your time and concentrate on your opponents mistakes. If you take enough time to absorb the information you will be able to take advantage of your opponents blunders and ultimately pull a win even in a losing position.
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ c4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ e3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N b d7 ]  [ R c1 ] , [ c6 ]  A very typical Queen's Gambit position where Black is waiting for White to move the bishop before playing ...dxc4.
 [ Q d2 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ h3 ]  [ b5 ]  [ B d5 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ R b8 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B e6 ]  [ c3 ]  [ f5 ]  [ N g5 ] , [ B x d5 ]  I guess this is where I messed up. Rather than taking the [ d5 ] knight I should have taken the [ g5 ] knight. He takes it with the bishop I move Queen to [ d7 ] and he will probably do [ Q d3 ] or f3.
 [ R g6 ]  [ B x h5 ]  [ R x g5 ]  [ B x f7 + ]  [ K x f7 ]  [ R d2 ] , [ K g6 ]  28. .. [ d4 ] was also possible. White could only go for a draw with 29.[ f4 ] [ R f5 ] 30.[ K g1 ] ex[ f4 ] 31.Bx[ d4 ] [ R x e2 ] 32.[ R x e2 ] [ B x e2 ] 33.Rx[ f4 ] Rx[ f4 ] 34.[ g x f4 ]  [ R x d5 ]  [ B x e2 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ B x f3 ]  [ R d x e5 ]  [ R g x e5 ] , [ B x e5 ]  After this combination it is rather clear that the game is drawn. Black will exchange rooks.
 [ e4 ] , [ e5 ]  As I see with players at the chess club. I mean not just Jack but all the members except for Tom whenever I open with the King's Pawn Opening they answer with the King's Pawn Game.
 [ c5 ] , [ e3 ]  After c5[ x d4 ] e3[ x d4 ] allows white to build with [ [ c3 ] ] the block against the [ g8 ] bishop. But it leaves the diagonal open to the black's white square bishop in [ b7 ] (this happened in this same game). White should have had the ability to reply [ d5 ] to this move so N[ [ c3 ] ] was needed no matter the pressure on the black diagonal. L'idea è sempre quella di costruire la fortezza complementando questa con [ [ c3 ] ] e poi giocare a spingere i pedoni sul lato di re. Ha funzionato molte volte.
 [ B b7 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ R d8 ]  [ f4 ] , [ d3 ]  There's no stopping my passed pawns as they are supported by the rooks and eachother.
 [ N d6 ] , [ R g4 ]  Attacking the weak [ a4 ] pawn and driving the knights out of the centre. With 2 pawns in the centre Anand will be looking to push one to promotion
 [ B x f4 ] , [ Q x f4 ]  Remember how you felt a few moves ago that White had a small spatial advantage but Black should have counterplay? Compare that with the position now. White has only a Bishop and a pawn for his Rook but his positional advantages are now huge.
 [ B x c3 ]  [ b x c3 ]  [ a x b5 ] , [ R e1 ]  Yet chess is not easy which is something I also wanted this student to learn. So with that being said I am thinking along the lines of TA's Q sacs where he wins after giving up his Q for the [ f2 ] or [ f7 ] pawn. Therefore I realized that against this student I might be able to get counterplay as I did with superandy when I blundered my Queen early. I also realize that she might not allow me to get counterplay and should even win. Bearing in mind that I could lose if it was going to happen I was not going to make easy for knightrider to win. The idea is that a student could learn even if they won but you must make it very difficult as easy19 does this. That's what happened with Mary. When I coached she won but also learned and something important became second nature due to how difficult I made it for her.
 [ B x h3 ]  [ g x h3 ]  [ Q x h3 ] , [ N h2 ]  ?? I am not sure why white played this. But in my opinion it's a blunder because black will further liquidate but more important white's K will become exposed. Therefore I think it's safe to conclude that black is winning. However I don't know if white has anything to counter it. If the two players were the same strength then I'd think otherwise. However stronger player can and does things that will throw the opponents off guard. An example happened in a game that Mr. Stockel annotated. It was with GM Bobby Fischer against his opponent. Now Fischer played a move that everyone including the computer thought was a losing blunder that would lose the game (and I forget the variations btw). But Fischer saw something that no onelse did. And what appeared to be a losing mistake was in reality the winning move.
 [ a6 ] , [ Q d2 ]  Both [ a6 ] and [ Q d2 ] are the most popular moves in this position - although of course at the time I didn't know that.
 [ K h1 ]  [ B x e1 ]  [ N x d6 ] , [ Q f3 + ]  Takes rook knight can take black rook but its too late
 [ c4 ]  [ B b4 + ]  [ N c3 ] , [ N e4 ]  Has to be worth doing
 [ R e6 ] , [ B e3 ]  25. [ B e3 ] - retreat forced if Glenda tries to back him up with [ Q e3 ] then [ K h7 ] could be problematical for Fou Lenoir!
 [ g6 ]  [ Q a5 ]  [ R a c8 ]  [ R x c8 ]  [ R x c8 ]  [ R c1 ]  [ R x c1 + ]  [ B x c1 ]  [ B c7 ]  [ Q c5 ]  [ Q x c5 ] , [ d x c5 ]  All the big pieces have traded; now the winner is going to be the person who can get another queen. I'm still a pawn up but I'm worried that he might be able to block my king from getting to his side of the board.
 [ Q e2 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ B x f6 ] , [ B x f6 ]  Alekhine now plans to plant his Knight on QB5...
 [ R x f5 ] , [ R x f5 ]  I think 29. ... Rxf5? needs a question mark. Black evidently had a plan of forking the white rooks but it won't work. Even if it did work giving up the exchange in order to win the exchange simply means making an even exchange of a black rook+piece for a white rook+piece and even exchanges of pieces do not favor black when he's down by two pawns.
 [ c5 ]  [ g4 ] , [ f x g4 ]  If white does not take the pawn now then 40 ... p-[ g3 ] ! and black can gain another queen (since white's pawn on [ f2 ] cannot capture black can advance his pawn another space to g2)
 [ B x d4 ]  [ R g8 ]  [ R c2 ]  [ N g5 ]  [ Q h4 ]  [ N f e4 ] , [ R a2 ]  Unpinning the knight?
 [ e4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N d2 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f d7 ] , [ f4 ]  Maybe too soon to open here
 [ Q x a7 + ] , [ K c6 ]  and now a queen exchange is forced
 [ Q c6 ] , [ Q h6 ]  [ Q x c2 ] threatens mate
 [ K e2 ] , [ R e5 x e3 + ]  Another sacrifice to remove yet another defender.
 [ Q x g3 ] , [ f6 ]  Pretty much necessary. At this point White has a slight edge.
 [ K x c1 ]  [ B x a3 + ] , [ K c2 ]  I had to be careful here because if the white rook got out it could have skewered my bishops or my rook.
 [ K f5 ]  [ Q c2 + ]  [ K e5 ]  [ B x h6 + ]  [ N e4 ]  [ B x g7 + ]  [ K e6 ]  [ Q x e4 + ]  [ K f7 ]  [ B x h8 ] , [ N c5 ]  at this point i feel like i am already victorious either way but [ Q x h8 ] look much stronger material wise+ strengthening the [ f6 ] square
 [ Q g6 ]  [ b4 ]  [ Q e6 + ]  [ N e2 ] , [ b6 ]  ? Black inexplicably offers up his a rook as a free sacrifice.
 [ e x d5 ] , [ Q x d5 ]  A beginer mistake. It was better to play [ N f6 ] and after [ B b5 ] c6! or [ B c4 ] [ N x d5 ] 0-0
 [ f3 ]  [ a5 ] , [ R d4 + ]  Again "Patzer sees check...". Is there a point to this move? If white wants to queen one of his pawns he will need to cut the black king off so [ R e4 ] would accomplish that and after [ K f4 ] the g pawn could get moving. This move just lets the black king take a free move.
 [ B f4 ] , [ R h e8 ]  The c7-pawn is off limits due to the opening of the c-file for Black which White will not be able to contest due to his backwards development.
 [ R x e1 ] , [ K x f7 ]  Then he grabs the Knight. Now 24.[ Q c4 + ] [ K f8 ] 25.[ R e7 ] is pretty strong but Black might go to g6...
 [ e4 ] , [ h6 ]  An unusual opening the Carr's defence (B00).
 [ R h g8 ] , [ N e5 ]  seeking for play; maybe better [ R a e1 ] [ Q c7 ] Re5...
 [ K c5 ]  [ K b7 ] , [ R x b6 + ]  Success. The game has turned unexpectedly for me.
 [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ B b5 ]  The Rossolimo variation. White doesn't want to enter the Sveshnikov and as such postpones playing [ d4 ] for the time being.
 [ Q d7 + ]  [ N e7 ]  [ Q x b7 ]  [ Q x e2 ]  [ R e1 ] , [ Q d2 ]  I theaten ...G5 with my next move deflecting the only defender of [ g2 ] and check mate.
 [ K h1 ] , [ R b5 ]  To chase away the white bishop.
 [ K f8 ]  [ Q x c4 ] , [ R x e2 ]  Time pressure! [ b5 ] was better.
 [ R e1 ] , [ Q f5 ]  ? Much better is bringing the queen to the queenside by Qd8-[ Q a5 ]  [ g4 ] , [ Q f3 ]  Still not very good.
 [ Q x d5 ] , [ N c3 ]  Gaining a tempo by attacking the queen and develops another piece.
 [ B g2 ] , [ B e7 ]  I want to get out of the center.
 [ f6 ] , [ R c2 c6 ]  There we go. Pressure building.
 [ B x f6 ]  [ N d5 ] , [ N e7 ]  By interposing the knight between the black queen and bishop the only piece protecting that bishop is the pawn in front of the king. This works towards my tactic of disrupting the kingside pawns.
 [ N x e6 ] , [ f4 ]  Now: I'm squeezed which means I have to play with great care. If I exchange I'll give him the B's pair power. But any attack discovers weak points. I found white's.
 [ B f5 ] , [ a4 ]  The advance begins!
 [ R e2 ] , [ d5 ]  White's pawn on [ e4 ] is pinned. Again. The rook at [ e2 ] is defended but white needs that rook to protect the knight on d2.
 [ N d2 ] , [ N d3 ]  If I knew how to put an "!" on my move I would. I added my Queen to bodyguard the pawn on e4. My Knight Block's his Queen and now almost all of the Black squares on White's first two ranks are unsafe for his pieces.
 [ N b6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B e7 ]  [ a4 ]  [ a5 ]  [ e3 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ h3 ]  [ B e6 ] , [ d4 ]  Because I dislike Qp games i usually try to avoid playing [ d4 ] for as long as possible to make it harder for black to transpose into one of the Qp lines. However here i had no sensible alternative
 [ h4 ]  [ h6 ] , [ N h3 ]  Aiming the [ f4 ] square
 [ O-O-O ] , [ B x a2 ]  Round about here I could have lost the game! My mobile phone went off and I rushed out of the palying area to answer it. Afterwards the Gameknot player frebec who also plays in the same over-the-board tem pointed out that my opponent could have claimed the game. It was my live-in girl friend she had forgotten I had a chess game. She asked me when I would be back. I told her it depended on how long the game went on for. She told me to try to be quick!
 [ K c5 ]  [ R c2 ] , [ R f5 f3 ]  This is the rook that had to protect since otherwise on 37. R1[ f3 ] Rc3ch 38. [ R x c3 ] Kxf5!
 [ B x f3 ]  [ N x f3 ] , [ e5 ]  Mmm move the king to safety
 [ B d2 ] , [ B c5 ]  Hitting [ f2 ]  [ d4 ] , [ Q e2 ]  13 [ B d2 ] [ R f8 ]  [ f x e3 ] , [ Q h4 + ]  Stopping triple 0
 [ K g2 ]  [ Q d2 + ] , [ K h3 ]  ?
 [ g4 ] , [ h x g4 ]  He thinks that he cannot allow gxN but in fact but in fact white's kingside is about to fall.
 [ N f6 ] , [ c4 ]  It must be noted that I cant take all of the credit for the ideas in this game. I study the games of Vladimir Kramnik heavily and this idea comes from the 7th round of the Monte Carlo Amber Rapid -- Kramnik-Anand 1994.
 [ b x c6 ] , [ B e3 ]  A unassuming move that overlooks a certain knight reprisal by black.
 [ Q e8 ] , [ N f1 ]  With this move I tried to redeploy my Knight to a more useful square. My position is cramped but the extra material compensates.
 [ e4 ] , [ N c6 ]  Right away my opponent goes away from the Classical lines.
 [ e x d6 ] , [ B d2 ]  At last now my rook can race to defend my king and save the day!! :/
 [ N x d4 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ a6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ B e3 ] , [ N e7 ]  Pretty standard fare for the Sicilian until I pull off this N in front of the K. I prefer the support for the opposite side N.
 [ B x f6 ]  [ R x d8 + ]  [ B x d8 ]  [ R d1 ]  [ B b6 ]  [ R d6 ]  [ B g1 ]  [ h3 ]  [ B h2 ]  [ K f3 ]  [ e5 ]  [ g3 ]  [ e x f4 ]  [ g x f4 ] , [ B g1 ]  the work is done...
 [ c x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ B x e7 ]  [ N x e7 ] , [ B d3 ]  so far i think im slightly better...
 [ N f1 ] , [ N b6 ]  ?! I don't like this; the knight does nothing here. Again 11. ... [ f6 ] 12. ef Nx[ f6 ] was preferable to untangle black's position a bit I think. I don't have to take of course but then 12. [ N g3 ] (say) fe 13. de [ Q c7 ] and the e-pawn is coming under a bit of fire.
 [ B e4 ] , [ Q x e5 ]  White is superior in space control and Black should be carefull retreting his Queen.
 [ d5 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c6 ]  [ e4 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ N x e4 ] , [ N d7 ]  This is the opening Kasparov played against Deep Blue in the last game of their match. However this game deviates from that one with the next move.
 [ B b6 ] , [ a4 ]  White continues an admirably aggressive approach hoping to trap the black-square bishop. Pawn rushes like these must be treated carefully. Even though the danger is somewhat minimized by having the kings castled on the same side the strategy can succeed in disabling black's development or fail by overextending white's pawns. The difference between success and failure in pawn rushes is subtle.
 [ O-O ]  [ f x e6 ] , [ Q x b7 ]  The knight is more valuable than the pawn.
 [ B e7 ]  [ Q g3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B x h6 ]  [ N h5 ]  [ Q g4 ]  [ B f6 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ Q d8 ]  [ Q x h5 ] , [ N d4 ]  Crushing?
 [ B g5 ]  [ h6 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ e x f6 ]  [ e4 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ B x f3 ]  [ Q x f3 ]  [ a6 ]  [ B x c6 + ]  [ b x c6 ]  [ O-O-O ]  [ B e7 ]  [ d5 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ R x d5 ]  [ Q x d5 ]  [ N x f6 + ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ Q x d5 ]  [ O-O ]  [ R e1 ]  [ B h4 ]  [ g3 ]  [ B g5 + ]  [ f4 ]  [ B f6 ]  [ h4 ]  [ R f d8 ]  [ Q c6 ]  [ R a b8 ]  [ Q x c7 ]  [ B x b2 + ]  [ K b1 ] , [ B e5 + ]  The amazing check!
 [ g x h6 ] , [ B h8 ]  ? The king is better placed here. Gameknot reckons instead on 20. ... [ N g3 ] forcing white to waste a move recapturing. Material would then be even but white is on the attack.
 [ B d6 ]  [ B x f4 ] , [ B x f4 ]  Now of course [ Q e2 + ] becomes possible and white can develop his lsb.
 [ N x e3 ]  [ f x e3 ] , [ R h f8 ]  here and on the next move black should have done more to restrain the backward pawn
 [ d4 ] , [ R a e8 ]  18. ..... [ R a e8 ] - following through with my plan mentioned in my last note.
 [ Q g4 + ]  [ K h7 ]  [ Q f4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ Q f5 + ]  [ g6 ]  [ Q b1 ]  [ Q c4 ]  [ h5 ]  [ b4 ]  [ h x g6 + ]  [ f x g6 ]  [ Q d1 ]  [ Q d4 ] , [ Q b3 ]  45. [ Q f3 ] is rather ineffective considering 45... e4.
 [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ d6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ O-O ] , [ B d3 ]  White's development is easy. Black's Queenside usually takes some time to untangle.
 [ b4 ]  [ Q e5 ] , [ N c1 ]  I think that is the best move(27. [ N x c3 ] [ R x c3 ] or [ d x c3 ] and black is even more dangerous!
 [ N d3 ] , [ R h f1 ]  No idea why I played this but I was running low on ideas.
 [ e5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B b4 ] , [ N f3 ]  With the aggressive [ B b4 ] feeling I want to get another piece in play before brining out my own bishop-- usually I do [ B c4 ] my third move.
 [ Q x d7 ]  [ Q x d7 + ]  [ K h4 ]  [ g5 + ]  [ K h5 ]  [ Q f7 + ]  [ K x h6 ]  [ Q f6 + ]  [ K h5 ]  [ R h8 + ]  [ K g4 ] , [ Q f4 # ]  
 [ B d7 ] , [ R e1 ]  Occupying the half-open e-file and setting up potential pins that could lead to gain of material.
 [ c4 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ h3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ d3 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N e2 ] , [ O-O ]  Black is castling Kingside. Whites castling is delayed at least three moves left.
 [ Q c7 ]  [ B e4 ] , [ b5 ]  White pins the pawn to the Rook and threatens to win it so Black responds with a kick to the Queen which must now retreat to c2.
 [ d3 ] , [ h6 ]  This is perhaps premature but in some games in the past [ B g5 ] has been annoying and there is no great disparity in development.
 [ N f1 ] , [ Q b6 ]  !? This took me by surprise but I couldn't see any advantage to this over the more normal ...[ Q c7 ] or continuing with redeploying the DSB. Later in the game though the Q provided a useful defence of Black's third row from here.
 [ K g7 ]  [ Q g5 ]  [ R d e8 ]  [ Q f6 + ]  [ K h7 ] , [ h4 ]  If White can divert than B off [ g6 ] he can deliver mate on g7.
 [ Q c2 ] , [ B f5 ]  ?? - This is the move that loses me the game. I was playing it out in my head to exchange the knight first then make this move. Unfortunately this is not what happened in the game. A rare lapse by me.
 [ K g8 ] , [ Q h7 # ]  34. [ Q h7 ] MATE!! - Oh dear oh dear oh dear the checkmate that I had been trying to avoid for many moves has taken place. Not a very nice picture. Now what have we learned from this ..... well ..... maybe eating poisoned pawns causes terrible squitters or worse ..... so think before you grab I thought it was OK but I should have perhaps analysed more carefully. Maybe you the jury have some more ideas to put in the mix here. Anyhow - to all of you - HAPPY NEW YEAR!! - Joanne
 [ B x b3 ]  [ a x b3 ] , [ R a d8 ]  White has added superior pawn structure and central dominance to his space advantage. This is more than enough for the win.
 [ K d1 ] , [ c6 ]  I can let white take b7. I'll lose an exchange but I will be able to use the tempo.
 [ R x c3 ]  [ f x g6 ] , [ R x b3 + ]  And so black finally gets rid of the white LSB at the cost of an exchange. Not many other possibilities here though. The white king gets a bit airy and now Black is constantly looking ways to exploit it.
 [ N x c3 ]  [ B g5 + ]  [ K e8 ]  [ B x d8 ]  [ Q x d8 ] , [ Q x a8 ]  24. [ Q x a8 ] - white has a terrific material advantage after this. His opponent plays on a few moves however.
 [ K f3 ]  [ B a5 ]  [ K e3 ] , [ K e6 ]  33. ......... [ K e6 ] - both kings centralise themselves for the endgame.
 [ R f c1 ] , [ N c6 ]  ?? ...Qby is a must. The queen must concede the c-file. This gives two minor pieces for the rook
 [ K h1 ]  [ Q f5 ] , [ Q d2 ]  white avoids the exchange.
 [ N f4 ]  [ B x d4 ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ N d1 ]  [ Q g5 ]  [ g4 ]  [ Q h4 ]  [ N f2 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ B e5 ]  [ N d3 ]  [ N x d3 ]  [ Q x d3 ]  [ R a c8 ]  [ N e2 ]  [ c6 ]  [ f4 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ e5 ]  [ B e7 ] , [ d6 ]  Three pawns moves drive the black bishop inexorably back.
 [ N x f1 ]  [ R e8 + ]  [ B f8 ] , [ Q x d4 ]  20 [ R x f1 ] [ Q x b5 ] 21 [ R f e1 ] [ b6 ] 22 [ Q x d4 ] Bb7-+ according to Fritz
 [ Q b5 ]  [ Q d6 ]  [ R a e8 ] , [ R e2 ]  He obviously intended to stack rooks but missed my queen on the diagonal. In addition attempting to stack them on the file I controlled was less than ideal.
 [ e4 ] , [ N d7 ]  I anticipated his pawn move to [ d5 ] so I move my pawn to [ [ e4 ] ] locking up the center. The resulting shift in the pawn structure shapes my strategy. I plan on making a king-side attack with my pawns supported by my knights while leaving my king in the center of the board...... KO prefers Q-[ e2 ] a developing move. N-[ c4 ] was another possibility increasing my presence on the queenside. One thing to keep in mind about [ [ e4 ] ] it does lock in my king’s bishop..... Black’s knight move gives the base of his center pawn chain added protection in case I go for eventual pawn break on f4.
 [ N x a4 ]  [ Q x a4 ] , [ N x d4 ]  Free pawn and threatens my queen.
 [ K c7 ] , [ Q x a8 ]  Why not? I don't really like taking my queen out of action locking her away in a dusty corner far from her king but despite black being developed all over the place while white is not none of that development seems to present a very credible attack in the immediate future so I grab the rook while the grabbing is good.
 [ a3 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ B x e6 ] , [ Q x e6 ]  threatening [ Q a2 ] which could be uncomfortable for white
 [ B g2 ]  [ b4 ] , [ B x h3 ]  I take the pawn
 [ R c c2 ]  [ K e7 ]  [ a4 ] , [ R c5 x c4 ]  The [ a4 ] pawn is on black menu too. After that the plan is a simple advance of the b and a pawn supported by both rooks and the knight. Note waht a strong position the knight has on e5.
 [ B a1 ] , [ a4 ]  I really need to unpin this Knight but for the moment I'll add a guard.
 [ B x d6 ] , [ Q x d6 ]  i hate this situation i can't castle my LSB is vulnrable he is well developed I'm not
 [ R f d8 ]  [ K f1 ]  [ B x f3 ]  [ B x f3 ] , [ R d2 ]  [?] Black was fixated on achieving the typically favorable position of paired rooks on an oppo­nent’s second rank but overlooked that he must separate his own rooks to do so pin­ning his bishop to the rook on the d-file. This would not be a problem if the bishop could be attacked by only a rook but White’s next move reveals such is not the case. He would have been better off playing to clear the rooks off the board with 21.… [ B d6 ] and seeing if his bishop pair could over­work White’s bishop and knight though the symmetrical pawn structure suggests White’s offer of a draw was well considered. Now this move required preparation with 22.… Ra1.
 [ N x g2 ] , [ R x g2 ]  Black went in for the exchange of minors simplifying my defensive task.
 [ B e7 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ h6 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ e3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ] , [ B b5 ]  Oh I see pinning my other knight.
 [ N x a6 ] , [ Q d3 ]  Is your queen really better placed here? I don't think so. The immediate [ N f4 ] was better. Black will not capture on [ c2 ] because he cannot afford to lose the pawn on e6.
 [ O-O-O ] , [ a3 ]  further preparation for the Q-side attack. The b-pawn needs support.
 [ e5 ]  [ K g2 ]  [ K h6 ] , [ R x a6 ]  Free material.
 [ K e7 ] , [ B e3 ]  His king is going nowhere
 [ e x f5 ]  [ Q x f5 ] , [ O-O ]  Finally Blacks King finds safety.
 [ N d5 ]  [ B e4 ]  [ R x e5 ]  [ B f3 ]  [ B c8 ] , [ c4 ]  ? Ok not only was the move a mistake but I did not have a good attitude here. And it typically happens when I finally realize that I'm fault. Remember how I learned that unsound aggression and cheapo tactics aren't good unless you're lost and know your opponent can go wrong if they're not careful. They'll likely see the threat so you do just about anything to stay in. It's called a defeatistic attitude which is sometimes the wrong approach. My idea is that since I had absolutely nothing else to lose I'll do anything to stay in. So I decide to march right after his ION's because once he moved I'd have tempo and could maybe get counterplay. That's not so. This kind of thing also happened in my game against Jack about two weeks ago. I was at a disadvantage and nearly lost so I tried anything to stay in. That time I went for an easy to drive off mate threat knowing that he had a strong edge. I figured that I was lost and so there was nothing else to lose. But I had to think defensively as opposed to aggressively. He said that had I done that the game might have still ended in a draw. But the approach I took lost instantly. So the idea is that no matter how bad the situation even if you're lost sometimes you have to think defensively as opposed to aggressively. This is now something that I emphasize to students because I realize that this is a common where sometimes you're aggressive because you're lost but thinking defensively is what you have to do instead. And the way to remember it is what pawntificator said in the WTWLTR which is not to have a defeatistic attitude because as we know it's not over until it's over. Having said all of that this move loses yet another pawn. So without further adue best was 33.[ R d1 ] in this position. 33...[ B e6 ] 34.[ B x d5 ] [ R x d5 ] 35.[ R a1 ] [ R d3 ] 36.[ R x a6 ] [ R x h3 ] 37.[ R x b6 ] [ R x c3 ] 38.[ b5 ] [ B x g4 ] 39.[ R c6 ] [ R f3 + ] 40.[ K g1 ] [ B d7 ] 41.[ R c5 ]  [ N x b4 ]  [ R b1 ]  [ a5 ]  [ R d1 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ R d6 ]  [ B x c4 ]  [ R x b6 ]  [ N d3 + ]  [ K g3 ]  [ a4 ]  [ h4 ]  [ a3 ] , [ R c6 ]  ?? The ultimate blunder. Yes the game was lost but this loses immediately however. The idea here since I make that mistake of being aggressive rather then defensive is march right after the B. I know he won't allow it but now even if "To take is a mistake" I do so anyway since the position is dire. Normally this is where I used to resign given that the a pawn is going to promote with no way to stop it. But first wrecking_ball emphasizes never to resign even with the promotion because you don't know. On one or two occasions on smaller scales though he's been put in situations similar to this but played on and win when all hope was more or less gone. And I had a very similar position in my game against Jack last week. Though we both had both the R's. But the same idea. After blundering away a piece within the first ten moves he was ahead a pawn and a piece. But this time with two passed pawns. One very nearly promoted. I was black so his pawn was on the third rank then. So that's lost generally speaking. But against all odds he made a mistake allowing me to skewer his R. So when I placed him in check I got that R back. And after that white could no longer win so I was able to draw in what was a hopelessly lost position. So as GM JP outlines ..."Fight til it's over." It's also because when I did the WTW games I didn't and still don't follow just those rules which says you can resign when you think you're lost. Instead I follow the Supplemental Talking the Talk which is the equivalent to the original WTW rules you don't resign until mate is inevitable. I like that rule and generally will follow it. With it the reason this loses instantly now is that with best play black has a mate in 8. So best was 40.[ R b7 ] 40...[ a2 ] 41.[ R a7 ] [ R e3 ] 42.[ K g2 ] [ N e1 + ] 43.[ K f2 ] [ R x f3 + ] 44.[ K x e1 ] [ R f6 ] 45.[ R a5 ] [ R a6 ] 46.Rx[ a2 ] Rx[ a2 ] 47.[ h5 ] [ f5 ] 48.gx[ f5 ] [ R e2 + ] 49.[ K f1 ] [ g x f5 ]  [ a2 ] , [ R x c4 ]  ?? There's only way to stop an immediate promotion 41.[ R c6 ] But even so black answers with 41.[ N c5 ] So it'll promote sooner or later that's before I found out that black actually had mate. So at this point I regained a little confidence back and seeing how lost I was given that he'd promote anyway I decided to take his B since there be one less thing that black has. Big mistake though as after black promotes it'll be mate in 4. So best was to play the immediate 41.[ R a6 ]  [ a1 = Q ]  [ K g2 ]  [ Q a2 + ]  [ K h3 ]  [ Q f2 ]  [ B c6 ] , [ R e3 + ]  Seeing that black has a mate in one because the K is stuck and can't move so the only option is 44.[ B f6 ] after which comes 44...[ R x f3 # ] I resign at this point. In order to prevent this the K would've had to escape and I've studied similar positions with GM games. What I learned here is to ask yourself when taking is a mistake. Sometimes even against much stronger players that isn't so. And in some cases no matter how bad the situation even if you think or are lost it's important to think defensively as opposed to aggressively. Overall I would like to thank archduke_piccolo for giving me this game.
 [ a4 ] , [ a3 ]  Stopping Black from playing [ a3 ] himself but now the White squares are chronically weak and the Bishop is doing life without the possibility of parole.
 [ B a2 ] , [ d5 ]  Challenging the center.
 [ f x g6 ]  [ e ]  [ p ]  [ + ] , [ h x g6 ]  White didn't see the mate coming. [ R h8 ] can only be delayed not prevented.
 [ N x h5 ] , [ N a4 ]  A miniature tactic to take one of Black's bishops leaving me with the strong bishop pair. Black cannot stop Nb6.
 [ O-O ] , [ O-O ]  Joe: Now that you have castled I'm planning to complete my development with my Bc1. I'd love to play [ B d2 ] but as you pointed out it's not a good move. I would also consider [ B g5 ] with the idea of pinning your [ N e7 ] which can be broken with ...[ f6 ] Therefore I like the looks of [ B e3 ] as both of the Bishops are together. But I think that best is [ B f4 ] as the DSB appears to be better placed then any other square. Ken: Here you have a wide range of reasonable moves. That's both good and bad for you. Great to have so many good choices but the sheer size of the move tree with all these branches can lead to confusion. That is why I chose this defense so that you will be forced to think for yourself because the database won't be much help. A lot of good plausible moves to choose from. It will come down to deciding which type of position makes you most comfortable. Joe: That makes sense. The irony is that I don't even look at the database because unless you know why they suggest moves it won't help to listen to it as I learned with tactical-abyss. Yes it's what I like to do here. I am interested in [ B e3 ] don't know what happens afterwards. Ken: It is a reasonable idea and we both will learn from working our way through the variations. Joe: I was thinking along a variation but after the first lesson about exchanges combined with a mistake in the team game where I got a lucky in which you gave an example of when not to exchange I'm not so sure. I was thinking along the lines of 7.[ B e3 ] with the idea being 7...[ d5 ] 8.ex[ d5 ] But I'm not sure that exchanging is the right approach. Or possibly 7.[ B e3 ] [ c5 ] but I'm not comfortable along the line after that. What it boils down to is me trying to avoid the exchange. I also considered moving my [ N c3 ] but I want to complete development as opposed to moving the same piece twice. Ken: sounds logical Joe: Which one [ N c3 ] or Be3. I meant [ B e3 ] or Ne2. Ken: both are logical. a matter of preference. Which p[osition do you like more? Joe: I like [ N e2 ] the best.
 [ N x e4 ] , [ d x e4 ]  fork...but no back up
 [ f4 ] , [ f6 ]  There's a 3-way fork from here Black can either play 6...[ Q h4 + ] or [ Q e7 ] or the move I prep was pawn-f6. Of course all of three of these lines are playable. I prefer [ f6 ] because it blunts White's b2-bishop.
 [ R a e8 ]  [ c4 ]  [ N f5 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ Q f3 ]  [ R e4 ]  [ N c2 ]  [ K c8 ] , [ B x c6 ]  I can remember what I was thinking here. Doh! I guess I was hoping that he would take with the pawn on [ b7 ] but as I soon realize he didn't...
 [ R c5 + ]  [ K a4 ]  [ R x d5 ]  [ f2 ]  [ R f5 ]  [ R e1 + ]  [ K x h2 ]  [ f1 = Q ]  [ R x f1 ] , [ R x f1 ]  Was this the best? The point is the "residual advantage" I have: the white king is unable to reach his pawns - otherwise I'm fried.
 [ B x c7 ] , [ B x c7 ]  ...and trade my knight for a bishop.
 [ N f6 ]  [ B c6 + ] , [ N d7 ]  It's either that or Qd7.
 [ c6 ] , [ d5 ]  And this is also correct: you break up the center while his king is still not castled - which means he must waste a move at some point getting his king away. The more pressure you bring to bear on him the more that wasted move will cost him.
 [ B d7 ] , [ R f x e6 + ]  Fighting Back.
 [ B x g5 ]  [ N x d5 ] , [ B e4 ]  [ B h6 ] will still be around as the pin is annoying for black.
 [ B c6 ]  [ R d d1 ]  [ h6 ]  [ K e3 ]  [ g5 ]  [ g3 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ h4 ]  [ B g4 ] , [ R x d4 ]  a good scarfice that gives me more control over the center and creates a powerful mobile pawns on the king side.
 [ B c4 ]  [ b x c3 ]  [ N x c3 ]  [ B x c4 ]  [ N x c4 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ N e2 ]  [ N x e2 + ]  [ Q x e2 ]  [ e4 ]  [ Q e3 ]  [ R c7 ]  [ Q b3 ]  [ K h8 ]  [ R f d1 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N e3 ] , [ d4 ]  Black will end up with two passed pawns which in the end will decide the game.
 [ Q e5 + ]  [ K g8 ]  [ R x e8 + ]  [ Q x e8 ] , [ Q x e8 + ]  Whites a queen up but this is only temporary because eventually she will need to give herself up in order to prevent black from promoting the only other option is for white to continuously give check and is this would result in an eventual draw its obvious that white will not allow this to happen
 [ B x d2 + ] , [ R x d2 ]  Although he is two pawns down White has a winning position. All his pieces are active and he is on the verge of a breakthrough.
 [ B e6 ] , [ R f d1 ]  Seizing control of the open file.
 [ K f2 ]  [ f4 ]  [ g3 ]  [ g5 ]  [ R d3 ]  [ R x d3 ] , [ c x d3 ]  Pawns undoubled. I still feel confident with both material and space.
 [ K h5 ]  [ K e3 ] , [ K g6 ]  55...[ K g6 ] loses. This allows the R to check and then push to [ g5 ]  [ R g4 + ]  [ K h6 ] , [ R g5 ]  If Black exchanges Rs then the White K picks off Black's pawns and Queens and if the Black R moves White moves Rxb5. As always I enjoy my games against joanne. I look forward to Annotation Project IV. Any and all comments/criticisms are welcomed and appreciated.
 [ N c3 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ N f3 ]  Nothing new
 [ e4 ] , [ e6 ]  this follows the French defense.
 [ e x f5 ]  [ R x f5 ] , [ h4 ]  Here [ Q f4 ] would finish the game. Cause after [ g x f5 ] white has [ N f6 ] followed by [ Q h6 ] black cannot avoid mate. I played an automatic move despite having around 1 hour on the clock.
 [ R c8 ]  [ g4 ]  [ R b8 ]  [ R e f1 ]  [ b4 ]  [ a x b4 ]  [ R x b4 ]  [ R x b4 ]  [ Q x b4 ] , [ f5 ]  Now [ g x f5 ] would be better. But white is still better.
 [ K x f7 ]  [ Q g6 + ]  [ K g8 ]  [ B x h6 ]  [ B f8 ]  [ B x g7 ]  [ B x g7 ]  [ h6 ]  [ R e7 ]  [ N f5 ]  [ R f7 ]  [ R x e6 ]  [ N f8 ]  [ h7 + ]  [ K h8 ]  [ Q x f7 ]  [ N x e6 ] , [ Q x e6 ]  Better might have been Kn[ x B g7 ] stalling the Black rook
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ] , [ c4 ]  after 1. [ d4 ] [ d5 ] I chose Queen's gambit to play.
 [ K g2 ] , [ K g6 ]  Time to activate the K.
 [ B d2 ]  [ Q x e5 ] , [ B c3 ]  A key move. Places my bishop on a big diagonal while saving my [ b2 ] pawn.
 [ R g3 ] , [ R g8 ]  Soon I pull ahead after a blunder from him. The only downside I only have about 25 minutes on my clock.
 [ N e4 ] , [ B e7 ]  Guarding. Black has good defence but poor development of minors
 [ a x b3 ]  [ R x b3 ]  [ R a8 ]  [ R b4 ] , [ N d6 ]  The correct move is [ N c5 ] because it is preparing Nd7.
 [ B x f3 ]  [ B x f3 ] , [ Q e5 ]  Threatens a battery mate on h2.
 [ B x e5 ]  [ B x e5 ]  [ R h7 ]  [ B x d5 ] , [ R x d5 ]  building on the pin over d4: but that will not hold long...
 [ K f2 ]  [ N x g3 ]  [ K x g3 ]  [ f5 ]  [ N c2 ]  [ f4 + ]  [ K f2 ] , [ R h e8 ]  I knew that [ d4 ] was in the offing so it seemed to require some rook support on the e-file
 [ e5 ] , [ K e7 ]  I wonder if [ B b5 ] was better or not. Anyway either the king or the bishop had to move.
 [ B x e4 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ N x e4 ] , [ d7 ]  ! the pawn comes into effect
 [ c4 ] , [ R g8 ]  Logical. Black has no fear of swapping a pair of rooks but otherwise he'll play [ R g g2 ] and dominate the 7th.
 [ Q x f7 ]  [ N x f7 ]  [ K x f7 ]  [ R f2 + ] , [ K e7 ]  Reacting....I need to try to bring the knight forward whil the rooks protect the King.
 [ Q b7 ]  [ R h d1 ]  [ R d8 ] , [ b4 ]  I switch tactics.
 [ R b3 ]  [ R c8 c6 ]  [ R g b1 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ R b3 b7 ]  [ Q f4 ]  [ R b7 b3 ]  [ h4 ]  [ K g2 ]  [ K g7 ]  [ R a3 ] , [ Q c7 ]  Tripling up on whites weak [ c3 ] pawn. The rooks followed by the queens is known as Alekhines Gun.
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ a6 ]  [ B a4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ O-O ] , [ N x e4 ]  This isn't really an uncommon move but it's unusual in that normally Black would castle and get his king out of the center. The challenge for White is to take advantage of his lead in development to get the pawn back and more.
 [ B g3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ N e7 ] , [ e5 ]  this strikes me as a little premature. 8 0-0 looks good.
 [ R x h2 ]  [ K e2 ]  [ Q g4 + ] , [ R f3 ]  thought he would of moved the knight from [ d2 ] to [ f3 ] bot o well
 [ R e5 ] , [ g6 ]  19. ........ [ g6 ] - does weaken castled position but Glenda will bed down there next to her other half for the next twenty moves or so. This is to prevent a bishop sac on [ h7 ] Freddy!
 [ R x a7 ] , [ N c5 + ]  Now the king must retreat and the pawn gets one square closer to promotion.
 [ B e3 ] , [ B x e3 ]  thewrongreason: This is different then what ION mentioned in the variations since it would be if Janet took with the N instead. And if she did I would've still voted for 10.[ N x e4 ] since he discussed. But because the capture was different then I anticipated I vote for 10.Qxe3. Of course this would likely change if ION thinks that we should play something different.
 [ c5 ]  [ c4 ]  [ g6 ]  [ b3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ N e7 ]  My version of Sicilian defense and yes the computers do not like this move. However it does support the Q pawn push.
 [ B e2 ] , [ f6 ]  f6? is premature and gets Black into real trouble quickly. White begins to gain the upper hand now exploiting a strong attack despite the absence of queens.
 [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ e6 ] , [ g3 ]  4. [ g3 ] - preparing to fianchetto Fou Leblanc on the long h1-[ a8 ] diagonal.
 [ N c3 ]  [ e6 ] , [ h4 ]  h4? white's first questionable move. Now I'm sure theres a purpose to this but I don't see it.. maybe to defend his bishop soon to be on [ g5 ] but his bishop stays put costing white a tempo.
 [ R x e8 + ]  [ B x e8 ] , [ Q c8 ]  No I have a rook against a bishop and I have an extra pawn. Can't believe I survived this one. I thick my resilience got him tired.
 [ Q x c3 ]  [ Q e7 ]  [ b4 ] , [ e5 ]  This should blunt the activity of the light-square Bishop.
 [ B g7 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ a6 ]  Najdorfs' contribution to the Sicilian: prevent interference on b5...
 [ O-O-O ]  [ B a5 ]  [ Q e3 ]  [ K g7 ]  [ f4 ]  [ B x d2 + ]  [ R x d2 ]  [ b5 ]  [ B d5 ]  [ R c8 ]  [ g5 ]  [ f x g5 ]  [ f x g5 ]  [ h5 ]  [ B f2 ]  [ Q e7 ] , [ K d1 ]  ? I assume that White was short of time since this move does nothing to help the attack. What about either moving the Rook on [ h1 ] or getting the Queen out of the Dark-Squared Bishop's way?
 [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ] , [ e6 ]  2. …… [ e6 ] - transposing into an English Opening.
 [ Q e7 ]  [ N g3 ] , [ N x g3 ]  17. [ N x g3 ] - black wisely trades knights. That knight was looking good on [ f5 ] and I wanted to either exchange it or drive it to a more passive square. Glenda decides to recapture as she gets a decent view of g7.
 [ B x e6 ]  [ Q a4 ]  [ Q f6 ] , [ R a b1 ]  I should have just moved my pawn up now I am going to be down a pawn
 [ Q g7 ] , [ K d7 ]  There is no good move. I resign.
 [ K h1 ] , [ N g4 ]  Threatening smothered mate via [ N f2 ] [ K g1 ] [ N h3 ] (double check) [ K h1 ] [ Q g1 ] [ R x g1 ] Nf2#.
 [ R b f1 ] , [ B f6 ]  As said before Black´s [ B f6 ] with [ b5 ] make the white position a very delicate if not a lost one.
 [ e x f5 ]  [ e x f5 ] , [ R a8 ]  White is safely controlling a lot of territory aroung the black king so he aims to get some pawns back.
 [ Q e7 ] , [ R g e1 ]  Pinned d5. A pity it is not threatened.
 [ e5 ]  [ d x e5 ] , [ f x e5 ]  The central pawn duo is deadly!!!
 [ d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ N b d7 ] , [ e4 ]  5. [ e4 ] - becoming a bit like a Philidor Hanham Variation.
 [ a6 ]  [ B a4 ]  [ b5 ] , [ B b3 ]  Pretty straightforward moves till here.
 [ B x f6 ]  [ B x f6 ] , [ N d5 ]  Attacking the bishop but not seeing the danger that awaits.
 [ f x e6 ]  [ B x e6 ] , [ N x e4 ]  Black blunders by accepting the pawn and mate is forced - 12.[ Q h5 + ] [ g6 ] 13.[ Q x g6 + ] [ K f8 ] 14.Qf7#. (11.[ B x e4 ] 12.[ N x e4 ] also looks weak for Black even if not immediately losing the game). Stronger would have been either 11…[ B d7 ] or 11…[ N b d7 ] to develop the Queen’s pieces while still keeping control of h5. Although Black would have been up a Knight for two Pawns White still would have retained a strong initiative with mobility space and control with a complex and interesting game ahead.
 [ N d4 ] , [ R a e8 ]  now i start a battle of tempi...
 [ K g1 ] , [ g5 ]  Now I must bring the [ R e8 ] on the "h" column threating the mate in h2.
 [ B e7 ] , [ N e5 ]  Exchange offered.
 [ R b8 ] , [ K e3 ]  !great. the [ b8 ] Rook is only able to leave his 8th reihe giving check and then has to return again. so he cannot kill [ b2 ] and cannot prevent the king attacking.
 [ N x e5 ]  [ d x e5 ] , [ R a8 a2 ]  
 [ N x e7 ] , [ K f6 ]  In this position I threaten to capture his free knight with [ K x e7 ] but it is now "too little too late".
 [ K c8 ]  [ Q x h8 + ]  [ N d8 ] , [ B e7 ]  Threatening mate and ganging up on the knight.
 [ R c7 ]  [ a5 ]  [ R x a7 ]  [ R x c4 ] , [ R e7 ]  He realized he can't play [ R x a5 ] or[ R c8 + ] wins.
 [ N c7 + ]  [ K d7 ]  [ N b5 ]  [ a6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ K c6 ]  [ K g2 ]  [ b5 ]  [ K h3 ]  [ f5 ]  [ g4 ]  [ f x g4 + ] , [ K x g4 ]  The exchange has isolated White's King-side pawns although his King is finally free.
 [ R d2 ]  [ Q a4 ]  [ R f d1 ] , [ Q x f4 ]  Having forced the win of the weak pawn and accomplished his strategic goal Black's Q is now active and White's position is very difficult. White resigns.
 [ B f1 ] , [ R a f8 ]  It is clear now that white has lost some position and won't scare black's backward pawn. 19. [ B f4 ] is still possible but not with the same effect: 19... [ N d6 ] 20. [ B g3 ] and it seems to me that having the g-pawn blocked white's light-square bishop would have very few prospects.
 [ B e7 ]  [ N x c6 ] , [ b x c6 ]  7. ...... [ b x c6 ] - after the knight trade my pawns have been duly split up.
 [ B e3 ]  [ d x e3 ]  [ N x e3 ]  [ Q x h2 ]  [ Q d3 ]  [ N g4 ]  [ Q d4 ]  [ N x e3 ]  [ f x e3 ]  [ Q g3 + ]  [ K d2 ]  [ b6 ] , [ R f g1 ]  and the attack begins.
 [ B e3 ] , [ B f5 ]  7. [ B e3 ] [ B f5 ] White protects the vunerable [ d4 ] pawn and Black responds with some development
 [ N x d5 ]  [ b x a3 ] , [ R a c8 ]  23. ...... [ R a c8 ] - threatening Rc2+.
 [ Q x a7 ]  [ R x b2 ]  [ Q a3 ]  [ Q b8 ]  [ R b1 ]  [ R x b1 + ]  [ B x b1 ]  [ B g4 ] , [ Q d3 ]  Threatening # if black moves [ N f6 ] knight.
 [ B e5 ] , [ N c5 ]  a bit of aggressive move but this stops black from advancing the d pawn further.
 [ b5 ] , [ e5 ]  forced if I want to hold onto my e pawn.
 [ e4 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ] , [ d3 ]  Until now it seems ok.
 [ K x e6 ] , [ Q x e8 + ]  ... but I don't need to axe both Rooks and a strong pin like this incapacitates 2 pieces for the price of a pawn.
 [ h x g5 ]  [ h x g5 ] , [ g6 ]  Black should have tried to exchange the queens with [ Q h5 ] but white has g4. Interesting to look deeper.
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ B c4 ]  Standard Ruy Lopez... as per.
 [ d x e6 ]  [ B x e6 ] , [ f3 ]  Interesting covering the knight's jumps.
 [ K x d7 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ B x c5 ]  [ d x c5 ] , [ K c6 ]  ?? An eager move that I myself might have made.
 [ R x b4 ] , [ c x b4 ]  His dsb is still blocked by his own pawn (now more than before since [ a5 ] is useless for it).
 [ R a h8 ] , [ K a2 ]  Alternative variation: 39. [ B b6 ] [ R h1 ] 40. [ R c g3 ] [ g5 ] 41. fx[ g5 ] [ f4 ] $19
 [ e x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ R e1 + ] , [ N g e7 ]  I think that [ B e7 ] was better and than Nf6.
 [ a6 ]  [ B a4 ] , [ B c5 ]  As far as I've heard this is the Modern Archangel Defense. It is a lagged Berlin but it is still sound- for the most part.
 [ c3 ]  [ c4 ]  [ B d2 ]  [ Q b6 ] , [ b3 ]  And I have to make the nessesary sacrifice...
 [ e x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ] , [ B a2 ]  The only safe square.
 [ a3 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ] , [ b4 ]  Hmm white is pushing pawns while not fully developed.
 [ B a3 ] , [ N e2 ]  As I think that was not the best possible defend for her. How about 15.[ Q b1 ] which would proceed as 15...[ B x e4 ] 16.[ N x e4 ] [ f5 ] 17.[ N d2 ] [ Q x b1 ] 18.[ R x b1 ] [ b6 ] which will remain a one pawn down situation?
 [ Q c5 ] , [ Q e3 ]  Consequently protecting it is the number one priority.
 [ B e7 ] , [ B g5 ]  I was tempted to take the knight but instead I pin with my dark squared bishop. I think I should have just captured the knight with my pawn.
 [ K c5 ]  [ e5 ]  [ K c6 ]  [ K e7 ]  [ K c7 ] , [ e6 ]  
 [ c x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ d x c5 ]  [ B x c5 ] , [ B x f6 ]  This is all theory walking along the beaten track. Now watch while my opponent (Black) drags us off into the wilderness!
 [ R c6 ] , [ B b1 ]  Adds protection to the knight and enables [ h3 ] to try and get the bishop. Unfortunately black has a nice move in reserve which prevents this from happening.
 [ c4 ]  [ b4 ]  [ d4 ] , [ c x d4 ]  [ B b7 ] earlier would have had prevent this line which gives white a chance.
 [ N f3 ]  [ d5 ] , [ c4 ]  This was a game I won in my reti mini-tournament. The reti opening is named after Richard Reti and he was one of the top players during 1910s and 1920s. Born 28 May 1889 in Pezinok (Austrian-Hungarian) and died 6 June 1929. In New York 1924 Richard Reti played a game against Raul Capablanca which he won. This was Capablanca's only defeat in 8 years and also the first defeat since becoming world champion. https://www.chess.com/article/view/richard-rti
 [ Q d6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ d4 ]  [ N b d2 ]  [ f5 ] , [ a3 ]  the centre is blocked my opponent and me are trying to attack on the Q and K sides
 [ Q x e8 ]  [ Q f5 ]  [ Q d7 ] , [ B h3 ]  If we're going to make this trade I want to do it on my terms while getting my Bishop into a better position.
 [ K g8 ]  [ Q x f6 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ R a e8 ]  [ N g4 ]  [ h5 ]  [ N h6 + ]  [ K h7 ]  [ N f5 ]  [ g x f5 ]  [ Q x f5 + ]  [ K g8 ] , [ Q g5 + ]  
 [ Q f3 ]  [ R x a5 ]  [ R e8 ] , [ Q x h5 + ]  Now that the queens are coming off the rest should be simple for White. Black resigned here and I breathed a sigh of relief.
 [ N c3 ] , [ O-O-O ]  As expected
 [ h3 ]  [ e3 ]  [ f x e3 ]  [ f x e3 ]  [ K d1 ]  [ K x c3 ]  [ K e2 ]  [ K b2 ]  [ K x e3 ]  [ K x a3 ]  [ K f4 ]  [ K b4 ]  [ K g4 ]  [ a3 ]  [ K x h4 ]  [ a2 ]  [ g4 ]  [ a1 = Q ]  [ K h5 ]  [ Q g7 ]  [ h4 ]  [ K c5 ]  [ g5 ]  [ K d4 ]  [ g6 ]  [ K e4 ]  [ K g5 ] , [ Q e7 + ]  
 [ K b2 ] , [ f6 ]  losing one tempo to remove opposition and then 50...[ K c3 ] wins a position to support the promotion. Black's approach on this game was to do massive exchanges after a material advantage achieved with a basic Noah's Ark trap and then to push one the remaining pawns to promotion with no more "fireworks" than the ones necessary to force some exchanges.
 [ B b6 ] , [ d4 ]  So far this home prep by Carlsen has a better psychological impact than on the actual board. He has not much in the game but this keeps away from Caruana's home prep. So a moral victory of sort. Objectively speaking Carlsen has nothing. But Caruana is out of home prep and he is thinking for the first time so far in this game. That is what Carlsen is banking on. He believes he is better than Caruana in the middlegame. As for the Women's World Championship it looks like Lagno is on her way to be the next Women's World Champion! She held a very difficult position today. All she needs is a draw tomorrow with white to win the match! ​After 13. [ d4 ] Caruana thought for a long time before finally playing
 [ B e2 ]  [ O-O ]  [ Q c2 ]  [ R e8 ] , [ O-O-O ]  Although not terrible I think White is less safe on the queenside.
 [ d5 ]  [ c4 ] , [ c6 ]  Fritz chooses the Slav Defence. I have little experience of this opening but I think I can wing it somehow...
 [ R x e4 ] , [ N e7 ]  Black refrains from the fork 13... [ d5 ] since the [ e6 ] pawn would be pinned. This move threatens the fork in earnest so I hastily retreat the rook. Not all the way back since leaving it on the second rank makes doubling easier (when the time comes).
 [ B c8 ]  [ R x a7 ]  [ e2 ]  [ R x b7 + ]  [ B x b7 ] , [ Q a7 ]  Obviously white looks so very powerful.
 [ K d6 ]  [ a5 ] , [ B e2 ]  Black will have to lose the bishop for sure but will it be enough to win? Sure.
 [ N f6 ]  [ d3 ]  [ O-O ] , [ N d5 ]  This caught me totally off guard. I was not expecting a attack so soon...
 [ R g7 + ]  [ K h8 ] , [ R x a7 ]  Game note: "35.[ R x a7 ] so I’ll grab this for now."
 [ d5 ] , [ Q f7 ]  Controlling the [ g7 ] square and creating many mating threats.
 [ R h3 ] , [ b5 ]  Gives the Bish a move...for what its worth !
 [ a5 ]  [ a4 ]  [ R a d8 ] , [ N b d2 ]  at last the N gets going - and connects Rs
 [ B b2 ] , [ Q d8 ]  Black gets out of the way of the potential skewer.
 [ R b1 ]  [ K g6 ]  [ f3 ]  [ K g5 ]  [ g3 ]  [ c5 ]  [ a3 ]  [ a5 ]  [ K g1 ]  [ h5 ]  [ g x h5 ]  [ K x h5 ]  [ K f1 ]  [ B e5 ]  [ f4 ]  [ B f6 ]  [ K g1 ]  [ K g4 ]  [ b4 ] , [ B x c3 ]  Now black has to play carefully without wasting a move.
 [ Q a6 ] , [ N b5 ]  Threatening [ N c7 + ]  [ N x e4 + ]  [ K e1 ] , [ B d8 ]  blacks knights look strong but they have no backup to snare the king
 [ f x g4 ]  [ Q x f7 ] , [ R g6 ]  Threatening to trap the queen.
 [ N x e4 + ] , [ K e3 ]  Again not the best continuation. this just exposes the king to too much attacking combinations.
 [ e4 ] , [ e6 ]  French Defence
 [ N b x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ] , [ Q d6 ]  # It seemed to me that Topalov was a bit surprised as he thought that attacking resources had dried out. A check on [ c6 ] was senseless the Knight will be beaten the King will go to [ b6 ] and there is hardly any opportunity for White to move his Rooks toward the black King. The d4-pawn safely protects the d-rank and there are no squares for intrusion on the e-rank. Actually this was not quite right and my next move made without any hesitation turned out to be an unpleasant surprise for Topalov.
 [ Q x f3 ] , [ Q g5 + ]  puting pression but no plan
 [ B d4 ]  [ R d f1 ]  [ B x f2 + ]  [ R x f2 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ B x e4 ] , [ R a d8 ]  Thus far White's 16th move pawn advance has netted him the loss of the exchange and a [ d2 ] Knight that is under attack.
 [ h3 ]  [ N h6 ]  [ B x h6 ] , [ g x h6 ]  8. ....... [ g x h6 ] - piece trade opening up the g file.
 [ f x g6 ] , [ f x g6 ]  while this may weaken my king it opens the f file completely to my rook and white can't make any immediate attacking threats. [ Q x h6 ] trades down to a won endgame for me.
 [ g4 ]  [ h x g4 ]  [ h x g4 ]  [ g5 ]  [ K g3 ]  [ f6 ]  [ f4 ]  [ g x f4 + ]  [ K x f4 ]  [ K g6 ] , [ e4 ]  i love when oponents put pawns in front of kings late game ehehe in 1 rook scenarios
 [ Q b7 ]  [ Q a2 ] , [ R b1 + ]  there is no stopping ...[ R b2 + ] forking K & Q.
 [ g x h6 ]  [ g x h6 ] , [ f4 ]  I'm trying to bust open the center. That's my excuse for not taking the [ h6 ] pawn.
 [ e x d5 ]  [ Q x d5 ]  [ d4 ] , [ N f6 ]  [ N c6 ] is usually played here but [ N f6 ] has to be played at some point and jumbling your move order up in the opening is a very useful ploy when playing a weaker opponent.
 [ Q x d3 ] , [ N d6 ]  I could have and probably should have played [ N x b6 ] however I thought I could get more than the three pieces for the three pawns
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ g6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ c3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N b d2 ] , [ d6 ]  Black is preparing for E5 with E4 a possibility
 [ B d2 ]  [ Q x b2 ] , [ B c3 ]  ?Blocking the knight"s Favorite square.
 [ g2 ] , [ R d1 ]  Forced.
 [ R d2 ]  [ R x d2 ]  [ Q x d2 ]  [ N c4 ]  [ Q d1 ]  [ R d8 ]  [ Q g4 ]  [ Q x d5 ]  [ R a1 ] , [ e3 ]  some analysis revealed this is the most efficient way to put white away.
 [ R c8 ]  [ g4 ] , [ B x g4 ]  I like this. Too bad the queen blocks the next capture. It weakens his pawn attack. Not optimal and could have been avoided earlier but the best move at this time.
 [ d x e5 ]  [ Q x e5 ] , [ N g4 ]  Attacking the bishop and the queen. If [ B x e7 ] then 13....[ N x e5 ] 14. [ B x d8 ] [ R x d8 ] and after the [ d4 ] knight moves I cannot take the pawn immediately because of [ N c5 ] but this pawn is a weakness which I will exploit.
 [ B x b4 ]  [ Q g4 + ]  [ f3 ]  [ R h2 + ]  [ N f2 ]  [ Q c4 + ]  [ Q d3 ]  [ Q x b4 ]  [ R e h1 ]  [ Q x b2 + ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ Q b5 + ]  [ Q d3 ]  [ Q b2 + ] , [ Q d2 ]  and here a drawn was agreed upon. had i been playing more aggressively i would have found a way to swing the rook to [ c8 ] which could have lead to some winning lines...
 [ R x h6 ]  [ O-O-O ]  [ R x h7 ]  [ Q b4 ]  [ a3 ] , [ Q a5 ]  another lost move
 [ d6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ N e7 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ h6 ] , [ B e3 ]  Development is basically completed for both sides now. The game proper begins here.
 [ N c3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ d3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ O-O ] , [ h4 ]  This is probably too aggressive. White has no guarantee of a winning attack on the flank while my center potential is threatening.
 [ e4 ] , [ c5 ]  Sicilian Defense. I chose this opening because a quick review of Maglicianer's games showed she tended to lose more often with this.
 [ N x d3 ]  [ K x d3 ]  [ R c8 ]  [ R x c8 + ]  [ K x c8 ]  [ R c1 + ] , [ B c6 ]  Black has plugged one path for White's forces but more soon open. Black we soon see is fatally debilitated on the central dark square complex.
 [ O-O-O ] , [ d5 ]  And the center is fixed.
 [ N d2 ]  [ R f4 f7 + ]  [ K d6 ] , [ Q e3 ]  30.[ Q e3 ] would save WT if only [ N x f3 ] were not with Check. But it is what it is and that includes Check.
 [ B d2 ] , [ B c3 ]  Instead of protecting the knights black adds a bishop into the mix.
 [ N d7 ] , [ Q c2 ]  18. [ Q c2 ] - Glenda responds to the distress rockets and desperate morse code messages sent out by these stricken footmen by desperately trying to keep them connected.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ B c5 ] , [ b4 ]  using an outside pawn to break the symmetry.
 [ Q e7 ] , [ O-O ]  Black's 5th move baffled me. I don't know what he thought to gain other than maybe security against a queen exchange if the pawns trade off in the center. And he blocks in his king's bishop. Or maybe he had is eye on taking the [ e4 ] pawn after he plays 6. ... [ e x d4 ] though that is foiled easily enough and the simple expedience of castling handles this rather effortlessly and develops the king's rook in the process.
 [ B x d2 + ]  [ B x d2 ]  [ B x f3 ] , [ Q x f3 ]  Both sides continue their development.
 [ N f4 ]  [ Q f3 ]  [ Q x e4 + ]  [ Q x e4 + ]  [ f x e4 ]  [ N x h7 ] , [ N x h7 ]  And here we are. Black has the advantage in mobility and development for the moment but needs to convert it to something more substantial before White can mobilize his unopposed kingside pawn cluster.
 [ Q h2 ]  [ B x h1 ] , [ g x f4 ]  whoa this is really neat if [ e x f4 ] [ Q x f4 ] threats [ Q b8 # ] and [ b x f6 + ]  [ e4 ]  [ e5 ] , [ N f3 ]  typical king pawn opening
 [ Q f3 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ Q x f6 ]  [ Q x f6 ] , [ g x f6 ]  The liquidation doubled black's pawns but not in a bad way since they will jointly support a push in the center and usually undouble easily enough through exchanges.
 [ B b6 ]  [ K f8 ]  [ R c7 ]  [ K e8 ]  [ g4 ]  [ g6 ]  [ K f1 ]  [ f5 ]  [ g x f5 ]  [ g x f5 ] , [ R h7 ]  and I resigned as my R would either be lost outright or swapped off or yet another pawn would fall and I only had about 4 minutes left compared with my opponent's 12.
 [ d3 ]  [ N g e7 ]  [ B g5 ] , [ f6 ]  I should have seen that coming. This won the tempo for the black.
 [ K e6 ]  [ K d2 ]  [ K e5 ] , [ K e2 ]  Both Kings are centralized. Black has played the ending properly and squeezed out my winning chances. A draw is inevitable.
 [ K f3 ]  [ N g5 + ]  [ K g4 ]  [ Q x d4 + ]  [ f4 ] , [ O-O-O ]  I won a pawn in the process but now I cannot check any more. I hurry to move my king to safety.
 [ B x f6 ]  [ Q x f6 ]  [ Q x f6 ]  [ g x f6 ] , [ N f3 ]  Developing another piece.
 [ N e4 ]  [ R e2 ] , [ N f2 ]  This does stop my threat but ties up the Knight which could be snapping up my loose pawns.
 [ R g4 g3 ]  [ R h8 ]  [ K g1 ]  [ R e3 ]  [ R x e3 ] , [ d x e3 ]  
 [ a7 ]  [ R f8 ]  [ K b7 ]  [ R f7 + ] , [ K b6 ]  Now white wins by interposing his rook against mine... but I blundered.
 [ Q x e6 ]  [ Q x e6 ]  [ B x e6 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ B b3 ] , [ c4 ]  bad move he should just take the Bishop.
 [ Q c7 + ]  [ K g8 ]  [ Q c4 + ]  [ Q x c4 ]  [ N x c4 ] , [ a x b3 ]  Best Move: [ a3 ]  [ h3 ]  [ e x f3 ]  [ h x g4 ]  [ c x b5 ] , [ g x f3 ]  Bloodshed over.
 [ R d8 ]  [ N g5 ]  [ K g8 ]  [ N e7 + ]  [ K f8 ]  [ N x h7 + ]  [ K f7 ]  [ N g5 + ]  [ K f8 ]  [ N x g6 + ]  [ K g8 ] , [ N e7 + ]  I would have resigned as black here.
 [ e4 ] , [ c5 ]  Sicilian. Love playing it as black. Love playing against it as White. :)
 [ N x c4 ] , [ Q c7 ]  Preventing 13. Nd6+. Also available was 12. ... Qb8. Both 12. ... [ Q b7 ] and 12. [ Q c8 ] run into 13. [ N d6 + ] Royal Fork
 [ Q x c2 ] , [ d4 ]  White is grabbing the last straw though he is hopelessly lost. The rest of the game is just a question of technique. In this game Fortune smiled upon me and my opponent made some blunders. When I looked at other of his games I understood that this was really luck for me because other his games showed reasonable quality. I've had games where I've played even worse. Anyway if there were any mistakes or anything some of my readers didn't like feel free to send your critisism. (make sure it's constructive not destructive)
 [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ] , [ N e5 ]  Tom also wanted to exchange my [ N c6 ] for his N. But I refused because I felt that my N was stronger then his Nd4. What comes to mind is the Visualization Count and consequently how much mobility it can get by moving it.
 [ N c3 ] , [ e5 ]  Meanwhile he decides to attack my N. This time however I have a safe place to retreat it so I do not mind.
 [ K g2 ]  [ N f4 + ]  [ K g3 ] , [ Q d7 ]  It is good enough.
 [ K d4 ] , [ R a6 ]  Threatens Rxa3.
 [ R d1 ] , [ B e7 ]  with plan for a rook exchange without losing a pawn
 [ N x d4 ]  [ e x d4 ] , [ f3 ]  ! At first I wasn't sure why lesplay played. I thought that better was to exchange with 15.[ B x e2 ] Qxe2. A second look at the position proves that I am wrong and this is actually the best move in this position. That's because chicoboy would get a free piece because of the [ e8 ] R which I forgot about. If black retook with 15...Qxe2?? 16.Rxe2. So this move was absolutely necessary to protect his LSB. So with that in mind black now has a bigger advantage given that there's a whole around white's K. As a result lesplay must be very careful to stay in the game.
 [ Q c4 ] , [ N e1 ]  Of course ...[ Q x g2 ] was right at the door.
 [ B h5 ]  [ O-O ] , [ c x d4 ]  I was surprised by this but it does open the c file for black
 [ R c5 ]  [ R x c5 ] , [ b x c5 ]  33. [ b x c5 ] - this rook trade brings me and the Dentist into a K & P ending with even material!
 [ h5 ]  [ R h2 ] , [ R g7 + ]  32. [ R g7 + ] - this rook move hits at the [ b2 ] pawn and enables a rook move to [ h2 ] protecting that weak yet strong passer isolani on the h column.
 [ b4 ] , [ Q f2 # ]  A sudden finish.
 [ d4 ] , [ a6 ]  Still more pawns moved with white moving to [ d4 ] and I moved to a6.
 [ B x c7 ]  [ b4 ]  [ c4 ]  [ a4 ]  [ R c b1 ]  [ Q c2 + ]  [ Q e2 ]  [ Q c3 ] , [ B e5 ]  Mm I think I like [ B d6 ] better. Black moves the rook P[ d5 ] pushes the knight culminating with BxPb4.
 [ R b3 ]  [ K g7 ]  [ R h b1 ] , [ R b4 x b3 ]  black should avoid the bonding of the pawns. not too late with 27... a5. if 28. [ K c3 ] then 28... [ R c8 ]  [ R x b3 ]  [ R b6 ]  [ a4 ]  [ R x b3 ]  [ c x b3 ]  [ K f6 ]  [ b4 ]  [ K e5 ]  [ K c3 ]  [ g5 ]  [ h x g5 ]  [ h4 ]  [ a5 ]  [ h3 ]  [ B f1 ]  [ h2 ]  [ B g2 ]  [ K f4 ]  [ b5 ]  [ K g3 ]  [ B h1 ]  [ K f2 ]  [ e5 ]  [ d x e5 ] , [ b6 ]  
 [ K a1 ] , [ R a4 ]  As now ION isn't just attacking the Queen but he's also placing an attacking force against Charles monarch. So King safety might become an issue here which is why he was willing to give up another pawn.
 [ e6 ] , [ N x b6 + ]  ! - Is a note necessary here?
 [ g6 ]  [ K f8 ]  [ R x f7 + ]  [ K g8 ] , [ R e7 ]  Defending was losing. So I tried the last one.
 [ N c6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ Q d7 ]  [ B x e4 ]  [ d x e4 ] , [ B g5 ]  12. ... [ f6 ] 13. ex[ f6 ] [ Q x g7 ] 14. [ f x g7 ] [ R g8 ] 15. B[ f6 ] threatening 16. Nd5.
 [ Q a5 ] , [ B d2 ]  I think that she probably moved her piece for further development but I do not completely understand this concept. Afterall her DSB is blocked by the [ f4 ] pawn. Therefore it does not have a lot of room to maneuver.
 [ f3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ f x e4 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ N x e4 ] , [ R x e4 ]  With Black's passed pawn and unchallenged Knight White's position does not present much hope. White resigned here. Personally I would not have resigned just in case my opponent made a blunder.
 [ N x b5 ]  [ a6 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ c3 ]  [ N f5 ]  [ R a7 ] , [ N d7 ]  He resigned here but I don't think he should have. The point is 18...either[ N x d7 ] 19. Nxe7+. If 18...[ R x d7 ] 19. [ R x d7 ] either[ N x d7 ] 20. Nxe7+. However their are other moves and he doesn't have to take it. If any one feels he should resign this position let me know. I think that the point of this annotation is to tell people not to stop at one or two moves. Really analyze if you feel you are lost.
 [ R c3 ] , [ R b3 b2 + ]  White saves his rook and now black cannot gain material with 28. ... [ B x f3 ] since he would then lose his own knight. Black finds a way to win a pawn as played increasing his material lead and more importantly creating a passed pawn on the e-file.
 [ R x g2 ]  [ B x g2 ]  [ K x g2 ] , [ a4 ]  White's K is out of the square and cannot stop the pawn.
 [ N b6 ]  [ B c6 ] , [ a8 = Q + ]  black havs no choise but to lose his piece .
 [ B e3 ]  [ B b6 ]  [ a4 ] , [ B x e3 ]  The simpler I can make the game the better my chances. So any and all exchanges are welcome.
 [ N c6 ]  [ B d3 ] , [ N b4 ]  Normally black will capture [ d x c4 ] at this point forcing another move by the Bishop and gaining a tempo. I don't see anything wrong with this except it is a second move with the Knight before Black is fully developed.
 [ Q f1 ]  [ K d5 ]  [ Q f5 + ] , [ K c6 ]  Menacing the b pawn and enabling a further [ d5 ]  [ Q b5 + ]  [ K b7 ] , [ Q a5 ]  White has now the advantage but the game will last 32 more moves
 [ R x c4 ]  [ c x b6 ]  [ Q c2 ]  [ Q e6 ]  [ B x c6 ]  [ b x c6 ]  [ R x c6 ] , [ Q d5 ]  There's a lot of air on the h1-[ a8 ] diagonal. The Queen will use this later.
 [ K f8 ]  [ Q x c7 ] , [ R e7 ]  This move makes matters worse by making White's Queen check me and wriggle my King away from safety.
 [ B e3 ]  [ N a6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N c4 ] , [ B c1 ]  Giving back the gain of time but retaining the two Bishops and the pawn on Q 5.
 [ B f5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ e6 ] , [ B g5 ]  (?!) I was a bit surprised by this. It's very interesting what he's done and I wasn't sure how to react. 5. ... [ f6 ] seemed to weaken my kingside more than needed and I didn't want to play 5. ... [ N e7 ] or 5. ... [ B e7 ] because I wanted my Bishop to be able to take at [ c5 ] once I pushed my c-pawn. So I played my favourite move of this opening.
 [ B x f6 ]  [ Q e6 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ B x b3 ]  [ N x e6 ]  [ B x e6 ] , [ B g5 ]  Now the game is wide opened. Black's control on the open file is not effective anylonger material is equal black's control on the center is slighly better. White still controls more field on the queenside. black's a pawn is under direct menace. White has 2 pieces unprotected against one for black. The situation seems equal.
 [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ] , [ Q x d4 ]  8. [ Q x d4 ] - pawn trade.
 [ K e8 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ b6 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ Q e4 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ B b3 ]  [ Q d7 ]  [ B x d5 ] , [ R b8 ]  ?
 [ B d3 ] , [ g5 ]  ...so this is my "plan": to attack on the kingside (the original purpose of black's asset) but with the disadvantage of having the Q almost useless on [ b6 ] and my own Qside far from being able to develop. On the other side white has more or less the same problem: he has to castle just under my advancing pawns and his minor pieces can be harassed - soon or later. If I play [ d6 ] [ B d7 ] o-o-o... he will do whatever he wants (like c4. Fortunately for me he assumes that [ N b4 ] is still very powerful but he can easily move his lsb from [ d3 ] or play [ a3 ] and make [ c4 ] a threat.)
 [ f5 ]  [ N f4 ]  [ g3 ]  [ N e2 + ]  [ K b2 ]  [ R x b4 + ] , [ K a3 ]  Now the King will be in a stalemate position. All I have to do is find a way to deliver a check and it will be mate.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N g5 ] , [ d5 ]  kind of variation of the Petrov I rarely encounter thitho: well you started with this rare [ N g5 ] :-)
 [ d5 ] , [ c4 ]  After [ d5 ] [ c4 ] we have queen's gambit.
 [ N f6 ] , [ B x c4 ]  Quickly white has nice postion and development.
 [ N f5 ] , [ N d5 ]  In the meanwhile Bobby tries to attack the opponent. Great!
 [ Q e8 ]  [ B x h6 ]  [ g x h6 ] , [ N f6 + ]  its over.
 [ a5 ] , [ R c1 ]  to prepare the central pawn break
 [ K c1 ]  [ Q c4 ]  [ c3 ]  [ R a1 + ]  [ K c2 ]  [ d3 + ]  [ R x d3 ]  [ Q x d3 + ]  [ K b3 ] , [ R x f1 ]  White has lost considerable material now and is on the ropes.
 [ N c3 ] , [ N f6 ]  Black's plan of 2...[ B e7 ] is revealed as aiming for an early castle.
 [ B d2 ]  [ Q b6 ] , [ O-O ]  My opponent has managed to create a far superior spacial advantage. She has had me on the retreat several times.
 [ K e7 ]  [ Q f7 + ]  [ K d6 ] , [ Q x f6 ]  Keeping the initiative by forcing the black rook on [ h8 ] to move.
 [ B e2 ] , [ f5 ]  Controls the white squares ([ g4 ] and I can wait for the exchange) and opens the way for the knight to [ f6 ] or to the queen. The good bishop for him to counter this is currently trapped...
 [ d5 ]  [ d4 ] , [ B g4 ]  I take it out of the opening book because I play 1.[ c4 ] as white and 1... [ N f6 ] vs 1.[ d4 ] so I don't know this opening very well.
 [ B d4 ]  [ R f8 ] , [ B e5 + ]  What a beautiful Bishop!
 [ R f3 ]  [ R a e8 ]  [ N g6 + ] , [ K h7 ]  As I said before I get a 2 extra points.
 [ Q f3 ]  [ R d8 ]  [ Q x d5 ] , [ R x d5 ]  Black is better developed but my pieces aren't really very well coordinated.
 [ b4 ]  [ R d2 + ]  [ K c6 ]  [ R a2 ]  [ K b5 ]  [ K e4 ] , [ B b6 ]  Locating my Bishop better and also gives space for my a-pawn to advance. It´s no hurry.
 [ N f3 ] , [ Q d7 ]  Preparing to castle Q side. So there's something I'm missing because in this position I would've castled short at once. Therefore my inference is that with the K side weakened (due to Ken's f pawn advancing) 9...0-0 would've left the monarch exposed.
 [ B b7 ] , [ c4 ]  I make it worse because I'm not ready to do what I just did.
 [ Q c7 ]  [ b4 ]  [ N b7 ] , [ B b3 ]  I should have played [ c4 ] first but now I have the threat [ Q x f7 + ] [ Q x f7 ] [ B x f7 ] Rxd6. If the Knight moves away
 [ B x e5 ] , [ f x e5 ]  my rook is there to protect the [ f7 ] knight.
 [ B d3 ]  [ K d2 ] , [ B c4 ]  treat [ a2 ] and [ R e2 + ]  [ R e2 + ]  [ K c1 ] , [ R x a2 ]  will i have the oportunitie to move [ R a2 ] in [ a1 ] ??
 [ f3 ] , [ g x f3 ]  I realized I had to take the pawn for after 16. Bc1? black has the nasty ...[ f x g2 + ] 17. [ K x g2 ] [ Q h3 + ] 18. [ K h1 ] (not Kg1? on account of Nxf3+) ...[ g3 ] 19. [ Q e2 ] Nhg4! with a crushing attack.
 [ R d7 ]  [ R d1 ]  [ R c7 ]  [ R c1 ] , [ N e4 ]  25. ....... [ N [ e4 ] ] - the black knight finds an outpost on [ e4 ] and breaks a threefold repetition. If my opponent had a crystal ball I think he would have played into it!
 [ R x e8 + ]  [ B x e8 ]  [ N e5 ] , [ R f2 ]  We should create problems for the opponent to solve. Here white can hold with [ R e1 ] but that is not so easy to see.
 [ R h e1 ]  [ R x e2 ] , [ R x e2 ]  Black's turn.
 [ R a8 + ]  [ K b6 ] , [ Q c8 ]  Decided not to attack for I did not want his king to escape.
 [ h x g5 ]  [ B g6 ] , [ f4 ]  I am aware my kingside is completely exposed but I thought the pawn chain was strong enough to prevent black's incursions. I was wrong.
 [ B x d3 ] , [ Q x d3 ]  Now what I want is to castle queenside and spent some time analyzing it. o-o-o [ K x f7 ] BxB K[ x R d1 ] [ B x a2 ] [ K h1 ] (looking to grab my bishop after g3) Kg4! (threatening Kxf2) but after [ Q e2 ] or [ Q f3 ] what? His knight can escape taking [ e6 ] making my position very weak (and trheatening my queen). If [ Q e2 ] Kd8-f6? Q[ e6 ] for instance. If after o-o-o [ K x f7 ] BxB K[ x R d8 ] [ B x h2 ] [ K h1 ] [ R f8 ] (instead that RxK) Kx[ e6 ] [ K g4 ] KxQ [ K x [ f2 ] ] K[ x B h2 ] KxQ c2[ x K d3 ] K[ x K c7 ] I am a rook under! If after o-o-o [ K x f7 ] BxB K[ x R d8 ] [ B x h2 ] [ K h1 ] R[ x K d8 ] [ g3 ] [ K g4 ] and white can easily defend [ f2 ] with the queen the rook and the [ c3 ] knight so... I will eventually lose my bishop. For instance: [ R f1 ] (but not [ Q e2 ] because of Bx[ g3 ] and if f2xB[ g3 ] Qx[ g3 ] and I have a playable game with a quality less but two free pawns and the white king very exposed. Anyway if [ Q e2 ] Bx[ g3 ] Qx[ K g4 ] [ B x f7 ] Rx[ e6 ] and it looks no good at all for black) [ R f8 ] [ Q e2 ] or [ K e4 ] and the black attack vanishes even after [ R f6 ] Qx[ K g4 ] [ R h6 ] Qxg7... nothing to do. So I had to wait.
 [ B b7 ] , [ B d3 ]  Having delayed the development of this B White now uses it to reinforce [ e4 ] enabling his Q to move and therefore enabling a future pawn advance and/or attack on g7.
 [ O-O ]  [ B d7 ]  [ h3 ]  [ Q c7 ] , [ B e3 ]  Black should castle here or soon but he decides to prevent [ N b5 ] and expand on the Queen's wing.
 [ N x f6 ]  [ Q x g5 ] , [ Q d7 + ]  I don't like this situation because exchanging benefits white as noted earlier. And there is no way to avoid it.
 [ B g7 ]  [ R g8 ]  [ B x h6 ] , [ Q f6 ]  Trapping the white bishop
 [ Q f8 ] , [ N x f8 ]  
 [ N x d7 ]  [ Q x d7 ] , [ B x f6 ]  White is now ahead by 3 points.
 [ h5 ] , [ g x h5 ]  This is already looking dangerous for black(if you look deeper in position you might disagree) but 23...[ g x h5 ] is the only option what else and now we see a quite odd thing. Rook that was played to [ c5 ] square suddenly eyes this pawn aswell. White can't go for 24.[ R x h5 ] cause black just goes 24...[ N x f3 ] 25.[ N x f3 ] Rxh5. From how the game goes on it might be that 24.[ b x a3 ] would have been the right move as a-pawn is going to be troublesome in this game.
 [ B x f2 ]  [ Q x f2 ] , [ Q x f2 + ]  After [ K x f2 ] white is a rook down because [ R d2 ] wins the bishop. So he resigned.
 [ Q b6 ]  [ K d7 ]  [ K e5 ]  [ K e7 ]  [ Q c7 + ]  [ K e8 ]  [ K f6 ]  [ K f8 ] , [ Q b8 # ]  Again well executed by white. gg
 [ h3 ] , [ h5 ]  !? temporarily sacrificing the bishop to open the h column if [ h x g4 ] then black would have [ h x g4 ] and white couldn't afford to move the knight due to the threat [ Q h4 ] so probably the best is [ g3 ] to open up an escape route via [ g2 ] but allowing [ g x f3 ]  [ d3 ] , [ Q f6 ]  the main line to allow the long castle and at the same time threatening [ B x f3 ] but while I have the bishop "en prise" I still need to keep my queen on the d8-[ h4 ] diagonal
 [ B x b3 ]  [ B x c6 ]  [ R d8 ]  [ a x b3 ]  [ K g7 ] , [ B d5 ]  Oops black wins white's bishop with Pf6. The rook has to move off the rank--possibly Re7+. But [ K f6 ] or [ K f7 ] leaves white with no way to guard against RxBd5.
 [ Q x f3 ]  [ g x f3 ] , [ d2 ]  And my passed pawn is impossible to stop. White gave up here. An enjoyable game and a sour end for White. This game shows that one (two!) wrong moves can drastically change the position.
 [ K h6 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ K g7 ] , [ K x g5 ]  I finally remove the pawn on g5...
 [ e x f6 ]  [ e ] , [ p ]  So now we get into an exchange variation. Like I said before black cannot develop his N or he will lose a B for a P because of 19.PXB QXP.
 [ B c8 ]  [ B d4 ] , [ N g5 ]  At this point I had a good long think. Clearly I have nice space on the Q-side but it appeared only a matter of time until Black broke thru on the King side. I went thru a variety of variations until I finally came up with a line that pleased me. My thought was when I went into these moves the worst I should come up is a point down in material but I would have hopefully minimized Black's K-side pressure.
 [ d6 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ h6 ] , [ B x f6 ]  ? Ugh!!!!! This Bishop makes a very annoying pin which gives White a lot of pressure. White could maintain the pin with [ B [ h4 ] ] and now Black will be hesitant to play ...[ g5 ] unless he absolutely has to. I believe that White made this move thinking that he had a tactical justification based on a fork at [ d5 ] but that was a miscalculation. Much better would be to retreat to [ h4 ] and THEN aim for N[ d5 ] piling on the pinned Knight. It is usually not a good idea to trade off Bishops for Knights without a good reason in open games (because the Bishops' long reach are so useful when there are open diagonals) and that is especially true of this particular Bishop which is 1) White's "Good Bishop" (notice that most of White's pawns are on light squares so that this Bishop complements them very well) and 2) exerting a lot of pressure with this pin
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ B b5 ]  Another game in my Ruy Lopez tournament another strong player matchup. Krewals' rating was still provisional when I played him but it has since gelled in the strong mid-1800s range. I didn't doubt it looking over the sharp sorties he'd thrust and parried thus far or was still fencing.
 [ K x d3 ]  [ h4 ]  [ K e4 ]  [ h5 ]  [ d3 ]  [ h6 ]  [ d2 ]  [ h7 ]  [ d1 = Q ] , [ h8 = Q ]  This position is lost for White because after [ Q g1 ] White's king is forced to the h-file since [ K f6 ] loses to [ Q d4 ] skewer. After the king moves to the h-file I have [ Q h1 ] skewer forcing a queen trade then my king just takes f4-pawn and I promote the last pawn and win. If White's king was on [ g6 ] then I wouldn't be able to force a queen trade and the ending is drawn. If White's king had moved to [ g7 ] then [ Q a1 ] forces a queen trade.
 [ a3 ]  [ a5 ]  [ R d2 ]  [ b4 ]  [ a x b4 ]  [ a x b4 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ B x d5 ]  [ B x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ] , [ f5 ]  Plausible. I still think [ K f8 ] diminishes drawing chances for white...
 [ g x h5 ]  [ f4 ]  [ N g6 ]  [ R a d1 ] , [ R c8 ]  18…[ R c8 ] in hindsight the computer considers this a small error. I don’t think I doubted it at the time but I was also watching …Bxc3.
 [ f x e6 ] , [ Q x e6 + ]  My queen gets into the heart of black's camp.
 [ N x c5 ] , [ B d4 + ]  Assumed he'd take with the king but the Zwischenzug develops the dreaded dark squared bishop plus it pins my king into the corner...
 [ Q d7 ]  [ Q f1 ] , [ R e8 ]  19. ....... [ R e8 ] - now I centralise my last undeveloped piece.
 [ K d3 ]  [ R f2 ]  [ K e3 ]  [ R g2 ] , [ K d3 ]  Moving the rook around isn't making any progress so Black has to try something different ...
 [ c3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ B d3 ] , [ N b d7 ]  Black's knight development on [ d7 ] instead of [ c6 ] will demand white to abandon the "Phoenix Attack" and pursue a different strategy to attack Black's position..Black's knight is less aggressively posted but more defensibly solid.
 [ Q x d1 + ]  [ K x d1 ] , [ B g4 + ]  My opponent again placed me in check early on forcing me to make concessions. I opted to block with f3. The piece itself would be easy for my opponent to deal with.
 [ h6 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ c6 ]  [ Q c1 ] , [ K h7 ]  not one peace was taken from the board and it is obvious that black is defending and white is attacking.
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ c4 ] , [ d x c4 ]  very popular these days...
 [ N c3 ] , [ a6 ]  White develops normally and now according to the world DB 3. ... [ [ [ a6 ] ] ] is by far the strongest move for black and it is the one played by the highest rated players (those two points may very well be self-fulfilling). In any case I don't immdiately see the reason for it. Sure in many openings white likes to post a knight or bishop on [ [ b5 ] ] and black often likes to play [ [ [ a6 ] ] ] to prevent that or to drive away the white piece. I don't see that white can make any terribly strong threats on [ [ b5 ] ] yet and black could hold [ [ [ a6 ] ] ] to drive off the white piece if white plays there. Maybe 3. ... [ N f6 ] to prepare to catle or 3. ... [ d6 ] to open up the other bishop. Still I go with the masters on this one.
 [ K e4 ] , [ K x f6 ]  Now the two Bishops Mate attempt can begin. If I can't work out how to do it within 50 Moves I'll be stuck with a Draw.
 [ c5 ] , [ N f5 + ]  !! the knight will not leave for nothing ! Black king will have no safe harvest black army will remain tied.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ d3 ]  [ N d4 ] , [ N x e5 ]  Oh. My. God. I did not see NxB. How could white be so blind? A move like NxP[ e5 ] would encourage black to seek a four move check mate.
 [ B x b2 ]  [ Q e3 ] , [ N d5 ]  I wait and try to put his queen in danger
 [ N x d4 ]  [ e3 ] , [ B x e5 ]  My plan to take in [ e5 ] with a pawn one of the keys of this opening fails...
 [ B b2 ]  [ Q e7 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ] , [ g4 ]  This is a truly brilliant move which I had missed completely! It immediately puts my poor pinned knight in danger and I cannot even get out of the pin!
 [ B x e2 ] , [ B x d4 + ]  Again check preventing [ R f8 ] .
 [ R e8 ] , [ O-O-O ]  Getting my rook involved.
 [ R x d1 ]  [ R x d1 + ]  [ B f1 ] , [ N f6 ]  16.[ R x d1 ] [ R x d1 + ] 17.[ B f1 ] [ N f6 ] This was forced. Black develops his knight to aid his attack on my Kingside.
 [ Q e3 ]  [ R x e3 + ]  [ K x e3 ]  [ Q d4 + ] , [ K e2 ]  And now is so much easy!!
 [ N c3 ] , [ d x e4 ]  Afterwards I found a game with my opponent as White in which the less popular 6...[ d4 ] was played. He managed to win that game after a long fight. However I continue with the main line and I was still well within my preparation.
 [ g4 ]  [ B g6 ]  [ B x g6 ]  [ f x g6 ]  [ O-O-O ] , [ e6 ]  Looking to complete his development but he now has weaknesses to protect.
 [ R c1 ]  [ B a6 ]  [ B e2 ] , [ Q g7 ]  ..taking care of [ N x e5 ] and [ Q g5 ] threats. Need to bring in the Bishop and [ R a8 ] into the game....
 [ B e3 ]  [ K b7 ]  [ b5 ]  [ Q d1 ] , [ a6 + ]  I tried to recover
 [ K g6 ]  [ R x a7 ]  [ h5 ] , [ R a5 ]  ! a great move! this prevents the black king from getting on [ f5 ] via Re8-[ R e3 + ]  [ R f6 ] , [ R c5 ]  he is in a lost position and only has less the 3 min.
 [ K e5 ]  [ Q d4 + ]  [ K f5 ] , [ K d5 ]  83. .... [ K d5 ] - Henry helps in the driving back process. The WK will be driven to the h column.
 [ a x b5 ] , [ K b1 ]  Guarding [ a2 ] after the knight grabs the [ b5 ] pawn. This was not in fact correct play: white would have done better to press the attack.
 [ N d7 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ g5 ]  This took me by surprise a bit. However I was fairly sure he wasn't going to castle on the king side anymore and decided to start bring my troops together for a queen side attack.
 [ B b3 ] , [ Q c7 ]  No rush to play [ h5 ] you are going nowhere. [ Q c7 ] makes its advance more powerful.
 [ K g1 ] , [ R d1 + ]  then check by black rook on move 45
 [ Q g5 ]  [ R c2 ]  [ h5 ] , [ a4 ]  ! Plans a possible [ Q a3 ] and locks down blacks [ a8 ] rook.
 [ N x d4 ]  [ R e1 + ]  [ B e7 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ N x b3 ] , [ a x b3 ]  Simplifying the position even further. Being up a pawn and doubled pawns in this position seems to benefit me to trade.
 [ K f3 ]  [ K f6 ]  [ g4 ] , [ h5 ]  No way to defend here. White's pawns are a mess.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ f4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ e4 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ N g e2 ] , [ B g4 ]  Black has a strong attack.
 [ e x d5 ]  [ c x d5 ] , [ B d3 ]  We should use the knights to develop since they are the least active and usually go to only [ f3 ] or c3. But the [ B d3 ] move has an idea to counter the development of the black's bad light squared bishop. Therefore it's the best move. By the way I know there are other options including the move 4.c4. But it is more thoery intensive and needs a deeper understanding of the specific ideas.
 [ B a5 ]  [ b4 ]  [ B b6 ] , [ a5 ]  ? [ b5 ] was better. Black would have been forced to play [ c5 ] and this opens the way for Wlsb. Very strong. The played move allowed the exchange. And the exchange has another inconvenient for white a "hidden" one. Can you see it from here?
 [ e3 ]  [ N g6 ] , [ h5 ]  Small pawn-storm on the king's side; the best defence is the offence.
 [ B x g4 ]  [ N x g4 ]  [ O-O ] , [ B g7 ]  Even the best place for Black's extra Bishop isn't great right now with so much mass on the board so he aims it at the White Knight to create pressure.
 [ K f3 ]  [ e5 ] , [ d x e5 ]  50. [ d x e5 ] - here Lee offers me a draw which I accept. This meant that I scored 3 points out of 5 rounds. I stayed for the presentation then drove back to Cambridge feeling satisfied with how the second day ended. Considering that I was out-graded in all five matches 3 points out of 5 is not a bad show. This has been my most successful congress although I did manage 3 points out of 6 games in a 30 minutes per side rapidplay in Peterborough the following summer.
 [ K x h4 ]  [ Q h2 + ]  [ K x g4 ]  [ R d4 + ]  [ K f3 ] , [ Q h3 + ]  Bringing the Black king into White's camp (or what is left of it)!
 [ N e5 ]  [ Q c8 ]  [ N d2 ]  [ N b d7 ] , [ e4 ]  White opens up the center to harness his lead in development but will it prove worthwhile especially since it appears to make him lose a pawn?
 [ B e7 ]  [ O-O-O ]  [ O-O ] , [ R h e1 ]  Just getting everything developed.
 [ Q d1 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ B b4 ]  Pinning his knight so I can play d5.
 [ K f4 ] , [ R e1 e4 # ]  
 [ Q g2 + ] , [ K h4 ]  forced #2
 [ K g8 ]  [ K d3 ]  [ R d6 ]  [ Q h4 ] , [ R x e6 ]  Mistake because of unpatience. From now Black obviously play for draw
 [ N c3 ] , [ N g6 ]  I'll be glad about BxN. Now the danger is [ f5 ] but BxN+ gxB [ N x e4 ] [ R e8 ] and the N is pinned but no pawn can kick him and [ f6 ] defends it as [ N d7 ] and [ B d6 ] just in case so no worry about that.
 [ K x f2 ]  [ Q f5 ]  [ B x c6 ]  [ R a c8 ] , [ B d7 ]  Ouch. Good move. I should have seen that.
 [ g3 ] , [ d6 ]  White's prepares to financhetto his LB by moving pawn to [ g3 ] and I make space for my LB to access the diagonal by moving my pawn to d6.
 [ N e5 ] , [ d x e6 ]  Another immediate threat.
 [ B x a2 ]  [ B x e6 ] , [ B x e6 ]  oponent resigned. i think he gave up prior the last 2 exchanges. comments appreciated. this was a really rough game! i hope i didnt do too many mistakes. please offer better lines if possible
 [ Q a5 ]  [ N d7 ] , [ Q d2 ]  Offering a trade of queens. Black is forced to accept or he loses his [ d7 ] knight.
 [ d6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ h3 ]  To shield my dsb on [ h2 ] if ever [ N h5 ] and supporting [ g4 ] at the proper moment.
 [ f x e6 ] , [ N d x e6 + ]  Win pawns with tempo to make the kibitzers start to believe that you are kind of understanding something.
 [ B e7 ]  [ Q f2 ]  [ N g4 ]  [ Q g3 ]  [ b4 ]  [ N e2 ] , [ B e6 ]  Waiting for white to commit to a line of action
 [ Q f5 + ] , [ e5 ]  Now time to win the knight...
 [ O-O ] , [ N a5 ]  Again seems good to me to hold the castling and activate some figures for black. Now what can I do? I considered that future [ N c4 ] to be annoying enough to have it exchanged for my WB. Will black accept the trade?
 [ K c4 ] , [ Q f4 + ]  The next moves are inevitable.
 [ B x d4 ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ R f3 ] , [ c5 ]  I don't like this move. With white in the posession of a theoretical +3 material advantage black offers an attacking lane that also hampers his queenside advance. It's hard to see an immediate downside to white accepting the offer. If white accepts black will be compelled to recapture with the 'wrong' pawn.
 [ B h5 + ]  [ K f8 ]  [ Q x e8 + ]  [ K g7 ] , [ Q f7 # ]  The end.. 1-0
 [ Q g4 ]  [ Q b7 ]  [ Q e6 + ]  [ K h8 ]  [ Q f7 ]  [ Q d7 ]  [ N e4 ] , [ h6 ]  while [ e4 ] is a nice square for my knight she makes sure it doesn't advance again
 [ B x c3 ]  [ b x c3 ] , [ h6 ]  [ c5 ] might be better.
 [ a4 ]  [ c x b5 ]  [ a x b5 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ f3 ]  [ a6 ]  [ Q f2 ]  [ R h1 ]  [ f x g4 ]  [ a x b5 ]  [ K d2 ]  [ K e7 ] , [ g x f5 ]  Now he came back to put me under pressure but without effective moves
 [ h x g6 ] , [ Q x g6 ]  That's all? Yes! Because the Q is threatening mate on [ h6 ] (or h5). [ R f7 ] is losing the R for nothing and...
 [ N x b6 ]  [ Q x b6 ] , [ B d5 ]  Threatening [ e7 + ] completely winning
 [ d6 ] , [ N x a8 ]  13. [ N x [ a8 ] ] - the [ a8 ] rook is now toast.
 [ N g3 + ] , [ K g1 ]  the only one: returning [ N e2 + ] is useless...
 [ B x h5 ]  [ K x h5 ] , [ a4 ]  Now I have my a-pawn free to queen and my unmoved e-pawn able to queen if I need it
 [ N x e5 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ B x e5 ] , [ B a3 ]  The position is annoying for black : the pieces are not well placed. Black has to reorganise his game. But the material advance and center control widely compensate.
 [ K h8 ] , [ N g5 ]  With this move I thought everything was over. I was wrong as I often am.
 [ R b b1 ]  [ R c5 ]  [ Q d1 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ R c1 ] , [ e6 ]  Fact is I'm pretty much done for. I am hoping to trade everything off in such a way that white has to sacrifice a piece to stop the promotion. That would leave black with two pawns for a piece. One more promotion threat one more sacrifice and black is up a pawn. Yeah not gonna happen but maybe if I can threaten it or if my opponent makes a mistake along the way I can still get a draw or a lucky win out of it. Maybe. Worth playing on to find out.
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ c4 ] , [ d x c4 ]  queen's gambit accepted. let the white proove his gambit.
 [ K d6 ]  [ K c4 ]  [ K c6 ] , [ K b4 ]  
 [ K d7 ]  [ c x b3 ]  [ c x b3 ]  [ R b2 ]  [ N c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N f5 ]  [ Q f4 ]  [ N d3 + ]  [ e x d3 ]  [ N e7 ]  [ Q x f6 ]  [ R b8 ]  [ R c2 ]  [ Q e8 ]  [ N e5 + ]  [ K d8 ]  [ d4 ]  [ Q a4 ]  [ N x f7 + ]  [ K d7 ]  [ Q x d6 + ]  [ K e8 ]  [ Q d8 + ]  [ K x f7 ]  [ R c7 ]  [ B h6 ]  [ Q x e7 + ]  [ K g8 ]  [ Q x h7 + ]  [ K f8 ] , [ Q f7 # ]  
 [ N x d5 ]  [ N c4 ] , [ a6 ]  Alternative variation: 11... [ B e7 ] 12. [ B d2 ] (12. [ d x c5 ] O-O $1 $11)
 [ d5 ]  [ N e2 ]  [ N x e2 ]  [ K x e2 ]  [ B d7 ] , [ c4 ]  Losing precious time. A little better seems the development of the Rook [ h1 ] either with 14.[ R d1 ] or 14.Re1.
 [ O-O ] , [ O-O ]  And now that the Kings are safely tucked away the battle begins.
 [ d x c4 ]  [ B x c4 ] , [ b5 ]  With that being said I was planning to play 9.[ N c3 ] but thinking about the forcing moves which in this case means the obvious reason that is not possible as of the moment.
 [ Q x f3 ]  [ O-O ] , [ O-O-O ]  ?
 [ K d7 ]  [ B c7 ] , [ K e6 ]  here [ b5 ] better black would have had a zugzwang and any move would lose a piece.
 [ O-O ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ O-O-O ]  White lets black to start his counterplay on center 9.[ B c4 ] is more often used nowadays.
 [ b x c3 ] , [ B c4 ]  The rest is simply grinding out the win with the extra pawn.
 [ B d3 ] , [ N f6 ]  White and black both move to protect/threaten the [ e5 ] square.
 [ B f5 ] , [ g4 ]  Surprisingly this is one of the main lines. One of the rare times the early [ g4 ] works
 [ Q x c5 ] , [ B x e7 ]  The only difference is that instead of the K Jack's R is indirectly pinned to his Q. Nontheless I thought that this would lead to the same thing win of serious material. Had that happened the position would be resignable for white.
 [ K h1 ] , [ N d f6 ]  Black brings the knight to a more active square. The drawback is that the retreat square of the g4-knight is now occupied. I think this is a positional mistake that allows me to make progress.
 [ B c2 ]  [ Q e3 ]  [ N x g8 ] , [ R x g8 ]  I did not overlook his Rook at g5; I just felt my Knight was more important.
 [ Q b3 + ]  [ N d5 ]  [ N x g4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ e x d5 ] , [ e x d5 ]  ? Althougth 11. ... [ c x d5 ] loses a pawn but Black needs to think about the King
 [ Q x h4 + ]  [ Q x h4 ]  [ N x h4 ] , [ N d2 ]  (?) Why not castle?
 [ N x h7 ]  [ N x g7 ]  [ N h f6 ]  [ N x e8 ] , [ Q x e8 ]  so we come out of it and black has two knights for a rook and a pawn. blacks h pawn will be hard to defend and the king is a little open but for the most part blacks position is looking pretty fine.
 [ N g3 ]  [ R f8 ] , [ N e4 ]  16. [ N e4 ] - I take the opportunity to improve the position of one of my knights.
 [ B g4 ] , [ d5 ]  ?! The idea being is because of what I learned from Susan Polgar. The difference however is that it involved the French Defense in the Tarrasch variation. You will note that this course was in fact a lecture. The last time I listened to lectures involved unusual openings known as the Owen's followed by the Grunfeld Defense. Since it was unusual it was one of the few things that I didn't remember though I sort of wish I had since it's good to get used to things that are unusual and those lectures involved a variations. The big differences here is that unlike the other two openings the French Defense is a very standard opening and the Tarrasch Variation is what's most often played from what I think she implied. In addition this one with Susan Polgar was even harder since there were more variations. But because of how often it was played even though I wasn't going to remember (since you'd have to memorize which as I've learned from GM's Susan Polgar and Damian Lemos the one thing you don't want to do is memorize anything.) Instead it's about understanding and why they happen I wasn't going to bother remembering everything. But I was going to remember the most important things which was the cornerstone. I forgot the exact variation that is weather three or four. I actually think it was four so somewhere missing one. What I know however is that white kicks black N's not just to gain tempo but also to achieve a solid pawn chain in the opening to give white an advantage. So it is something like 1.[ e4 ] [ e6 ] 2.[ d4 ] [ N f6 ] 3.[ e5 ] The only difference here is that it is not the French Defense and it didn't happen in three or four but rather 8 moves. However I am applying the same concepts and treating it as if this was the Tarrash Variation as it's what I'm comfortable. Moreover which I took right into consideration is that the same thing that makes it special with the French is happening here. That I have a solid pawn chain early so the position is not much different as that of other defense. But in this case it does and is therefore an inaccuracy because of where it's headed.
 [ N c3 ]  [ Q a5 ] , [ Q f3 ]  Watch out for QxPf7.
 [ e x d5 ] , [ N c3 ]  And that's with this move since that backward pawn is now attacked. Believe it or not I didn't think there was anyway for Tom to defend [ d5 ] pawn now. As I felt that in all variations it was all lost. That also came into consideration when I decided to exchange a move earlier. But I was wrong.
 [ d3 ]  [ d6 ] , [ h3 ]  Prevents [ B g4 ] which would be pretty annoying to deal with.
 [ R b7 ] , [ g5 ]  
 [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ N c6 ]  ? This symmetrical defence favors White who exploits his central pawn structure.
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B b5 ] , [ a6 ]  There was a time when I didn't enjoy playing the Spanish at all but nowadays the complex closed positions feels good to play.
 [ N c3 ]  [ N g7 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ B g4 ]  If black exchanges I'm getting rid of his good bishop leaving a slew of potential homes for my remaining knight ([ b5 ] [ c6 ] and f5) and [ b7 ] is wide open for my rook.
 [ Q d7 ]  [ Q f6 + ] , [ K h7 ]  White's play has been easy and natural and he still has the resources of all four minor pieces that can join in.
 [ R c8 ]  [ h4 ]  [ K f8 ]  [ K h2 ]  [ K e7 ]  [ K h3 ]  [ Q f5 + ]  [ g4 ]  [ Q f4 ]  [ Q d5 ]  [ R c7 ]  [ h5 ]  [ B e5 ]  [ N x e5 ] , [ d x e5 ]  Now Black has a second passed pawn--and open lines against White's King.
 [ f6 ] , [ N h3 ]  only safe square for the knight. good pressure from black.
 [ N x d5 ]  [ h3 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ N a3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N b5 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ B b4 + ]  [ B d2 ]  [ B x d2 + ]  [ K x d2 ]  [ O-O-O ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ R x d5 + ] , [ K e3 ]  Better was [ K e8 ] when continued harrassment by the rook is met by white development.
 [ B e2 ] , [ e5 ]  6. [ B e2 ] is a little timid much quieter than 6. [ B e3 ] or 6. Bg5. Black just follows the main premise of the Najdorf playing 6. ... [ e5 ] without fear of the 7. [ B b5 ] reprisal.
 [ B d3 ]  [ R c8 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N x c2 ]  [ B x c2 ]  [ R x c2 ] , [ B a3 ]  Black wins a pawn and now should retreat the rook else it gets trapped as in this game.
 [ c5 ] , [ N e2 ]  (!?) This is better than [ N f3 ] in my opinion. White anticipates that I'm going to castle kingside so he/she can push his f-pawn on the attack anytime he/she likes.
 [ d3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N c3 ] , [ B b4 ]  [ N d5 ] is probably best. I decided to move [ B b4 ] pinning the Knight to gain space on Queenside.
 [ Q x d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N a2 ]  [ R c8 ]  [ d3 ]  [ R x c2 + ]  [ B d2 ] , [ e4 ]  And black should win easily!
 [ f x g6 ]  [ f x g6 ] , [ Q e4 ]  I know tend to my concern (queen-king line up). Again [ R a1 ] was the move here. Thoughts?
 [ B d2 ] , [ f6 ]  How strong is White's center Black asks?
 [ N f3 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ N f6 ]  Solid but not as sharp as 5...Nxc3. Perhaps there is a second lesson here avoid passivity at all costs.
 [ B x c4 ] , [ R x c4 ]  There. The c-file is mine and I now bear down on the backward [ c7 ] pawn. So far so good.
 [ R c4 ]  [ K f3 ] , [ b5 ]  Counterattack?
 [ a4 ] , [ B c2 ]  This is probably the best square for white's light squared bishop but it potentially allows me the chance at an opportune time to get my own inactive (up to this point despite the great diagonal) bishop off the board.
 [ f x e5 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ N x f8 ]  [ R x f8 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ R f2 ]  [ a5 ] , [ Q f1 ]  Looking to break through on the f-file while pressuring black's b-pawn. The point is I'm winning and all I have to do is grind.
 [ Q a4 + ] , [ K d8 ]  so now i can go on whith my little plan to use the f colon ! I think that the victory has become possible he he he ! great pleasure !
 [ R e6 ]  [ N c7 ]  [ R a7 ] , [ N d5 ]  [ N x e6 ] might have been an option...
 [ B e4 + ] , [ K b2 ]  Black has an extra support on [ f5 ] but he can't take gxf anyway! This is fun isn't it?
 [ R e2 ]  [ R f8 f6 ]  [ R g2 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ K e1 ] , [ B c1 ]  I have to admit I did not see that the pawn was hanging bt Black should regain it back anyway.
 [ B b7 ] , [ B a3 ]  i wanted to prevent the opponent castling
 [ R d8 ] , [ Q c6 + ]  For a great deal of time White simply harasses the Black king.
 [ g6 ]  [ Q f3 ]  [ B f5 ] , [ N x f5 ]  the knight is pinned so i can offerd a lil sac to open this up more.
 [ c5 ]  [ f4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ N g5 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ Q x g4 ]  [ N x g4 ]  [ B x f7 + ]  [ K d7 ]  [ B e6 + ]  [ K c6 ]  [ B x g4 ] , [ e6 ]  9. ...... [ e6 ] - this is I think the best move. I have scored pretty well with it as black in my personal db.
 [ d4 ] , [ f5 ]  Signs of the struggle to come. My opponent is a steadfast partisan of the Dutch and never misses an opportunity to defend its honor; for my part the Dutch is one of my absolute favorite openings to play *against*.
 [ B f7 ]  [ Q x h6 + ]  [ K x h6 ]  [ R g4 + ] , [ K h5 ]  The King is being forced away from his supporting troops.
 [ Q x d5 + ]  [ B x d5 ] , [ R d1 ]  Perhaps 19. [ B b2 ] was a better way to defend the pawn.
 [ R e5 + ]  [ K f3 ]  [ K e6 ] , [ K g2 ]  I must have good drawing chances now unless I blunder?
 [ R g8 ] , [ N c7 ]  Where does this crazy knight go? Why so far from his favorite and strongest squares?
 [ g3 ]  [ N g5 ] , [ R h7 h1 # ]  
 [ R f2 + ] , [ K g1 ]  [ e1 ] would have been mate [ g1 ] only option thus [ f1 ] was a wasted move
 [ K d4 ]  [ K f3 ]  [ K c3 ]  [ K x f4 ]  [ K b2 ]  [ a4 ]  [ K x b3 ] , [ B c6 ]  (!) A crucial moment - and a great trap by White. The "automatic" move 46. - Kxc4?? will be refuted by 47. [ K f3 ] followed by eg. [ B b5 ] and a rock-solid draw since White has build a fortress on the light squares. Maybe I am wrong - but I don´t have Fritz to prove it... Nevertheless it became obvious that the c-pawn helps BLACK to win because it blocades Whites Bishop if the a-pawn goes. The next move is therefore both simple and decisive.
 [ R f1 + ] , [ K e8 ]  this now seals the queens fate. although [ K g7 ] doesn't help much either :)
 [ B e1 ]  [ B x b3 ]  [ B x b4 ]  [ B d5 ] , [ Q e1 ]  Trying to prevent an isolated [ e4 ] pawn..
 [ B g5 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ O-O ] , [ a6 ]  This move took me off guard a little. But I knew what to do.
 [ K f2 ] , [ c x d4 ]  
 [ K h2 ] , [ h x g3 + ]  Now if he takes the pawn [ R g8 + ] will follow. For example 24.[ K x g3 ] [ R g8 + ] 25.[ K f2 ] (if he doesn't want to get matted) [ Q h4 + ] 26.[ K x e3 ] (the only move) and now the simple 26...[ Q g3 + ] with mate to follow. So in order to prolong the agony he would have been forced to play Qg4. (I created a mate in 6 puzzle of it you can check it out if you want)
 [ Q e3 + ]  [ K c4 ] , [ B e6 + ]  Bringing my pieces to attack
 [ K b6 ]  [ Q d4 + ]  [ K c6 ]  [ Q c4 + ]  [ K d6 ]  [ Q b4 + ]  [ K e5 ]  [ Q e7 + ]  [ K f4 ]  [ Q x d7 ] , [ Q x h5 ]  so impossible to join the queen... I decided to go back and join my other troops... what a job...
 [ e5 ] , [ a3 ]  With this unusual move I had to wonder what I was up against.
 [ R c1 ]  [ Q a5 ]  [ c4 ] , [ Q x a2 ]  Nabbing this pawn proves very useful later on.
 [ O-O ] , [ g4 ]  The first attacking move.
 [ Q x f5 ] , [ g x f5 ]  I feel I probably was not looking too bad up to now but it looks like my chance has gone with my queen. The way black has blocked the centre with the pawns is not only bad for me but I feel it is bad for black too. So despite black having more pawns it really does not show the real picture. All he has is an extra piece and one passed pawn.
 [ Q d2 ] , [ B f6 ]  Piling on the pressure
 [ R d3 ]  [ O-O ] , [ N a4 ]  [ N a4 ] is a mistake. The correct response for black would have been 17 ... [ N a c5 ] 18. [ N x c5 ] [ N x c5 ] and you would still have had chances. Better would have been 17. [ B x f4 ] [ N e5 ] 18. [ R x d6 ] [ N f3 + ] 19. gxf3.
 [ R e8 ] , [ N a3 ]  Still castling was best as the knight is defended by the bishop on b5.
 [ Q d2 ]  [ N g e7 ]  [ N g e2 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ] , [ R d8 ]  When I analyzed this position I had the sensation that Black was close to equalizing because he is already going to push his pawn to d5. So I decided to remove my dark-squared B in order not to fall victim of a [ d4 ] fork.
 [ c4 ]  [ Q f5 ]  [ B g4 ] , [ Q f6 ]  I thought I was risking in order not to stay passively playing the queen to [ a5 ] just to take it away from the danger but letting him go on with an attack on the center...
 [ Q x e2 ] , [ Q h5 + ]  White played the only move that didn't lose material and black finally plays the move he should have played 5 moves ago.
 [ Q x c7 ]  [ f6 ]  [ Q x d7 + ]  [ K f7 ]  [ Q x b7 ]  [ Q d3 ]  [ Q x b8 ]  [ Q h7 ]  [ Q x c8 ]  [ K g6 ] , [ Q e6 ]  Stalemate! Nice huh...
 [ Q b6 + ]  [ K g2 ]  [ N e3 + ]  [ K h3 ] , [ Q d4 ]  Now if White were to swap Black would threaten to quickly queen the passed central pawn.
 [ N c3 ] , [ B g4 ]  I develop a bishop and attack his queen in the process.
 [ N x c5 ]  [ d x c5 ]  [ B x a6 ]  [ R c7 ] , [ K g3 ]  and now i made a terrible mistake... somewhere here. I am very sad because i had a strong attack at least to force the draw... And now I lose.
 [ Q h5 ]  [ N e2 + ]  [ K h1 ]  [ N f2 + ]  [ R x f2 ]  [ R b1 + ]  [ R f1 ] , [ R x f1 # ]  Thanks Terence for the game. I learned a lot.
 [ B x e5 ] , [ N c5 + ]  The game's as good as over. Black's only the exchange down but he still can't untangle his pieces. For instance after 18 . . . [ K d6 ] the Black bishop will still be tied to [ c8 ] in view of the threat of Nxb7+. White on the other hand needs only a few moves to bring his rooks into the attack against the exposed Black king.
 [ c x d5 ]  [ N a5 ]  [ Q b4 ]  [ b6 ] , [ R x h7 ]  Pretty dangerous stuff. now need to be extra careful.
 [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ d x c4 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ c6 ]  [ a4 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ N b d7 ]  [ N x c4 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ f3 ]  [ e5 ]  [ e4 ]  [ N x c3 ]  [ b x c3 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ R b1 ]  [ Q c7 ] , [ B e2 ]  Wojtaszek R - Gajewski G; ch-POLJ u20; 2003; 1-0 white has more space black is heavily restricted
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ B b5 ]  The Ruy Lopez or Spanish game. White's idea behind the attack is to weaken Black's defense of its [ e5 ] pawn and possibly damage Black's queen-side pawn structure.
 [ N c6 ] , [ K e6 ]  [ K e6 ] - Now Black sees the delima and is attempting to thwart it.
 [ B e7 ] , [ b4 ]  You'd queston it but look at Nc6: he has no place to go after [ b5 ] and [ a6 ] doesn't work beacuse of the pin on the [ a8 ] R. So no developing move right now but any alternative was just a shot in the dark ([ B d3 ] is ok but what for? [ h3 ] so to get a square for the B after Nd5? How boring! Let's be nasty! :-)
 [ N x f3 + ] , [ Q x f3 ]  Down 2 Pawns Black obligingly exchanges for me bringing my Queen out without loss of time.
 [ d x c2 ] , [ R a e1 ]  How about 22.[ R a2 ] which will make the game more neutral?
 [ Q b6 ] , [ B e3 ]  This is bad. I saw [ Q x b2 ] a few moves later.
 [ R d3 ]  [ Q b4 ]  [ B f2 ]  [ R d8 ]  [ R f d1 ]  [ R x d3 ]  [ Q x d3 ]  [ Q d6 ]  [ Q e2 ]  [ Q a3 ]  [ B g3 ] , [ f6 ]  Creating an escape square.
 [ h x g5 ]  [ N x g5 ] , [ N g4 ]  At first I didn't know why black played this. But after what I'm about to do next the blunder that's made I figured out that this is a nasty discover attack in itself.
 [ N h4 ] , [ a x b6 ]  ? This will need to be played at some point if white plans to have any chances however I should have allowed my rook to see along the a file first. Now black wins the a file shutting out any chances white had since most of the game will now be played on the kingside where black is obviously much better. White has to reach an endgame now if there is any hope a queen exchange will be very helpful to white
 [ c4 ]  [ Q e3 ]  [ a5 ]  [ h5 ]  [ e5 ] , [ B g5 ]  I also considered Bh6. But this can result into a loss of time since the exchange is not forced and blacks can simply move the bishop to h8. Then I will have to retreat my bishop so as to enable pieces advancement.
 [ B d3 ] , [ O-O ]  How about [ d x c4 ] here? Decided to take the easy option
 [ Q e6 ] , [ B b2 ]  I made this move to force Black into the ...[ f6 ] move which put another pawn on the dark-squares thus blocking his Bishop in even more.
 [ N f4 + ]  [ K f1 ]  [ N d3 ] , [ N a3 ]  Organizing a further advance.
 [ c x d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ O-O ] , [ O-O ]  However [ B d3 ] is open now.
 [ O-O-O ] , [ R d8 ]  If 12...Qb4? then 13. [ B f6 ]  [ R x d7 ]  [ R d1 ] , [ Q e6 ]  14...Qb4? 15. [ B f6 ] (Too late to step out of the pin)
 [ Q x c6 ] , [ R d3 ]  ! and now the threat is [ R c3 ] followed by a knight fork of K and R from c7.
 [ R x f7 ] , [ B x d5 ]  Pinning Black's rook.
 [ B d7 ]  [ R a8 ] , [ R c2 x c7 ]  ! I foresaw the position and seen that my Rook wouldn't fair to well after the Bishop exchanges and Rook capture. Plus I saw my dark-squared bishop was better on [ e5 ] attacking the King's fortress.
 [ R e e8 ]  [ d4 ]  [ B b6 ] , [ O-O-O ]  At this point White has the advantage the bishop pair and an extra pawn.
 [ b5 ] , [ a3 ]  I'm not sure that this was the right way to proceed. Maybe I could have played a4. Suggestions?
 [ d x e4 ] , [ N d2 ]  White's Knight retreats adding another attacker onto Black's e-pawn.
 [ N f3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N a3 ] , [ c x d4 ]  Why ?? Black should develop. [ B e7 ] or Nc6. Also to consider is retrieving the Queen and accepting the tempo loss with [ Q d8 ]  [ N a6 ] , [ Q x d4 ]  I want to avoid that [ e5 ] is played and i want to keep the center.
 [ B x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ f6 ] , [ Q c6 ]  Here I should have played Qd8! and the knight will have to return to f3.
 [ K e2 ]  [ f4 ]  [ N a3 ]  [ R e3 + ]  [ K f2 ]  [ R x c3 ] , [ d6 ]  Now I was astonished at his decision to push for promotion! I just won a knight!
 [ B x d4 ]  [ N x f4 ]  [ Q f3 ]  [ N x d3 ] , [ Q x d3 ]  Although a piece down for two pawns thats releived a bit of pressure.
 [ Q x b8 ]  [ R x b8 + ]  [ K e7 ]  [ R x f4 ] , [ R e5 ]  Black is lost.
 [ B d7 ] , [ R a d1 ]  control of the center is crucial for white to keep advantage.
 [ R a3 ]  [ a5 ]  [ g4 ]  [ K b5 ]  [ g x f5 ]  [ g x f5 ]  [ R a1 ]  [ a4 ]  [ R d1 ]  [ a3 ]  [ R a1 ]  [ a2 ]  [ h4 ] , [ N b3 ]  Mate in 4 missed with [ N e4 ]  [ R d1 ]  [ R b1 ]  [ R d5 + ]  [ K b4 ]  [ R d7 ]  [ a1 = Q ] , [ R b7 + ]  looking for a draw
 [ a6 ]  [ R a d1 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ R d7 d8 + ]  [ R c x d8 ]  [ R x d8 + ]  [ R x d8 ]  [ N x d8 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N c2 ] , [ b4 ]  The least he can do is go for promotion white needs to talk this through
 [ c3 ] , [ c5 ]  Not anymore!
 [ N x f3 + ]  [ Q x f3 ] , [ e6 ]  Opening up a line for his Bf8. But I would've tried to develop by fianchettoing with 7...g6.
 [ Q c5 ]  [ B x e5 ]  [ N x e5 ] , [ Q x e5 ]  I see we've given up on f7.
 [ Q g3 ] , [ R g7 ]  Threatening White´s Queen and also aiming at White´s pawn at g2.
 [ Q x e5 ] , [ Q x a3 ]  Alone the black queen cannot be that dangerous if white pays attention.
 [ N f6 ] , [ B x f6 ]  Well if [ B g5 ] wasn't a complete mistake so that is a blunder. Why would you possibly play that ? Can someone answer me ? You lose a turn to bring your bishop ahead and then exchange it for a undeveloped knight. Additionaly he allows my black squared bishop to open his diagonal and threaten [ c3 ] and put pressure on [ b2 ] and [ a1 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ] , [ N d5 ]  This move is obviously a mistake. He wants to have the possibility of [ B c7 ] but doesn't see that [ B x b2 ]  [ B x b2 ]  [ R b1 ] , [ Q a5 + ]  Of course I don't retreat immediately. White's mistakes give me a oppurtunity to attack the uncastled king.
 [ Q f3 ]  [ R f e8 ]  [ c4 ] , [ R a c8 ]  17. ...[ d x c4 ] only helps untangle whites messy pawns. However if white intends then 18. ...[ e x c5 ] unleashes the power of the bishop pair. In short White can not afford to open the positon and must strive to keep it closed.
 [ N b4 + ] , [ K d6 ]  I think k[ b6 ] was preferable here. Around this point I realised I needed to try to prevent a draw
 [ B f1 ]  [ Q x a3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B x b4 ]  [ N d4 ] , [ B c5 ]  White is helping Black at the minute. Both players conscious of the time. But White stopped thinking in the last few moves.
 [ g5 ] , [ B e3 ]  no sweat yet: after [ N g4 ] Bf2...
 [ Q x b5 ] , [ R x c3 ]  I capture the pawn on [ b5 ] with my queen and black moves his c rook down to [ c3 ] capturing my pawn and attacking my bishop at [ c1 ] and a pawn at a3.
 [ c5 ] , [ B c4 ]  Any thoughts on whether this is a good move? I know it's a strong move but as I understand it usually you lead with the knights first bishops second? Or is this just a players preference?
 [ d5 ]  [ e x d6 ]  [ e ] , [ p ]  This allows Black easy equality
 [ Q x c5 ] , [ Q f5 ]  Geoff has seen 1 last way of putting me check which I dont see but wasn't far off from stopping.
 [ N x e4 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N g f6 ] , [ N x f6 + ]  Westerinen begins clearing lines at once.
 [ Q h5 ]  [ h6 ] , [ N h3 ]  Why not the simple 31. [ N f3 ] ?
 [ N f6 ] , [ e3 ]  a little bit shy isn't it?
 [ K f6 ]  [ a4 ]  [ N c7 ]  [ K c3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ a5 ]  [ K f5 ] , [ g4 + ]  It would be nice to take the pawn but that would mean I would promote as the King would lose the race and the knight can't compete in it.
 [ a6 ]  [ B c4 ] , [ b5 ]  he continues to chase my bishop...
 [ Q b1 ] , [ Q d2 ]  Looking to mount a direct attack against the King and force a mate or decisive material gain. Note that White is horribly cramped with no piece beyond the second rank or Pawn beyond the third. The *attack* is the way to exploit an opponent's cramped position.
 [ K x g2 ]  [ Q x h6 ]  [ R x h6 ] , [ K g7 ]  White is one rook up.
 [ R d8 + ]  [ K a7 ]  [ R a8 + ]  [ K b6 ] , [ R b8 + ]  setting a trap...
 [ N g4 ] , [ B x f7 + ]  I used to do this a lot. Now I only do it If a bishop is on [ g4 ] pinning my knight to my queen.
 [ B x g2 ]  [ N f2 ] , [ h4 ]  Black increases his positional lead to +1. Following this move white panics and make a mistake followed by two blunders. Black get's excited by the blunders and does on fully capitalize on them.
 [ Q x b3 ]  [ Q x b3 ] , [ R d b1 ]  The worst move in the position .
 [ K f5 ]  [ R f2 + ] , [ B f4 + ]  The bishop demonstrates it's power to both defend and attack. Bishops show their full power in extremely open positions like this. White has a much better chance of drawing if the bishop was a knight since knights aren't as powerful in open positions.
 [ R d2 ]  [ Q c3 ]  [ Q b5 + ]  [ Q c4 ]  [ Q x e8 ] , [ R h4 ]  Now we need to improve our position...
 [ B g5 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ h3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ e3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B f4 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ N b d2 ]  [ d5 ]  [ c3 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ O-O ]  [ a6 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ b5 ]  [ N h4 ]  [ N a5 ]  [ N x f5 ]  [ g x f5 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ f x e4 ]  [ f3 ]  [ e x f3 ]  [ B x f3 ]  [ N c4 ]  [ b3 ]  [ N b6 ]  [ Q d3 ]  [ Q d7 ]  [ B d1 ]  [ K h8 ]  [ B c2 ]  [ f5 ]  [ Q e2 ]  [ R a e8 ]  [ R e f1 ]  [ N c8 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ N d6 ]  [ R a c1 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ B x e4 ]  [ f x e4 ]  [ Q h5 ]  [ e6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ b x c4 ]  [ b x c4 ]  [ c6 ]  [ c5 ]  [ Q f7 ]  [ Q g4 ]  [ Q g6 ]  [ Q e2 ] , [ R e a8 ]  Equal? Black has a doubled pawn on the e file. Material is level.
 [ b4 ] , [ N f4 ]  Finally! Welcome to the party! Is it too late....? It is now certainly a very interesting game. Whose flanking attack has more momentum? Let's find out...
 [ R x b4 ] , [ Q x b6 ]  28. ...... [ Q x b6 ] - now a knight trade.
 [ d5 ]  [ d3 ] , [ N f6 ]  4. ..... [ N f6 ] - maybe I should have undoubled those e pawns at once and played PxP but that would have allowed the Wicked Witch of the West to come into [ h5 ] and with a knight on [ g5 ] it would have looked really nasty for Henry. So [ N f6 ] prevents this check.
 [ B e3 ] , [ B x e3 ]  Black is eager to trade off but after 7. [ Q x e3 ] White is leading in development. Note that his bishop is serving a good purpose on [ c4 ] helping the pawn on [ e4 ] defend the pawn on [ d5 ] and can't be attacked very easily. Unfortunately for White it doesn't threaten much.
 [ R b d1 ]  [ N a5 ] , [ Q a6 ]  It is a really big tactical mistake now. The queen has no where to go. Therefore black needs to search for tactical resources. Can you find the right move?
 [ N d3 ] , [ a4 ]  Just to remove the bishop from the diagonal.
 [ K a7 ]  [ a2 ]  [ K a6 ] , [ a1 = Q # ]  I shake a dead fish hand say "Good game" and promptly go record the result. Junior pitches a fit and runs to momma. Three people offer to buy me beer. I forget about this game quickly and avoid talking about my opponent although several other players are obviously pleased. I however have other things to consider. To my pleasant surprise I now calculate that if I can win round 5 and another player wins her game she and I will tie for 2nd place and we will split $300. We chat for a bit wish each other luck and prepare for the last round. She studies an opening book. I smoke cigarettes:)
 [ a4 ] , [ b4 ]  Refusing to trade that was unexpected but may force me to change my plans slightly if he can protect it with a3.
 [ R x g7 + ] , [ Q x g7 ]  now thinking it'll be interesting to see how Rook and knight work together.
 [ N e1 ]  [ B g6 ]  [ R d1 ]  [ R x d1 ]  [ Q x d1 ] , [ R d8 ]  Black could have gone for the pawn on [ b2 ] here somewhere but decides to play for activity.
 [ Q e7 ]  [ R h e8 ] , [ Q x g7 ]  Here I could have played [ R g8 ] and won his queen but I sniffed mate.
 [ N x h3 + ]  [ K h2 ] , [ N f4 ]  23. ..... [ N f4 ] - back to f4. Now the [ g4 ] pawn is weak. White's next move allows me to snap it off.
 [ K c3 ]  [ K a7 ] , [ R x d3 ]  If he exchanges rooks I must win due to my king's proximity to his pawns since my doubled pawns prevent him to easily take them.
 [ B x c4 ] , [ B x c4 + ]  notice that black's queen the most powerful piece on the board is reduced to a lowly bishop.
 [ d5 ]  [ Q e1 ]  [ e4 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ e3 ]  [ B x g4 ]  [ e x d2 ] , [ Q g3 ]  18. [ Q g3 ] - in the space of a few moves though things can change a little.
 [ N e8 ]  [ R d2 d8 ] , [ g5 ]  ? this just allows [ B b5 ] winning yet another piece.
 [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ d6 ] , [ N c2 ]  I don't know where I got this. It must have been in the DB. 7. [ N [ f3 ] ] seems OK as does 7. [ N x c6 ] or just leaving it there and moving it after black plays e4. From [ c2 ] it doesn't do much that it could do from [ f3 ] but it does cover [ b4 ] if white wants to advance the pawn and it is safe from being pinned. It also allows [ N e3 ] which can put more pressure on [ d5 ] the whole point of the Maroczy Bind.
 [ B x b5 + ] , [ N c6 ]  ! Blocks the check.
 [ b5 ] , [ N x d6 ]  I decide to take down something before I see the grave.
 [ O-O ] , [ B d6 ]  developing my dsb with an eye toward [ h2 ]  [ d3 ]  [ O-O ] , [ g3 ]  He must really be worried about the pawn at [ f4 ]  [ f x e5 ] , [ N x e5 ]  I take back with the knight because I want to save my bishop for the endgame.
 [ Q d7 ] , [ Q d3 ]  BUT HE DIDNT SEE IT
 [ B g5 ]  [ Q f7 ] , [ h3 ]  I think that better was [ N d2 ] with f4.
 [ b x c6 ] , [ O-O ]  Tucking the king away in a safe corner. Keeping the King in the middle usually creates attacking chances for the other player later down the road.
 [ N h6 ]  [ R c3 ]  [ f5 ] , [ f4 ]  I think I have better chances then to promote a pawn once...
 [ B e7 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ f3 ]  [ e x f3 ] , [ B x f3 ]  12. [ B x f3 ] - pawn trade.
 [ K h8 ]  [ N e2 ]  [ a5 ] , [ f5 ]  nice little trick he fell right in
 [ d x e5 ]  [ K e6 ]  [ f4 ]  [ g5 ]  [ g3 ]  [ g x f4 ]  [ g x f4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ K f2 ]  [ d4 ] , [ a3 ]  His pawn advantage on the queenside keeps me honest in the end game
 [ R c8 + ]  [ K g7 ]  [ R c7 + ]  [ K f6 ] , [ R x h7 ]  That pawn will turn out to place the Rook too far from the King but other moves weren't so better for White.
 [ N d2 ] , [ B x h3 ]  I win a piece in a tactic as if he recaptures then I can mate him.
 [ b4 ] , [ N b7 ]  Returning the Knight to [ e6 ] seems more natural to me.
 [ e3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ O-O-O ] , [ N e4 ]  The N threatens to capture on [ f2 ] forking the Rs and Q. If White plays [ N x e4 ] [ d x e4 ] forks the N and Q.
 [ K f8 ]  [ f5 ] , [ B c8 ]  missed this
 [ Q d6 ]  [ Q e2 ] , [ a5 ]  Now Reshevsky's backward QNP is fixed as a target.
 [ K e6 ]  [ R f8 ]  [ K d5 ] , [ R a8 ]  Instead White attacks the pawns from behind: a good plan since Black will have difficulty keeping everything defended.
 [ N d2 ]  [ R a4 ]  [ Q e2 ]  [ Q g6 ]  [ R a f1 ]  [ R x a2 ]  [ N d2 f3 ]  [ N e6 ]  [ N h4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N x g6 ]  [ N x e2 + ]  [ K h1 ]  [ h x g6 ]  [ R f5 f3 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ h4 ]  [ R e4 ]  [ g3 ] , [ R x b2 ]  white resigns
 [ b x c3 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ N x c3 ] , [ Q d3 ]  I expected [ Q d2 ] here aiming for Bh6.
 [ K x f5 ] , [ B x d6 + ]  White is down a pawn in material. But Computer says White has +9 advantage.
 [ R x e7 + ]  [ B x e7 ] , [ Q x d5 + ]  By the traditional values for material white has a modest advantage of one pawn after that sequence. But black has lost two pieces around his vulnerable king and white still has a swarm of them hovering nearby as well as the continuing initiative.
 [ K d8 ] , [ Q f6 + ]  Do it right here and NOW!
 [ B x b5 ] , [ B d3 ]  I can't lose this pawn too!
 [ Q f3 + ] , [ N f6 ]  Black blocks the check frees up his queenside a bit and threatens to recover the pawn by capturing on d4; but if I play carefully I can inhibit Black's development while pursuing my own. For example Black's [ B c8 ] is tied to the defence of [ b7 ] which can't move because it's pinned against the Ra8. I can also tie Black's Q to the defence of [ f6 ] by attacking the N with [ B g5 ] and put pressure on the isolated e pawn with Bc4.
 [ B b6 ] , [ h3 ]  Attacking the horse not really developing any pieces. I get the advice not to temper with pawnformation too much in the beginning.
 [ R b1 ]  [ R b4 ]  [ R c2 ]  [ B e5 ]  [ Q g1 ]  [ e3 ]  [ b3 ] , [ Q g5 ]  Threatening ...[ f4 ] and ...f3.
 [ Q d2 ] , [ B x h1 ]  The obvious 16 [ N x f7 ] QxB NxR was not enough to save the game. Another try could have been 16. [ Q d3 + ] [ B e4 ] (if KxB 17. [ Q g3 + ] and mate the next one) then 17. [ Q g3 ] and black has only [ h5 ] to avoid Qg4#. But then 18. [ B e3 ] and I can see no escape to 19. Qf4#. Am I right? But I blundered again.
 [ B c3 ]  [ Q d3 ]  [ Q d4 ]  [ Q x d4 ]  [ B x d4 ]  [ a5 ] , [ c6 ]  ? Alternative variation: ['better is'] 39. [ f3 ] [ a4 ] 40. [ B b2 ] [ ]
 [ R x e5 ] , [ R d2 ]  42. ...... [ R d2 ] - 4 pawns to the bad I throw everything at Ion's king. Alas thanks to Ion's pesky knight Ion has another little combo up his sleeve to force a rook trade.
 [ N c6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ g6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B g7 ] , [ c3 ]  Relieving the dsb from the protection of [ b2 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ O-O ]  [ b3 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ B b2 ] , [ N d7 ]  As black I feel that I should try to break though queen side with this set up.
 [ a3 ]  [ O-O ] , [ R a2 ]  What? If you understand that move tell me in the comments.
 [ Q d7 ]  [ a x b5 ]  [ c x b5 ] , [ N e5 ]  Now it is a matter of time before black suffers serious material loss.
 [ g4 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ N x g6 ]  ? -- Still trying to lose. Instead an immediate 33. [ g5 ] had a nasty little bite to it without dropping a pawn.
 [ N f3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ h3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ e5 ]  [ e3 ]  [ e4 ]  [ N h2 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ Q d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ a6 ]  [ B a4 ]  [ b5 ]  [ B b3 ]  [ a5 ]  [ N x b5 ]  [ Q b4 + ]  [ N c3 ] , [ a4 ]  This looks good for him
 [ K g3 ]  [ K g1 ]  [ K x g4 ] , [ K x g2 ]  The b2-pawn falls and Black will queen his own b-pawn after 81 [ K4 ] [ K f2 ] 82 [ K e4 ] [ K e2 ] 83 [ K d4 ] [ K d2 ] 84 [ K x c4 ] [ K c2 ] etc.
 [ B x h7 ]  [ K x h7 ]  [ R e4 x e7 ]  [ K g7 ]  [ R x b7 ]  [ Q x h4 ]  [ R e e7 ]  [ Q f6 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ Q f4 ]  [ R e x f7 + ]  [ Q x f7 ]  [ R x f7 + ]  [ K x f7 ]  [ N d6 + ]  [ K e6 ]  [ N x c4 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ K f1 ]  [ R f8 ]  [ f3 ]  [ R f4 ]  [ N a5 ]  [ K d5 ]  [ N b3 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N x c5 ]  [ N x c5 ]  [ d x c5 ]  [ K x c5 ]  [ K e2 ] , [ R b4 ]  Its easy to play that.
 [ B c7 ]  [ Q f5 ]  [ R h g8 ]  [ K f2 ]  [ Q b5 ] , [ g3 ]  25. [ g3 ] - I have been wanting to get Henry back to safety but it is not that easy.
 [ N x e2 ]  [ e6 ]  [ O-O ] , [ c5 ]  Black is not yet castked and its kind of dangerous to open the center now.
 [ e5 ] , [ a4 ]  And now I want more space on the queenside. Also possible was 0-0-0.
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ c4 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N x c6 ] , [ b x c6 ]  I don't quite know what to call this opening - an English that aspires to be a Sicilian? A Sicilian that wants to be an English when it grows up? It looks most like a Maroczy Bind but White needs a pawn at [ f3 ] to make that official.
 [ N d5 ] , [ h8 = Q ]  37. [ h8 = Q ] - Glenda 2 appears but she is snapped up immediately by the black knight. But that knight is also about to disappear from the board!
 [ d5 ] , [ e x d5 ]  Begging her royal highness to enter the middle.
 [ g5 ] , [ R x g5 ]  I decided to make this pawn trade to gain a passed pawn.
 [ N f3 ]  [ g6 ] , [ B f4 ]  I don't know if there is a preferable square for the bishop but I wanted to play e3...
 [ b x a3 ] , [ b x a3 ]  Did you consider 8.b4?
 [ K h2 ]  [ b4 ]  [ N e2 ]  [ b3 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ b2 ]  [ N c b3 ]  [ B x b3 ]  [ N x b3 ] , [ R d1 ]  Most of white's problems stemmed from the misplayed opening which eventually allowed black a nice outpost on [ d4 ] total control of the a-file and ultimately a winning endgame. Don't bring out the queen too early! Concentrate on minor piece deployment and only when you get a feel for how the position is developing should you engage the queen.
 [ g5 ]  [ N d7 ] , [ K b1 ]  not a usual move for Tips but neatly relieves the mounting pressure on the a and b pawns and knight on [ a1 ]  [ N d5 ] , [ Q d8 ]  ? Drops a pawn. Was expecting 18...Bxd5. Now 19 [ N x e7 + ] [ Q x e7 ] 20 [ Q x d6 ] [ Q x d6 ] 21. [ R x d6 ] [ a5 ] 22 [ h4 ] and it's White's turn to turn the screws!
 [ R x h5 ]  [ R d1 ]  [ R d5 ] , [ K b1 ]  33. [ K b1 ] - Henry moves back to try and protect his rook and Frere Lenoir.
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ c4 ]  This was the start of the themed mini tournament.
 [ h5 ] , [ B e1 ]  37. [ B e1 ] - black now finally resigns after I announced mate in 3. Now I leave it to you to send me your answers in a pm. Spot the checkmate!
 [ N c3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ h3 ]  [ c5 ]  [ d x c5 ]  [ e5 ]  [ b4 ]  [ a5 ]  [ B a3 ]  [ N a6 ]  [ Q b1 ] , [ a x b4 ]  I initiate the exchange because I think it will end in my favor.
 [ c5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ a3 ]  [ a6 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ B e7 ] , [ d4 ]  All even to here and then I push d pawn
 [ B c4 ] , [ B g4 ]  Pinning the Knight and developing white has two choices to break the pin [ h3 ] or [ B e2 ] he didn't want to move the bishop twice in a row so
 [ R x f6 ]  [ h8 = Q ]  [ R d6 ]  [ Q e8 + ]  [ K d5 ] , [ Q f7 + ]  I think I would have taken the a4-pawn.
 [ N g4 ]  [ f4 ] , [ Q e8 ]  Preparing the attack. White's King has nowhere to go so a few waiting moves are fine. Also this defends against [ N x e6 ] - White's one good attack.
 [ e x f5 ]  [ R x e1 + ]  [ R x e1 ]  [ Q x c3 ] , [ R e7 ]  Wow----now the game is at that point of who is zooming whom? Extreme apologies for the waiting.......
 [ e5 ]  [ B x c3 ] , [ b x c3 ]  White has very weak Q side Should have done something to avoid this breakup
 [ B f1 ]  [ R h8 ]  [ Q e2 ]  [ e5 ]  [ O-O-O ] , [ Q h7 ]  Change of plans... the queen and rook are shooting the wrong way...
 [ d x c6 ] , [ B x f3 ]  ...but by attacking his Queen this prevents him from playing [ c x b7 ] threatening to Queen his pawn!
 [ f6 ]  [ N x d7 ]  [ N x d7 ]  [ a4 ]  [ b x a4 ]  [ R x a4 ]  [ N e7 ]  [ R a6 ]  [ N c8 ]  [ R e1 + ]  [ B e5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ d4 ]  [ N d5 ] , [ R b8 ]  Nothing protects P[ d4 ] from Bxd4. [ B e5 ] is pinned by Re1.
 [ e x d5 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ Q h4 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ a5 ]  [ R c1 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ R f b8 ]  [ b3 ]  [ R b c8 ] , [ B f1 ]  Covering the Kingside bases and also preparing to boot Black's Queen back behind her own lines where she belongs.
 [ c4 ]  [ g5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ g4 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ d6 ] , [ N d3 ]  White is not bad but it is a strange play for him since the knight in [ d3 ] is unusual.
 [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ a6 ]  The usual first 5 moves.
 [ e5 ]  [ B d2 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ B e3 ]  Now that I saw that my opponent moved the same piece twice in a row whilst blocking the advance of his central pawn I was almost sure I had this game in the bag.
 [ O-O ] , [ h3 ]  prophylaxis! yes I was planning [ B e3 ] but I spent a little too much time on this move. I passed the move to Black
 [ c4 ]  [ Q d8 ]  [ d5 ] , [ N b4 ]  white played [ d5 ] but the diference is that he has no pawn on [ c3 ] so the black Knight can stand proud on b4.
 [ N f6 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ Q x d5 ]  [ d4 ]  [ B b4 + ] , [ c3 ]  Not wanting to trade pieces or double pawns I deny my Queenside Knight it's precious [ c3 ] post.
 [ d x c6 ] , [ d4 ]  That's right. It's this move as after we exchange his [ B c5 ] is attacked. So with this extra tempo I could not be any happier.
 [ Q x g2 + ] , [ K x g2 ]  27. [ K x g2 ] - yup black blunders his queen and then waves the white flag. If black had not blundered his queen I feel I would have been extremely lucky to get away with a Low Draw otherwise I feared I would lose 16 points as stated in my introductory note. This win gives me 7 point out of 10 games in this mini-tourney. Not bad at the half-way stage let's hope I can hold things together in my remaining games. Do you the jury feel that taking that pawn en passant was an improvement on Freddy's game. I will be very interested to hear your views. Hope you have all had a good read. Bye for now. Joanne
 [ K f7 ]  [ N e5 + ]  [ K g7 ] , [ Q h5 ]  16. Qh5! This was the kicker and the hardest move to decide on during analysis. The placement of the queen here seals the deal; most lines now end in mate.
 [ R f5 ] , [ N e4 ]  Good placement on a white sq with tempo
 [ B x c4 ]  [ B x c4 ]  [ R x c4 ]  [ R f4 ]  [ R c a4 ]  [ R h4 ]  [ R a4 x a2 ]  [ R x a2 ]  [ R x a2 ]  [ R x h5 ]  [ R x c2 + ]  [ K f3 ]  [ R c3 + ] , [ K g4 ]  39. [ K g4 ] - my queenside has been massacred - completely caved in from relentless pressure but here comes some counterplay of my own.
 [ B e7 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ B x f6 ] , [ Q h5 ]  12. [ Q h5 ] - Glenda goes on the offensive! She comes out with an immediate threat Qxh7#!
 [ c5 + ]  [ K c6 ]  [ K e4 ]  [ R x a8 ]  [ K x e5 ] , [ K x c5 ]  I am now up a knight and a rook! He resigned.
 [ K x g7 ] , [ K g1 ]  Now my K is in position to capture either Black pawn if it advances and Black's K is too far away to prevent to promotion of my QRP.
 [ K b1 ] , [ Q x f3 ]  And this is where he resigns. Good game bro. .............................................................................................. gmflash2008: This was completely senseless. .............................................................................................. Really? It will probably make more sense to you when you learn some chess notation. :) GL!
 [ B e7 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ B x f6 ] , [ e4 ]  White soldiers party in City Centre (Computer suggest more cautios move with e3)
 [ Q f2 ]  [ R g8 ] , [ R d c1 ]  I'm not sure what the deal was with this move but White is very constrained in any case.
 [ b x c3 ]  [ Q x c3 + ]  [ Q c2 ]  [ Q x c2 + ]  [ K x c2 ]  [ f x g5 ] , [ B e5 ]  i hoped him to take my pawn so i could take back his and double the rooks.
 [ R d2 + ]  [ K g1 ] , [ R g3 # ]  
 [ B c7 ] , [ c x d5 ]  Accepting doubled pawns to get rid of black's only active piece (should he exchange) and to get back the pawn.
 [ N f4 ]  [ N c4 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ B e3 ]  putting White in control...
 [ R e7 x e6 ]  [ g4 ]  [ c7 + ]  [ K d7 ]  [ R e6 e8 ]  [ R x e8 ]  [ R x e8 ]  [ K x d6 ] , [ c8 = Q ]  And black resigned. Black's failure to develop and get castled cost him dearly in this one. I can only hope to get so lucky again in my next game against him!
 [ B d3 ] , [ g5 ]  Attacking White's DSB. No big deal.
 [ N x d7 ]  [ B x d7 ]  [ N a4 ]  [ b5 ]  [ N c5 ]  [ B x c5 ] , [ b x c5 ]  here i am wondering over between [ B e8 ] and Nd5.[ B e8 ] protecting [ d4 ] via [ h5 ] is annoying for a short period of time. [ N d5 ] is chosen mainly because of possible opening of the f-file and the giving the black queen control of the d8-[ h4 ] diagonal.
 [ O-O ]  [ h4 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ B h3 ]  [ g6 ] , [ N h6 + ]  Nh6!+ Check and the discovered threat to the queen.
 [ N c3 ] , [ B g4 ]  This move not too good.....watch and see
 [ K h1 ] , [ N x e3 ]  Alternative variation: 31... [ B h8 ] 32. [ B h3 ]  [ B h3 ] , [ N c5 ]  .
 [ O-O-O ]  [ B b4 ]  [ N b5 ] , [ O-O-O ]  And so after his castle my dsb development he plays the Knight to [ b5 ] and I go with my castle.
 [ g4 ]  [ h6 ]  [ a3 ]  [ a6 ]  [ K e2 ] , [ R h b8 ]  good move the idea is to advanced [ b5 ] and open B file for the black rooks if 17... b5?! was sooner played so 18.d5-exd5.19.cxd5-Ne5.20.[ f3 ] and probably drawn game .
 [ R x e5 + ]  [ B e7 ] , [ R h e1 ]  After having the last move forced Nathan doubles up as things are suddenly looking very bad for black.
 [ c x d5 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ N x c3 ]  10... [ R e8 ] is also possible
 [ N x e5 ] , [ Q x b5 ]  This however is where I take back. But white's next move proves to be dangerous which I miss.
 [ g3 ] , [ B g4 ]  good idea for black- now if white play Q:[ g4 ] black have q:[ e4 ] and after this Q:h1...
 [ K h1 ] , [ R e8 ]  ? this is a mistake looks like a perfectly good move though doesn't it.
 [ O-O ]  [ N d5 ] , [ Q x a2 ]  !? Black decides to swap his e-pawn for the white a-pawn. Black's plan is all about Q-side play so passive defense of the e-pawn is out of the question.
 [ a4 ] , [ h6 ]  Securing [ g5 ] so to be able to play f5.
 [ K f2 ]  [ Q b6 + ]  [ K g2 ]  [ Q g6 + ] , [ K f2 ]  Draw Agreed. A highly entertaining game that had its highs and lows.
 [ B x b7 ]  [ Q x b7 ] , [ Q g5 + ]  White has regained material equality but his king is feeling the draft.
 [ B e3 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ B x d4 ]  [ Q a5 + ]  [ c3 ]  [ e6 ] , [ a4 ]  Getting pawns to [ a5 ] and [ b4 ] seems to lock down the dark squares.
 [ N x e6 ]  [ Q x e6 ]  [ B f3 ]  [ R d8 ]  [ g3 ]  [ B e5 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ R e3 ]  [ R d8 ]  [ c4 ]  [ R d2 ]  [ B d5 ]  [ Q e7 ]  [ a4 ] , [ Q b4 ]  31. Qb4! the trap is set for mate here and the will coordinated forces of the black make it difficult to get away
 [ B d3 ] , [ Q f6 ]  Threatening mate on f2.
 [ N g f6 ]  [ R e1 ] , [ B b4 ]  black finally takes advantage of the [ [ b4 ] ] square but this should really have been done earlier when the king was still in the centre when the bishop on [ [ b4 ] ] would cause white some problems. as it is black isn't even threatening the [ e4 ] pawn as he would have been if the king was on [ e1 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ] , [ e x d5 ]  ?? loses instantly. black should try ...[ e5 ] trying to keep the centre closed
 [ h3 ] , [ R h6 ]  This move allows white to capture black's knight as well as black's rook. Black's knight should have retreated back to f6.
 [ N d x b5 ]  [ a x b5 ]  [ N x b5 ] , [ B a6 ]  Black must react energetically but dares not exchange too many pieces - and definitely not his Queen! - or White's Q-side phalanx will spring to life.
 [ B x c3 + ]  [ b x c3 ] , [ N x e4 ]  My purpose in capturing this pawn is to make my opponent think thus getting the edge over time.
 [ K a8 ] , [ B f3 + ]  getting it set up for the kill
 [ N e2 ] , [ N f g4 ]  Now this looks promising. Careless play here by white could cost him his queen such as by 11. [ Q g3 ] [ N g6 ] 12. [ Q f3 ] [ N h4 ] 13. [ Q h3 ] Nxf2.
 [ K x f4 ] , [ R g4 + ]  maintaining the initiative
 [ Q e7 ]  [ Q x h8 ] , [ N f6 ]  This is the attempt to trap the white queen
 [ N x d4 ] , [ N x d4 ]  Now black will play [ R c4 ] winning back the b-pawn. This leads to a dead-even endgame so both players accept a draw. Just goes to show that when you step onto a chessboard everyone starts with the same 16 men (err 15 men and one lady) and anything can happen!
 [ N x d5 ] , [ B c5 ]  Plan is to have both bishops pointing straight at his King
 [ K g2 ]  [ N f4 + ] , [ K g1 ]  White plays the waiting game in his turn. On 32. [ K h1 ] I planned 32. ...[ R f7 ] followed by ...Nh3.
 [ d x e5 ]  [ N c x e5 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ N x d7 ]  [ Q x d7 ]  [ B x d6 ] , [ Q x d6 ]  Get through it. I don't mind my position so much now. My queen is active and the bishop strikes right at White's King. Maybe not a bad gambit...
 [ f x e4 ]  [ O-O ] , [ B x c5 ]  This seems a mistake to me for now white has nothing on the center and the black queen will be well placed on [ c5 ] soon supported by a rook.
 [ N a5 ]  [ N x a5 ] , [ b x a5 ]  Creating a passed pawn.
 [ B x d5 ]  [ N x d1 ]  [ Q e7 ]  [ Q x e7 ]  [ R x e7 ] , [ c x d5 ]  Pratically forced as after a knight move white eats up all the queenside pawns.
 [ a5 ] , [ R f6 f5 ]  trying to create a passed pawn.
 [ b4 ]  [ R e7 ]  [ K c2 ]  [ K h7 ]  [ K d3 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ b5 ]  [ B f5 + ]  [ K c4 ] , [ R c7 + ]  Still hoping to force an error and win back at least one Pawn in a position where I could salvage a draw.
 [ B x c5 ]  [ d x c5 ] , [ g3 ]  Now it makes sense as to why he didn't castle short. Not sure the reason behind it but Joe's plan was to play this. Therefore I don't know what it accomplishes but it must be something good.
 [ Q g6 + ]  [ K h4 ] , [ R g8 ]  White has no threats left.
 [ N x d4 ] , [ Q c5 ]  and here it is now white is at least pinned down for the moment and it gives me a few moves to try to come out of my passivity.
 [ B x c5 ]  [ Q c2 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ b4 ]  [ B b6 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ B x h6 ]  [ g x h6 ]  [ B x c6 ]  [ b x c6 ]  [ O-O ] , [ O-O-O ]  Castling on opposite sides - this should get exciting. Black couldn't exactly castle on the kingside...though I grant you my queenside wasn't that good either.
 [ b x c6 ] , [ Q e2 ]  thus attacking both the Bish at [ f2 ] and the pawn at e5.
 [ N x f6 + ] , [ g x f6 ]  [ Q x f6 ] drops the B on b4.
 [ Q x g6 + ] , [ Q x g6 ]  
 [ Q e3 ] , [ R c8 c7 ]  Computer prefers [ Q b6 ] but I wanted to keep queens on as I am a pawn down. "Exchange pawns but not pieces" is the general advice when material down.
 [ N c4 ]  [ a4 ]  [ a6 ]  [ a x b5 ]  [ a x b5 ]  [ h6 ]  [ R g3 + ]  [ K h5 ]  [ R h3 + ]  [ K g5 ]  [ K d6 ]  [ N f5 + ]  [ K e5 ]  [ R e2 + ]  [ K d5 ]  [ K f6 ]  [ c5 ] , [ R e7 ]  the pawn is loose...
 [ N e7 ] , [ B d3 ]  White castles sound good right now
 [ K g2 ] , [ Q x c4 ]  Better might have been capturing the knight because that would continue the attack but I played this to get rid of the mate threat.
 [ N b d7 ] , [ Q c2 ]  at this point the game looks to favor black who has more space and his pieces are mobilized whereas white has his two bishops locked in on the back rank.
 [ Q e8 ]  [ B g5 ] , [ Q g8 ]  24. ...... [ Q [ g8 ] ] - Glenda steers her broomstick to [ g8 ] and waves her wand at the enemy dsb who moves out of the way to h4.
 [ R d1 ]  [ R b c8 ]  [ B b3 ]  [ N a4 ] , [ B x a4 ]  Both b and c-files are possessed by Tal and his [ b2 ] pawn is once again invincable. Trading pieces doesn't seem to do much for White. At this point he doesn't seem to have very many options.
 [ N c3 ]  [ d x e4 ] , [ N x e4 ]  Pretty standard stuff. Main line is [ B c4 ] then [ N g3 ] [ B g6 ] [ h4 ] [ h6 ] [ h5 ] [ B h7 ] [ N f3 ] [ N d7 ] and [ B d3 ]  [ N x f6 + ] , [ g x f6 ]  THis is the Bronstein- Larsen variation. Although rather dubious black tries to attack down the g- file.
 [ N g4 ]  [ N x g4 ]  [ h x g4 ] , [ B x g4 ]  Two pawns up :D
 [ R g8 ] , [ R b1 ]  My a pawn obviously cannot be taken
 [ K f3 ] , [ f5 ]  Adding force to my attack on the KNP.
 [ K h7 ] , [ h3 ]  Give my king an escape square just in case.
 [ B c6 ] , [ h4 ]  And this does not help either. [ f4 ] was the lesser evil.
 [ R g8 ]  [ g3 ] , [ B f6 ]  I took care of that piece...for now.
 [ R e1 ] , [ B x c4 ]  White moves h rook to e1. Black moves light bishop to c4.
 [ K x f7 ] , [ f5 ]  Now I'm glad I castled.
 [ B x g4 ] , [ K b6 ]  Black escapes the nasty 10.[ N e6 + ] royal fork and seeks shelter in the queenside.
 [ B x f6 ] , [ g x f6 ]  Opens the K position up but there is no other choice.
 [ N e7 ] , [ R c x f6 + ]  The rooks are forked but since either one can move with check allowing the other to escape the fork it's a failed fork. Further white captures the remaining isolated f-pawn in the process.
 [ B x b5 ]  [ Q d4 + ]  [ K a3 ]  [ Q b4 + ] , [ K a2 ]  White's only move.
 [ e3 ] , [ B e6 ]  If Black wants to try to hold on to the pawn he should have played 3...[ c6 ] or 3...a6.
 [ Q d1 + ]  [ R x d1 ] , [ R x d1 # ]  After this game Jack of course asked who won. And he said that we moved a little too quick. I told him how much time I had which was about 16. But I mentioned that Carl lost in only 10 minutes. That's when Jack lost it and sort of yelled at Carl by saying "I'VE TOLD YOU MANY TIMES BEFORE AND I'LL TELL YOU AGAIN. SLOW DOWN AND TAKE YOUR TIME."
 [ a4 ] , [ a6 ]  I wanted to play; ...[ b5 ] first before;...[ e6 ]  [ Q e2 ]  [ N x c4 ]  [ Q x c4 ] , [ b5 ]  The only continuation I felt comfortable with.
 [ N c e5 ] , [ R c1 ]  If we accept that black has the advantage after the next three moves then this would be the mistake. Maybe 12.[ B b3 ] would be better preventing the next?
 [ K f6 ]  [ Q d4 + ]  [ e5 ]  [ Q d6 + ]  [ Q e6 ]  [ Q d8 + ]  [ Q e7 ]  [ R d6 + ] , [ K f7 ]  not very strong move?? I win his queen
 [ N x c3 ]  [ B e5 ]  [ R x f7 + ]  [ K g8 ] , [ R h1 ]  Fianchetto52 mentioned this move and the more I meditated on it the more it seemed like the best option. Essentially I'm trading an inactive rook for jammic's most valuable piece. Apparently this seals the deal!
 [ B x e8 ] , [ Q h6 ]  33. .... Qh6! - I was soo tempted to play RxB here but I was worried about Henry on the back row. Now incredibly it is white's king's turn to feel icy cold and see a dark dark shadow directly overhead. It looks as though if he plays [ f4 ] to avoid copping Old Matey on [ h1 ] he will lose his rook on [ c1 ] to RxR+ RxR QxR. But white keeps the deficit down to a mere two pawns.
 [ B b5 + ]  [ N b d7 ]  [ O-O ]  [ a6 ]  [ B x d7 + ]  [ N x d7 ] , [ c4 ]  the neo Panov-Botvinik attack deferred! Joking. There is a neo Panov-Botvinik attack but I just added deferred.
 [ Q b4 + ]  [ K c8 ] , [ Q a3 ]  Exhausted and out of time white fails to see [ Q f8 ] keeping the attack alive.
 [ Q x e3 ] , [ e x f4 ]  Here I fully expected that my opponent would move his Queen away from [ [ f4 ] ] and certainly not take [ [ f4 ] ] as that would permit [ Q b6 + ] and either his Bishop or Knight would be likely to fall as well but...
 [ Q d8 ]  [ h3 ]  [ Q b8 ]  [ Q f6 ]  [ h6 ]  [ N d2 ]  [ Q f4 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ R f8 ]  Otherwise [ N e5 ] is very annoying.
 [ B h6 ]  [ B x h8 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ B c3 ]  [ N c5 ]  [ R d1 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ R x d8 + ]  [ K x d8 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N e6 ]  [ R d1 + ] , [ K c8 ]  Kc8?! maybe [ e8 ] is too unprotect but in this way i'm gonna win soon...
 [ B e3 ] , [ B x e4 ]  See? I got him.
 [ K e1 ] , [ Q h1 # ]  So there was a lot to learn from this game. The lessons are consider all threats made by the opponent and follow the guidelines. In particular don't leave the N on the rim unless there is an extenuating circumstance especially when faced with a threat. In this case a discover attack that like with Kasporov lost a piece. @Knightrider62: If you can remember these lessons you'll improve. And I must say that you have become a better player. Not just by rating but I looked at a couple of your games and say that you are getting each time. Just keep on studying remember those lessons and I'm confident that your rating will skyrocket to 1200 sooner then you know it.
 [ a x b5 ]  [ N x c3 ]  [ b x c3 ]  [ c x b5 ] , [ B a3 ]  A strong move keeping the initiative. Now the main line goes: 10. - [ B e6 ] 11. [ B e2 ] [ N c6 ] 12. 0-0 [ B d5 ] and Black is fairly okay. The book had another suggestion though - and unfortunately I decided to try it.
 [ B b3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B d2 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ h6 ]  [ O-O ] , [ B e7 ]  This bishop got Black in a lot of trouble in this game. First it was played to a tactically weak square then it was moved again while there was clearly still more development to be done.
 [ R h4 ] , [ b5 ]  Aha. It looks darker and darker on the queenside. Anyway my [ h6 ] pawn is starting to play right here.
 [ B x g5 ]  [ Q x g5 ]  [ h4 ]  [ Q e7 ]  [ B e2 ] , [ h5 ]  Stopping White's potential K-side expansion.
 [ N c3 ] , [ N f6 ]  This transposes to a short of Gruenfeld exchange line without the bishop fianchettoed at g7.
 [ Q f4 + ]  [ K e6 ]  [ Q x f6 + ] , [ R x f6 ]  Blacks pawn advantage quickly becomes a problem as he realizes the importance of protecting his king
 [ c3 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ d4 ]  Instead of defending you attack a perfectly good strategy.
 [ O-O ] , [ B g4 ]  What I overlooked is this pin as now Jack will force a different exchange. Better might have been 9...Nd2. However after a little consideration I decided that exchanging is doesn't benefit black. And to my knowing I might get an edge as his [ B g4 ] appears stronger then my Nf3. Therefore I felt that a good strategy in this position is to connect my Rooks at once by moving the Queen to same rank as my Knights since as usual I have no idea of what else to do. Obviously I'm not going to exchange on c6.
 [ R a8 ]  [ K b3 ]  [ R b8 + ]  [ B b4 ]  [ K d5 ]  [ R g4 ] , [ R c8 ]  easy...jst get him to the side....
 [ c3 ] , [ B b7 ]  Better was [ d6 ] and attempting to exchange the Bishop on [ b3 ]  [ d4 ] , [ e x d4 ]  Very dubious. Cedes control of the center
 [ B b5 ] , [ B d6 ]  The e-file and the e-pawn in general will be vulnerable until the BK can vacate it usually to the queenside. Opposite-flank castling tends to favor whichever side has more midgame attacking possibilities and with the half-open f file the situation looks like it would favor Black at the moment (as it very often does in this opening).
 [ c5 ]  [ R c b8 ]  [ Q c4 ]  [ Q a4 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ R x b4 ]  [ Q x b4 ]  [ Q x b4 ]  [ B x d8 ]  [ Q x c5 ]  [ B h4 ]  [ g5 ]  [ B g3 ] , [ Q f5 ]  We played like devils at this stage to win precious time on the clock... The material is quickly diminishing...
 [ K e3 ] , [ Q g2 ]  My queen moves back to cover the [ f1 ] square...
 [ Q d5 ]  [ N a5 ] , [ B f7 + ]  QxB would probably have been better although the Fritz chess engine has them about equal.
 [ R e8 ]  [ B e3 ] , [ B x h3 ]  With this small combination based on the weakness of the castling ([ h3 ] g3) and the development advantage the game is resolved.
 [ N x d3 ] , [ h5 ]  better [ Q g5 ] [ N e5 ] [ R b b1 ] [ Q x c4 ] [ R b c1 ] [ Q x d5 ] [ R c d1 ] and set up some decent defense...
 [ f3 ]  [ e x d4 ] , [ f x e4 ]  here black is slightly better because of all the pawn weaknesses in whites position.
 [ B g3 ] , [ N x g3 ]  When he played this move I remember thinking that I would not have played this because it opens up the h file for my rook. This actually proves important later in the game.
 [ B x f6 ]  [ g x f6 ] , [ Q h5 + ]  Here she is!
 [ N g f3 ]  [ B g4 ] , [ e3 ]  pins his own knight
 [ e5 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ d4 ] , [ c x d4 ]  Still in the main line here.
 [ Q x d3 ] , [ R f b8 ]  As noted however doubling up. The other idea is to compensate and win back a pawn by putting pressure on the b file. Note: Some time ago I made this mistake against Jack when he threatened something similar and I miscalculated but the situation was even worse because instead of a pawn he was able to win a piece. It was my LSB if I'm not mistaken.
 [ N x d4 ] , [ g6 ]  The accelerated dragon it's finind it's way into alot of my games recently.
 [ f6 ] , [ R x a5 + ]  But get back on track after all how cool would it be to win down a queen?
 [ B g2 ] , [ B b4 ]  Now I moved my LB to [ g2 ] getting ready to castle. Black developed his DB to [ b4 ] attacking my king which is protected by my knight.
 [ R x f5 ] , [ K g8 ]  Its really all over from here. I knew graham would not let me off easily but i played on in hope.
 [ R d e8 ] , [ Q d5 ]  ! Again stopping [ R a2 ] plus creating a couple of threats of my own.
 [ R c1 + ]  [ K h2 ]  [ Q c7 + ] , [ g3 ]  Here he resinged because my next move was [ R d8 ] . I would be a queen up . Thanks for watching.
 [ K f8 ]  [ d x e5 ] , [ Q e8 ]  Well nothing is perfect. So let's try to keep on developement...
 [ K c5 ]  [ N x h8 ] , [ Q x g2 ]  I need to move the rook out fast otherwise my work is lost.
 [ K d2 ] , [ R x a7 ]  With this "strange" move I was hoping that my opponent made a mistake. And if that didn't happen my interest now was exchanging some pieces and going to end game with and knight advantage.
 [ b x c4 ] , [ R x c4 ]  taking with the b-pawn would have been worse.
 [ O-O-O ] , [ d4 ]  Although I had already planned for [ [ d4 ] ] Black's castling gives it more potency because now the black queen and rook are on the same diagonal of the bishop I am about to release. [ [ d4 ] ] is now a double attack of sorts. [ B g5 ] wins rook for bishop there is also a nasty little pawn fork d5.
 [ R x c2 + ]  [ K d1 ]  [ R x b2 ]  [ f x e3 ]  [ R x d2 + ]  [ N x d2 ]  [ b2 ]  [ K e2 ]  [ b x a1 = Q ]  [ R x a1 ] , [ d5 ]  I think the idea here is to get another passer. But his doubled pawns in the center will prevent. So although major pieces have been exchanged in this particular position doubled pawns are beneficial for white. That's because it keeps him in longer. And with this move white gains tempo.
 [ B b2 ] , [ e6 ]  with this move queen was able to move back to square 1!
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ f5 ]  A Latvian Gambit tourney in which the fiorst 6 moves are set for each side...
 [ B x d5 ] , [ N g5 ]  This was where i started suspect my capability to win this game but after a while of thinking i came to a conclusion that whites attack is not dangerous
 [ Q g4 ]  [ Q e2 ]  [ B g3 + ]  [ K d1 ]  [ Q x d4 + ]  [ K c2 ]  [ Q e4 + ]  [ K b3 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ N x a5 ]  [ Q e6 + ]  [ N c4 ]  [ Q g4 ] , [ Q e1 ]  
 [ N g x e3 ]  [ R g6 ]  [ Q h2 ]  [ R f6 ] , [ B d5 ]  Harassing the black queen.
 [ N c5 ] , [ O-O-O ]  !? Right into the danger. But the support the rook gives to the center will be helpful.
 [ K x h7 ]  [ N g5 + ]  [ K g6 ]  [ Q x g4 ]  [ f5 ]  [ Q f3 ]  [ K x g5 ] , [ h4 + ]  better was 14.B:[ f4 ] with good atack
 [ B x a8 ] , [ N b6 ]  Now I'm familiar with the motivation behind this move (chess thought process) as that's how I used to think. Sue is thinking ok Joe won a Rook but I will try to compensate by attacking it. But as I've also learned the hard way there is no compensation for that. I like her fighting spirit but the lesson is that in general once you lose something it's gone. With that being said I exchange first because the liquidating while ahead. Then I will defend and when that happens she'll be faced with multiple threats.
 [ K x f7 ] , [ Q f3 + ]  Checking and threatening the knight. Most possible move: King supporting the knight. But then the King will be even more out to the middle of the board
 [ K b3 ] , [ Q f6 ]  The only thing that I don't mind exchanging is Perry's Queen because that's what's making his pieces stronger then my pieces. If I can do that all of the problems that I had after being forced exchange before will end. So I am seeing what can be done to take off his Queen.
 [ h5 ]  [ e4 ]  [ g5 ]  [ h3 ] , [ R d7 ]  A kind of wait-and-see-move. I didn't like 37. ... [ h4 ] because I thought this would give white the opportunity to block the kings flank.
 [ N b5 ]  [ Q d8 ]  [ N x d6 ] , [ Q x d6 ]  white will exchsnge all he is got.
 [ b4 ]  [ a5 ]  [ a3 ]  [ a x b4 ]  [ a x b4 ]  [ R a1 + ]  [ K d2 ]  [ R x d1 + ] , [ K x d1 ]  Black simplifies the game
 [ B f4 ] , [ R c d8 ]  Trying to vaporize a pair of Rooks.
 [ Q x b7 + ]  [ K d8 ] , [ Q c7 # ]  
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ g6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ e4 ]  [ d6 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ O-O ] , [ N f3 ]  preparing for battle ... tartakov3r has level and an avatar to frighten ElephantTrio (me) is just a biginner ! i choose est indian defense whith his [ d4 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ c x d5 ] , [ f5 ]  opening f colonne in order ti use tower
 [ K h2 ]  [ N g5 ] , [ R d1 ]  costing another tempo to weaken the pin...
 [ O-O ]  [ O-O ] , [ N h5 ]  ? Probably an attempt to prevent [ B f4 ] and also creating options for the fianchetto bishop. In some continuations ...[ f5 ] is useful too. But IMO the N is misplaced here and cedes too much central control. 12... [ N e5 ] is probably best.
 [ Q e7 ] , [ N e x c7 + ]  Now this move need some explaining. Looks rather dubious why not take with the [ b5 ] knight and leave the knight on [ e6 ] as a bone in blacks throat? Well what is whites biggest asset once the [ c7 ] pawn falls? If you answered the question with his [ d4 ] pawn than you would have been correct. Take a look at the obvious [ K d8 ] which is a blunder. After d5! and then [ d6 ] black is looking very pinned in. Blacks best in my opinion would be to retreat his king to f7. Where I might continue with [ B e6 + ] followed by [ d5 ] or even have the option of Bxf4. [ K d8 ] however makes blacks king a target.
 [ B x h4 ]  [ g x h5 ]  [ Q g5 ]  [ Q g4 ]  [ Q x g4 ]  [ B x g4 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ R a3 ]  [ f5 ]  [ e x f5 ]  [ g x f5 ]  [ B h3 ]  [ K h7 ]  [ N e1 ]  [ f4 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ B f6 ]  [ B f5 + ]  [ K h6 ]  [ B g6 ]  [ R f g8 ]  [ K h2 ]  [ R g7 ]  [ R g1 ]  [ R b g8 ] , [ K h1 ]  Not sure I see any threat to the king.
 [ h6 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ N d7 ] , [ N e2 ]  10. [ N e2 ] - clearing the way for kingside castling.
 [ R x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ] , [ Q c5 ]  Pinning the Nd4.
 [ Q b6 ] , [ a5 ]  Trying to move away his queen from the side so he can't make any good moves.
 [ g5 ] , [ R e3 ]  trying to push my e-pawn again...
 [ K e1 ] , [ Q f2 + ]  ? [ Q g1 ] was mate.
 [ g4 ] , [ N x e3 ]  However I saw an open pawn and went for the kill. This position also forced the Q to move whether that is good or bad yet. I am not sure.
 [ R b8 + ]  [ K e7 ]  [ R x h8 ]  [ N x e3 + ]  [ f x e3 ] , [ R x e3 ]  White has now limited the damage to two pawns but you would still think Black has enough resources to eventually win.
 [ b x c3 ] , [ R d8 ]  Because of the pin on the d-pawn and the position of my knight Black threatens 15...e4. The pawn is also the only thing guarding my knight on [ c4 ] so moving the queen away won't help here.
 [ R d1 + ]  [ K g2 ] , [ Q f8 ]  From here on out it's unstoppable checkmate.
 [ R x c5 ] , [ Q e4 ]  And of course black dare not take for the obvious reason so agata moved here instead.
 [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ] , [ N x f7 ]  this is the key to the fried liver white thinks he is gaining a piece but it is difficult to keep!
 [ N d7 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ N e5 ]  I always feel a little silly making two Knight-Moves to attack a Queen but here it made sense.
 [ K x g2 ]  [ K f7 ]  [ c3 ] , [ K e6 ]  Black wants to use the half-open f-file and h-file together with the open g-file for his rooks and is quite happy to swap off anything that moves safe in the knowledge that even if White could swap pretty much everything he's still got an extra piece and the bishop is the right colour to queen the a-pawn.
 [ c x d4 ] , [ N x d4 ]  [ Q x d4 ] wouldn't seem very appealing after 7...[ B c5 ] but I didn't realize that when I was playing. I simply wanted to avoid the queen exchange and let tactics manifest.
 [ e4 ] , [ c5 ]  Another mini-tournament game and another game as black. 5 in a row. I really want to play white again... For now black's opting for the Sicilian again.
 [ B g2 ] , [ b6 ]  ? bad move considering the position of Fou Leblanc... 6...[ c6 ] would be far better
 [ g5 ] , [ f x g5 ]  22. ...[ f x g5 ] Mandatory. 23.[ g x f6 ] open the g-file and also 23.[ g6 ] were threating.
 [ h5 ] , [ N f8 ]  Now 2 pieces are locked on the back rank - but I won't mention the obvious N move Nxe5. I think this type of thoughtless move comes from playing too many games together playing too quick or just not giving adequate analysis time to each move.
 [ K g1 ]  [ a5 ]  [ d6 ] , [ K e8 ]  Stopping the pawn.
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ g6 ] , [ b3 ]  a new twist: in fact enforcing an early d4...
 [ N f3 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ B f4 ] , [ N b6 ]  Black usually castles queenside and has his rooks on [ d8 ] to help keep white off of [ d5 ] and on [ g8 ] to attack the castled king.
 [ d6 ] , [ B f4 ]  Capturing the pawn would help Black to develop with 9...Qxd6.
 [ B x f3 ]  [ N x f3 ] , [ R e8 ]  Now having given up a bishop for knight I should have closed up the position with [ d4 ] either on move 15 or 16.
 [ Q x e8 ]  [ Q x c1 + ]  [ K g2 ]  [ Q c2 ]  [ a4 ]  [ K b7 ] , [ Q g8 ]  ...and now he loses another one. He can recover it but on the wrong side... black's pawns are equal to a rook in value...
 [ N x e5 ] , [ B x e5 ]  I feel happy with this position. It might be crap but I think I'm pretty solid here. My bishops feels rather strong. 12. [ f4 ] could be troublesome. But I think it could be handled.
 [ d3 ] , [ B c5 ]  Black in my knowledge can play too 4 ... [ d5 ] 4 ... [ d6 ] and 4 ... Be7. The two last variation are similar the first leads to a definite center. I chose an active line
 [ B b2 ] , [ N c6 ]  Protecting my central pawn and developing a piece
 [ N f6 ] , [ Q b4 ]  Although there is no clear threat against the queen this move ensures white is not caught out with a pin along the d-file.
 [ R h1 ]  [ R d2 + ] , [ K g3 ]  the plan is to advance my king until I can be shielded by the pawns and then Queen and capture his advanced pawn after trading Castles....but he will resign no? Yes Win by resignation......good game me!
 [ K b1 ]  [ R a b8 ]  [ N x c7 ] , [ R b c8 ]  Countering the attack on the Rook with a pin. But in the scuffle it is now Capablanca who is up a Pawn.
 [ N d5 ]  [ N a6 ]  [ N x e7 ] , [ K x e7 ]  Black resigned before I could play 10. Bf4.
 [ Q d5 ]  [ f x g4 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ R f e8 ]  [ B f3 ]  [ Q b5 ]  [ B h6 ]  [ Q b4 ] , [ Q x b4 ]  I'm ahead so I'll exchange for a lead in the end game. His knight has to capture and I win b7.
 [ Q x b7 ] , [ B x b7 ]  Exchanging queens when down by two pieces is never a good idea; white is glad to oblige.
 [ B f3 ]  [ e x f4 ]  [ B x f4 ] , [ Q x f5 ]  White sacrifices a pawn but she has plenty of compensation for it in the form of a Bishop pair a weak [ d6 ] pawn space advantage and superior piece placement.
 [ B x g5 ]  [ Q b2 + ]  [ K g1 ]  [ Q a1 + ] , [ N f1 ]  49. [ N f1 ] - successfully screens out the black queen's checks. Black starts to gobble up my pawns but boy isn't he going to get big indigestion! His next move allows mate in a few moves.
 [ B g7 ]  [ B x g7 ]  [ K x g7 ]  [ f4 ] , [ Q e7 ]  Opening communication between the Rooks and preparing a likely exit for the Black King to the center or Queenside.
 [ R g6 ]  [ R d5 ]  [ R g4 ] , [ K f6 ]  Aiming to lure the rook to [ f4 ] and then exchange it if the king moves to the f-file.
 [ N f3 ]  [ O-O ] , [ O-O ]  both kings now safe
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ b6 ] , [ B b5 ]  I don't know this opening and don't play it much as black but I doubt this is good as the bishop can be driven back with tempo
 [ K g2 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ B x g5 ]  [ f x g5 ] , [ b4 ]  Getting rid of the [ b2 ] weakness but creating another on a3.
 [ a4 ]  [ B a2 ]  [ Q x f7 ] , [ B x f7 ]  After chasing white's bishop into the bolt hole black then sets him free by playing the queen exchange. Perhaps what black is hoping for here is reducing the pieces on each side going after that [ e5 ] pawn and settling in for a lazy endgame where white is up by a knight vs. 2 pawns a tricky endgame that might go either way.
 [ K e7 ] , [ N c5 + ]  And here black resigned in view of 27...[ K d8 ] 28.[ R f8 ] [ B e8 ] 29.[ R x e8 # ] or the even less attractive alternative 27...[ Q e6 ] 28.[ Q x e6 ] [ K d8 ] 29.Qd7#.
 [ N c5 ]  [ N b6 + ] , [ K e4 ]  46. [ K e4 ] - Mike's king goes towards my kingside pawns. Henry is still being pegged back in his own half.
 [ O-O ] , [ d3 ]  Now my pieces are free to roam...
 [ R c2 x c6 ]  [ d x c6 ]  [ R x c6 ]  [ R e7 ]  [ R x a6 ]  [ R c7 ] , [ B c5 ]  By all means prevent black from getting counter play.
 [ N a5 ] , [ B f4 ]  Targeting the [ c7 ] pawn and putting my bishop on a better square.
 [ e4 ] , [ c6 ]  The Caro-Kan defense.
 [ N c3 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ] , [ N d5 ]  This has to be considered as a mistake moving a piece twice in the opening without a good reason.
 [ B d3 ] , [ d x c4 ]  Black's main goal here is to open up the board. The French Defense is feeling a little constrained and I'm tired of being on the defense and not having initiative.
 [ B x d2 + ] , [ K x d2 ]  there goes my chance to castle
 [ K x f7 ]  [ N x e4 ] , [ d5 ]  Controls the center with the tempo. My plan is to gain space and push white knights back to their ranks.
 [ R h2 ]  [ Q x a1 ]  [ h x g6 ]  [ h x g6 ] , [ c3 ]  Yet again 19. [ N c3 ] developing the knight simultaneously attacking the queen gives White more hope.
 [ R g4 ]  [ R f2 ]  [ R x g5 ] , [ R f4 ]  This seems to be all White can do; if 60. [ R h2 ] then 60... [ f4 ] 61. [ K b4 ] [ f3 ] 62. [ K x a4 ] [ R g2 ] wins.
 [ h3 ] , [ c5 ]  black is just wasting time now. [ B d7 ] or 0-0 is better
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N g5 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ B x f7 + ]  [ K e7 ]  [ B b3 ] , [ R f8 ]  6. ....... [ R f8 ] - also fairly standard.
 [ d6 ] , [ e x d6 ]  And exchange it off. Black now has a lead in development and white has gained nothing except that black is no longer just playing 'book' French Defense moves.
 [ R d1 ] , [ R x d1 + ]  But it's mate next move and he resigned. An attack that gave me a kind of spurious satisfaction in that it only worked because my opponent missed key defensive moves. But it was played quickly in an hour or so!
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N d b5 ]  [ d6 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ a6 ]  [ N a3 ]  [ h6 ]  [ B h4 ]  [ g5 ]  [ B g3 ]  [ b5 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ N x f6 + ]  [ Q x f6 ]  [ c3 ]  [ N e6 ]  [ N c2 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ f3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ R d8 ]  [ N e3 ]  [ h5 ]  [ B f2 ]  [ N f4 ]  [ a4 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ a x b5 ]  [ B x d5 ]  [ Q a4 ]  [ O-O ]  [ b x a6 ]  [ B c6 ]  [ Q c4 ]  [ B a7 ] , [ R d1 ]  ? because the following combination is forced for White
 [ Q e2 ] , [ Q x c2 ]  14. Qe2? was a blunder that cost white a pawn.
 [ Q h6 ]  [ Q d3 ] , [ K e7 ]  The Black King is forced into the open to help with the defence of the d-pawn the Queen still being out of position.
 [ N c6 ] , [ N f3 ]  Transposing toward the Open Sicilian.
 [ B c4 ] , [ d5 ]  7........ d5!! - this move is the refutation of this gambit. Give back a pawn for the piece and blunt my attack.
 [ h4 ] , [ R h8 ]  An odd move hoping to contest the h-file but I need not open it if I do not want to and this takes the rook away from the attacking forces.
 [ R e6 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ Q g6 ] , [ f3 ]  [ e x f6 ] might have been better. It doesn't lead to the loss of the exposed Re3. If [ e x f6 ] and White plays [ R x e3 ] [ Q x g2 # ] is satisfactory!
 [ R x a2 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ R a8 ] , [ B f5 ]  Now I hold an advantage. But is worth little unless I can make use of it. A simplification of pawns would work in blacks favour. The black king is in the 'good corner' (ie rook cannot mate on the back rank ie Kh8; [ R a8 ] will be met by [ B g8 ] and draws). I need to develop a plan to promote one of my pawns but the black king cannot be driven off [ g7 ] in order to capture the f pawn. Unless I can think of something a draw seems the likely result
 [ b6 ]  [ K d8 ]  [ K b5 ]  [ K c8 ]  [ c5 ]  [ K b8 ] , [ a6 ]  And now we're fine. Rook jumps around a bit not allowing white to do anything at all and eventually white accepts a draw.
 [ g5 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ K h2 ]  [ K f8 ]  [ K g1 ]  [ K e7 ]  [ K h2 ]  [ K d6 ]  [ Q d2 ] , [ B c4 ]  ? -- Pfff! Anti-positional: the long diagonal is much better for Black's QB.
 [ B x h8 ] , [ N x b4 ]  I try to make the most of the situation
 [ b3 ] , [ R g6 ]  A piece sacrifice! Well played even if not the best.
 [ K h1 ]  [ B x c3 ]  [ B x c6 ]  [ B x b2 ]  [ R b1 ]  [ b x c6 ] , [ R x b2 ]  Black is a pawn ahead.
 [ K e6 ]  [ R c3 ]  [ K d6 ]  [ R d3 + ] , [ K c6 ]  Ready to push the pawns forward
 [ e4 ] , [ c5 ]  So I am continuing with my adventures with the sicilian
 [ N e3 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ Q g3 ]  [ R f d8 ] , [ O-O ]  24. 0-0 - I remember castling late in the Concordborn game in which Coach Ion said that in this variation white was too busy to castle. It is certainly time to get a rook into play particularly with a BR controlling the d column.
 [ O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ B b4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N g4 ]  [ N e4 ] , [ d5 ]  Remember en-passant although if I choose to implement it won't be bad for you.
 [ K e6 ]  [ f2 ] , [ R a7 + ]  Not much else to do in this position. White is probably looking for some sequence that will give him perpetual checks.
 [ f4 ] , [ B f5 ]  Not [ g x f4 ] [ g x f4 ] giving white a passed pawn. Trying to force white to move a pawn ([ K g8 ] or [ K h8 ] is met with [ R b2 ] ). If [ g4 ] white has a backwards pawn.
 [ B x g7 ]  [ N x a5 ] , [ B x f8 ]  The game is finished. I holded 7 more moves but it's hopeless
 [ d5 ]  [ c4 ] , [ e6 ]  so you decline the gambit?
 [ N f6 ] , [ d3 ]  The strongest continuation for both sides... After 6. ... [ B e7 ] also d3... For white it is too early for 7. d4... We have to give [ N c6 ] no slack... Not good is 7. e5? [ d x e5 ] 8. [ f x e5 ] ([ N x e5 ] Nd4!) Ng4! No good for black is 7. ... [ d5 ] 8. [ N e5 ] [ d x e4 ] (on [ d4 ] also Bxc6) 9. [ B x c6 ] [ B x c6 ] 10. [ N x c6 ] [ b x c6 ] 11. dxe4...
 [ N d5 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ B x d5 ] , [ R d8 ]  Black had been aiming for 16. ... [ B h3 ] but now the white bishop on [ d5 ] defends the [ g2 ] square. Black's 16. ... [ R d8 ] is an attempt to drive it off but not a very well thought out attempt; white has a simple and obvious reply that invalidates black's move.
 [ B a2 ] , [ K g7 ]  Unforking [ f7 ] cause it may be needed soon. Black king gets a bit more active
 [ O-O ] , [ B d7 ]  Now Caruana is trying to bring his last undeveloped Bishop out. Both players are just making logical moves. Amateur players can learn a lot from this. Make sure pieces are developed King is safe control the center etc. Simple chess rules!
 [ B x c3 ] , [ N e6 ]  [ e6 ] is the obvious square for the bishop so 11...[ N c6 ] was better.
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ] , [ N c3 ]  MM WILL CONTINUE AS USUAL
 [ R h5 ]  [ Q f7 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ h6 ] , [ R f2 ]  Low on time I just played thinking in winning back some seconds
 [ Q x b3 ] , [ K f2 ]  Fighting hard for the draw since he's protecting [ f3 ] but Erika fights back as she will make another capture on her next move.
 [ R c7 ] , [ B x f3 ]  This move is played with Rxa7! still on the cards which I did actually realise by this point but I was hopeful my opponent wouldn't see this the second time around. In truth [ R x a7 ] [ R f8 ] [ N x f3 ] [ R x b3 ] is nowhere near as strong as [ R x a7 ] was the previous turn
 [ e6 ]  [ B f4 ] , [ d6 ]  6. ..... [ d6 ] - although this move closes up Fou Lenoir's line temporarily it also shuts out Ger's dsb. I do not want a knight fork on [ c7 ] thank you very much!
 [ N f3 ]  [ B g4 ] , [ e3 ]  My move here according to book is 4. [ c x e5 ] and it makes a great deal of sense to me but I was unaware of the standard continuation and the game is into the unknown for me now.
 [ B b2 ]  [ R h d8 ] , [ B c3 ]  white protects d2.
 [ N c6 ]  [ e4 ] , [ N a5 ]  I play to hold the pawn and I do!
 [ N x c5 ]  [ N x c5 ]  [ d x c5 ] , [ B x c5 ]  Decent desperado to escape without any major loss. White's queen and bishop still shore up a solid formation. Black needs to get that rook involved to have any attack.
 [ b x a3 ]  [ Q a1 + ]  [ K d2 ]  [ Q c3 + ]  [ K c1 ]  [ N c5 ]  [ K b1 ]  [ N a4 ]  [ B c1 ]  [ R e6 ] , [ Q x g4 ]  30 [ Q b5 ] [ a x b5 ] 31. [ R x e4 ] would have held out a little longer.
 [ R x c6 ]  [ N x a7 ]  [ R x c2 ] , [ b4 ]  Now what? I should probably free my trapped Knight.
 [ R b d1 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ c x d5 ] , [ B x d5 ]  Pawn exchange.
 [ Q h4 ] , [ h3 ]  Only move - but another weakness on Whites K-side.
 [ N x f7 ] , [ Q g6 ]  why? White takes the rook and the queen will still be threatened...
 [ K h1 ]  [ N x d5 ] , [ c x d5 ]  34. [ c x [ d5 ] ] - we are now in a Q & P ending after my knight and William's lsb have been traded off. I am tempted to take that nice juicy pawn on [ d5 ] but I eschew it. Do you the Inquest Jury see why?
 [ Q c7 ]  [ N a3 ] , [ N c6 ]  The first mistake. I should have played 9 - [ a6 ] 10.[ N h4 ] - [ h5 ] with equality.
 [ N f4 ] , [ Q d2 ]  Defending from mate in g2.
 [ N x c5 + ] , [ B x c5 ]  Lo and behold I'm a piece to two pawns up and threatening mayhem...
 [ d6 ]  [ B g2 ] , [ e5 ]  6. ..... [ e5 ] - a necessary pawn break.
 [ h4 ] , [ N h7 ]  Extra support which leaves my Q free to roam...
 [ a4 ] , [ b6 ]  putting as many pawns on the dark squares as possible.
 [ e4 ]  [ c6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e5 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ B x d3 ]  [ Q x d3 ] , [ e6 ]  The advance variation if the Caro-Kann defence leading to slow positional games.
 [ Q x d3 ]  [ R x f6 ] , [ Q x e4 ]  Boom and double threat of checkmate on [ g2 ] and hanging knight on [ b1 ] decides the game. C'est tout!
 [ N f3 ] , [ N f6 ]  My standard reply
 [ K f8 ] , [ R x f3 ]  Preparing an attack over the f-file by doubling the rooks.
 [ Q e6 ] , [ N g5 + ]  Deadly fork
 [ B d2 ] , [ K e6 ]  Once again tactics prevent Black ridding himself of the a-pawn: 20 ... a5? 21. [ b x a5 ] Rxas 22. [ R e3 ] winning a pawn.
 [ c6 ]  [ c3 ] , [ Q d7 ]  I move up my queen to control the c8-[ h3 ] diagonal...
 [ a4 ] , [ N c3 ]  31...[ [ c3 ] ] 32.[ R c2 ] and there is no fork because [ [ c3 ] ] is hanging with check: 32..[ N a3 ] 33.[ R x c3 + ] +-
 [ B x e4 ]  [ B x e4 ] , [ R h f1 ]  White gets his Rook out of danger defends [ f2 ] and prepares f2-f3. All the while the weak [ e3 ] pawn is pinned to the White King and White's only threat--the idea of a strike down the a1-[ h8 ] diagonal--can be put to the sword any time Black sees fit as the White Bishop cannot escape from the Nd3.
 [ N f3 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ d6 ] , [ O-O ]  Of course the idea is castle early and often. Now usually what's important is that you know how there are exceptions to that guideline. From what I've noticed this happens a lot with strong players. A good example was against jstevens1 where I castled right into the attack and then wound up in trouble. So this is where you really have to evaluate which is good as it's part of doing that HW. But here in this position I saw that castling would not cause any immediate problems so I just went for it since K safety is essential.
 [ N f3 e5 ] , [ Q e7 ]  drives queen off light squares. If 20...B[ x N e5 ] 21. N[ x B e5 ] [ Q e7 ] 22. Qe4! is very dangerous
 [ R a2 ]  [ K f6 ] , [ R b2 ]  Mission accomplished.
 [ N f3 ]  [ B f6 ]  [ h3 ]  [ B x e7 ] , [ R x e7 ]  27. [ R x e7 ] - one pair of bishops is exchanged but Fou Leblanc is under castle fire.
 [ K f6 ] , [ N x e7 ]  The next one would have been mortal in any case.
 [ N x d3 ]  [ Q x d3 ] , [ R b4 ]  !? A very agressive move by Black attacking my bishop and taking over some squares on my half of the board.
 [ K e5 ]  [ K d7 ]  [ K x f5 ] , [ K c6 ]  46. ...... [ K c6 ] - my prized passer is about to fall but if K x P immediately Fou Lenoir will skewer the BK against that pawn. The result will be a draw on the grounds of insufficient mating force. That was exactly what happened and Adam and I had to manually agree a draw on move 49. A pleasing result for me as it was a High Draw - my current form is very erratic but the more of these kind of results I get the more likely my rating may upsurge again should I be at the top of my game!
 [ B x d6 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ R x f6 ]  and finally I can make the play - hard to see how black defends this now
 [ N x c7 ]  [ R e7 ] , [ Q a5 ]  Well there's no way I can protect everything.
 [ R g1 ] , [ B f5 ]  Black's main advantage here is the majority of pieces controlling the kingside. Black should continue to clump the pieces around the kingside. The maneuvering will be slow but as long as White can't do anything Black has time to prepare a kingside attack.
 [ e4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N d2 ]  [ B e7 ] , [ Q g4 ]  A speculative move...
 [ N f6 ]  [ f3 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ R a d1 ] , [ N e5 ]  Better was 14... P-[ Q N3 ] to be followed by ...P-[ Q B4 ] and... N-N1-B3.
 [ Q x c2 ]  [ Q x f3 ]  [ Q g2 ] , [ B f2 + ]  ? Queen bishop for queen? Lousy trade.
 [ g3 ]  [ c4 ]  [ c3 ]  [ b5 ]  [ h4 ] , [ Q f3 + ]  He loses [ g3 ] pawn too so he decides the best move for him is Resigning. Good 30 moves-game for me. What do you think? Comment bye!
 [ g x h8 = Q + ] , [ K d7 ]  Even if I were up against a weaker opponent I'd resign as black at this point. As black is too far behind to stand a chance. But that's not how Perry thinks.
 [ B x g7 ]  [ R h7 ] , [ B f6 ]  this exchang is in my favor give me a tempo
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ g3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ B g2 ]  [ B g7 ] , [ d3 ]  Closing the Sicilian. Back in the days before I became almost exclusively an English player as White I loved playing the the Closed Sicilian.
 [ b4 ]  [ f4 ]  [ K d4 ]  [ B g1 + ]  [ K x e4 ] , [ N x c4 ]  Pawns come off the board and this game seems to be heading towards a draw.
 [ N f4 ]  [ h x g2 ] , [ N x g2 ]  White chooses to drop a pawn rather then expose the king to the check.
 [ a3 ] , [ B x h6 ]  I decided I couldn't take it any longer. The person's rated more than 200 points above me but I'm going to play an interesting move and make him find a good defense. If he defends well in a tough position he wins. If he messes up then I win. What more could you ask for? If he recaptures with [ g x h6 ] it's my knight that's going to recapture and the queen will head to f4.
 [ N c1 ] , [ N d5 ]  26. ...... [ N d5 ] - don't those horsies look nasty! I now decide to give up Fou Lenoir for one of them.
 [ N b6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ b3 ]  We are still in known territory.
 [ K d4 ]  [ K b6 ]  [ K d5 ]  [ K c7 ] , [ K c5 ]  White should be very happy. It has taken the Opposition from the Black King White King is in front of pawn so the White King can move forward and gain squares while the white pawn remains safe (don't push King to far that allows the Black king in behind to capture white pawn).
 [ e x f5 ] , [ g x f5 ]  Now black has an isolated pawn on an already weakened kingside. I just gotta punish this.....
 [ Q h7 ] , [ f3 ]  ooo sees the threat coming will it be enough though!
 [ Q e2 ] , [ Q x e2 + ]  I happily agree to the queen trade.
 [ Q g7 ] , [ R f2 ]  23. [ R f2 ] - a rook lift with a dual purpose. Maybe to attack down the kingside later on and more likely to cover Henry against any black heavies down the g column.
 [ g x h3 ] , [ Q g3 + ]  Again we played much better to force the win of the h pawn with this check rather than take the h pawn immediately
 [ B e2 ] , [ c5 ]  No danger on the Qside whites squares for now and I'm ready to castle kingside so... let's go.
 [ K e2 ]  [ b4 ] , [ b3 ]  Now the rooks have to be traded leaving black still dominant.
 [ Q b6 ] , [ b4 ]  Driving the Bishop off the diagonal.
 [ e4 ] , [ N c6 ]  I don't know the name of this opening but in game this played out to a reverse Alekhine.
 [ d5 ] , [ N d2 ]  One of the two options to follow the Classical Variation the other being 3. Nc3.
 [ N f3 + ]  [ B x f3 ]  [ e x f3 ]  [ g x f5 ] , [ Q e2 ]  Keeping Bogoljuboff completely restrained.
 [ K h1 ] , [ N x c2 ]  16. ....... [ N x c2 ] - I get one of the pawns back.
 [ B g7 ] , [ Q e2 ]  Another option here is 7.[ a4 ] starting activity queenside
 [ d6 ] , [ d4 ]  I decide to push open the center since he advanced his queen pawn.
 [ e3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ d6 ]  He's letting me have a very easy development - not challenging me at all.
 [ d x e3 ]  [ c5 ]  [ Q d1 ]  [ B c6 ]  [ f3 ] , [ a6 ]  This seems like a better time to pull this pawn up.
 [ N b5 ] , [ N c6 ]  I'm thinking development here ever mindful of the knight on b5.
 [ f x g5 ] , [ Q d2 ]  ...and now he is behind in terms of development and material. Even his strong control of the center in the beginning of the game has dissipated.
 [ Q b3 ] , [ B x h6 ]  Destroy castle
 [ B x g6 ] , [ e2 ]  This move was unexpected and nearly finished me off. There were no easy defenses which made this position almost unsalvagable but luckily...
 [ N x h2 ] , [ R h1 ]  The storm get worse. If black plays [ B h6 ] is threatening mate at once. White must play something like [ Q d3 ] but black is near to make white sweat...
 [ B x g6 + ]  [ K x g6 ] , [ Q h5 + ]  about to just bust the king side wide open.
 [ h x g6 ] , [ Q f6 + ]  28. [ Q f6 + ] - nothing for it but to go for all out attack and hope that it will lead to mate for black.
 [ N c3 ] , [ Q f6 ]  Got to defend somehow!
 [ B e2 ] , [ O-O ]  As expected he castles. fredmcgriff calls this Krystals while when White Castles he calls it... White Castle. Either way I agree with him that those little burgers are extraordinary. I'm from the South so Krystals rules.
 [ Q b4 ]  [ Q d7 ] , [ Q d4 ]  I am significantly up at this point. Offering an exchange hastens defeat.
 [ f6 ]  [ N x c6 ]  [ B x h2 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ e3 ]  [ b x c6 ]  [ d5 ] , [ B g1 ]  Black threatens checkmate again.
 [ K x g2 ]  [ Q e2 + ] , [ K h3 ]  It's mate in 2 now. 24.[ K g3 ] would last a little bit longer but I missed that after 24...[ B f2 + ] I could return to g2: 25.[ K g2 ] Be1+! (necessary to block the 8th row) 26.[ K g1 ] [ Q f2 + ] 27.[ K h1 ] Qf1#.
 [ K h7 ]  [ Q e4 + ]  [ K h8 ]  [ Q a8 + ] , [ K h7 ]  I keep them going long enough for Black to offer the draw which I gratefully accepted. Interesting to speculate about 58.[ Q b7 + ] [ K g8 ] 59.[ Q b8 + ] [ Q f8 ] 60.[ Q x a7 ] [ g1 = Q + ] 61.[ Q x g1 ] [ Q g7 + ] 62.[ K f5 ] Qxg1... but the game's pace meant that it went begging. A really wild one.
 [ R a c1 ] , [ Q e5 ]  I saw the threat of 14.[ N e2 + ] winning the queen and I saw that 13...[ K b8 ] would simply lose the knight on [ d7 ] after 14.Rfd1. I also calculated a line with 13...[ N c5 ] which went 14.[ N a4 ] [ b6 ] (only one to defend the knight) 15.[ B a6 + ] [ K c7 ] 16.[ Q b7 + ] [ K d6 ] and Here I thought 17.Rfd1?? would win the Black queen not seeing that the White queen was also attacked. But at all moves of that variation White has many alternatives which all win. But it does not matter what I play here as I'm lost in all variations.
 [ R e8 ] , [ d3 ]  Planning [ B e3 ] and if [ B x e3 ] [ f x e3 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ B f5 ]  This surprised me
 [ B d2 ] , [ Q b6 ]  17. ....... [ Q [ b6 ] ] - here I froze. This was the first time that I had managed to maintain a clear pawn lead against an Expert. There seemed to be no weaknesses but this just seemed too good to be true. I let the emotional baggage from my past performances against the Expert colour my judgement here. I offered Jim a draw. I half expected a refusal. If the refusal was to come with an exchange of queens I would recapture with Frere Lenoir otherwise Frere Leblanc would come to [ e6 ] and drive back the Witch followed by the move [ N e7 ] to protect my e pawn and to prepare [ f6 ] to bolster it. But he accepted the draw offer and I received 7.1 points for this high draw. At the end of the game Ion assessed the position as Black has a clear advantage. I suppose in one way I am in a win win situation here. If the advantage is with white then it was a good draw offer. If it was a bad draw offer then it is nice to end the game with the better of things against a player 300 points north of my rating. In any case it ensured that although I came bottom of the league I did not leave Beafyness' tourney with nul point. It was Un Demi Point. My opponent had the following to add - hope you can follow:- 1.[ [ e4 ] ] [ [ e5 ] ] 2.[ N f3 ] [ N c6 ] 3.[ [ d4 ] ] ex[ [ d4 ] ] 4.[ [ c3 ] ] [4.Nx[ [ d4 ] ] [ B c5 ] 5.[ N x c6 ] [ Q f6 = ] ] 4...dx[ [ c3 ] ] 5.[ B c4 ] [5.Nx[ [ c3 ] ] [ N f6 = ] ] 5...[ d6 ] I have always thought this best 6.0-0 N[ f6 ] 7.[ Q b3 ] [ Q d7 ] 8.[ N g5 ] N[ [ e5 ] ] 9.[ B b5 ] [>=9.Nxc3!? is interesting 9...[ [ h6 ] ] 10.Nf3=/ ] 9...c6-/ 10.[ f4 ] [ c x b5 ] 11.fx[ [ e5 ] ] dx[ [ e5 ] ] 12.Nx[ [ c3 ] ] Dunno whether [ B e3 ] is better? 12….[ B c5 ] 13.[ K h1 ] 0-0 14.[ N x b5 ] [14.Nd5!?

 [ B d3 ] , [ N e4 ]  i think this might've been a mistake not too sure but i certainly don't think it was a good idea to get tactical with the guy... should've just traded the bishops and hurried castling along...
 [ Q c2 ] , [ R e8 ]  As long as the [ f6 ] knight guards [ h7 ] there should be no [ N g5 ] funny business.
 [ f x e5 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ N f5 ]  [ B x f5 ]  [ R x f5 ] , [ Q c8 ]  controling [ c5 ] which threatens B[ c5 ] with a deadly pin. In a short few moves black has greatly improved his prospects. Black's pieces enjoys a greater sense of harmony
 [ B b4 + ] , [ K d1 ]  The only move
 [ h6 ]  [ B x f6 ] , [ Q x f6 ]  This seems fairly standard. No questions yet.
 [ Q f3 ]  [ N h3 + ]  [ K f1 ]  [ g4 ]  [ Q e2 ] , [ Q c7 ]  blunder by black ... i'm not sure what he was trying to accomplish with that move but he almost let me back into the game.
 [ N h6 ]  [ a x b4 ]  [ Q x b4 ]  [ N x e5 ] , [ Q x b2 ]  The Queen is trapped because [ b5 ] is no longer covered by Black (Rxa8).
 [ h x g5 ] , [ B x f6 ]  This helps me a lot. White should have kept his bishop's pair aiming at my king. [ R e1 ] was called for.
 [ R g3 ] , [ Q e7 ]  Is he returning the piece because he had no choice or thought it or it was just a blunder?
 [ b5 ]  [ N e2 ] , [ e x f3 ]  Ups! a two flanks war
 [ c5 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ c3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ a6 ]  [ a4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ d3 ]  [ b6 ]  [ h3 ]  [ N a5 ]  [ B a2 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ N b d2 ]  [ b5 ]  [ b4 ]  [ c x b4 ]  [ c x b4 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B b3 ]  [ b x a4 ]  [ B x a4 ]  [ N x b4 ]  [ R b1 ]  [ a5 ]  [ N c4 ]  [ K e7 ]  [ B g5 + ]  [ f6 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ N c5 ]  [ B x c5 ]  [ d x c5 ]  [ B c2 ]  [ g6 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ B a4 ]  [ d3 ]  [ e5 ]  [ f5 ]  [ N d6 ]  [ B a6 ]  [ Q b3 ]  [ Q b6 ]  [ N g5 ] , [ B c8 ]  A this point I'm struggling for idea's. His King is out in the open. That's something for me to consider.
 [ Q c3 ] , [ R d5 ]  Unexpected as he loses The Exchange
 [ c x d4 ] , [ B b6 ]  Moved my bishop to safety.
 [ N a3 ] , [ B b4 ]  and good to keep attacking ht eknight.
 [ K e7 ] , [ Q e6 # ]  So here it is the 19 move mate by me giving my team the first team match win against another team. That is the end of my 2nd annotated game.
 [ e5 ] , [ B f5 ]  Alternative variation: [Fritz 11:] 23... [ R e d8 ] 24. [ N e4 ] [ Q x e5 ] 25. [ N d6 ] [ Q g5 ] 26. [ [ h4 ] ] [ Q f6 ] 27. [ N x b7 ] [ R x d1 ] 28. [ R x d1 ] [ B b4 ] 29.

[ Q e1 ] [ a6 ] 30. [ R d3 ] [ Q e7 ] 31. [ B c2 ] [ B e3 ] 32. [ B b3 ] [-0.58/21]
 [ B e2 ] , [ B e7 ]  Now I moved my LB out to [ e2 ] to protect my king as there are no pawns to protect the king now and d file is open. Black moved his DB to [ e7 ] in front of his king and he now has access to 2 diagonals one to [ a3 ] and one to h3.
 [ N e4 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ d x e4 ] , [ B x e4 ]  It opens the 5º row to my queen's action and bishop and rook are perfectly placed for a mortal attack. Black worry about his h pawn...
 [ B x g6 ]  [ f x g6 ]  [ Q d3 ]  [ B d7 ] , [ Q x g6 ]  ack! Who will defend the king??
 [ d6 ] , [ N f3 ]  Both knights out.
 [ R g2 ] , [ d x e5 ]  I could have played [ N e1 ] here as my opponent later pointed out but I didn't even consider it. I was happy to trade off knights to reduce his attacking threat now I'm a minor piece ahead.
 [ d x e5 ] , [ B x f6 ]  Offering another sac.
 [ B b6 ] , [ R a d1 ]  As predicted 10 moves ago (it took longer than I thought) the black pieces on [ [ d7 ] ] and [ [ d8 ] ] are now under fire. Further the black bishop on [ [ d7 ] ] is pinned. If it moves the black rook on [ [ d8 ] ] falls. This puts a direct threat against the black pawn on [ c6 ] though for now black's rook keeps the pawn safe.
 [ O-O-O ] , [ R e1 ]  Directly threaten the black queen for the first time.
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ] , [ N c3 ]  Veresov's Opening. White usually tries [ e4 ] somewhere. I later found out that Andrew has had decent success with 1. [ d4 ] 2. [ N c3 ] so I'm inadvertently playing into one of his specialties. I think I'll try to get [ c5 ] in so that I can dispute the center. Since I don't feel daring enough to play a gambit I'll set up with [ d6 ] first. But I'll try to keep him guessing by playing [ N f6 ] ahead of d6. Then I'll move the c-pawn.
 [ B g2 ]  [ e4 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ N x d4 ] , [ Q x d4 ]  14. [ Q x d4 ] - knight trade.
 [ Q x a1 ] , [ R a3 ]  This was where I thought his queen was trapped...
 [ B e7 ]  [ K b1 ]  [ b5 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ h3 ]  [ O-O ] , [ g4 ]  14. [ g4 ] - over the last few moves both sides have been clearing their decks and preparing to pawn storm each other's castled positions. I am playing to open up the g and h column.
 [ O-O-O ] , [ B e3 ]  defending [ d4 ] developing a piece and anticipating ..[ c5 ] maybe.
 [ c5 ] , [ B c4 ]  Black is getting ready for a big attack so I didn't want to let it happen. I was forced to move my bishop and exchange the rooks.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ] , [ N c3 ]  Hi everyone! I hope you are all having a nice weekend. After coming on the wrong end of a tactical melee in my previous annotated game at least The Beginner got one tactic right in her game against a Class A 1800+ player called Jean-Pierre. I drew my MT game with him as white so it was nice to get a win with the black pieces over him. I played against The Vienna Opening which I remember trying out against Coach Ion without too much success. The gameknot analysis link to the game is as follows:- http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=15246679&fb=1&rnd=0.599032368192871. The moves of this opening are [ e4 ] [ e5 ] and [ N c3 ] rather than Nf3.
 [ B e5 ]  [ B c6 ]  [ R a b8 ] , [ R e4 ]  and now there is a real danger that my queen will get caught without any squares to move to.
 [ B d7 ] , [ N x d5 ]  White wins a pawn but must sidestep a tactical trap.
 [ h6 ]  [ N g5 e4 ]  [ b5 ]  [ c x b5 ]  [ N x d5 ] , [ h4 ]  Why would he do that? If he pushes it to [ h5 ] I'll play g5. That lets his knight have f5. So I'll play [ e6 ] to keep ahold of that and also helps take some pressure off of that pawn.
 [ g5 ] , [ f4 ]  Blunder! Not necessary to play! [ K e3 ] was better or the tricky one Bb2!!
 [ d x c4 ] , [ e4 ]  This move is still within the main line and the white c pawn has been sacrificed for the initiative.
 [ O-O ] , [ N x e7 + ]  I played this because I thought that it would make the attack on [ d6 ] easier and that I wanted to have a bishop over knight advantage but in retrospect this seemed like trading an active knight for a bad bishop.
 [ f x g6 ] , [ Q h3 ]  Forking to good pawns.
 [ e x f5 ]  [ R c5 ] , [ g4 ]  defending the pinned pawn
 [ b x a4 ]  [ N x a4 ] , [ h6 ]  With a potential threat against black Carl opens up here. Of course the other big plan is a pawn chain where Carl would get an unstoppable passed pawn.
 [ N x e5 ]  [ Q d5 ]  [ Q x d5 ]  [ B x d5 ]  [ d x c3 ]  [ B a3 ]  [ R c7 ]  [ R d e1 ]  [ R d8 ]  [ B f3 ]  [ N x f3 + ]  [ g x f3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ K g2 ]  [ R d2 ]  [ R e d1 ]  [ R c d7 ]  [ R x d2 ]  [ R x d2 ]  [ B b4 ]  [ R b2 ]  [ a3 ]  [ c2 ]  [ R c1 ] , [ B h6 ]  No good options; White resigns. A lesson learned.
 [ e x d4 ]  [ O-O ] , [ B d3 ]  This is the normal position for the bishop in this set-up.
 [ N h4 ]  [ Q g5 ] , [ N d f3 ]  16... [ R x f3 ] 17. [ Q x f3 ] [ Q x h4 ] 18. [ Q x h3 ] [ Q x h3 ] 19. [ g x h3 ] -- seems ok for white still.
 [ Q d6 ] , [ a3 ]  Going after my B. But I was unprepared for his next move but I knew what had to be done anyhow.
 [ Q f4 ]  [ R a c8 ]  [ R h6 ]  [ K f7 ]  [ R h x g6 ]  [ Q x g6 ]  [ R x g6 ] , [ K x g6 ]  26. ..... [ K x g6 ] - Glenda is traded off for two rooks and a pawn. This leaves me one point up in material but there is big trouble ahead. I am very weak on the dark squares and the downside is - rooks do not move diagonally so they cannot do very much even collectively.
 [ K f8 ]  [ B x g7 + ]  [ K x g7 ] , [ R x b6 ]  and black resigns! hope you enjoyed the game ! that's my friends is one of the cruelties of chess or maybe we can say that some how justice have been done what do you think ?
 [ Q x c4 ] , [ Q h5 ]  Looking to get the rook.
 [ Q c2 ] , [ f5 ]  White threatens the unprotected black N. Black refuses to relinquish his footing on e4.
 [ B x b3 ] , [ a4 ]  White doesn't know what he is doing: let's move a bishop around
 [ h6 ] , [ B h4 ]  White invites the charging [ [ [ g5 ] ] ] but the games I've played it have imploded back upon me. None of the materials I have on this position are written from the black perspective and none of the ones written for white suggest it but the move can have a real rationale for it: Inducing [ [ [ g5 ] ] ] and playing [ B g3 ] to control c7. If black plays [ [ [ g5 ] ] ] white gets to play [ B g3 ] with tempo. Because of this I'm still willing to play it but I figure moves preparing it are necessary. The pin is still there but for the moment it seems safe to ignore.
 [ B e7 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ B e5 ]  [ B d6 ] , [ N x d6 + ]  Fork. *CANTO II*
 [ h6 ]  [ B x f4 ]  [ h x g7 ] , [ R g8 ]  9. ...... [ R g8 ] - I "lose" the [ g7 ] pawn but will get it back next move. There is no time to realise my piece for pawn advantage because my rook on [ h8 ] is en prise. I cannot now castle kingside and I must rack my brains as to how to clear the decks for Henry to go queenside. I have a hunch that Freddy is gonna put his king there ........
 [ N f3 ] , [ N c6 ]  As I'm not so used to playing against the Closed Sicilian Defense. So this is pretty educational. I'd say as much as the Owen's Defense. That's because when Ken played that against me the amount of times I encountered it come to think of it was only once or twice more. Thus in this case if I seem to remember correctly this is only the second time that I've encountered 2...[ N c6 ] as part of the Sicilian. As most of the time 2...[ d6 ] has been played against me.
 [ R d5 ]  [ B c4 ] , [ R d8 ]  40. ...... [ R d8 ] - breaking the monotony but would [ R d7 ] have been better here?
 [ K e7 ] , [ N d5 + ]  ! With tempo and guarding e3.
 [ B b5 + ] , [ N f d7 ]  Mistake (I wanted to menace the knight)
 [ R a c1 ] , [ R f e8 ]  22. ....... [ R f e8 ] - to put pressure on [ e3 ] and to stop white's knight going to [ e7 ] with check.
 [ h x g6 ]  [ f x g6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ Q f4 ]  [ R a d1 ]  [ R a d8 ]  [ R e3 ] , [ g5 ]  [ h5 ] was also interesting.
 [ K h1 ] , [ Q x d7 ]  To be honest at this point in the game I believed that if I played carefully Black wins. Black's Queen is in a good position and Black's King is tucked away. White has lost her two most active pieces she is behind in development and behind in material.
 [ N x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ B x d4 ]  [ e x d4 ] , [ Q e4 ]  Now you lose the knight since after [ B x d5 ] you cannot recapture by Qe4[ x d5 ] because the discovered attack Bd6[ x h2 + ] wins the queen. Only chance was 16.[ c4 ] even though after something like 16.-dxc3e.p. 17.[ N x c3 ] [ R e8 ] 18.[ Q d1 ] (cannot allow Bb7[ x f3 ] destroying the king's shelter) [ Q d7 ] black's bishops are much stronger than the knights in an open position like this and the d-pawn is weak as well.
 [ d5 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ e3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ f3 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ h4 ] , [ N b4 ]  [ K b4 ] - not the principled move of deploying pawns and secondary pieces (ie knights and bishops). Also what is the plan of attack? If it's [ c2 ] it's easily defended. Knight as he did or Bd3. If you want to move pawn to [ c5 ] make sure to do it before moving Q knight. Always ask what can he do next? Here all he has to do is move [ a3 ] and you retreat losing tempo.
 [ h6 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ e6 ]  Very solid. This won't be easy.
 [ Q d4 ] , [ f6 ]  Black's position becomes pretty cramped after the text move so perhaps 10...[ R g8 ] was worth considering.
 [ R f1 ]  [ R e2 ]  [ f4 ] , [ B c5 ]  Preparing to answer ...PxP with BxP.
 [ R x c2 ]  [ b x c2 ] , [ B x c2 ]  He resigned.
 [ B x e4 ] , [ R c1 ]  This move knocks White out of the game. Once the White Knight is taken Black will win the Bishop and be up a piece.
 [ d x e4 ]  [ Q b5 + ]  [ K d1 ]  [ Q d3 + ]  [ B d2 ]  [ B x d2 ]  [ N x d2 ] , [ Q x c3 ]  Now it is time for black to get some pawns back.
 [ K h1 ] , [ N a5 ]  Basically blacks need to do something about pin - for example by moving the king. But in this case blacks can move knight on [ c4 ] where it is very active.
 [ N g4 ]  [ B h4 + ]  [ K d1 ]  [ Q e7 ]  [ b3 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ N f2 ]  [ d5 ] , [ B h6 ]  I see here White is aiming for the [ g7 ] space to try and trap my king.
 [ K d2 ] , [ Q a1 ]  !
 [ N x g4 ]  [ B x g4 ] , [ f3 ]  This is not a good plan I followed. This squares closes in my own pieces. On the other side I'll have an impressive center easily supported if handled with care.
 [ e4 ] , [ c5 ]  Part of a series of annotated games where I explore the Sveshnikov Sicillian. See my annotated games list for other examples.
 [ Q c7 ]  [ a4 ] , [ b4 ]  16. ...... [ b4 ] - now that passer on [ c3 ] is well supported. Passivitis and paralysis is setting into the white camp like dry rot!
 [ e4 ] , [ d6 ]  This game came from the Pirc Defense mini-tournament
 [ g x f5 ] , [ K e7 ]  Now I obviously have to protect the f-pawn right? I only have three pawns left and they are all weak. I need as many chances to promote as possible. And yet...
 [ O-O ]  [ g4 ] , [ h6 ]  Now the game is where I want it to be. Still it's not easy to break.
 [ B g2 ] , [ Q e3 ]  I hate that Queen...
 [ B d3 ] , [ B a7 ]  Threatening as in the previous note...
 [ Q x h6 ] , [ R x h6 ]  And Black's king is trapped.
 [ B d3 ] , [ N f6 ]  Continuing logically.
 [ e x d5 ]  [ Q x d5 ] , [ d4 ]  Otherwise Black gets control of the center and an active Q.
 [ d x e5 ] , [ Q d5 ]  ! - Never underestimate the lower rated players.
 [ B e7 ]  [ B x c4 ]  [ N a5 ]  [ Q a4 + ] , [ N c6 ]  I feel like I'm in good shape in this position. None of my previous moves have sealed my fate and no one has dominant control of the center yet.
 [ a5 ] , [ B g4 ]  Time to frighten the bishop away.
 [ g6 ] , [ B g8 ]  for some this position looks like a draw but in this kind of position you need to ''scan'' the board. look on what your advantages are and use them to win. White's advantage in this position is that he has the center and black's pieces are very passive king protects pawn on [ d5 ] so does the bishop while blockading the passed pawn on g6. How ever the tricky part is how white should proceed. Well in this bishop ending game white should focus on taking advantage that he has a passed pawn and so...
 [ c4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ e4 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ B d3 ] , [ O-O ]  He has given me total control of the center. There are sound defenses were black intentionally does this but this is not one of them.
 [ N d1 ]  [ Q f5 ]  [ N f e3 ]  [ Q g6 ] , [ R a b1 ]  White's road to salvation is down the b-file but will it be enough!
 [ N c6 ] , [ d4 ]  Forcing by taking contol of the centre
 [ e5 ]  [ R h c8 ]  [ c3 ] , [ B f8 ]  Perhaps this last move was a waiting move
 [ R d8 ]  [ N d4 ] , [ Q f6 ]  Black is preparing to use the big field a1-[ d4 ] by making pressure on the Knight the Bishop becomes a headache for the freedom of move protected by his own Pawns the route: c4-[ d3 ] compromising the defense of the Knight
 [ B b5 ]  [ d5 ]  [ a3 ]  [ B x c3 + ] , [ b x c3 ]  His pawn structure is smashed with his entire queen pawn structure isolated and part of it doubled.
 [ c x d6 ]  [ K d7 ]  [ N e5 + ] , [ K x d6 ]  Ouch! White is encouraged to move NxP[ f7 + ] followed by leaping onto the rook.
 [ K b6 ] , [ Q b7 # ]  
 [ R a8 ] , [ B d5 ]  Key move forces his rook into [ a6 ] and some tactics.
 [ f3 ] , [ f4 ]  Any number of siege plans can follow. I did not analyze the Kingside in detail but pawns + Bishop + Knight + Queen/Rook just felt bad for me. I needed to hurry up.
 [ K g2 ]  [ R e5 ]  [ R f4 ]  [ f6 ] , [ h4 ]  Preventing [ R g5 ] and attempts on my part to hold the 5th rank while protecting the g-pawn.
 [ d x c5 ]  [ N x c5 + ]  [ K e3 ]  [ N x b3 ]  [ B b4 ]  [ K c4 ] , [ B d6 ]  49. [ B d6 ] - Black's pawns stay doubled but it will only be a matter of time before I lose the pawn on a3.
 [ R f e1 ] , [ B x c5 ]  ? Black needs this bishop so can not afford to give it up so easily
 [ K g1 ] , [ R a c8 ]  mate threat.
 [ K f8 ]  [ N b d2 ] , [ N f6 ]  Both trying to finish development
 [ c4 ] , [ e6 ]  I like this move as it solidifies black's position.
 [ g6 ]  [ g3 ]  [ B g7 ] , [ B g2 ]  this also goes with the territory: fianchetto's on the Kings' wing; Indian style...
 [ f5 ]  [ K e3 ]  [ R h8 ]  [ R c2 ]  [ K f6 ] , [ R g2 ]  34. [ R g2 ] - I believe this move to be very flexible and versatile. It certainly adds protection to [ g4 ] and protects the knight on h2.
 [ R x e8 + ]  [ R x e8 ] , [ B x e8 ]  Now I am +5 and after my rook gets active black is helpless.
 [ K g7 ] , [ N x d5 ]  i want to check with pawn and than attack by knight; but i didnt see that black knight on defending the f (five) _ my numbers seems not to work
 [ N b7 + ]  [ K c4 ] , [ N x a5 + ]  Yummy!
 [ B e3 ] , [ B g4 ]  With the white queen on [ f3 ] and bishop on [ c4 ] black's knight is tethered to its [ f6 ] square and not available to do any work since the [ f7 ] square is exposed if it moves away. 7...[ B g4 ] forces the white queen off the f file and allows black to catch up one step in development. The computer likes the odd-looking [ N a5 ] at this point which seems strategically hard to explain.
 [ R b8 ]  [ h5 ] , [ c5 ]  An error for him. This lets me get right in his grill so to speak.
 [ R e8 ] , [ R d5 d1 ]  there!
 [ R f e1 ] , [ N e4 ]  I move my rook [ f1 ] to [ e1 ] opposite the king but behind my [ e2 ] knight and black moves his knight to e4.
 [ Q h5 + ]  [ K e7 ] , [ Q f7 + ]  More good moves.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ N x c6 ]  i think this is a bad change... the black gains a better control of the center...
 [ e x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ] , [ K e5 ]  That's because of this fork as now I have to give up my e pawn in order to keep my N alive.
 [ h3 ]  [ B h5 ]  [ g4 ]  [ B g6 ]  [ K e3 ]  [ R a b8 ]  [ B a5 ]  [ R b3 + ]  [ R d3 ]  [ R e b8 ]  [ R c1 ]  [ N d5 + ]  [ K e2 ]  [ N f4 + ]  [ K e1 ]  [ N x d3 + ] , [ K d2 ]  Should have went for the rook here and traded horsies or escaping without a scratch. Another mistake I won't be correcting this time so that I can get us to the strange strategy in question.
 [ Q d7 ]  [ N x f5 ]  [ Q x f5 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ Q e6 ] , [ Q h5 + ]  Maybe I had to consider [ g4 ] taking advantage on the uneasy position of his queen.
 [ R a2 ] , [ a5 ]  White moves rook to a2. Black pushes pawn to a5.
 [ N f5 + ] , [ K g8 ]  So the finish is in touching distance.
 [ B e7 ]  [ N f6 + ]  [ N x f6 ]  [ g x f6 ]  [ B f8 ] , [ Q b3 ]  Here i think that the black stands better but not much. I evaluate this because all the white pawns are on black squares and this is the reason i went to exchanges
 [ R x e5 ] , [ d x e5 ]  29. ..... [ d x e5 ] - one pair of rooks is exchanged off.
 [ N a3 ] , [ B d6 ]  Dark bishop moved to [ d6 ] onto the same diagonal as black queen. This means that diagonal is defended if need to move queen elsewhere.
 [ K b5 ]  [ K h5 ] , [ K a6 ]  ...so I move him diagonally to attack them.
 [ g5 ]  [ B g3 ] , [ Q e7 ]  Both players have incomplete development.
 [ R b8 ]  [ b3 ]  [ e6 ] , [ N b1 ]  And my threat is over for about the next 20 moves. Good defense by white I think. Threatens my queen prevents Qa3+. . . .
 [ Q d7 ] , [ N b5 ]  Planning to exchange: [ B x b5 ] Rxb5! and attacking [ b7 ] once again.
 [ h x g4 ] , [ K e7 ]  It was very nice to dream on [ f6 ] from where my king can take a round and block the g pawn.
 [ B h4 ]  [ R x g4 ] , [ B x f2 + ]  Although White missed his chance to win my overextended pawn I'm still in trouble because of the open file to my king.
 [ b x c3 ]  [ N e5 ] , [ N f3 ]  ?? This is a huge blunder.
 [ B x d5 ]  [ R a b1 ]  [ a6 ]  [ a4 ]  [ O-O-O ]  [ a x b5 ]  [ f5 ]  [ Q g6 ]  [ R d7 ]  [ Q e8 + ] , [ K b7 ]  This line leads to the forced draw by repetition. Black has perpetual and his king is in too much danger for him not to use it.
 [ K h8 ]  [ Q x e4 ] , [ f3 ]  ..gxf leads to [ N f3 + ] with Rf6-[ h6 ] and [ Q x h3 ] coming soon...
 [ Q c2 + ]  [ N d2 ] , [ a6 ]  a6! This is a very difficult move to find and is the only move that draws. e.g. 38.. [ a5 ] 39. [ R d5 ] +/- 38.. [ R f8 + ] 39. [ K g1 ] (..[ R e8 ] 40. [ R b1 ] +/- or ..[ Q c5 ] 40. [ R b1 ] +/-). 38.. [ Q g6 ] 39. [ N c4 ] +/- 38.. [ Q c5 ] 39. [ R b1 ] [ R x e5 ] 40. [ B x b7 + ] [ K b8 ] +/-
 [ R x c3 ] , [ N e5 ]  Ok I've sacrified two developement moves and conceded the semiopen b column... for some reason right? So...
 [ h5 ]  [ f5 ]  [ N x f5 ] , [ N x f5 ]  22. [ N x e6 ] also playable but I need his 1 pawn on g' file to block his Rook & Queen to which attacks [ g2 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ N x c3 ]  [ b x c3 ]  [ B f5 ] , [ N f3 ]  And now everything starts going down hill from here.
 [ B b6 ] , [ c5 ]  Thinking that it was trapped I played this move. I'm trying to outsmart and pull a swindle against Carl. But it's not going to work.
 [ R x d7 ] , [ R b1 ]  white protects his b pawn so he can move his queen. I would have considered moving the queen to [ e3 ] attacking my knight.
 [ N x d6 ]  [ R x c1 ]  [ R x c1 ]  [ Q e7 ] , [ N f5 ]  Black cannot play 33. ... Qxb4?? because 34. [ N x g7 ] followed by [ B x d7 ] and also threatening [ B x e5 + ]  [ Q d8 ]  [ d6 ]  [ N h f6 ]  [ B f3 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ R c7 ]  [ R e6 ] , [ R x b7 ]  Black loses a second pawn
 [ f6 ]  [ B c3 ] , [ e5 ]  Exploiting the pin. Believe it or not all of these moves have been played before. Here the stem game continued with 29.[ K b1 ] but after 29...[ e x f4 ] Black survived.
 [ R c2 ] , [ Q x f2 + ]  Ai was that a threat as well..... Good game by my opponent brought me back with two feets on the ground. The end of a beautiful winning streak of 7 games but of course it is also the start of a new winning streak which hopefully lasts more than 7 games this time.
 [ B x b8 ]  [ R x a6 ] , [ Q e5 ]  and black resigns the activity of the white queen is to much for black thank you and i hope you enjoyed the game .
 [ Q f7 ] , [ B x a7 ]  Now my surviving bishop removes his far pawn...
 [ R e5 + ] , [ K d4 ]  White threatens mate. Only move:
 [ e3 ] , [ N a6 ]  Setting a foothold for his bishop on [ c5 ]  [ a3 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ Q g4 ] , [ g5 ]  not much of a threat the queen by herself better I think would be d5!
 [ K b5 ]  [ a x b3 ]  [ Q d3 ]  [ Q x h8 ]  [ b6 ] , [ Q e5 + ]  White has won back most of his material now. The final attack starts.
 [ h4 ] , [ Q g4 ]  I attack the queen by moving my h pawn out to [ h4 ] and black's queen moves down to g4.
 [ K h6 ] , [ N e g4 + ]  Exclam! The counter-intuitive [ N e g4 ] leaving the [ f6 ] Knight en prise is the game-winner. The other Knight check leads to a dead end for White.
 [ N f3 ] , [ N c6 ]  ...then we develop our knights mine to defend my pawn.
 [ Q x c7 + ]  [ K x a6 ]  [ Q c6 + ]  [ K a7 ]  [ K c7 ]  [ a6 ]  [ Q b6 + ]  [ K a8 ] , [ Q x a6 # ]  
 [ K f6 ]  [ N d3 ]  [ N d8 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ R c7 ]  [ f4 ]  [ h6 ]  [ R a8 ]  [ N e6 ] , [ R g8 ]  Ion - I don't know whether 35...[ R g8 ] was best but it did seem to mean that if Black wanted to get play she would have to give up her c-pawn...
 [ N x e5 ] , [ c4 ]  The knight sac was in order to to this.
 [ B f4 ] , [ Q a8 ]  Forced. Exchange of the Queen for Bishop while it sounds wildly bad might have staved off mate for a few more moves. Instead I moved into a forced mate in 5.
 [ B h6 ] , [ R h1 ]  I again decided to bet I could survive to BxB KxB.
 [ R b3 x b2 + ]  [ Q x b2 ]  [ R x b2 + ]  [ K x b2 ]  [ B e5 ]  [ K c3 ]  [ B x d4 + ]  [ K x d4 ]  [ f5 ]  [ g x f5 ]  [ e x f5 ]  [ K e5 ]  [ f4 ]  [ K e4 ]  [ K f7 ]  [ a4 ]  [ K e6 ]  [ K f3 ]  [ K f5 ]  [ a5 ]  [ g4 + ]  [ K g2 ]  [ K e4 ]  [ a6 ]  [ f3 + ]  [ K f2 ]  [ K f4 ]  [ K g1 ]  [ g3 ]  [ K h1 ]  [ K e3 ]  [ K g1 ]  [ g2 ]  [ K h2 ]  [ K f2 ]  [ K h3 ]  [ g1 = Q ]  [ K h4 ] , [ Q g3 # ]  What a comeback and that is why you never give up!!!!
 [ e x f5 ] , [ e5 ]  The thematic followup white has forced a pawn breakthrough he has two well supported passed pawns that continue to tie black down.
 [ B x g3 + ] , [ f x g3 ]  Omus did contemplate declining the Bishop and instead playing Kh1. My initial analysis suggested this line would take me to an endgame featuring either the two Queens and me with a two pawn lead or an equal material endgame with just Kings and pawns with my King winning the race to the other side. But this analysis may be flawed and perhaps I would only have found myself a pawn up with a lot of work still to do. Still I'd rather have had the two Bishops than the extra Rook. In case you hadn't noticed [ K g1 ] was not an option or mate in two with [ B h2 ] [ K h1 ] [ B x g2 # ]  [ R x g2 + ]  [ K h1 ] , [ R x c2 + ]  You can see where this is going...
 [ d x c6 ]  [ B x c6 ]  [ B x b6 ]  [ Q b7 ] , [ B f2 ]  Black gets some initiative in the center
 [ f6 ]  [ f3 ] , [ Q h3 ]  Queen in worthless spot for rest of game.
 [ N g e2 ] , [ O-O ]  Normal development so far hence the scarce notes.
 [ f x e6 ] , [ R d3 ]  Pinning the bishop to the rook.
 [ R d8 ] , [ f8 = Q ]  49. f8/Q - checking to make sure that Graham's king will be able to move should he decide to give up his rook I now crown my f pawn.
 [ N g5 ] , [ h x g4 ]  Opening the file but also allowing to exchange a piece thereby eliminating one piece from the attack
 [ R f8 ] , [ N d2 ]  23. [ N d2 ] - my [ d3 ] pawn just two squares away from Glendadom is momentarily blockaded but he will get there.
 [ R x g7 + ]  [ K f5 ] , [ R f7 ]  ?!
 [ c x d5 ]  [ R x c1 ]  [ R x c1 ]  [ B x a3 ]  [ d x e6 ]  [ B x c1 ]  [ e x d7 ] , [ Q d8 ]  And this is the only way to stop it. But Joann has something up her sleeve since she will fork on her next move. On the other hand it's about how far the Q fork will go.
 [ B x f2 + ] , [ K x f2 ]  And the reason for giving me a piece for pawn is due to the monarch being exposed which puts me in rough shape especially with what will happen on the next move. In fact this isn't a real gambit because he gets back a piece and I'm at a big disadvantage with what was noted.
 [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ d4 ]  I'm always happy to see this move instead of [ B b5 ] which is much more annoying to play against.
 [ N x h5 ]  [ Q x h5 ]  [ Q x e3 + ]  [ K h1 ]  [ Q x d4 ] , [ N f3 ]  I'm down two pawns now although I have a bit of an attack on the unprotected King. I think Black is clearly better at this point and if my opponent can get his Bishop out and activate his Rooks I think it is a winning position.
 [ R d1 ] , [ Q x h4 + ]  White threatened a discover attack that didn't really change much. If I allowed 27. [ B e3 ] I could simply respond with [ R x e2 ] 28. [ B x d4 ] [ R x f2 ] 29. [ B x f2 ] and I've accomplished the better half of my liquidation plans. But I might have better so I try something different.
 [ N d6 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ f5 ] , [ g3 ]  White didn't move the knight as it is not clear yet where to move.
 [ e2 + ]  [ B x e2 ]  [ f x e2 + ] , [ K x e2 ]  And my opponent resigns in this position as he did not forsee the loss of his white rook. Yeah it's not fun playing without a shred of hope unless one wants to see what the opponent does to finish the game. I've played a bit longer against good opponents than I should just to see how they finish me off. It's a learning experience after all. I hope you enjoyed this game and got something out of it!
 [ a x b3 ]  [ e ] , [ p ]  Now the position is getting very dynamic.
 [ N e c7 ]  [ c4 ]  [ K f2 ] , [ N d3 + ]  !? Just makes me do what I was going to do anyway.
 [ R e7 ] , [ R e3 ]  Waste of a move!
 [ R a1 ] , [ N e8 ]  Trying to reposition my N to a better spot. The plan was 20...[ N c7 ] followed by 21...[ N e6 ] as I like better there then on [ f6 ] where it blocked my Bg7.
 [ R b8 ]  [ a6 ]  [ R a8 ]  [ a7 ] , [ B e6 ]  (!)Strong move and a good connector with the black plan.
 [ B e7 ] , [ N b2 ]  I saw an opportunity to further advance my position if my opponent captured my R. His Q would be taken.
 [ K d2 ] , [ h5 ]  The obvious threat here is 18. ... [ B h6 ] skewering the white queen to her king.
 [ h5 ]  [ g x h5 ]  [ N x h5 ] , [ R g1 ]  While white's attack is beginning to unravel black has barely any play anywhere on the board.
 [ R a d8 ]  [ Q g5 ] , [ d5 ]  Time to get the ball rolling while my opponent fruitlessly tries to attack on the kingside
 [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ e4 ]  [ B b4 ]  [ a3 ] , [ B x c3 ]  All standard stuff so far though I was a little suprised that black gave up a bishop for a knight he clearly thought it was a worthwhile exchange
 [ N d6 + ] , [ K g6 ]  If black had moved his king to [ f6 ] then I still would have been in the game since [ N x e4 ] would have come with a game winning check.
 [ R x e7 ]  [ R x e7 ]  [ N b6 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ N x a8 ] , [ B x a8 ]  and now with the presences of opposite coloured bishops the ending is a clear draw. I chose to play on for a while more though simply because my opponent is stronger and has the extra material so I wait until I have 'proven the draw' before I offer one
 [ R a g1 ]  [ f5 ] , [ N h2 ]  Chased the knight away.
 [ K g7 ]  [ K g3 ]  [ f6 ] , [ e x f6 + ]  I intend to swap off ans many Pawns as possible.
 [ e x d5 ]  [ O-O ] , [ B e4 ]  Now his bishop acts like a blocker!
 [ Q x d7 ] , [ B d2 ]  The other logic behind the exchange is that while Mary doesn't lose anything it allowed this move. Even though it gets defended this move gains a tempo for white.
 [ R x f2 ]  [ R x f2 ] , [ Q x e6 + ]  white must guard against discovered check with the rook attacking the queen.
 [ a3 ]  [ R a4 ] , [ h4 ]  I'm really starting to hate those pawns.
 [ Q x d4 ]  [ f x g4 ] , [ B e5 ]  Instead of 8.[ Q x d5 ] I was desperate to win a rook.
 [ a3 ] , [ N a4 ]  ? this was black's last chance to equalize with ...[ N c6 ]  [ a x b3 ]  [ e ]  [ p ] , [ c x b3 ]  Black is still ok but all the attacking chances belong to white.
 [ R e8 ]  [ R e1 ] , [ b5 ]  I would’ve went [ B x c4 ] threatening [ R x e2 ] but this is ok
 [ N f4 ] , [ N f5 + ]  No the real point of 20. [ N h6 ] is revealed. The K is forced to move and there are forks in the air.
 [ h3 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ c4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ B b4 ]  Developing the pieces towards the center.
 [ K h7 ] , [ B d3 ]  Threatening a discovered check.
 [ b4 ] , [ N c e2 ]  or [ [ a4 ] ] though i didn't really want him loading up on [ [ a4 ] ] with [ B d7 ] and Qa5. back to [ b1 ] was never an option that would pass the advantage to black.
 [ Q x e1 + ]  [ K c2 ]  [ Q f2 + ]  [ K b3 ]  [ R e3 ]  [ Q c4 ] , [ R x f3 ]  I discover another defense to the bishop.
 [ Q e7 ]  [ f3 ]  [ Q d6 ] , [ Q x d6 ]  He took the bait there...
 [ f4 ] , [ g6 ]  ? He should have taken my pawn. Now I have an imposing wall of pawns aimed at him.
 [ Q e7 ]  [ O-O ] , [ N c7 ]  Planning [ g5 ] and [ N d5 ] now needing some way to get my pitiful white bishop activated.
 [ Q g3 ]  [ c3 ]  [ b x c3 ] , [ b5 ]  20. ...... [ b5 ] - Graham continues with his plan to try and open the c column but now it is time for my own rooks to nip that little idea in the bud and move in for the kill.
 [ K d8 ] , [ e6 ]  once again... a tempo...
 [ f6 ]  [ K e6 ]  [ B e5 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ B c7 ]  [ B a6 ]  [ c5 ]  [ B b7 ] , [ B d8 ]  The immediate f6-[ f7 ] fails to 43. ... Kx[ f7 ] 44. [ K e5 ] [ K e7 ] so the bishop goes to [ d8 ] to control e7.
 [ c4 ] , [ N f6 ]  He can create his own square for the bishop.
 [ B d5 ] , [ Q f5 ]  Nice — this is a better move here than [ h x g7 ] by the way — now White is clearly better.
 [ N e5 ] , [ Q e2 ]  White could have played [ Q g3 + ] exchanging Q and get a playable endgame. I lost the chance to play [ N g4 ] here forcing Rh1.
 [ N f6 ]  [ b3 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ Q f4 ]  [ N x c4 ]  [ b x c4 ]  [ d6 ] , [ N h3 ]  its not so good spot for the knight 7.Nf3-g6.8.Bb2-Bg7.9.[ N c3 ] -0-0.10.0-0-[ B d7 ] and blacks position is better but at least white finished its development
 [ K c8 ]  [ N f5 ]  [ R f8 ]  [ N e7 + ]  [ K b8 ]  [ R d3 ]  [ a6 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ b6 ]  [ N c6 + ]  [ K b7 ]  [ N d8 + ]  [ K c8 ]  [ N e6 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ N g7 ]  [ R d8 ] , [ R x d8 + ]  I saw here that the trade of rooks would be good for white. After I take his h pawn white will be up a piece and a pawn. As long as I don't screw up too bad white should win with this position.
 [ N x b2 ] , [ R d2 ]  There are better squares for the rook
 [ R x c3 ]  [ Q x c3 ] , [ B g7 ]  Here [ R e1 ] would be met by ... Ne4.
 [ K c4 ]  [ N d2 + ] , [ K x c3 ]  Taking the unprotected pawn
 [ R b8 ] , [ R a2 ]  Rb1? with Rb6-[ a6 ] and [ N b3 ] black can solve some of his problems and threats [ N d2 ] to win the b pawn
 [ c4 ]  [ B x f3 ]  [ Q x f3 ] , [ O-O ]  Not sure why I traded for the knight other than I didn't want to retreat the bishop. Now white has the bishop pair.
 [ R x d6 ] , [ B e5 ]  Hitting the rook and forcing it into a more passive position. Black is down a pawn but his bishops are in command of the board. Compare the activity of the black bishops to the passivity of the white ones. (And keep an eye out for a reversal of fortunes.)
 [ N x e3 ] , [ f x e3 ]  White is still uncastled and reaching an uncomfortable position due to the lack of support for the king. It is not an immediate problem but the cookie will begin to crumble.
 [ Q d6 ] , [ R c e8 ]  As Jack is trying to exchange Rooks. With this move I'm worried about 25...[ R x e1 + ] 26.[ N x e1 ] Qf1#.
 [ N e4 ] , [ B b6 ]  Any other bishop move allows [ R x a7 ] and 20... [ R c8 ] is met by 21. [ N x c5 ] [ R x c5 ] 22. [ R x [ d4 ] ] Rxb5. Black finishes still two pawns up but White has exchanged the worthless [ b5 ] pawn for the powerful [ d4 ] pawn.
 [ B h8 ] , [ c3 ]  41. [ c3 ] - here is the nest!
 [ K g7 ] , [ R e1 ]  Threatening a nice sacrifice with [ R x e7 ] [ b x e7 ] [ R x e7 ] leading to mate on [ f7 ] or g6.
 [ Q x c4 ] , [ R x f3 ]  Taking back a pawn and trying to create some space for my leader to hide.
 [ O-O ]  [ e5 ] , [ B g5 ]  Threatening [ B x f6 ] [ g x f6 ] [ Q x f6 ] winning a pawn!
 [ B g7 ] , [ N b d2 ]  Nothing happens here...
 [ B x c6 ]  [ N x c6 ] , [ h4 ]  ? Doesn't really solve any problems. Makes mating easier in fact. Possibly a long king retreat would have been preferable? 23 [ K f1 ] [ Q h3 + ] 24 [ K e1 ] [ Q x h2 ] 25 [ Q f1 ]  [ Q h3 + ]  [ K g1 ] , [ N d5 ]  ! Threatening the queen and rook at the same time Black is most definitely in a winning situation.
 [ N c6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ a x b4 ] , [ N x f4 ]  I think that this was his first mistake I believe that [ B x b4 ] was a very good move for black now I have two moves ([ b5 ] [ d4 ] ) which force him to defend and give me the control of the center.
 [ R a8 + ]  [ K e7 ]  [ Q x g7 + ]  [ K d6 ]  [ Q x f6 + ]  [ K d5 ]  [ Q e6 + ]  [ K c5 ] , [ R a6 ]  ...and black resign
 [ N x e4 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ B x e4 ] , [ N f6 ]  Changing the guard at [ f6 ] and gaining a tempo. But you might already be noticing something about Black's light-square bishop. Where is it going? Its scope is pretty limited. Recalling that Black has been playing a 'colours reversed' Colle system we see here the downside of the System if the e-pawn doesn't make it to the fourth rank. The c8-bishop won't be developed for another seven moves...
 [ B f5 ]  [ B e4 ]  [ B d7 ] , [ f4 ]  22. [ f4 ] - not much doing here. It is now a case of where do I go from here? I just hope it doesn't turn my position south.
 [ Q x d6 ] , [ B f4 ]  Solid move... gets his other bishop into the fray.
 [ Q b6 ] , [ B f4 ]  15. [ B f4 ] - Freddy clears the decks and develops his dark squared bishop. I wonder where black is gonna castle? With the queen side looking rather draughty I would hesitate to put Henry on that side hmm I know Freddy usually gets him in the end but why make it Easy for him!
 [ R e5 ]  [ R c8 c7 ]  [ R g3 ]  [ K h8 ]  [ Q h4 ] , [ N g8 ]  You can see how clinging to the Caro can mean extreme pressure at this point. Here I know I get to go through the tunnel to see what comes. I do get scared at points like this because the Caro does not always protect with economy of motion even though it is designed to have economy of motion (force) at most given times.
 [ K e2 ] , [ N x d4 + ]  I go on to win
 [ Q x f3 ] , [ Q f6 ]  instead of developing Black seeks an exchange
 [ B x e5 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N x c6 + ]  [ B x c6 ]  [ B x c6 ]  [ Q x c6 ] , [ Q e5 + ]  Only the queens are left and the White queen has arrived on [ e5 ] with check. After 31 ... [ K b7 ] the game will still be dead even with Black's central passed pawn balanced against White's secure king position the exposed position of Black's king and the possibility that White may create a passed pawn of his own on the either wing. White thinking he'd frittered away his advantage with 19 [ N f4 ] offered a draw that Black refused.
 [ R f2 + ]  [ K c3 ] , [ R x h2 ]  This the the final nail in the coffin.
 [ N x d5 ] , [ B d3 ]  Setting up a discovered attack.
 [ K d2 ]  [ c x b3 ]  [ c x b3 ]  [ Q x b3 ]  [ R d b1 ]  [ Q c4 ] , [ Q d4 ]  24. Qd4? - another well-intentioned move to exchange queens to relieve the pressure on Henry but when my knight moves to [ d4 ] my b pawn will be left hanging. I now drop another pawn.
 [ d5 ] , [ N c3 ]  I'll decline the pawn exchange for now; if d5[ x c4 ] I can use the white bishop to retake and kill 2 birds with one stone. Just get on with developing pieces.
 [ K e7 ] , [ B d5 ]  7. [ B d5 ] - this move is recommended by Wikipedia and is the most popular move in the World DB.
 [ e4 ] , [ c5 ]  A team match in which I am playing black. White played the King's pawn so I opted for the Sicilian. I must say I'm pretty proud of this one. My oppnent gave me fits and kept me in a straight jacket for almost 20 moves. This is by far the hardest defensive struggle I have undergone in any of my recent chess games.
 [ B x e4 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ N x e4 ] , [ Q h4 + ]  12. ...... [ Q h4 + ] - sssss in comes the Wicked Witch of the West. It looks as if black will get a piece for a pawn but .......
 [ K e1 ] , [ N d3 + ]  not sure why black didn't take the rook... but I suspect there's a quicker mate this way
 [ N f6 ]  [ f3 ]  [ d4 ]  [ N e3 c4 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ d3 ]  [ N e3 ]  [ B x e3 ]  [ d x e3 ]  [ Q e2 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N x c6 ]  [ b x c6 ]  [ a3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N x e3 ]  [ R e8 ] , [ g3 ]  Oops. Black has two pieces attacking the white knight white has only the queen defending it. Worse if black takes the knight with the rook the white queen is pinned.
 [ g4 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ h4 ] , [ e5 ]  This is made to free a little black's lsb. Black realizes what's coming on and tries to mix up things a little.
 [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ d4 ]  the Sicilian defence one of my favourite openings as black but i also like to play against it with white because often you get many open lines which can lead to rather interesting games whit alot of action and tactics.
 [ N d3 ]  [ B a6 ]  [ N x c5 ]  [ Q x c5 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ O-O ]  I'd like this rook to be on the d file.
 [ K g6 ] , [ R x d7 ]  Lunch! But not free. I expect 4u to move a Rook to [ d8 ] attacking both Rook and Knight.
 [ B d7 ]  [ N b c3 ] , [ N g6 ]  9. ..... [ N g6 ] - now the other knight moves to the third rank this is to free up Fou Lenoir.
 [ N f6 ] , [ a3 ]  forcing the bishop to make a desicion
 [ f4 ]  [ Q e7 ] , [ N b3 ]  The idea is Nd4. It can be kicked by the c pawn though. No no c4.
 [ b x c3 ]  [ b x c3 ]  [ R d6 ] , [ R b1 ]  25.Ne6? then 25. ... [ R x e6 ] 26. [ R x e6 ] [ f x e6 ] 27. [ Q x g6 ] [ Q x f2 ] black win.
 [ b5 ]  [ B b3 ] , [ c4 ]  Opening the diagonal and blocking the bishop of the protection from the [ d5 ] square where I will make a tactical maneuver.
 [ h6 ]  [ B x f6 ] , [ Q x f6 ]  I have a weak point in f4. instead of avoid the occupation with the knight. I am going to commite another mistake.
 [ N d4 ] , [ K c3 ]  Not a good choice.
 [ B d6 ] , [ f4 ]  Seems to lose a tempo and slightly weakens the king's position. The Knight can be chased anyway after ...[ N e4 ] followed by ...f6.
 [ K b6 ]  [ h5 ] , [ B x h5 ]  sacking the bishop now the best black can hope for is a draw
 [ Q h3 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ f6 ]  stopping the night
 [ Q x f4 ] , [ d5 ]  Freeing both bishop and knight - good.
 [ Q b6 + ]  [ K c1 ] , [ Q g1 + ]  I realized here that he was going to keep putting me in check relentlessly trying to do anything to prevent checkmate. I realized that if I stayed around the bishop the game could eventually end in a threefold repetition. I knew I could win this so I was gonna have to leave those pieces and plan a new strategy.
 [ N x e4 ]  [ Q x e4 ] , [ R e8 ]  At this point the consequences of White's 11th move become apparent. His lead in development has largely been pulled in the centre is a vacuum and Black has the bishop pair in an open position. Given the symmetry of the pawn structures I'd say the game was too close to call here.
 [ N g5 ] , [ f6 ]  10. ........ [ f6 ] - I did consider castling but Qh5! would have resulted in a winning attack. Now I must bite the bullet. At least I will get 2 pieces for the rook after Nf7.
 [ R d5 ]  [ R d1 ]  [ R x d1 ] , [ Q x d1 ]  Tactical threat of [ N d6 ] or [ N c7 ]  [ N d6 ] , [ R d8 ]  with a passed a-pawn I am more than happy to exchange down to a simplified endgame.
 [ Q d6 + ]  [ K e8 ] , [ Q d8 # ]  
 [ Q x b6 ]  [ a x b6 ]  [ a3 ]  [ h6 ]  [ B h4 ] , [ R f d8 ]  14. Bxf6? gains nothing as after 14....[ B x f6 ] White's Q-side pawns come under pressure.
 [ N b c7 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ N e6 ]  [ N c5 ]  [ N e f4 ]  [ N a7 ]  [ N e3 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ N e2 ]  [ N b8 ]  [ N g4 ]  [ K b3 ]  [ N g1 ]  [ K b2 ] , [ N h2 ]  With Safeway and Jabborg returning from their dressing rooms the referee rounded up his explanation; 'knights can only joop within the b7:G2 grid and players must make their moves immediately after their opponent has moved - only a split second delay is allowed as soon as a player has been 'jooped' they must present their rook to [ a1 ] (if white) or [ h8 ] (if black) so that the opponent's king can capture and that colour will win the game!'
 [ R g8 ]  [ R a d1 ]  [ R c4 ]  [ Q f6 ] , [ N c6 ]  Black appears to be freeing himself up possibly preparing to advance his d-pawn but he has to watch out for mate threats.
 [ d x c3 + ]  [ K c2 ]  [ R x e4 ]  [ f x e4 ]  [ R c4 ]  [ R x c3 ]  [ R x c3 + ] , [ K x c3 ]  And I won for timeout. It was a lost final.
 [ K a8 ]  [ Q x e6 ] , [ B x e6 ]  ...decided to open up the king more...
 [ B d2 ]  [ d6 ]  [ h3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ N g e7 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ a3 ]  [ a6 ]  [ B e3 ] , [ B d7 ]  10 moves without any contact...
 [ N c6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ e6 ] , [ B c4 ]  Typical move set that really isn't offensive enough. I think these moves are a bit too passive but perhaps it is because I play too much offensively based games.
 [ Q x c8 + ]  [ Q x c8 ] , [ R x c8 + ]  The rest should be easy.
 [ d6 ]  [ B b5 + ]  [ K e7 ]  [ Q g5 ] , [ Q a5 ]  Notice the count. The Queen and the Bishop attacking the Knight who has only one defender. If you had retreated your Queen to [ d3 ] instead of [ e5 ] you would not have this problem.
 [ B x c3 ]  [ B x c3 ]  [ Q x a4 ] , [ d5 ]  ?? He decides to play a fork between my knight on [ c6 ] and my [ [ e6 ] ] pawn. Therefore I can win his [ [ e6 ] ] pawn and be four points ahead but this does not happen. That will be explained shortly.
 [ Q x f5 ] , [ e x f5 ]  I capture the rook with my queen but knowing there is a pawn at [ e6 ] which will capture my queen.
 [ K f5 ]  [ a5 ]  [ K g4 ]  [ a6 ]  [ K h3 ]  [ a7 ]  [ K g2 ] , [ a8 = Q ]  I finally promoted a pawn to a Queen.
 [ K x f8 ] , [ B h7 ]  Jered's bishop line. Game over unless he moves the queen.
 [ K e8 ]  [ Q f6 ]  [ R g1 + ]  [ K d2 ] , [ B g8 ]  32. ..... [ B g8 ] - temporarily holds the position but .....
 [ g x h6 ] , [ N d5 ]  Hunting more exchanges. I had to analyze this one out quite a bit as it seems to give up the [ e4 ] pawn returning all of black's material deficit and restoring part of his pawn structure.
 [ R c7 ]  [ K f5 ] , [ a4 ]  now I'll advance my a pawn to get the king to come to the queen's wing or to get one of black's pieces committed to block it
 [ B d2 ]  [ B g4 ] , [ a3 ]  Alternative variation: 12. [ N g5 ] [ N f6 ] 13. [ B x g4 ] [ N x d4 ] 14. [ Q d3 ] [ R f e8 + ] 15. [ K d1 ] $19
 [ K g7 ]  [ B e4 ]  [ b6 ]  [ B d8 ]  [ B x f7 ]  [ B c7 ]  [ K f6 ]  [ B b8 ]  [ a6 ]  [ B a7 ]  [ K e5 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ K d6 ]  [ B x b6 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ B x a6 ]  [ K c6 ]  [ B d8 ]  [ c4 ]  [ K c3 ]  [ K d7 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ K c6 ]  [ a4 ]  [ K b6 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ K c5 ]  [ B e7 + ]  [ K d5 ]  [ a5 ] , [ N c6 ]  Another interesting moment.
 [ N x a5 ]  [ Q c8 ] , [ B d2 ]  Virtually anything wins here. White can play such diverse ideas as f2-[ f4 ] and [ B g5 ] to the same effect. Though Black's doom is far off it is virtually assured. The game continuation is instructive as an example of converting a massive positional advantage into a material one via tremendous pressure on one part of the board. In particular this idea of a queenside stranglehold building into irresistible pressure occurs commonly in many d-pawn openings where White plays d4-[ d5 ] as in the Benoni and King's Indian.
 [ O-O ]  [ B g7 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B g5 ] , [ h6 ]  2Puttung the question" as Nimzo described this technique.
 [ N x e3 ] , [ Q x e3 ]  I thought he might have taken with pawn here creating an attack on f7.
 [ d x e5 ]  [ N g4 ] , [ e4 ]  I could have hung onto it but I sensed that this is one of those gambits where black usually gets his pawn back. I could be wrong though.
 [ g5 ]  [ N g3 ] , [ B g6 ]  Bad move. The bishop must go directly to [ h7 ] I will lose tempoes.
 [ B x f6 ]  [ g x f6 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ h5 ]  [ c4 ]  [ f5 ]  [ R b3 ]  [ Q a4 ]  [ O-O ] , [ f x e4 ]  tripled pawns
 [ B d3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ O-O ] , [ B g7 ]  The bishop is developed as planned. I start to wonder where I'm going to move my light squared bishop to. Maybe [ b7 ] would be nice after a [ [ c5 ] ] push but I think that a [ [ c5 ] ] push is too early at this point of the game. The [ e6 ] square isn't really appetizing either as it doesn't put pressure on anything. It's something I'll have to think about during the next few moves. Right now castling should be my priority.
 [ N x f5 ]  [ Q x g4 ]  [ Q x d3 ]  [ B x c5 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ Q g6 + ]  [ K d8 ] , [ Q f6 + ]  Nice move forking king and rook.
 [ B x c6 ]  [ b x c6 ] , [ B g5 ]  ...now have to give up the exchange...
 [ N c3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ N x c6 ]  [ N x c3 ]  [ N x d8 ]  [ N x d1 ]  [ K x d1 ]  [ K x d8 ]  [ e4 ]  [ e5 ] , [ B c4 ]  I attack the f-pawn...
 [ d5 ]  [ c4 ]  [ c6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ e6 ]  The actual starting position.
 [ e4 ]  [ c6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ d5 ] , [ e5 ]  My favourite response to the Caro Kann as recommended by Vasilios Kotronias.
 [ Q x f4 ] , [ e x f4 ]  and now black has to lose a pawn
 [ a5 ] , [ B e1 ]  Still retaining bishop pair
 [ c x d5 ]  [ d x e4 ] , [ d x e4 ]  I would say pawn in [ f5 ] should have moved because now I can check him.
 [ h x g5 ] , [ N x c3 + ]  To menace [ d3 ] with the rook and the LSB in a 2 with black's LSB.
 [ R x h7 ] , [ c5 ]  Black intends to undouble his pawns here. I know he because he moved it forward and first I wasn't sure why. But this time I studied it as Homework since I was interested in knowing what black was trying to do. At first I viewed it as pointless. However the idea is that white will take and when he does black takes back so that those pawns are no longer doubled.
 [ N d7 ]  [ B g4 ] , [ N f4 ]  Here I faced dilemma. If I take the knight then I will drop [ g5 ] pawn too.I did not want that
 [ K h1 ]  [ B e6 ] , [ Q c2 ]  I cnt say that this is my favourate position and I wnt recomend it but my mind brought me to this situation and will have to find a way out.
 [ B x h4 ] , [ a4 ]  Consequently I am planning to promote a pawn. Sometimes you can turn a loss into a win by promoting a pawn but I am not going to be successful as we will see shortly. Believe it or not I lost a game in a winning position when the opponent promoted and vica versa.
 [ N e2 ]  [ Q f3 ]  [ R d1 ]  [ R x d1 + ]  [ Q x d1 ]  [ R d8 ]  [ Q c2 ]  [ K h8 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ B h4 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ Q x e3 + ]  [ N e2 ] , [ Q x f2 # ]  
 [ N c3 ] , [ B b4 ]  I know this is not the best place for my bishop but I wannted to prevent 5.[ d3 ] with 5....ed3: 6.Bd3: Bc3: and a double pawn
 [ N f6 ] , [ O-O ]  I note that White castles early in the game.
 [ N x c4 ]  [ K x c4 ] , [ R g4 + ]  Black has an advantage here as White's pawn is as good as dead and Black's pawns are more maneuverable not to mention more in number.
 [ g x h4 ] , [ N d6 ]  relising the king couldn't stop it he tried the knight but that was doomed from the start
 [ e5 ] , [ N f3 ]  I put pressure on the [ e5 ] pawn. I hope to take it here shortly.
 [ B g6 ] , [ b4 ]  and gains space also
 [ a x b5 ]  [ R f7 ]  [ R c4 + ] , [ R f4 ]  Again offering the exchange of Rooks which would win me the game immediately.
 [ K b4 ]  [ d3 ]  [ K c3 ] , [ d2 ]  clearly the pawn is lost so I wanted the black king as far away as possible
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ f6 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ f x e5 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ h6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ a6 ] , [ B e3 ]  at this point i've developed all 4 minor pieces and black's are still all on his back rank....
 [ R c2 c3 ]  [ R h8 ]  [ K e2 ] , [ R h2 ]  40. ..... [ R h2 ] - suddenly a black attack from nowhere.
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ a6 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ e6 ]  [ f4 ] , [ Q b6 ]  Sicilian: poisoned pawn - Kasparov's favourite as black.
 [ Q x c3 ]  [ B x f5 ]  [ B x f5 ] , [ R x f5 ]  I would assess this as round about equal but with a very slight edge for black due to effectiveness of his knight in comparison to the bishop which is hemmed in by the pawns.
 [ c x d4 ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ N c4 ]  [ B x g2 ]  [ B x g2 ] , [ R x g2 ]  The position has simplified and reevaluation is in order. Black is a pawn up but it's a doubled one so that's irrelevant. The Black Rook is more active than its counterpart also the Black King is a little safer than White's. I also have a passed central pawn which is only 3 squares away from queening. Black is threatening to centralize the Queen with [ Q d5 ] so White has to act against it.
 [ N e6 ] , [ R a d1 ]  Step 1 accomplished.
 [ O-O ]  [ O-O ] , [ b5 ]  17. [ b5 ] - I decide to keep my b pawn secure in a chain.
 [ g x f3 ]  [ Q x f3 ]  [ B h3 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ Q d7 ]  [ Q c3 ]  [ O-O-O ]  [ f3 ]  [ b6 ]  [ d3 ]  [ f5 ]  [ B g5 ] , [ f4 ]  14. f4! Black aims to sacrafice the exchange inorder to push the pawn not only to open the kingside but to block off whites bishop from returning to [ e3 ] when ...[ B c3 ] would lead to mate.
 [ R d e1 ] , [ R d3 ]  ! now Rd3! is possible leaving the bishop "en prise" as white doesn't have the check on the a1-[ h8 ] diagonal any more
 [ Q g5 ] , [ N f3 ]  wasted repeat
 [ a2 ]  [ Q g4 + ]  [ K a3 ] , [ Q x e6 ]  I can actually afford to allow the Black pawn to Queen...
 [ Q x d4 ]  [ B g7 ] , [ B x f7 + ]  White's "bad trade" is only slightly improved by breaking black's castle.
 [ R a d8 ]  [ g5 ]  [ N e8 ] , [ B e6 + ]  With Marco's position bottled up and a powerful wedge at [ K6 ] Alapin proceeds to tighten the screws.
 [ c5 ] , [ N d7 ]  Capturing on [ c5 ] with either pawn just ends up with black having doubled and isolated pawns on the c-file. As played whichever way white captures and now he must capture black can recapture with the backward c-pawn and avoid doubling or isolating any pawns.
 [ N b5 ] , [ B b4 + ]  ...[ d6 ] was also possible but black prefers his bishop on the a7-[ g1 ] diagonal than merely backing up the [ f6 ] knight.
 [ B d3 ] , [ N g4 ]  This time I thought I could as I wasn't worried about the N. But then I did homework asking myself why that N moved since first why is the most important and common question ask. Second for that reason it's theory which is very important. This is where I realize that Bert is threatening through a combo. And it's a very similar position to a quiz that Susan gave me with the same lecture which for a change not only did I get correct but for the right reason. Therefore he threatens 10...[ B x h2 ] and if 11.Nxh2?? he mates with 11...[ Q x h2 # ] So the only other option would be 11.[ K h1 ] which not only loses a pawn but the K is exposed. As a result he'd have a noticeable and I believe a winning advantage from that point which I cannot allow.
 [ e x d5 ] , [ N x d5 ]  Exchanging in the center.
 [ O-O ] , [ O-O ]  i am late in developing and i have no plan.
 [ B c6 ]  [ B x c6 ]  [ R x c6 ]  [ B x e7 ]  [ R x e7 ]  [ R d c1 ]  [ R b6 ] , [ a4 ]  To keep closed the lines.
 [ h6 ] , [ N x e6 ]  Even here instead of going after the pawn it may have been best to rid black of his his bishop. After 15. [ N x d6 ] [ Q x d6 ] 16.[ N e4 ] white seems to keeping thins together. A computer may disagree with my analysis however computers don't really understand these positions. Having said that 16...[ Q e4 + ] 17.[ K h1 ] [ g5 ] does give black very annoying unitive which is not something that white wants to allow so maybe this is alright
 [ Q h6 ]  [ R a2 ]  [ h4 ] , [ N d4 ]  Finally forcing her to exchange to relieve myself of the pressure
 [ Q x b3 + ]  [ a x b3 ]  [ e x f5 ] , [ N f4 ]  another effective move capturing the un protected knight on [ f4 ] will lead to losing Rook for example 28...Nxf4.29.Qh8+Ke7.30.Qxa8......
 [ N e7 + ]  [ K b7 ]  [ h4 ]  [ R x g3 ]  [ N x f5 ]  [ R g2 ]  [ R d7 ]  [ K c6 ] , [ R h7 ]  starting to make tempi work for me in terms of material however black now gets to take d file and strengthen his rooks position.
 [ B a4 ]  [ c6 ]  [ N e3 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ O-O ]  [ R e8 ]  [ B c2 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ f3 ]  [ g6 ] , [ b3 ]  Looking to get the dsb on the A3-[ f8 ] diagonal though the potential pin from [ B b2 ] is tempting too
 [ d x c4 ]  [ K x g3 ]  [ K d5 ]  [ R a7 ]  [ c3 ]  [ R c7 ]  [ K d4 ] , [ R d7 + ]  Realizing that there was no sound way to stop the passed pawn Botvinnik resigned. Following Tal's line of thought is like a roller coaster on black and white squares - so many moves are overlaid with deep traps and subtle forces so unpredictable that Botvinnik had little hope but to succumb in the end. The 1960 World Championship went to the young Latvian by a score of 12.5 to 8.5.
 [ N f6 ] , [ d3 ]  Why? Why not 3. d4. Or Nf3. Not bad but weak.
 [ b6 ]  [ g4 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ h4 ]  Continuing my pawn storm
 [ R e1 + ]  [ K d5 ] , [ R e7 ]  having secured the back white tries to clear way for h pawn.
 [ N c3 ] , [ B g7 ]  I complete the classic King's Indian opening putting my bishop of g7.
 [ R x e3 ] , [ Q g4 ]  now exd is forbidden of course...
 [ B e6 ]  [ B x e6 ]  [ Q x e6 ] , [ b4 ]  12. [ b4 ] - an expansion on the queenside after an exchange of light square bishops.
 [ K h8 ]  [ N x f5 ]  [ g6 ]  [ N e7 ]  [ R a e8 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ c6 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ R e6 ] , [ Q h4 ]  Threatening mate and also protecting the knight.
 [ e5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ g3 ]  The Bremen variation which is again my preferred line
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ] , [ f4 ]  we have to pick a bone with this: the Grand Prix Attack...
 [ c2 ]  [ R c8 ]  [ K x c8 ]  [ g8 = Q + ]  [ K b7 ] , [ Q h7 + ]  Black resigns what was a very hard fought game
 [ B e6 ]  [ Q c3 ]  [ B f6 ]  [ h6 ] , [ g6 ]  And I think black's position will be fine. Of course I will have to watch the long diagonal now that white has attained a thorn pawn -- his only achievement thus far.
 [ K g8 ] , [ Q g7 # ]  I hope you enjoyed the game and/or found the analysis informative. Comments are most welcome.
 [ R e8 ] , [ Q x g7 ]  A person said he thinks it is checkmate in 2 moves but Black can play many moves that make it not checkmate. I think [ B d7 ] is probably best. But Black decided that it was to hard to win with this position and he resigned. I hope you liked my game. Thank you Cenarius. You are a good player and you will win lots of games.
 [ N c1 ] , [ Q f6 ]  Threat Qxf3. If [ K e2 ] or [ B g2 ] then pawn [ c4 ] falls. I didn't like the look of [ K f2 ] [ B g4 ] and if I add further protection to [ f3 ] by [ B e2 ] or [ Q e2 ] then Black can take on c4. Desperate measures are called for! I didn't like giving up my good bishop on [ e3 ] (it is good as most of my pawns are on white squares so it can weave in and out of them while my bishop on [ f1 ] is bad as it is blocked by my pawns on white squares
 [ R e7 ]  [ h5 ]  [ R d2 ]  [ K h3 ] , [ R d1 ]  trying to annoy him with some checks but it does not work!
 [ B x c4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ g6 ]  [ Q f3 ]  [ B g7 ] , [ e5 ]  I have a good grip on the light squares particularly those in the centre so I wasn't too worried about this move it also allows [ N e4 ]  [ B f4 ] , [ c6 ]  I don't understand this move at all as it means blacks [ b8 ] knight can only move to [ a6 ] where it is no better off than it is now.
 [ N f3 ]  [ B g7 ] , [ b3 ]  Copy cat? After my move I see the capture of my knight doubling my pawns.
 [ Q f2 + ]  [ K d3 ]  [ N c5 + ]  [ K c3 ] , [ Q d4 # ]  Hope you enjoyed this quick game. Played in one day :)
 [ d4 ]  [ R e2 + ]  [ K d6 ]  [ K g2 ]  [ d5 ]  [ K f3 ]  [ K d7 ]  [ K e4 ]  [ d6 ]  [ K e5 ]  [ K e7 ]  [ K d5 + ]  [ K d7 ] , [ R e6 ]  Yes. But I am still not sure. Well played okima even if you lost. Just a couple of mistakes not more than me.
 [ N f6 ] , [ h3 ]  4. [ h3 ] - unusual continuation - probably to take me out of the database. I did see in the database however that somebody had played [ a3 ] and the suggested continuation was [ N x e4 ] with at least equality for black and then I could get to see what my opponent's endgame play was like! It didn't quite work out that way though!
 [ Q f7 ] , [ Q f6 ]  I bet that the pawn in [ f6 ] could be defended of which I am not sure.
 [ B d5 ]  [ K h7 ]  [ N g6 ] , [ K h6 ]  Opposition important to achieve the aim.
 [ g x f3 ] , [ Q d7 ]  The now-isolated h-pawn and the backward f-pawn are Black's new targets. The next several moves are designed to lock White's pieces in the corner where they'll be least effective. Watch how each move forces White's replies; pulling the Rook away from the center and removing the defense of [ d4 ] for a powerful check from the DSB.
 [ e4 ] , [ c5 ]  I tried diffrent variations against [ e4 ] but nothing has proven to be better than sicilian.
 [ Q d1 ] , [ d x c4 ]  I play this move to development the ligth bishop to [ [ f5 ] ] (seeing c2) and protect the knitgh with the queen. Two ideas and a only move must be strong. Jugué este movimiento con la idea de colocar el alfil de casillas claras en [ [ f5 ] ] atacando [ c2 ] junto con el caballo y defender mi caballo con la dama. Dos ideas en una sola jugada debe de ser buena.
 [ N x c3 ]  [ B x d1 ]  [ R x e8 + ]  [ Q x e8 ]  [ R x d1 ]  [ b x c5 ] , [ B x c5 ]  The dust settles. Material equality is re-established. It's hardly a queen sacrifice when you're a piece up and you're getting another rook and a passed pawn for it but the position is still highly dynamic and difficult for both sides. For White the obvious plan is to try to push the d-pawn supporting it with his pieces which can chase Black's queen away. For Black the plan is less obvious. TIMEOUT. What is Black's plan in this position?
 [ B x f6 ] , [ Q e8 ]  10....Qe8. Now everything goes downhill.
 [ Q c2 ]  [ N x d2 ] , [ K x d2 ]  Maybe castling is not such a big deal now but i was glad to see that night on [ e4 ] back in the dug-out.
 [ a5 ]  [ a3 ]  [ b5 ]  [ B a2 ]  [ K f7 ]  [ R x f5 + ]  [ K g6 ]  [ R g5 + ]  [ K f6 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ e5 ]  [ d5 ]  [ c5 ]  [ R d1 ]  [ c4 ]  [ c3 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ B b1 ]  [ e4 ] , [ B d4 + ]  This happens when I have no good day. The war is over white can go home with resign...
 [ N x a8 ]  [ N x f2 ]  [ N c7 ] , [ N x h1 ]  This will at least slow him down a little.
 [ N c6 ]  [ h6 ]  [ K d4 ]  [ R x g4 ]  [ K x d5 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ R f1 ]  [ f6 ]  [ N e7 + ] , [ K h8 ]  Black's king retreats instead of coming out. Perhaps he would otherwise have won...
 [ B e3 ]  [ g5 ]  [ f4 ]  [ b6 ] , [ f x g5 ]  Now Black must cede the two bishops and further simplify into an endgame stripping him of any sort of counterplay. The knight is given his outpost and Black's pawn is fixd on a light square.
 [ B d6 ]  [ B x h8 ] , [ R f8 ]  And now there was the possibility to go into a safely won endgame which I gladly took. (Otherwise he can play 24...[ R f1 + ] 25...Rxa1.)
 [ h4 ]  [ h5 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ c5 ]  [ K c4 ]  [ K c6 ]  [ B f2 ]  [ f5 ]  [ e x f5 ]  [ g x f5 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ d5 + ]  [ K d3 ]  [ d4 ]  [ B d2 ]  [ K d5 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ e4 + ]  [ K d2 ]  [ e3 + ] , [ K c2 ]  As the King is driven away the Bishop can safely be exchanged for the Knight. Better might be 43. [ B x e3 ] but White would still be in the worse position.
 [ B e3 ] , [ b6 ]  Supporting the pawn.
 [ K b8 ] , [ B b3 ]  Protecting the pawn and tempting black with another trade.
 [ Q b4 + ]  [ K d5 ] , [ Q c5 # ]  Mate. I think castling kingside and losing the queen were two of Black's big mistakes in this game. The Queen is self-explanatory but in move 21 when black castle kingside rather than queenside it put the king within range of my queen to check him. From move 22 onward it's a string of my checking the king in various ways to either gain a piece or force his move. If Black had castled queenside instead on move 21 I wouldn't have been able to force a mate so easily.
 [ R x d6 ]  [ R d2 ]  [ R f d8 ]  [ R x e2 ]  [ h6 ]  [ R f e1 ]  [ B x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ R d6 x d4 ]  [ R e2 e7 ]  [ R d4 d3 ] , [ Q x f7 + ]  
 [ Q e7 + ]  [ K f5 ]  [ Q f8 + ] , [ K e4 ]  Once again the possibility of a cross-check means that Black is out of checks and this time he cannot prevent the pawn advancing further.
 [ h6 ]  [ R d1 ]  [ R x d1 ] , [ N x d1 ]  I am down a pawn in material but my structure is completely shattered.
 [ B d3 ]  [ R f e8 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ B x d4 ]  [ B x d7 ]  [ B x f2 + ]  [ K x f2 ] , [ R e5 ]  28. ..... [ R e5 ] - after another plethora of exchanges I am still endeavouring to keep my pawns intact. In retrospect I should have got in [ h4 ] asap (I would have avoided this pawn becoming backward later on) and tried to force an exchange of one of my kingside pawns for the [ g3 ] pawn. If I had succeeded in doing that then my drawing chances would have increased tenfold.
 [ K h7 ] , [ Q b5 ]  ... and opts to simply take the [ b2 ] pawn off the board!
 [ a3 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ Q d3 ] , [ f6 ]  I have to open up some possibilities here
 [ B b2 ] , [ h4 ]  The storm descends...
 [ d5 ]  [ K e5 ]  [ d6 ] , [ K x d6 ]  45. ...... [ K x d6 ] - munch!
 [ a x b5 ]  [ B x b5 ] , [ Q a5 + ]  Always be aware of open diagonal pointing towards the king. I took advantage of the open diagonal. He is losing the bishop for nothing.
 [ Q x h1 + ]  [ K e2 ]  [ f x e6 ] , [ b3 ]  He chose this candidate because he wanted to fianchetto his DSB and this brings him one step closer to doing that.
 [ O-O ] , [ Q c7 ]  I don't fully understand this move. It defends both his pawns and indirectly aims at the [ h2 ] square but it doesn't feel that strong.
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ d6 ]  This is the mainline Open Sicilian.
 [ N f4 ] , [ B f1 ]  46. [ B f1 ] - this looks to be a reasonable move activate Fou Leblanc. This move proves to be a mistake according to GA. I should have moved this prelate to [ h1 ] instead.
 [ a3 ] , [ B x c3 + ]  But black has to defend. I hesitated again to trade for if it gives white a double pawn which compensate a bit the two pawns advance it opens the b file.
 [ d x e5 ] , [ N g4 ]  Black is sacrificing a pawn (and possibly his own kingside structure) in return for development lines and the dissolution of White's center.
 [ B x d6 ] , [ R x d6 ]  I preferred this to [ c x d6 ] due to Re-[ e7 ] which looked pretty nasty
 [ c5 ] , [ O-O-O ]  Queen side castle although I think it would have been better to do king side castle because its more protected.
 [ R g1 ] , [ K c5 ]  ?! (Dubious) This allows white to play [ d4 ] and finally escape. Prior to this I was about to offer a draw but was still trying to see if I could force something.
 [ b x c5 ] , [ B x c5 ]  I end up with my black bishop at c5. Didn't understand why white moved rook to [ e1 ] maybe was unrelated to my move?
 [ B f5 ] , [ Q g3 ]  Defending the Pawn for the moment.
 [ B x a3 ]  [ b x a3 ] , [ b2 ]  This is where I start to become a little anxious yet I'm also thinking about what to do as opposed to letting my nerves take over.
 [ K f8 ] , [ g3 ]  Probably white did find the right way: a kinside pawn storm.
 [ N f3 ]  [ R e8 + ] , [ K f1 ]  White prefers not to interposie the bishop hoping to castle by hand instead.
 [ B f5 ] , [ B d3 ]  Hoping to exchange light squared bishops with developing momentum.
 [ N x d4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ B b5 + ]  [ B d7 ]  [ B x d7 + ]  [ N x d7 ]  [ N f5 ]  [ g6 ]  [ N e3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ N e7 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N b c3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B g5 ]  [ N f x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ f6 ]  [ N x e7 + ]  [ Q x e7 ]  [ Q d5 + ]  [ K h8 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ f5 ]  [ R f d1 ]  [ R a d8 ] , [ f4 ]  What was wrong with BxPa7?
 [ R a c8 ] , [ R f e1 ]  ptitroque: 20... [ B [ [ e5 ] ] ] We are cramped. The immediate threat is 20. [ B x d4 ] for our [ [ e5 ] ] pawn is pinned. I do not see any counterthreat for us. I believe that we should play 20... [ B [ [ e5 ] ] ] But maybe I've overlooked something. bluenoser: Be5? I don't believe our Bishop will go to [ [ e5 ] ] if my diagram is right. It could possibly go to [ c5 ] a_random_guy: 19...[ Q f8 ] Sure 19...[ Q f8 ] looks ugly but it does unpin our e pawn and it provides additionnal support to our [ c8 ] rook if they decide to pile on the c file.
 [ h4 ]  [ h6 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ b6 ]  [ B x f7 + ]  [ K d8 ] , [ B b3 ]  Clearing the way for K-[ f7 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ N f7 + ] , [ Q x f7 ]  Now that came as a major shock to me. It wasn't what I was expecting at all.
 [ N c2 ] , [ a6 ]  I dislike this move I don't feel it gains anything for Black allowing White a "move in hand" as it were. White already has the advantage of being first to move so this sort of delaying move just plays into his hands. I think I'd have looked at 8...[ N c6 ] 9.O-O [ B e6 ] 10.[ N e3 ] [ Q d7 ] 11.[ N e d5 ] [ B h3 ] which looks better.
 [ K b3 ]  [ Q e3 + ]  [ K a4 ] , [ B x b4 ]  And white finally resigns as his obvious hopes I'd blunder something away to a knight fork is no longer a possibility. I don't blame him for not resigning sooner considering the terrible blunder of mine on move 15. Laters everyone. ;)
 [ K f2 ] , [ h5 ]  The fans need to remember that Carlsen is in no pressure to win this match in 12 games. If the score is tied 6-6 (maybe 12 draws) then the players will have a playoff with rapid blitz etc. This will heavily favor Carlsen. So basically he has a big draw odd. So the pressure is on Caruana to win in regulation! It is clear that Carlsen cannot allow Black to play h4. That can be uncomfortable for White has he cannot move his [ h1 ] Rook. And if [ h3 ] then the [ g3 ] square becomes problematic.
 [ B d5 ] , [ N a5 ]  black tries to hold onto the material balance but I now have a past c-pawn so I go to exchange the queens
 [ B e3 ] , [ h5 ]  Leaves the king an escape route...but also weakens the column
 [ f x g6 ] , [ N g5 + ]  At this point I made a "conditional move" that showed the two mate in ones.
 [ K e3 ] , [ R f5 ]  25.[ K d4 ] is not possible because 25...Rf2___may 25.[ [ [ c4 ] ] ] is possible ?__25.[ [ [ c4 ] ] ] dxc 26.[ b5 ] (free 27.Rc1) [ a6 ] 27.[ b6 ] (27...[ a5 ] seems wrong because [ R [ a1 ] ] can threat [ [ [ c4 ] ] ] go back to [ a1 ] or the 4th rank. But difficult to visualize.
 [ Q b7 ] , [ R a c1 + ]  An intermezzo that gets the rook onto the open file with tempo
 [ N x g4 ] , [ B x h7 + ]  I figure I have lost the game and ruined the chance to play the line out well. Though I do not like it I make the sacrifice anyway more to just see what happens now. I know seeker2 is a slow and cautious player and being 3 points down now will not help me as I am not good enough to beat him but at the same time I have sort of given up on the game due to the simple pawn error.
 [ N x d5 ] , [ R e8 + ]  Here I knew no matter what I was going to have his N back always check it might be mate. :)
 [ f3 ] , [ B d6 ]  To centralise the king for an endgame.
 [ Q g1 ] , [ R g2 ]  here comes the joy. Looks like my queen is in the trap But it is not true He is about to loose the game.
 [ N c4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N x d6 ]  [ B x d6 ]  [ R a c8 ] , [ a x b5 ]  it is very clear now that the [ c6 ] pawn is very weak.
 [ N x c6 ]  [ b5 ] , [ N x d4 + ]  by far the best move if Ne7? then white goes [ N x e7 + ] winning the rook on c8.
 [ d6 ] , [ f3 ]  I'm not entirely sure how sound this move is my intention was to prevent something like [ B g4 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N g e2 ] , [ N b d7 ]  supports [ e5 ] but blocks in the white lsb which doesn't move for the whole game
 [ B x f6 + ] , [ K c7 ]  Now I was actually pawn up. Till now it was only a flamboyant attack. All that attack was only for a pawn? Well! Credit has to be given to black for defending well. But black king is on queen side and my bishops are on Kind side and his pawn structure is disturbed which was good for me. The way forward I felt was by advancing pawns. So I continued
 [ Q f3 + ]  [ K g8 ]  [ Q x d5 + ]  [ K h8 ] , [ B f4 ]  The piece is lost.
 [ B x b4 ]  [ Q x e4 + ]  [ B e2 ] , [ N f6 ]  ?? A fatal blunder but Black is under tremendous pressure.
 [ a3 ]  [ B x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ Q x b2 ]  [ N x c7 ] , [ R a c8 ]  The B's are off the board and a pair of Pawns fall as well.
 [ K c6 ] , [ B x g4 ]  I take the Knight
 [ Q x g6 + ]  [ K f8 ] , [ O-O-O ]  I castle because I realize that I need to bring my last arch piece to action as soon as possible...I plan to swing my rook on [ h1 ] as fast as ed allows me to.
 [ N b6 ]  [ K b1 ]  [ c6 ]  [ B h6 ] , [ K d7 ]  17. ........ [ K d7 ] - protecting the [ d6 ] pawn and preparing to castle queenside by hand but Chrisobee does not allow this!
 [ R e7 ] , [ R g1 ]  19... [ R e7 ] 20.[ R g1 ] and my rooks are in safe.
 [ O-O ] , [ B e2 ]  Safety of the kings.
 [ K h2 ] , [ Q x f6 ]  And my queen falls. i cringed! I admit at this point I nolonger had hopes of winning but I was seeing how I still had the ability to give my opponent some hard times I went on with the game.
 [ Q x a1 ]  [ B b2 ]  [ Q b1 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ Q x h1 ]  Now Black's Queen has been forced out of play.
 [ d x e5 ] , [ e6 ]  I took the [ e5 ] knight with my pawn at [ d4 ] and black moved his pawn to [ e6 ] allowing his DB access to the diagonal to a3. I now have my pawn at e5. Yesss
 [ N f6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B e7 ] , [ B b2 ]  A very poor developing move.. The bishop is staring at its own color pawn! It's not good here!
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ h6 ] , [ B x f6 ]  I do not like this move for him as it gets rid of his Bishop and it allows me to open up a path for my Bishop.
 [ K f8 ] , [ R g g1 ]  no way out. white will have no defense for 27. ...R8e2. resigns. Thank you to stalhandske for the game. commenters will please advise if there was a way out after 19. f3.
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ g6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ N b d2 ]  [ B g7 ] , [ e4 ]  Up to here a model. Now even if normally black avoids this move somehow it is good for white but the game follows an entire different path from the normal attack that takes place after [ d4 ] from black.
 [ Q d2 ]  [ N c7 ] , [ B h6 ]  Nobody said that I had to be subtle. Now 10. ... [ B x h6 ] 11.[ Q x h6 ] followed by h2-h4-[ h5 ] is a standard Yugoslav style attack from the Sicilian Dragon but without the open c-file to allow Black counter-play.
 [ B x h6 ]  [ K x h6 ]  [ g4 ] , [ K h7 ]  I didn't think I could allow 18. [ g5 + ] when my Queen's discovered attack on the [ R h3 ] would have been useless though it would of course still have discouraged 19. gxf6.
 [ B c4 ]  [ c6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ d3 ]  Opening a line for the QB.
 [ K f7 ] , [ Q x g6 + ]  Driving his king to a dark square so that my bishop on [ c1 ] can join in.
 [ N c6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ N f6 ]  The position is completely symetrical and both sides has two pieces developed.
 [ e5 ] , [ e4 ]  I had to play [ e4 ] before my opponent played e4. That way I could play [ N f3 ] on my next move without the pawn threatening my knight with exf3.
 [ Q g2 ]  [ Q d7 ] , [ N f3 ]  get my pieces out as I rebuild my attack
 [ B c5 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ N f8 ]  [ f5 ]  [ B x d4 ]  [ B x d4 ] , [ c5 ]  A loss of material is forced after say 21. [ B e3 ] [ c4 ] forking White's queen and bishop.
 [ Q d5 + ]  [ K f6 ] , [ Q f5 # ]  He does not. A brilliant attacking game by White and a horrible game by Tarrasch who just 4 years before had played a match for the World Championship!
 [ K g7 ]  [ f6 + ]  [ K g8 ]  [ R d8 + ]  [ K h7 ]  [ K e3 ]  [ N f e6 ]  [ R c8 ]  [ R x a2 ]  [ f7 ]  [ K g7 ]  [ N d6 ]  [ R a3 + ]  [ K d2 ]  [ N b3 + ] , [ K c2 ]  classic: the lone King attacking two pieces...
 [ N b5 ]  [ Q e5 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ Q h5 ] , [ Q x h5 ]  Nice and clean. I like.
 [ B d4 ]  [ Q x e2 + ]  [ K x e2 ] , [ N a6 ]  ??
 [ R a d1 ] , [ N d7 ]  Now it was a risk but I wanted to get out of passivities and take the chance to unravel my position.
 [ R e7 ]  [ R e d1 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ g4 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ B b3 ]  [ f6 ]  [ a4 ] , [ R h e8 ]  With a view to swapping rooks - the plan is to sacrifice the pawn on [ d4 ] for an easier position.
 [ Q b6 ]  [ e4 ] , [ N g4 ]  This is the point. After 17. [ B e1 ] [ B f6 ] Black has a very good middle-game. Whites next two moves doesn´t make much sense but leads to what could have been a beautiful finish.
 [ R x a7 ]  [ R c2 ]  [ Q a1 ] , [ Q x b5 ]  from here Black is winning...
 [ Q d2 ] , [ B x f3 ]  White plays Qd2. Black captures White Knight.
 [ K h2 ] , [ R c6 ]  Rc6. I thought it was better to [ c6 ] instead of [ c4 ] because it could protect the king side as well.
 [ N x c3 ]  [ Q x c3 + ] , [ Q d3 ]  forced
 [ f4 ]  [ h6 ]  [ f3 ]  [ h7 ]  [ f2 ]  [ h8 = R + ]  [ N e8 ] , [ R h x e8 # ]  
 [ Q d2 ] , [ Q x e2 + ]  another 'crack pipe' moment from me... no real need to swap pieces here. Probably should have kept my queen as i was in a better position. Must have got bored or something. Bad move by me
 [ c x d4 ] , [ c x d4 ]  I have stronger central control and a lead in development.
 [ e3 ] , [ c6 ]  now both he and i have a good pawn chain
 [ Q e6 ] , [ g3 ]  Tunnel opened the game is without interest.
 [ B x d7 + ]  [ B x d7 ]  [ B x e7 ]  [ N x e7 ]  [ h3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N f3 ] , [ f5 ]  Black wants to contest the center with the extra pawn.
 [ e x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ] , [ g6 ]  preparing [ B g7 ] leading to a rather strong bishop for black
 [ R c5 ] , [ R c2 ]  a new day a new perspective. I needed to get the B and Rook off the same file ....offering again a Rook swap.
 [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ B e7 ] , [ B b3 ]  Removing the possibility of [ N x e4 ] followed by [ d5 ] also a kind of waiting move that means black won't gain a tempo with a later [ N e5 ]  [ O-O ] , [ f3 ]  Preparing [ Q d2 ] and preventing [ N g4 ] also supporting a later king-side pawn advance in anticipation of opposite side castling.
 [ B d4 ]  [ R c2 ]  [ B x e3 + ] , [ K x e3 ]  36. [ K x e3 ] - bishop trade.
 [ N f5 ] , [ N e2 ]  The knight on the has a nice and cosy home on [ f5 ] although [ e4 ] would probably be a bit nicer
 [ Q a2 ]  [ a4 ]  [ N e2 ] , [ N b6 ]  Now both two Black Knights are ready to invade the White field.
 [ B d7 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ e6 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ B x f6 ] , [ N e3 ]  I was happy to leave black with two cramped bishops rather than lose one of my best placed knights.
 [ K e1 ] , [ K e3 ]  Seemed to be the quickest way. ...[ K x c4 ] works too.
 [ h x g5 ] , [ B x g5 ]  this bishop is immune because of the mate thread on f7.
 [ R d7 ]  [ h6 ]  [ g5 ]  [ K g3 ]  [ K g6 ]  [ R h1 ]  [ B h5 ]  [ R g8 + ]  [ K x h6 ]  [ R h8 + ] , [ R h7 ]  losing another piece and the game is lost now...
 [ N f5 ]  [ R f7 ]  [ d4 ] , [ R x f6 ]  Now I'm only down four
 [ O-O ] , [ R a c8 ]  a bit of a standard move: White could not be bothered...
 [ R e3 ] , [ R g7 ]  
 [ c6 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B x e7 ]  [ N x e7 ] , [ Q h5 ]  ! Morphy plays his queen to its most aggressive post with a direct menace to Black's castled position. The more I study this position the more dangerous the more and more threatening White's formation appears.
 [ B f5 ] , [ N e2 ]  Not the strongest move
 [ e x d4 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ R g6 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ R x f6 ]  [ R x e6 ]  [ R x e6 ]  [ Q x f2 ]  [ R h6 + ]  [ K g7 ]  [ R x h5 ] , [ Q x f3 ]  a other bunder
 [ Q x f6 ]  [ g x f6 ]  [ N e2 ] , [ R b1 ]  I carry on for a few moves
 [ h3 ]  [ R c8 ]  [ R b1 ]  [ B b4 ]  [ R e1 ] , [ O-O ]  Now [ R e3 ] removes an annoying pin.
 [ f3 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ R x h5 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ R h1 ]  [ Q e8 ]  [ O-O-O ]  [ N h5 ]  [ B f1 ] , [ N g3 ]  ! And here we are - the invasion square! Pick an outpost and use it well Ali babe!
 [ d x e5 ]  [ N x e5 ] , [ B d6 ]  On 13... O-O-O 14 Q-[ K2 ] K-[ N1 ] 15 N-[ N3 ] [intending N-[ R5 ] ch] is murderous.
 [ B b6 ] , [ B d7 ]  [%clk 0:04:48] ...and now my B is danger with no compensation. Black has developed very finely thank to my ugly idea.
 [ K e7 ] , [ R a7 ]  Now two pieces attacking blacks knight.
 [ N c6 ] , [ N e5 ]  I wanted to exert pressure on his N. An exchange would still leave me the opportunity of capturing his B on b4.
 [ e4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ d4 ] , [ d5 ]  French defense. I have been preparing using Roman D's new training vid about a system vs the french.
 [ R g7 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ K c3 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ R e7 ]  [ B g8 ]  [ R c7 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ K b4 ] , [ B g8 ]  Lesson No. 3 - White offered a draw on this move his second draw offer of the game. Am up a major-minor and am thinking I can win. I declined I want to watch this game also!
 [ Q d8 ]  [ f4 ]  [ e x f4 ]  [ Q x f4 ]  [ Q d7 ]  [ Q f5 ]  [ R c d8 ]  [ R a3 ]  [ Q a7 ] , [ R c3 ]  Here's my find: Instead of this [ R c3 ] why not [ N f6 ] ? Black is forced to take the knight to avoid mate by Qxh7#. He can either take with the pawn which leads to a quick win for white or he can take with be bishop which leaves white with good advantage. Here are the options: 25.[ N f6 ] [ g x f6 ] 26.[ g x f6 ] [ K h8 ] 27.[ Q g5 ] [ R g8 ] 28.[ f x e7 ] and white is winning. Or 25.[ N f6 ] [ B x f6 ] 26.[ g x f6 ] [ g6 ] (not gxf6?) 27.[ Q g5 ] which I think wins quicker than what Fischer played. What do you guys think??
 [ Q e5 ]  [ B x g7 ] , [ Q x g7 ]  ?! In post game analysis my opponent shared his thoughts with me that he was anticipating a pawn storm and wanted to back up his pawn defenders with his strongest piece. While a valid concern IMHO it seemed a little slow and was just begging to be punished. I'm really digging my position now as I'm ripped and ready with great activity while my opponent stills lags in development.
 [ Q g7 ]  [ B c3 ]  [ B f6 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ Q x f6 ]  [ R x h6 ]  [ g x f5 ]  [ R x f6 ]  [ R x h2 ]  [ e7 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ R f8 ]  [ R h8 ]  [ R x e8 + ]  [ R x e8 ]  [ g x f5 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ B f7 ]  [ R h8 ]  [ e8 = Q + ]  [ R x e8 ]  [ B x e8 ]  [ N a b8 ]  [ B x d7 ]  [ N x d7 ] , [ R e1 ]  
 [ f x e4 ]  [ d x e4 ] , [ R x e2 + ]  ?? But this was also a blunder and just about anything else was better then this move. As Erika will get the Rook in return which will leave her the equivalent to a pawn up.
 [ K g1 ]  [ B x f3 + ]  [ K f1 ] , [ B g2 + ]  The "quiet" 22...Rg2! would have won more quickly: 23.[ Q d3 ] [ R x f2 ] 24.[ K g1 ] [ R g2 ] 25.[ K h1 ] [ R g1 ]  [ K g1 ]  [ B h3 + ]  [ K h1 ] , [ B x f2 ]  Black now threatens 25...[ B g2 # ] mate
 [ B h5 ]  [ Q a3 ]  [ Q x a3 ]  [ b x a3 ]  [ B x f7 ]  [ B x f7 + ] , [ K x f7 ]  20. ..... [ K x f7 ] - well so I have my material parity and perhaps a slight positional edge as white's queenside pawns were shattered by the queen trade before the white knight and the white lsb's disappearance from the board. I still feel a bit sick about this missed opportunity.
 [ d4 ] , [ d5 ]  Now white has several options.. The most popular (according to GK Game DB) is 3. [ N c3 ] which is leading to the Classical Variation. Second popular is 3. [ e5 ] the Advance Variation. Third is 3. [ e x d5 ] the Exchange Variation.
 [ B f1 ] , [ N g3 ]  Attack on bishop.
 [ B x d2 + ]  [ Q x d2 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B g2 ] , [ d5 ]  Before playing this move Black must have been waiting for the fianchetto development of White's LSB which moves that piece's line of sight off of c4. However Black might have been better served to play it sooner.
 [ N f3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ O-O ] , [ N e7 ]  we continued in the classical way
 [ R e x d1 ]  [ b5 ]  [ d6 ]  [ c6 ] , [ R d e1 ]  White must not let Black control the open file else Black will have a big advantage.
 [ B x c3 ] , [ b x c3 ]  black has now a well-structured pawn structure. White has a queen-side in a pity condition. At last there has been no king-side attack from black neither queen-side attack from white but this is all because white has chosen this atypical middle-game.
 [ B f8 ] , [ B f3 ]  Andy throws in the towel in light of 28. ...[ K g6 ] 29. [ R x g4 + ] [ K x f5 ] 30. Kxh2. He was never able to get on track after 3. ...[ N g e7 ] and my minor pieces buzzing around his undefended king made things too hectic for him. Being the competitive sort he returned soon after seeking revenge. Check out how our rematch fared.
 [ K h7 ] , [ R d6 ]  And after neither of us has succeeded in winning a break point this good move forces the exchange of minor pieces (at least I can't see that Black has much alternative) thus taking the match to a tie-break.
 [ B d3 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ B e3 ] , [ N f d7 ]  8. ...... [ N f d7 ] - opening up the f column for a possible Hoover Dam busting f5. Yup it does get busted and the only thing that is gonna get sucked up Freddy's Numatic Henry HVR200 (http://www.electrocentreltd.com/viewproduct.asp?pid=5140) is King Henry!
 [ B x f6 ] , [ g x f6 ]  !? Much better was to use the Queen by recapturing with 8...Qxf6. As this move not only limits the mobility of her [ B f8 ] and Queen but it also destroys her King side pawn structure which leaves her King vulnerable to exposure. In a lecture Susan mentioned that when you have the option of how to capture you're much better off taking back with a piece or the Queen then the pawn in front of where you castle short. As this is also where the doubled pawns can become quite dangerous for the reason that I mentioned in my second sentence.
 [ Q b6 ]  [ B b2 ]  [ Q h6 ]  [ h4 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ N g5 ]  [ f6 ] , [ N f7 ]  This is it. It doesn't win or anything - or shouldn't; it just makes board-life a little more interesting. On 20. ...[ Q g6 ] I would have simply played 21. [ N d6 ] and then exchanged on f5.
 [ Q x g7 ] , [ R g8 ]  unpleasant position for black's queen takes control of semi-open file
 [ K f8 ] , [ N x b7 ]  White now clips a pawn and attacks the queen but note that White's queen now attacks the pawn on [ c5 ] and capturing it will place Black's king in check. Black can't save the queen and defend the pawn at the same time.
 [ e x f4 ] , [ R f7 ]  Here my opponent resigned.
 [ Q x c7 + ]  [ K d4 ] , [ Q d6 + ]  31. [ Q d6 + ] - I notice after hitting the submit button that I could have delivered mate here by Qe5. However mate will come next move because all black can do is block the check with his bishop. Glenda will swipe it next move and deliver the kiss of death which she duly does. A welcome win. I hope you have all had a good read. Be back soon. Bye for now - Joanne
 [ B b2 ] , [ N e4 ]  If 12. [ N x e4 ] [ d x e4 ] with fork attack between th f knight and the d bishop.
 [ g x h7 ]  [ Q x g5 ]  [ h8 = Q ] , [ N x f3 + ]  But getting some back...White's g pawn is pinned.
 [ R a5 ]  [ f4 ]  [ g x f4 ]  [ g x f4 ]  [ R d5 ] , [ R f3 ]  Now here is a point where I have to disagree with the computer analysis after [ R x a4 ] [ R d4 + ] [ K b3 ] [ R x a4 ] [ K x a4 ] [ K c5 ] I have no way to stop him from dropping my [ f4 ] pawn and I'm going to lose. I figured keeping the rooks on the board was my only chance for a draw.
 [ R x e8 + ]  [ Q x e8 ] , [ h3 ]  Covering the back rank mate.
 [ N a6 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N h4 ]  [ B e6 ] , [ h2 ]  White has succeeded in getting in trouble again; 52. [ c6 ] or better 51. [ B x g2 ] were still easily winning...
 [ c3 ]  [ d x c3 ]  [ N x c3 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ Q f4 ]  [ B g4 ] , [ N e6 ]  Losing another piece. There was no necessity to panic and play such a move he could have just moved the rook.
 [ K e6 ]  [ f5 + ]  [ K d6 ] , [ R e4 ]  Played this to get the king out into the open and start sending him toward the edge
 [ K x f1 ]  [ R x f8 + ] , [ R f2 ]  This rook manoeuvre turns out to be pivotal in Rybka's game...
 [ B f4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ B h6 ]  [ R e7 ]  [ R x e7 ]  [ N x e7 ]  [ R d7 ] , [ N c6 ]  27. ....... [ N c6 ] - I manage to avoid the dreaded double rooks on my second rank but I will very soon be in a zugzwang next move in fact.
 [ R c2 ] , [ R x c2 ]  swapping off an attacker for a defender seems an obvious move here. If I had allowed White to take on [ b2 ] I didn't have any pieces ready to defend the pawn there since the rook is prevented from moving to [ b7 ] by the [ N c5 ]  [ N x c2 ] , [ R c6 ]  preparing to occupy the b-file
 [ R a d1 ] , [ R e7 ]  To meet the threat of [ R d7 ] followed by R1[ d6 # ]  [ b5 ]  [ a x b6 ]  [ e ]  [ p ]  [ K x b6 ] , [ N x c5 ]  Not 32.Rxc5? Rxe4!
 [ e7 ]  [ K f6 ]  [ d6 ]  [ a6 ]  [ R d8 ]  [ K f7 ] , [ R f8 + ]  Great game again.. It had a draw written all over it again - I'm sure you had me stronger than I felt - and maybe I was missing the killer moves that you were seeing at various points? the knight sacrifice was inspired and really got you right back into it ... cheers for another good one :-)
 [ N c6 ]  [ N b d2 ] , [ B d6 ]  note that push [ e4 ] doesn't work because of 9...[ B x f4 ]  [ B g3 ]  [ B x d3 ]  [ Q x d3 ]  [ B x g3 ] , [ h x g3 ]  I knew it was a draw anyway so i exchanged the bishops and we agreed to a draw.
 [ R x e3 ]  [ f x e3 ] , [ Q f2 + ]  and now it is all over...
 [ Q d3 ]  [ N x e3 ] , [ Q x e3 ]  9. [ Q x e3 ] - and now there is a trade off. Klaus has a choice kingside or queenside castling - he defers it until move 14.
 [ B d5 ] , [ R b8 ]  Getting out of harm's way.
 [ d5 ]  [ g3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B g2 ]  [ e5 ]  [ d3 ] , [ h6 ]  I found this move immediately odd - developing the minor pieces seems much more logical. I see Black's idea though: he wants to cut off my knight from the flight square [ [ g5 ] ] in the case of a future [ e4 ] push and to take away the [ [ g5 ] ] square from my dark-squared bishop. But then again the dark squared bishop is not used early in the game in the King's Indian Attack.
 [ B x f6 ] , [ R f7 x f6 ]  now i better take that pawn soon
 [ R b8 ] , [ R d7 ]  ?! [It is clear that black wants to play [ R b5 ] leaving the eight rank open so why waste time on this manoeuvre?] [It would have been more purposeful to activate the king for example 39.Kb2]
 [ K d5 ]  [ K e2 ] , [ K c4 ]  Now Black king reaches a very comfortable position. The only White pieces which can move are the king and a blockaded bishop.
 [ R d7 ]  [ R x d7 ]  [ Q x d7 ] , [ R d1 ]  Now white controls the d file.
 [ Q x a1 ]  [ N f6 + ] , [ K h8 ]  Better was 17... [ Q x f6 ]  [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B c4 ] , [ h6 ]  A waste of precious time. This will prove costly.
 [ N f3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ g3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ B g2 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ c6 ]  [ d3 ]  [ f5 ] , [ c4 ]  Black plays a Stonewall White - forward in the development of his pieces - immediately attacks the black pawn center.
 [ h4 ]  [ Q e7 ] , [ Q e5 + ]  And I'm beginning to see the K side attack plan since Ju cannot bring her monarch to the 6th rank which means that it's starting to become confined to one corner as I've mentioned in some of Erika's annotations by using a little trigonometry and line of symmetry with the B+N endgame checkmate.
 [ d5 ]  [ e5 ] , [ B b5 + ]  I don't know why white doesn't play [ d x e6 ] e.p. very often here. [ N c3 ] is the most common response to [ e5 ] but [ B b5 + ] is good too.
 [ R e1 ] , [ O-O ]  Okay time to push the pawn. But first we've got to move that bishop further back. You always have to really consider what you're doing to your kingside when you push another pawn to drive back the bishop. Will it hurt you if he sacrifices the bishop for the pawn (or two)? Have you opened yourself up too much?
 [ f4 ] , [ N d7 ]  All even trades now favor black given the knight advantage. N[ x B c4 ] also splits white pawns.
 [ g3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ R h2 ] , [ N x c3 ]  tidy sac wins the game for black.
 [ O-O-O ]  [ a5 ]  [ Q c7 ] , [ R e b1 ]  Preparing a queenside pawn storm to attack the king.
 [ d4 ]  [ h5 ]  [ B h3 ] , [ g5 ]  Black pushes back where he can hoping to develop his B at last with the immediate threat of trapping the White B and therefore also threatening White's N. The threat is easily thwarted though. I think the computer still prefers 19...Nf6.
 [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ] , [ c5 ]  [ c5 ] may start Benko defense if white abandon the center with dxc an easy why to retrieve it is [ Q a5 + ] and Qxc5. but of course it is not a good idea. 90% white player may push d4-[ d5 ]  [ d6 ] , [ e4 ]  the white reaction against benko gambit must be to take position at center.
 [ Q c8 ]  [ B b6 ]  [ R d e8 ] , [ R x d7 ]  I focus primary on pawn formation but I accept tactics however I was not sure about the result: rook + bishop + (knight) against queen and pawns black rook will be very passive anyway. [Computer: 23. ... [ h6 ] the only chance to get some counterplay]
 [ B g7 ] , [ N g e2 ]  Continuing in the manner of Master Penrose...
 [ K e3 ] , [ a2 ]  Taking advantage from the situation until its last consequences.
 [ B b2 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N f5 ]  [ g x f5 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ N x f6 ] , [ e x f5 ]  Okay this is a new milestone in the game and time to think of a plan once more. The game is far from being won at this point. White can try to invade with the rook to start attacking from behind and if he can knock out my f-pawn his clump of pawns can give me real trouble. I can try to exchange rooks by [ R a8 ] but White doesn't have to go for it. So again I shouldn't try to force a quick win (there are still 23 moves to go!) but slow down and start improving my position.
 [ a6 ] , [ d4 ]  So white decides to open the center.
 [ Q x c5 ] , [ c3 ]  Right move one too late... Best is 6. [ K e1 ] and sit it out... With any luck white can exchange queens...
 [ K g7 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ Q x e5 ]  [ B x c1 ] , [ R a x c1 ]  Thank you black for trading a strong bishop for white's weak bishop connecting white's rooks getting the trapped white rook on [ a1 ] into the game and trading material when white is ahead by a pawn. I think I'm giving 20. ... Bxc1? a question mark though truth be told black didn't have much better.
 [ e x d4 ]  [ O-O ]  [ d6 ]  [ c x d4 ] , [ B b6 ]  Standard position of Evans gambit the tabiya of 19th century.
 [ R h e1 ]  [ c6 ]  [ N x e6 ] , [ f x e6 ]  Now Black has equalized and has a strong center.
 [ R c7 ]  [ R a b8 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ R e1 ] , [ N x c7 ]  -1Q-1R-1B-2N-2P -1q-1b-1n-3p Game won resignation 0-1.
 [ K x g4 ] , [ Q h3 + ]  White resigned. 35. ...[ K g5 ] 36. [ Q h4 ] [ K f5 ] 37.[ N g3 # ] is the same mate as above.
 [ e x f5 ] , [ N f6 ]  ?
 [ Q a7 ] , [ Q d4 ]  And this is where a draw was agreed upon. From this I know why which is that if Carlsen refused the offer I'm sure he would've played 35...[ Q a6 ] and after 36.[ Q c4 ] Ding would've declared a draw by repetition.
 [ K d6 ]  [ R d2 ] , [ K e5 ]  With White's Rook hemmed in on the 2nd rank like that Black's King can immediately initiate defensive action on the Kingside.
 [ f3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ O-O ]  [ Q d2 ] , [ a6 ]  a6... this is sometimes called the Dragondorf. Magnus Carlsen plays this kind of setup in the Dragon though I do not know the intricacies.
 [ h4 ]  [ d6 ] , [ c6 ]  pawn block - white pawns still waiting in the wings.....
 [ R b8 ]  [ K b1 ] , [ R b7 ]  17. ...[ Q b6 ] straight to the point (b2) was better !
 [ B a6 ] , [ R b2 ]  And get to the second rank which is usually uncomfortable for the opponent.
 [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ] , [ d3 ]  I thought he would play d4. Very interesting.
 [ K h4 ] , [ f5 ]  Why not Nxf4?
 [ d5 ]  [ Q a4 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ N d2 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B d3 ] , [ O-O ]  Black has completed his development and stands better
 [ N e2 ]  [ B x c5 ]  [ Q d2 ] , [ Q e7 ]  This is a bad move as [ B b4 ] isn';t much of a threat. Better was [ N d5 ] aiming for the vulnerable [ e3 ] square.
 [ N x h3 ]  [ K c7 ] , [ K a7 ]  Here hs resigns appropriately. I'm up 4 pawns and a piece. I will soon be up a queen and it would be too easy. Black played fantastically and it was only 1 blunder that cost him the game.
 [ K f7 ]  [ R x a6 ]  [ K x g7 ]  [ R a7 + ]  [ K g8 ]  [ K f6 ]  [ K f8 ] , [ R a8 # ]  Checkmate I win
 [ Q d3 ] , [ B e4 ]  White tried to bring her back but not enough. He's far from out of danger. 15. [ Q e2 ] is the saving move here though it loses a piece to 15. ... Bxb1.
 [ Q x b7 ]  [ f3 ] , [ N c2 ]  [ e [ e3 ] ] at this point could be met by n[ e3 ] so time to dislodge that knight
 [ Q g1 ] , [ K x h7 ]  Recovering the piece with yet another gain of time. (Threat number 4?)
 [ N x d6 ]  [ B d8 ] , [ N c8 ]  The white bishop ties the knight to this awkward defense until the black king comes to drive it away. Meanwhile I had also planned to try and move my king to the queen side to support all three pawns at once. But that was not possible. Curiously this is the third time that this knight sits on a different light square of the 8th rank and all for perfect reasons.
 [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ e6 ] , [ N c3 ]  Nimzo Indian Defence
 [ K h1 ]  [ B x f3 ] , [ Q x f3 ]  now i have the way to [ h5 ] opened
 [ N c3 ] , [ B x f3 ]  Black trades a Bishop that could have been useful for a Knight with no prospects and lets me lift my Rook in the process. He's trying to trade down to lessen the pressure but he has no way to get at the pieces that actually matter. 25...[ Q c5 ] might have been a good alternative here.
 [ e x d5 ] , [ N x d5 ]  I'm in love with this position. My king is safe my knight is on a great square and my pieces look dangerous against my opponent's queenside.
 [ g x f5 ]  [ e x f5 ]  [ N d3 ]  [ B x d3 ]  [ c x d3 ] , [ N d8 ]  Its mission accomplished the Knight races for the blockading square at e6. White's attack has been completely stymied and now he finds he needs to reorganize his postion completely for defense because Black is already positioned to begin an attack of his own.
 [ N a6 ]  [ a3 ] , [ N c7 ]  Now I need to get my bad Bishop activated somehow.
 [ R f8 + ]  [ K c7 ] , [ R x b8 ]  With black's material advance a trade cannot be bad.
 [ R x h5 ]  [ g x h5 ]  [ Q x h5 ] , [ R e8 ]  Black needs to find an escape square for the king
 [ K g3 ]  [ Q g1 + ]  [ K h3 ] , [ Q f2 ]  ! Black dare not take the e-pawn on account of this well-known mating pattern: 34.[ R x e2 ] Qf3ch 35.[ K h4 ] g5ch [A] 36.[ K x g5 ] Qf6ch 37.[ K h5 ] [ Q h6 # ] or [B] 36.[ K h5 ] [ Q f6 ] and Black has no defence.
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ] , [ c4 ]  I always start with the queen's gambit in blitz games.
 [ K c4 ]  [ f5 ]  [ h6 ]  [ f4 ] , [ h7 ]  A justly famous "white knuckle ride" by Pillsbury who had to have calculated virtually the whole of the above sequence before entering the knight and pawn ending. Perish the thought that anyone should think that endings are boring but if there really is someone who does think so he should be converted by this example.
 [ N g3 ] , [ R a e8 ]  22. ….. [ R a e8 ] - black counter-attacks by putting pressure on my [ e4 ] pawn but now I further advance my g pawn. Note if the black knight goes back to [ h5 ] it will be immediately traded off.
 [ N c3 ]  [ B g7 ] , [ O-O ]  If we were expecting a big battle of tactics early on we were wrong. Inside the computer thinking endlessly both programs seemed to be playing pretty calmly. Funny that. Though they have no emotion we always seem to imagine computers as living beings. Frustrating intelligent and overly interesting living beings.
 [ B e7 ]  [ c x b5 ] , [ f5 ]  Strenghtening the control over the long diagonal. There is no need for Black to help White developing the LSB by taking the pawn.
 [ a6 ]  [ N a3 ]  [ B x a3 ]  [ b x a3 ] , [ Q d6 ]  White is totally busted! There's no such defense for black's attack!
 [ R b1 ] , [ e x d3 ]  It's only the illusion of gaining material since [ d5 ] is sure to fall.
 [ Q d4 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ Q x e4 + ]  [ Q e2 ]  [ Q x e2 + ] , [ K x e2 ]  Now the black is in the better position because white can't do O-O
 [ d6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ e5 ] , [ N f3 ]  here he choose to retreat instead of [ b5 ]  [ b5 ] , [ B d5 ]  threats the knight
 [ c5 ] , [ d5 ]  Again [ d5 ] seems too aggressive especially with the king still in the centre. 0-0 seems best still although it is hard to see any advantage for white. Any thoughts dear reader?
 [ R a2 + ]  [ K f3 ]  [ c x b5 ]  [ R x d5 + ]  [ K e6 ] , [ R x b5 ]  I thought to myself that I now have an easy draw as long as I don't do anything stupid.
 [ K f5 ]  [ K e3 ]  [ K e5 ]  [ K x f2 ]  [ K d4 ]  [ K e2 ]  [ e3 ]  [ a5 ]  [ b x a5 ]  [ b x a5 ] , [ a6 ]  !?
 [ B b6 ] , [ B f4 ]  It would have been a better idea to develop my knight protecting my [ d4 ] pawn and allowing me to castle.
 [ Q e2 ] , [ h3 ]  Want ultimately to act like I'm his pawns but enough of that!.... I just need to open this side up and use the theory that space and time have to offer.
 [ Q f3 ] , [ B c5 ]  OK whites queen has come out better bring some more pieces out to play
 [ K c8 ] , [ Q a6 + ]  This check+ is very important He will loose his king if he goes to [ b8 ] then my queen [ a8 + ] mate. and If he block using his queen he will loose his queen or his rock using my knight to [ d6 ] He chose his rock.
 [ e4 ] , [ N f6 ]  Attacking the e pawn and lining up to attack f2.
 [ B a4 ] , [ b5 ]  Staying true to his plan.
 [ e x f6 ] , [ g x f6 ]  11... QxP pinning the Knight would be better. Even with that move I don't think Black's attacking chances are worth the sacrificed material but the move actually made allows me to drive the B and get my King to safety.
 [ R x e4 ]  [ R d1 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ R b3 ]  [ h5 ]  [ K f2 ]  [ g6 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ R x e1 ] , [ K x e1 ]  Already thinking about engineering a draw even though a pawn down
 [ N c5 ] , [ B a6 + ]  !! He resigned.
 [ f x e5 ] , [ N x e5 ]  This is indeed the correct reply
 [ K d6 ] , [ N f2 ]  Again white's only move well found. The bishop is torn between the defence of the g-pawn and the knight. Black can afford to lose neither.. so he is forced to play........
 [ e6 ] , [ a3 ]  The feeling grows stronger. I decided to continue because I have seen real good players "making experiments" in these blitz games. Anything for the fun and I myself do try some unorthodox movements as well
 [ R f e1 ] , [ R c8 ]  After winning material it's a good idea to collect your forces.
 [ K c7 ] , [ R g3 ]  
 [ R a1 ]  [ f5 ]  [ R a8 ]  [ K f8 ]  [ R d8 ]  [ R b5 ]  [ h4 ]  [ K e7 ]  [ R a8 ]  [ N d6 ]  [ h5 ]  [ h6 ]  [ R a3 ]  [ R b4 ]  [ R g3 ] , [ K f7 ]  of course not Kf6?? and I cannot defend both [ g7 ] and the knight.
 [ N x g4 ] , [ h x g4 ]  ?? I was shocked to see this staid recapture which capitulates the rest of the game. I was fully expecting 28. Qxd5ch and a bit of a chase around my light-colored squares as my king seeks sanctuary though I felt secure in the calculations I made that there was no perpetual or cheapos to fear.
 [ B f2 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ N x c6 ]  I didn't see many other options to keep my strong pawn presence in the centre.
 [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ B c4 ]  While the Sozin variation is still playable it is not as popular as it once was because a pawn push to [ e6 ] neutralizes much of the LSB power along the a2-[ g8 ] diagonal.
 [ R x d8 ] , [ R d1 ]  White continues in his quest to trade pieces off the board - as I have the slightly healthier pawn structure and the bishop pair I'm content to oblige.
 [ B g4 ]  [ N x g4 ] , [ f x g4 ]  24. [ f x g4 ] - here is where my game starts to go wrong. Afro cunningly forces exchanges on his terms and ends up with two connected passed pawns.
 [ c5 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ c x d4 ] , [ N x d4 ]  White has better development so tries to open up the position.
 [ Q h3 + ]  [ K g8 ]  [ B x e6 + ] , [ R f7 ]  Forced.
 [ N f4 ] , [ Q c4 ]  I am preparing to unblock the b-file and play b2-b4-[ b5 ] while also threatening the crushing c6!
 [ c5 ] , [ N f3 ]  I've played this move before but the position was usually reached via: 1. [ e4 ] [ c5 ] 2. [ d4 ] [ e6 ]  [ d5 ] , [ Q e7 ]  We're off the beaten path now.
 [ B d3 ]  [ b6 ]  [ N g e2 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ Q d2 ] , [ e5 ]  Since black will not be getting through this center I will play on the kingside and attack. I leave my kings position in doubt so that black doesn't no where to attack. At any time I could castle queenside. When I was in Sacramento for the USCF Junior High Nationals I spent a lot of my time observing the top board: Alec Getz from Hunter. I noticed that he played the caro-kann several times and didn't castle. I learned that he found his rook on [ h8 ] to be better placed there then if he castled and it was on f8. Because ofter he would later play h7-h5-h4.
 [ B b4 ] , [ Q b3 ]  I was hoping for 9. ... [ B x c3 ] so I could play 10. P[ x c3 ] and put a pawn on defense of my [ d4 ] pawn and also creating a threat at b7.
 [ N f6 ] , [ N d2 ]  18. [ N d2 ] - clearing the decks and heading for [ e4 ] to pile up upon the pinned knight on f6.
 [ N d2 ] , [ a5 ]  Stopping all queen side play.
 [ e6 ] , [ Q f3 ]  White pursues control of the center while Black seeks to barricade the center. The pawn wall is complete.
 [ f4 ] , [ e x f4 ]  Jupiter for a moment got scared and started seeing nothing but shadows. But soon he understood the position was not bad at all for him as he played the following move
 [ a6 ]  [ c3 ]  [ b5 ]  [ B b3 ]  [ B e7 ] , [ d4 ]  All pretty ordinary so far. With 6. ... [ b5 ] black left the world DB and now we're on our own.
 [ R c1 ] , [ b6 ]  [ a6 ] preparing [ b5 ] is slightly better.
 [ B d5 + ]  [ K g7 ]  [ B x c4 ] , [ R a4 ]  Here White should play [ R x d4 ] and after [ R x b4 ] [ R d7 + ] and no matter where the black king goes he has problems. The best is [ K [ [ [ g6 ] ] ] ] but then [ B d3 + ] is easy for black. If instead [ K f8 ] [ R f7 + ] and now if [ K e8 ] then [ R f4 ] with discovered threats. So now [ K e7 ] [ [ [ g6 ] ] ] and black queens first but black's king is in more trouble and the white king can hide from checks by running to g3. Instead after [ R x d4 ] [ R x b4 ] [ R d7 + ] [ K f8 ] [ R f7 + ] Kg8? [ R c7 + ] followed by [ [ [ g6 ] ] ] will force mate. Also after [ R x d4 ] [ R x b4 ] [ R d7 + ] Kh8? Black has similar problems after [ B d5 ] [ g2 ] [ [ [ g6 ] ] ] threatening mate in 1.
 [ R x d3 + ]  [ c x d3 ]  [ Q d4 ]  [ h5 ]  [ Q x d3 + ]  [ K c1 ]  [ Q c3 + ]  [ K d1 ] , [ B c6 ]  
 [ Q e2 ]  [ N x h1 ]  [ Q f1 ]  [ N f2 ]  [ h3 ]  [ f5 ]  [ e x f5 ]  [ g x f5 ]  [ B c2 ]  [ e4 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ e3 ]  [ N x f5 ]  [ Q g5 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ R f8 ]  [ N b5 ] , [ N d3 + ]  An OK move if the queen wasn't so well placed.
 [ e5 ]  [ N d5 ] , [ f6 ]  The [ g7 ] pawn is pinned
 [ h3 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ g4 ] , [ B d6 ]  Slow move was looking for the exchange to free up my pieces for the kingside defence.
 [ a3 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ N e5 ] , [ O-O ]  Now white needs to play Nd2[ f3 ] to complete the pretty picture.
 [ e6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B x b2 ]  [ B x b2 ]  [ Q b6 + ]  [ K h1 ]  [ Q x b2 ]  [ Q d2 ] , [ N f6 ]  11. ...............[ N f6 ] - if [ Q x a1 ] then [ N c3 ] traps her!
 [ R a d1 ] , [ B x d5 ]  I take with the bishop because it forced him to take me in return. The bishop is also threatening a2!
 [ c5 ] , [ N a2 ]  It was this or back to d3. The problem with the latter is that Black wins a pawn from the resulting exchange and White finds it difficult to mobilize her pieces. I'd still fancy White's chances but it would take very patient play to establish a supremacy and make progress.
 [ K e7 ]  [ K e4 ]  [ K d6 ] , [ a3 ]  ?? Stupid stupid stupid. White had no reason to play impatiently on the queenside. Better was to use his king to rip apart black's kingside: 40. [ K [ f5 ] ] [ K e7 ] 41. [ g4 ] [ g6 + ] 42. [ K e5 ] [ f6 + ] 43. [ K f4 ] [ f5 ] 44. gx[ f5 ] gx[ f5 ] 45. Kx[ f5 ] [ K f7 ] 46. K[ g4 ] [ K g7 ] 47. [ K h5 ] and white wins easily. White will advanced his passed pawn and when black's king moves to stop it white's king will eliminate black's h-pawn and escort his own h-pawn to queening.
 [ N x e5 ]  [ Q x d5 + ]  [ Q x d5 ] , [ N x d5 ]  Just as planned! - except White overlooked the incoming fork.
 [ B x h4 ] , [ N d6 + ]  Establishing an immovable monster knight on [ d5 ] and threatening the [ f7 ] square.
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ c4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ B e7 ] , [ e3 ]  So it starts off as a very standard Queen's Gambit Declined. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen%27s_Gambit_Declined
 [ e3 ]  [ N b d7 ]  [ b4 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ N h3 ] , [ f4 ]  ATTACK!!!!
 [ Q f2 + ]  [ K h1 ]  [ Q x f4 ]  [ Q h5 + ] , [ Q h6 ]  22. ... [ N h6 ] 23. [ R f1 ] [ Q d6 ] 24. [ R x f1 ] [ Q x f1 ] 25. [ R f1 ] [ Q d8 ] and although I might be able to stem the attack I'd rather simplify immediately.
 [ N e3 + ]  [ K f2 ] , [ N d5 ]  Forking rook and pawn.
 [ B g5 ] , [ B e5 ]  preventing [ g3 ] and blocking white's e pawn
 [ Q c4 ] , [ R e6 e4 ]  Black needs her Queen so [ Q b5 ] was better.
 [ R c2 ]  [ R b1 ] , [ K f8 ]  Not certain what black was planning on at this point perhaps bringing his king across the board?
 [ N c3 ]  [ Q g5 ]  [ g3 ]  [ B g4 ] , [ Q e3 ]  i offer the queen trade again.
 [ Q f6 ] , [ B h7 + ]  This forces the king to [ h8 ] from there I could move my bishop and the pawn on [ h6 ] would be unable to take my knight on g5. And also protected by the knight it could stay there and keep the pressure on black.
 [ c6 ]  [ B a4 ] , [ O-O ]  I always feel especially daring castling kingside in this opening.
 [ N c3 ]  [ R b2 ]  [ N d1 ]  [ R b3 ] , [ f6 ]  This not only drives away the knight but also prevents back-rank mate allowing the second rook in.
 [ K g3 ] , [ g5 ]  The king can not escape
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B b5 ] , [ a6 ]  The mainline. But Jack (until our last game) played 3...Bc5?!. I recently found out that it's an inaccuracy as the way to proceed is with 4.[ [ [ c3 ] ] ] followed by 5.[ [ [ d4 ] ] ] The only time this works is when black plays ...[ [ b5 ] ] and you answer with [ B a4 ] then c2-[ [ [ c3 ] ] ] followed by d3-[ [ [ d4 ] ] ] is no longer of an asset to black. In fact learning that from this game is why I brought up the mainlines in the last annotation with Ted. For the next couple of moves everything is standard. Although the move order isn't the same as where reversion and I put it where we said it later I deem it appropriate to copy and paste the conversation here since we're talking about this anyway. Joe: I also remember a game with Jack Stockel believe it or not. Forgot what it was but I got a pawn and then he got one back just when I thought it was without compensation. And it involved the same move as what I'm bound to play. reversion: 4...Bc5?! is an innacuracy here. White will continue with 5.[ [ [ c3 ] ] ] intending d2-[ [ [ d4 ] ] ] stablishing a big control in the center. I'd only recommend an eventual [ B c5 ] for Black in the 5...[ [ b5 ] ] 6.[ B b3 ] [ B c5 ] line known as the Archangel Variation.
 [ B f6 ] , [ Q d3 ]  11. [ Q [ d3 ] ] - Fou Lenoir (my dark square bishop) forces the Witch to retreat - she chooses [ d3 ] which indirectly hits at [ h7 ] with a lsb on the board I must watch out for Old Matey (checkmate) on h7.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ f6 ]  [ N x e5 ] , [ f x e5 ]  gotcha... actually went pretty well.
 [ R e2 ] , [ N h7 ]  gotta reposition the knight
 [ K f3 ]  [ f5 ]  [ g x f5 + ]  [ g x f5 ]  [ K g3 ]  [ R a1 ]  [ K g2 ] , [ b5 ]  [ b6 ] was more precise according to SF5 since it avoids counterplay based on [ R c3 ]  [ K g3 ] , [ R c1 ]  [ h5 ] was correct! Now [ a4 ] gives white a chance of counterplay!
 [ e x d4 ]  [ N b5 ] , [ N x e4 ]  Evening out material by taking both the middle and a hanging piece.
 [ g4 ] , [ g5 ]  symmetrical
 [ R d8 ] , [ R h d1 ]  probably the losing move...
 [ B b3 ]  [ e5 ]  [ R a2 ] , [ e6 ]  Black here could win the [ a4 ] pawn but really needs to stop that pawn on [ e6 ] before it promotes and curtains for Black.
 [ d3 ]  [ e5 ]  [ e3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N e2 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ N g3 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ f3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ O-O ]  Now i have a good positions
 [ Q d5 + ] , [ K e8 ]  Better is 31.... Kg7. 32. [ c6 ] Nb6. 33. [ Q d6 ] and black keeps Queen-hunting until saving the rook.
 [ N c3 ] , [ e5 ]  I love this variation.
 [ R a8 ] , [ Q b7 ]  only safe square but can make escape shortly with Nd5...
 [ B x c5 ] , [ b x c5 ]  White has the potential of a passed pawn
 [ c6 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ B f5 ] , [ g4 ]  The choice was between castling and attacking. I like attacking. Besides the DB says the highest rated players go with this option so how can I refute that?
 [ O-O ] , [ N f x e5 ]  White catches Black completely flat-footed regaining parity while maintaining the threat to the Rook and Bishop. I begin to suspect I will lose or at best force a draw but there is still hope.
 [ g5 ] , [ f3 ]  A queen would be nice
 [ d5 ] , [ c5 ]  ?! I did lose the links with all of those variations from before so now it's just move by move. However I believe it changes because the first few moves were similar to the Game DB on this website. So Fritz is calling this as another inaccuracy and keeps us a little better after 9.[ a3 ] Of course we don't stick to it as 9.[ B g5 ] is agreed on.
 [ O-O ]  [ B e3 ]  [ B x e3 ] , [ f x e3 ]  i really like this... maybe it is a flaw in my mind...
 [ Q e2 ]  [ e5 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B g4 ]  [ h3 ]  [ B h5 ]  [ R a d1 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ N b6 ]  [ B e6 ] , [ g5 ]  This bad pawn move loses a pawn for black
 [ h4 ]  [ N h6 ] , [ g3 ]  This seems to be the best option halts the king attack n[ f5 ] doesnt seem to be to bad to me.
 [ Q x a3 ] , [ e6 ]  Not sure what the purpose of this was. I decide to ignore it for now and go for the jugular.
 [ B x f6 ]  [ g x f6 ] , [ R a7 ]  I want that a-pawn.
 [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ d3 ]  With this move White confirms he is playing for a light-square game. The position is somewhat resemblant of an English Opening.
 [ f x g6 ] , [ a4 ]  Time to break up the wings. Also setting up the next few moves by enticing black's pawn to move from [ b5 ] to b4.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ b4 ]  [ B x b4 ]  [ c3 ]  [ B c5 ] , [ d4 ]  Evans gambit was the most popular opening in this match. It was played in 6 games in all games except one in which Anderssen played with white.
 [ N e5 ] , [ R d6 + ]  Yet again white misses the win. [ R d4 ] followed by [ R d5 ] wins the N
 [ K a1 ] , [ K c2 ]  White's king is forced onto a checkable square so now mate can occur and Black has succeeded in winning this very complicated endgame.
 [ N c6 ] , [ c3 ]  Alternative move :[ N x d4 ]  [ d x c3 ] , [ N x c3 ]  Gambit - White's one pawn late but has 3 pieces out against one for black
 [ e4 ] , [ N f6 ]  1...Nf6. I am unfamiliar with this opening. I have no idea why I played this.
 [ R a g8 + ]  [ K f1 ]  [ h3 ]  [ c4 ]  [ h2 ]  [ B x h8 ] , [ h1 = Q + ]  I personally would have taken the bishop and upgraded pawn next move. Major mistake on his behalf as the bishop ends up winning the game for me.
 [ R x f2 + ]  [ K g1 ]  [ R b2 ]  [ K f1 ] , [ b4 ]  Time to start the advance. 40. [ N x c4 ] fails to 40... [ B e2 ]  [ c4 ]  [ g6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ e4 ]  [ d6 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ O-O ] , [ B g5 ]  Up to this point I new how to play but this move was a bit new for me. I played [ c5 ] here since after [ e5 ] the normal move most of the times 7. dx[ e5 ] dx[ e5 ] 8. [ Q x d8 ] [ R x d8 ] 9. [ N d5 ] black is clearly worse and already losing material.
 [ R f e1 ] , [ N h4 ]  ?! It does chase my queen but he *really* needs to finish developing. This also brings his only active piece onto the edge.
 [ O-O ] , [ B d6 ]  Develop a piece and threaten mate - gain a tempo.
 [ B e2 ]  [ e5 ] , [ O-O ]  !?!?!? This move surprises me. Either an immensely cunning sacrifice or a blunder. Taking the players' ratings into consideration this is probably an immensely cunning sacrifice.
 [ e4 ]  [ h3 ]  [ g5 ]  [ h4 ]  [ g x h4 ]  [ g x h4 ] , [ h5 ]  White is pretty helpless as I'm reverting to testing blacks endgame skills.
 [ B g4 ] , [ h3 ]  I just wanted to relieve a bit of pressure but the computer doesn't like it at all. Maybe because I can't immediately capture the B on account of his Q would snatch my K-side R. Anyway I don't like the computer's recommendation of [ N b5 ] although the simple O-O makes sense. Funny that I ended up castling Q-side.
 [ N x e5 ]  [ f x e5 ]  [ Q e7 ]  [ d4 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ B b4 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ B x f8 ]  [ R x f8 ]  [ Q b4 ]  [ Q e7 ]  [ Q x e7 ]  [ N x e7 ]  [ R b1 ]  [ b6 ]  [ a4 ]  [ R c8 ]  [ a5 ]  [ b5 ]  [ N b4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ d x c5 ]  [ R x c5 ]  [ N d3 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ R b3 ]  [ B x d3 ]  [ R x d3 ]  [ K f7 ]  [ B h3 ]  [ a6 ]  [ R f3 + ]  [ K e8 ]  [ R f6 ]  [ R c6 ] , [ R x c6 ]  Again gameknot suggests [ R f1 ]  [ N x c6 ]  [ B c8 ]  [ N b8 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ d4 ]  [ K f1 ]  [ K d7 ]  [ K e2 ]  [ K c7 ]  [ B d5 ] , [ N c6 ]  for obvious reasons I cannot take the knight as my opponent would definitely win because it would transpose into a won endgame for Black
 [ B x e4 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ Q x e4 ] , [ R f d1 ]  Protecting the N. And with that being said this is also what I would've played.
 [ Q f3 ]  [ Q h4 + ]  [ Q h3 ]  [ Q e1 + ]  [ K h2 ] , [ B g1 + ]  !!
 [ g x f4 ] , [ N x f4 ]  Threatening Nxd3.
 [ N e7 ]  [ O-O ] , [ O-O ]  [ N g6 ] before castling offers the escape [ Q d3 ] if black captures the bishop [ R d8 ] leads to checkmate
 [ N c6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ d6 ] , [ R f d1 ]  Forget about Nd5! Plan B is to encourage him to rob my Bishop so that I can check him for the rest of the game until his end.

 [ B b5 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ Q e5 ]  [ g3 ]  [ R d b8 ]  [ Q x a5 ] , [ c5 ]  Black withdraws support of his white bishop. [ N x b5 ] puts white up a pawn while threatening Bd6.
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ b4 ]  [ B x b4 ]  [ c3 ] , [ B c5 ]  An incorrect reply that runs into trouble quickly. This move allows white his plan with tempo
 [ f x g6 ]  [ h x g6 ] , [ h6 ]  Ok step one concluded. Now I need a sac to break the pawns. [ B x h3 ] was enough to win?
 [ e x d6 ]  [ K e3 ]  [ R x e4 + ]  [ K x e4 ]  [ R b5 ]  [ g4 ]  [ K e6 ]  [ B h4 ]  [ h6 ]  [ B e1 ]  [ h5 ]  [ h3 ] , [ R d5 ]  A small mismove on Black's part. 42...[ h x g4 ] 43. [ h x g4 ] [ R c5 ] may have gotten Black the win he so desired.
 [ B f5 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ Q x d5 ] , [ N c3 ]  Aiming to drive back the centralized Queen.
 [ Q d2 ] , [ B h3 ]  This move should lead to [ N f3 ] in case white does not see it.
 [ e x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ N f6 ]  I'll play with this isolated pawn as White. [ e5 ] is my set-up point and the e file is the avenue for attack.
 [ Q x d1 + ] , [ N x d1 ]  Here is the pivotal position of the game and the one I alluded at the beginning of the game. White has a minor piece and a great center for two pawns. Look how inviting that [ g3 ] square is for the black knight. This is one of those positions however that without a lot of calculating the right move should instantly be apparent and it isn't Ng3. Consider the position. How valuable is that knight right now? Wouldn't it be apparent that it is easily more valuable than a white rook right now? Both white rooks are doing nothing. No white pieces are doing anything after white's move. The black knight right now is worth far more than the rook. Despite the temptation of the fork I instinctively dismiss it and instead choose [ N x d4 ] without looking more than a very few moves ahead. Fritz very much agrees. [ N x d4 ] is the best move and a distinct advantage rather than [ N g3 + ] forking the rook and king.
 [ K g4 ]  [ Q d1 + ] , [ K f5 ]  Now there's just no way to check him again.
 [ K g7 ]  [ Q a4 ]  [ d1 = Q + ]  [ Q x d1 ]  [ B x d1 ]  [ K f2 ] , [ B b3 ]  Probably I should have moved my king first
 [ N c6 ]  [ Q x c4 ] , [ N x d4 ]  I've got my eye on c2. Just gotta get the white queen off it.
 [ Q x f5 + ]  [ K a1 ] , [ N d5 ]  Feeling very depressed for my lost attack I seized the chance to simplify and see if I could draw at least.
 [ K g2 ]  [ Q h2 + ]  [ K f3 ]  [ B x g4 + ]  [ K x g4 ]  [ Q h5 + ]  [ K f4 ] , [ B h6 # ]  Checkmate my friend!
 [ Q x e4 ]  [ O-O ]  [ d5 ] , [ R f e8 ]  safer is [ e x d5 ] [ c x d5 ] Rfe8...
 [ Q x a1 ]  [ R x a1 ]  [ K h4 ]  [ K g7 ]  [ K g5 ]  [ R h1 ]  [ g4 ]  [ R g1 ]  [ h6 + ]  [ K h7 ]  [ K f6 ]  [ f x g4 ]  [ K x e6 ]  [ g3 ]  [ f5 ]  [ g2 ]  [ f6 ]  [ R f1 ]  [ K e7 ]  [ g1 = Q ]  [ f7 ]  [ Q g5 + ]  [ K e8 ]  [ Q g6 ]  [ K e7 ]  [ R x f7 + ]  [ K e8 ] , [ Q g8 # ]  Many thanks for reading. Please leave a comment or two and rate the annotation on the star system to let me know how I am getting on. Until next time dear reader!
 [ Q d7 ] , [ N e5 ]  Attacking my queen again. Maybe I should exchange off the pieces in the centre quth 14...[ B x e5 ] (14...[ N x e5 ] exe5) 15.[ B x e5 ] [ N x e5 ] etc. and make use of his lag in development. But for some reason my heart wasn't in it.
 [ R g5 ] , [ R a2 ]  Black attacks and I riposte.
 [ e5 ] , [ c5 ]  Thwarts 3. [ d4 ]  [ B b5 + ] , [ B d7 ]  Black his happy to accept an exchange and he gains a tempo in development (if BxB NxB).
 [ e4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ N c6 ]  comment from RD: 3...[ N c6 ] is weak. White should reply 4 d5.
 [ O-O ]  [ N b d2 ] , [ d6 ]  Expected was d5. This allows me to...
 [ d x c4 ] , [ B c5 ]  The development of that bishop has been the greatest dilemma of my exhistance. 9...[ B d6 ] with attack on [ h2 ] and blocking the aggressive d pawn also looks solid. Here I considered that king-side castling was the best white could get from his position where [ B c5 ] would pretty much justify itself.
 [ e4 ] , [ c5 ]  The sicilian defence. I think this is the best response to 1.[ e4 ] but that's just my personal opinion
 [ R h8 ] , [ Q d2 ]  The mating net is being constructed.
 [ B e5 ]  [ B b4 ]  [ K c2 ]  [ a3 ] , [ K b3 ]  The bishop in untakeable
 [ d x e5 ]  [ B x f3 ]  [ Q x f3 ]  [ d x e5 ] , [ B c4 ]  Clearly white is better off in terms of development
 [ Q d2 ]  [ B x g1 ]  [ R h1 ] , [ B e3 ]  again .. same trick .. if Q[ x B e3 ] then [ N g2 ] and fork ..
 [ R b8 ] , [ B x b8 ]  The BQ remains the only supporter of [ b7 ] and no tempo is lost because black has nothing better than retake.
 [ d5 ] , [ e5 ]  3.[ e x d5 ] is played normally in here but I prefer to play this one.
 [ Q x c6 ]  [ b x c6 ]  [ R c8 ]  [ R c1 ] , [ K f8 ]  The king now strolls across to the pawn and we will be left with a 3 vs 3 pawns dead draw.
 [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ g6 ]  This was the initial position of the tournament.
 [ b4 ] , [ B d7 ]  14. ........... [ B d7 ] - develops his queenside at last but black is rather cramped. I now decide to move my queen knight away from the queenside and move it towards the kingside where I will then make a somewhat risky move.
 [ b6 ] , [ h4 ]  White does not want to give up the long white diagonal so he needs to force the knight away to move Be4.
 [ d4 ]  [ R c8 ]  [ c3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B x f4 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ R a e1 ]  [ R f e8 ]  [ N g5 ]  [ N x g5 ]  [ B x g5 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ R x e8 + ]  [ R x e8 ]  [ R c1 ]  [ R e2 ]  [ c4 ]  [ h6 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ R e4 ]  [ B x d6 ]  [ R x d4 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ R x c4 ]  [ R x c4 ]  [ B x c4 ]  [ b3 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ B x a7 ]  [ g5 ]  [ K f2 ]  [ f5 ]  [ K e3 ]  [ B c6 ]  [ g3 ]  [ g4 ]  [ K d4 ]  [ K f7 ]  [ K c5 ]  [ B a8 ]  [ K b6 ] , [ K e7 ]  
 [ R x e5 ]  [ f x e5 ] , [ R a1 + ]  And our surfer resign so i can come back to my work while he will come back to his waves ! Thanks for comments.
 [ e5 ] , [ e x d5 ]  white is in complete control until:
 [ R h2 ] , [ R g8 ]  Pulling the rook back into reserve. Black will be shifting his attention to the centre and given the weak point at [ b3 ] the Q-side as well. The threats won't amount to much but by inducing a reaction enable Black to make some sort of progress. Such at least was the hope.
 [ N x e4 ] , [ N x d4 ]  A sneaky move by black. If white recaptures the knight with 10. [ d x e4 ] black wins the white bishop with 10. ... [ Q x c4 ] and now white is down a pawn though he now has 11. [ Q x d4 ] or 11. [ N x d4 ] to restore material equality. However black would be much better developed and will have gained quite nicely positionally so the move as played 10. [ N x d4 ] seems the better choice.
 [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ N d4 ]  The typical movce is ...[ d6 ] or ...[ g6 ] but like I said was in a different mood.
 [ Q e6 + ]  [ Q x e6 ]  [ R x e6 ] , [ K f7 ]  [ h5 ] here would have saved a lot of trouble...
 [ Q x d3 ] , [ B x c5 ]  (??) And here it is. This capture has been in the air for several moves and Black obviously had it in mind ever since he played 6...d5. Had he retaken on [ e5 ] with his other knight (8...Ngxe5) this recapture would have been fine. As it is...
 [ Q e5 ] , [ N x a2 ]  Now I really want to figure out whether two rooks and a knight are stronger than a queen.
 [ R e5 e4 ]  [ h3 ]  [ g5 ] , [ R c7 + ]  King can march ahead now even he would be needed for the mating net.
 [ K e5 ] , [ a5 ]  I therefore push my far right-hand a-pawn.
 [ N h4 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ R g5 ]  [ B x h7 ]  [ f x e5 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ R x e5 + ] , [ K f1 ]  After opening up the King side for an attack at a later date I lost the ability to castle by playing [ K f1 ] planning on hand castling. 19.[ B e4 ] was also possible but led to counterattacking chances and causing the Queen to be stuck guarding the bishop. Also 19.[ B e4 ] [ B h6 ] stops the ability to castle Queen side which would have been the point of playing 19. [ B e4 ] so I could play 20. O-O-O
 [ K f8 ] , [ N d6 ]  I played this because to threat AND checkmate in 1 yes I mean ONE move
 [ d x e5 ]  [ d x e5 ] , [ N x e5 ]  This is idiotic on my part. Shortly after I hit the send button I realized that I had hung the N to a simple Q check.
 [ b5 ] , [ N x b5 ]  If 14...PxN??? 15 BxP ch is decisive. [15...N-[ B3 ] 16 BxN ch B-[ [ Q2 ] ] 17 BxR or 15... B-[ [ Q2 ] ] 16 BxB ch K-[ Q1 ] 17 B-[ B6 ] dis ch followed by 18 BxR.]
 [ N f2 ] , [ R e8 ]  All the threats are coming from black I think n-[ e4 ] is best
 [ R f6 + ]  [ K h7 ]  [ h4 ] , [ g4 ]  I wasn't sure if going for the pawn exchange would have been better. I saw some threats during the game but I do not seem to remember them now.
 [ B x f6 ]  [ Q x f6 ]  [ B x d5 ] , [ R b8 ]  Now White is a pawn up.
 [ Q x g5 ] , [ R g3 ]  Pin on bishop
 [ Q x d4 ]  [ e x d4 ] , [ N f1 ]  Because Joann prevented ...[ Q d1 + ] as noted earlier I don't see the point behind this move. The N wasn't pinned and this just appears to undevelops for a reason that I don't consider to be good.
 [ Q x h5 ]  [ B x h5 ] , [ N f6 ]  My opponent could have considered this a way to get out of troubles returning the material.
 [ N x d4 ]  [ R e8 ] , [ h3 ]  preparing [ B e3 ] otherwise Ng4. But pawn on [ h3 ] could be weak
 [ a x b6 ] , [ a7 ]  And now I expect [ N d7 ] [ a8 = Q ] BxQ RxB [ N b8 ] (or [ K b7 ] losing the rook) [ R x b8 ] [ K d7 ] [ R b7 ] KxB RxR and white emerges a piece up.
 [ B d2 ] , [ Q a3 ]  ...my Q is a little useless while white can develop his kingside attack now.
 [ N c6 ]  [ e x f5 ] , [ N x d4 ]  More or less forced to keep from falling behind a pawn but now the isolated c pawn will become a dangerous passed pawn
 [ e x f5 ]  [ e x f5 ]  [ R e8 + ]  [ K f2 ] , [ N x f4 ]  Now black has a real edge despite material is even.
 [ B g6 ]  [ h4 ]  [ h5 ] , [ g4 ]  !
 [ a3 ] , [ Q x h5 ]  so what do you thing about this "bishop variation" is it known ? or is it not recommended ?
 [ R d2 ]  [ a5 ]  [ B f1 ]  [ B c6 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ a4 ]  [ R e2 ]  [ N h5 ]  [ Q f2 ]  [ N f4 ]  [ R d2 ]  [ b3 ]  [ a3 ]  [ N x d3 + ]  [ R x d3 ]  [ b x c2 ]  [ Q x c2 ]  [ B x e4 ]  [ Q x c7 ] , [ R x c7 + ]  Black is a clear pawn up and has the Bishop-pair and White's King is terribly exposed.
 [ K f8 ]  [ R e e7 ]  [ B e8 ]  [ R c x a7 ]  [ R b8 ]  [ R e b7 ]  [ R c8 ] , [ b4 ]  I control all the open files my rooks dominate in black's camp and I have a passed b and c pawn looking fit to queen. In this position black resigned.
 [ N g8 ]  [ g5 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ R e8 ] , [ B f5 ]  40. ...... [ B f5 ] - maintaining the Joblock.
 [ d x e5 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ Q x d1 + ] , [ N x d1 ]  to my advantage i have two developed pieces he has none
 [ b4 ] , [ R c3 ]  This is why. My Rook isn't doing anything once again.
 [ Q d1 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ R e d2 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ Q e1 ]  [ g6 ]  [ Q e3 ]  [ b5 ]  [ K h2 ]  [ K e8 ]  [ Q b6 ]  [ R c7 c6 ]  [ Q e3 ]  [ Q b7 ]  [ K g1 ]  [ K e7 ]  [ K h2 ]  [ Q b6 ]  [ Q x b6 ]  [ R x b6 ]  [ N a2 ]  [ a5 ] , [ b4 ]  This is now completely winning for me after [ a4 ] since I have activity on the c file and my LSb is worth a lot.
 [ N x c6 ] , [ B x c6 ]  ?! This was why I wanted to put my bishop on d7. However this loses a pawn. After 8...[ b x c6 ] 9.Nxd5?? is off course not possible because that just loses a piece. 8...[ b x c6 ] also opens the b-file for the rook on [ a8 ] which will compensate for the doubled pawns.
 [ e4 ] , [ e5 ]  A mini tournament within my team the Cynical Cynics for players 1600 - 2000. I'm playing black. My opponent opens with 1. [ e4 ] and I'm feeling adventurous so I give him the Open Game my favorite as white so today I'll play against it instead - actually the second time on the same day I made this choice to wear the other man's moccasins.
 [ a x b4 ] , [ Q a3 ]  Well played opponent ... that should be ok but I
 [ B d7 ]  [ Q e2 ]  [ b5 ]  [ B x h7 + ]  [ K x h7 ]  [ N g5 + ]  [ K g6 ]  [ Q g4 ]  [ f6 ] , [ N e4 + ]  This check wins the hanging Bishop.
 [ N c6 ] , [ a3 ]  7. [ a3 ] - preventing Nb4.
 [ c4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ e4 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ d4 ]  [ d6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B e2 ]  [ e5 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N c6 ]  [ d5 ] , [ N e7 ]  based opening of the tournament.
 [ B b7 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N f6 ]  [ d3 ]  [ B e7 ] , [ e5 ]  Because of blacks strength on the light diagonal playing this move is not recommended. White should have played Re1.
 [ N c7 + ] , [ K f8 ]  I think [ K d8 ] would have been better as it would protect Nd7.
 [ R h e8 ]  [ f x e6 ]  [ f x e6 ]  [ N g2 ]  [ K b8 ] , [ N f4 ]  18. [ B d3 ] [ g5 ] 19. [ Q h5 ] is no better... After 18. [ B f4 ] [ e5 ] 19. [ B c1 ] ([ B e3 ] Rf8) [ e4 ] white loses his edge completely...
 [ N x e4 ] , [ d x e4 ]  Now [ f3 ] is forbidden and black threats to win my B after my Q retreats (the alternative was BxQ NxQ hxN [ d x e5 ] and white has a lot of activity).
 [ f5 ]  [ f3 ]  [ N f7 ] , [ B f2 ]  All of white's pieces are now pointing to the queen-side but black has not managed to organize a king-side attack quite yet
 [ B x f3 ] , [ Q x f3 ]  I expected Black to try trading Queens and go into an endgame but my Queen just chills here for the rest of the game and lets the underlings do the dirty work.
 [ e3 ]  [ N e4 ] , [ h4 ]  Needed to avoid Qh4.
 [ K d3 ]  [ B c4 + ]  [ K e3 ]  [ Q b6 + ]  [ K f3 ] , [ R c7 ]  Alternative variation: 27... [ Q f2 + ] [doesn't change the outcome of the game] 28. [ K x f2 ] [ R c7 ] 29. [ B x g6 ] [ B e6 ] 30. [ B x h7 + ] [ K f7 ] 31. [ Q g7 + ] [ K e8 ] 32. [ Q x c7 ] [ B d7 ] 33. [ B g6 + ] [ K f8 ] 34. [ R h8 # ]  [ K x e2 ] , [ b4 ]  Alternative variation: 29... [ R c2 + ] [ does not solve anything] 30. [ K d3 ] [ R d2 + ] 31. [ R x d2 ] [ Q a7 ] 32. [ R f2 ] [ Q f7 ] 33. [ B x f7 + ] [ K x f7 ] 34. [ Q g7 + ] [ K e6 ] 35. [ Q e7 # ]  [ f7 + ]  [ R x f7 ]  [ B x f7 + ]  [ K x f7 ]  [ Q x h7 + ] , [ K e8 ]  Alternative variation: 32... [ K f8 ] [ is not much help] 33. [ Q h8 + ] [ K f7 ] 34. [ R h7 + ] [ K e6 ] 35. [ Q c8 + ] [ K f6 ] 36. [ Q f5 # ]  [ Q g8 + ] , [ K d7 ]  Alternative variation: 33... [ K e7 ] [does not save the day] 34. [ Q g7 + ] [ K e8 ] 35. [ R h8 # ]  [ R h7 + ]  [ K c6 ] , [ Q d5 # ]  
 [ b6 ] , [ B h3 ]  I'm preparing to castle king-side.
 [ N f5 + ] , [ K e6 ]  Want to stack the rooks - think I can get a rook
 [ R f d8 ]  [ R e7 ] , [ g6 ]  27...[ R a8 ] defends the pawn but after 28.[ R c7 ] followed by 29.[ R c6 ] a pawn will fall
 [ B e3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ Q d2 ] , [ c6 ]  brulla: I like this move. It opens the diagonal for the queen and covers the points [ d5 ] and [ b5 ] with the option of queen wing action. (13.07.06)
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ d4 ]  This continuation (Scotch) usally leads to an open game. Other moves like [ B b5 ] or [ B c4 ] can lead to closed positions that are more positional.
 [ B e4 ]  [ Q g7 ]  [ B x b7 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ B d5 ] , [ R e7 ]  Maybe [ f6 ] was indicated instead. But it starts to look funny.
 [ K b8 ] , [ N e5 ]  [ R a e1 ] would once again be better but this is fine.
 [ Q a4 ] , [ g4 ]  Mistake! the computer sees it well but not wwgia. He could have played [ N g3 ] followed by 24. [ h x g3 ] then [ B x g4 ] recuperates the piece and win 2 pawns.
 [ K x h7 ]  [ R x f7 + ]  [ R x f7 ]  [ B x f7 ] , [ R f8 ]  Caging the white king and feeling completely free to leave my pawns unguarded. My opponent has two joined pawn and this should give him advantage. I doubt I can stop the two of them so I am technically lost (I can be wrong be aware!). But now white better play with good technique or the weakness of his own pawns against the rook will cause his to lose the game. White's bishop belongs to b3. Period. White can still try to bring the king on his pawn's side losing the other two at the end and force a draw but it requires very good chess either.
 [ R a c8 ] , [ h4 ]  Preventing a potential K-side surge. To use a Niemzowitschian phrase i'm reducing the game's dynamism.
 [ c3 ]  [ Q b8 + ]  [ K e7 ] , [ Q e5 ]  The point of [ Q b8 + ] though I'm completely lost after the next few moves.
 [ N g5 ]  [ N f4 ] , [ N h2 ]  In the heat of the game Safeway misses an opportunity for the diagonal joop on [ e3 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ N g4 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ N e5 ] , [ N e c3 ]  
 [ f5 ]  [ K b3 ]  [ f4 ]  [ g x f4 ] , [ g x f4 ]  See the last note - compared with earlier variations there is no white hpawn about to drop and no black hpawn about to become a dangerous passed pawn.
 [ N f7 ] , [ e6 ]  The pawn advances cramping the black king and knocking away a defensive piece.
 [ N x f3 ] , [ N f4 ]  black's knight looks dangerous white is just beginning his master plan
 [ b4 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ g5 ]  This is what i call a complicated position. Castling would be nice.
 [ R c2 ] , [ R c7 ]  Draw Agreed. White cannot win it in the time he has left and I have no winning options on the board.
 [ c x b4 ]  [ a x b4 ] , [ a5 ]  ? Still leads to a win but 43. ... [ b5 ] gets there faster because it immediately eliminates the passed pawn after 44. cx[ b5 ] ax[ b5 ] and we see the solidity of 41. ... f5+. White cannot prevent his passed pawn from getting eaten up.
 [ O-O ] , [ Q f6 ]  a very bad idea...
 [ N x f4 ]  [ N x f4 ] , [ Q x d6 ]  Things are terrible enough for White but grabbing a pawn wastes valuable time. Instead he could mount a better defense with 27. [ R e3 ] 27. [ Q e3 ] or 27. Bc2.
 [ B x e6 ]  [ B x e6 ] , [ Q c7 ]  Well he still wants to complete development. Despite not being able to castle it is feasible for him to achieve what he wants. However it generally takes an extra move to do so.
 [ O-O ] , [ g3 ]  Still refusing to develop and this will prove diastrous if black manages to open up the game quickly which I did.
 [ f x e6 ] , [ B x h6 ]  Not enough. He's looking [ N e5 ] and queen invasion hitting king and [ e6 ] pawn there is no mate here unless it's handed over. Black has [ N f5 ] stopping both threats although this leads to a little skewer giving back the material still leaves black up a piece some consolidating moves and it's an easy victory.
 [ O-O + ] , [ K e7 ]  On ...[ K e8 ] the response would've been the same threatening mate and rook. Naturally [ K g8 ] fails to [ Q e6 ] mate.
 [ Q d2 ] , [ Q c7 ]  7. ... [ Q c7 ] moves out of awkward pin and doubly protects Kt.
 [ N e5 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ c6 ] , [ N c3 ]  Changed my mind.
 [ N g6 ] , [ B h3 ]  Really weak as 8:[ B h3 ] weakens white's kingside and at any time black can play [ e5 ] and gain center space while threatening to exchange light squared bishiops.
 [ Q c5 + ]  [ K g8 ] , [ N c3 ]  prevents the mate at e2.
 [ Q x h1 + ] , [ K d2 ]  28. Kd2? Better was... resign! :) In this way I taken mate in one the shortest mate. The game was lost but 28. [ R e1 ] [ Q f3 ] 29. [ R e2 ] (29. [ K d2 ] Qd3#) [ Q f1 ] 30. [ R e1 ] (30. [ K d2 ] Qc1#) [ Q f3 # ]  [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ c4 ]  [ c6 ]  [ e3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ g6 ]  Major choice point: I chose the Grunfeld (Schlecter var) over the Semi-Slav. I am more comfortable with Fiancettos in general.
 [ R x f2 ]  [ Q x g3 ]  [ R f3 ]  [ Q g5 ] , [ Q e1 ]  Trying to attack with not-natural moves but it doesn't work!
 [ Q x f6 ]  [ b3 ] , [ B b4 ]  Black is significantly better.
 [ N f6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ g6 ] , [ e3 ]  ? A curious early deviation which will open up some strategic possibilities for black later on. 3. [ c4 ] would have transposed into any of several King's Indian lines and been better.
 [ a5 ] , [ B e2 ]  maybe try going the other way.
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ c4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ c5 ]  QGD Semi-Tarrasch defence. Black gives up a pawn for rapid development. However after 4. [ c x d5 ] blacks pawns are a bit weak in the centre.
 [ B a3 ]  [ b6 ] , [ B b2 ]  white are making pointless moves with the bishop and are giving time to the black
 [ Q d8 ] , [ B h7 + ]  ?! Really not sure about this sacrifice. It was purely instinctive but I think a direct [ g5 ] would have been more precise.
 [ N e5 ] , [ R e6 ]  and have to retrace my steps. I don't want to have to recapture on [ c6 ] with the pawn that prevents White's a-pawn from being a passer.
 [ a5 ] , [ c x d5 ]  {Lagrave Polgar - 63%} (11...[ Q d7 ] {Nakamura - 37%}) Nakamura's move prevents [ [ h3 ] ] since that would lead to (11...[ Q d7 ] 12. [ [ h3 ] ] Bx[ [ h3 ] ] 13. Bx[ [ h3 ] ] Qxh3)
 [ R e8 ] , [ R f2 + ]  Checking white King & securing f line
 [ d x e5 ] , [ d x e5 ]  the threat is still on
 [ N f6 ] , [ Q g6 ]  !!! Wow...sacrifices a queen for a mating net.
 [ B x c6 ]  [ N x c6 ] , [ N c3 ]  I do not know why I made that move because he would not have been able to play [ d5 ] due to my pawn on e4.
 [ f x e3 ]  [ Q x g3 + ]  [ Q g2 ]  [ Q x e3 + ]  [ K h1 ]  [ Q x d4 ]  [ B b3 ]  [ R e8 ] , [ R f2 ]  Alternative variation: 23. [ R a e1 ] [ R x e1 ] 24. [ R x e1 ] [ Q h4 ] $19
 [ R g3 ] , [ d6 ]  forcing the king to move
 [ d5 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ f x e5 ] , [ N g1 ]  To clear a spot for the KB pawn to assume guard duty.
 [ c3 ] , [ d6 ]  White braces for the pawn move to [ d4 ] at the cost of developing his queenside knight. Black readies 4. ... [ B g4 ] in response to an anticipated 4. Nf3.
 [ d x e5 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ N g4 ]  [ B x e7 ]  [ Q x e7 ] , [ h3 ]  I get rid of the knight
 [ B e4 + ] , [ K h6 ]  He also could have played 31...[ g6 ] but didn't want to lose a pawn. Even if he did that white would still mate quickly.
 [ B x g4 + ] , [ K c6 ]  15. ..... [ K c6 ] - the BK is further exposed. Had it been my king Henry he would have been asking Glenda for his cloak!
 [ e6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ c6 ] , [ B g5 ]  Where does this bishop go here or f4? I tried this one.
 [ R a b8 ]  [ g6 ] , [ f x g6 ]  not good: this will open up Black Kings' wing...
 [ R e8 ]  [ B d4 ]  [ R e2 ] , [ a4 ]  White is missing the checkmate possibility and is just annoyingly kibitzing with Black.
 [ Q b5 ]  [ B g3 ]  [ Q x b2 ]  [ N x c4 ]  [ Q x c3 ] , [ N d6 + ]  While white is a pawn behind Black's king will be a target in the center.
 [ N x c5 ]  [ R d e1 ]  [ f x g3 ]  [ h x g3 ] , [ B f5 ]  Or directly 22... [ B g4 ] -/+ -+
 [ B g5 ] , [ O-O ]  It's good to get castled early but there was no imminent threat on the King so [ [ h6 ] ] might have been better here working toward breaking the pin on the Knight on f6. After castling if Black plays 6... [ [ h6 ] ] then 7.[ B h4 ] [ g5 ] 8.Nx[ g5 ] hx[ g5 ] 9.Bx[ g5 ] with a good game for White because of the retained pin on the Knight and the exposed Black King. Another possibility would have been [ a6 ] forcing the issue with White's Bishop on b5.
 [ N g4 ]  [ B g2 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ] , [ f5 ]  I knew he will move his pawn to [ f4 ] I do not want to trade pawn because I will allow his white bishop to control [ f5 ] So decided not to trade but get my queen back
 [ B x g5 ]  [ Q x g5 ] , [ B x f5 ]  Here I considered 12...[ Q x g2 ] but I decided against it in favour of the less risky option.
 [ e x f5 ]  [ e x f5 ]  [ Q e6 + ] , [ K h8 ]  Ok now what? I have [ B x h6 ] in mind but the knight must not be there so I tempted him with a juicy free pawn when in fact he will just help me to...
 [ Q c2 ] , [ N e5 ]  This move in retrospect i think was a mistake better was maybe Nb3...
 [ N d5 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ a x b5 ]  [ c x b5 ] , [ R f c1 + ]  20. [ R f c1 + ] - after a knight trade and a pawn trade the c file has been opened. I seize on this immediately and use my king rook as I feel that the other rook will be needed to rake down the a column.
 [ K g8 ]  [ a x b5 ]  [ a5 ]  [ O-O ] , [ d6 ]  Here we have moved on a few moves and I felt my king was a little exposed so I castled. This also freed my Rook in case I needed it. His move here appears sound and I nearly played [ N f3 ] but I noticed an aggressive attack over the next few moves.
 [ N e7 ] , [ d3 ]  5. [ d3 ] - supporting the centre and opening up the c1-[ h6 ] diagonal for Fou Lenoir.
 [ K e2 ] , [ c3 ]  forced any other move would gift the win to white
 [ N a6 ]  [ a3 ] , [ R a d8 ]  19. ............. [ R a d8 ] - over the last two moves I finally complete my retarded development and pile up on the hapless d pawn.
 [ R f4 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ R f6 ]  [ R x f8 + ]  [ R x f8 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ K g8 ] , [ R e8 ]  So in this game black made the common mistake of starting the early attack with just two pieces while forgetting to castle. White defended and won a peice after the blunder by black on move 11. Another mistake by black opened up the center so white's attack was made much easier. Black almost gained an equal game after white's mistake that lost white bishop but did not hold on to it after overlooking white's clever double fork. So overall white played good in both attack and defense (with only one serious mistake in the game) but black made several mistakes stemming from not calculating just a few more moves and not castling before beginning an attack. The first can be helped much by using the analysis board in critical positions.
 [ e3 ] , [ g6 ]  This is a new reply I see from players who confront the Potato opening.
 [ R h7 + ]  [ R e7 ]  [ B h3 + ]  [ K c7 ]  [ N b5 + ]  [ K b8 ]  [ R x e7 ]  [ Q x e7 ]  [ Q g8 + ]  [ B c8 ] , [ Q x c8 # ]  
 [ B e3 ] , [ N x d1 ]  resignation is in order
 [ N c6 ]  [ B c4 ] , [ h6 ]  waste of a tempo trying to preempt 6. [ N g5 ] and a queen rook fork
 [ Q e7 ]  [ f5 ] , [ K g8 ]  preventing the fork
 [ B d5 + ]  [ B x d5 ]  [ Q x d5 + ]  [ K f8 ]  [ Q c5 + ]  [ K g8 ] , [ Q x c3 ]  A pawn less and a cramped position is the deserved result of my blindness.
 [ B a2 ]  [ B b7 ] , [ N f3 ]  putting more pressure on my h pawn and sectioning the queen
 [ e4 ]  [ g6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d4 ] , [ N f6 ]  If you're wondering about the opening it's a kind of self-styled Robatsch defense I've been working on with delayed fianchetto
 [ B b2 ] , [ N d4 ]  Critical blunder. My queen was safe.
 [ Q f1 + ]  [ K g3 ] , [ f4 + ]  ! A pawn sac to solidify Black's advantage - White has to take since [ K h4 ] leads to mate after [ Q e1 + ]  [ K x f4 ] , [ Q c1 + ]  The queen exchange is forced and Hort resigned in a hopeless position - a spectacular game!
 [ e4 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ Q d5 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ Q a5 ]  4. ........ [ Q a5 ] - this transposes into a Scandinavian - Freddy plays an unusual line - [ a3 ] and I respond with developing my knight to f6.
 [ d4 ] , [ Q c7 ]  I had no hopes to make white abandon [ g2 ] so I have to find some other use for my queen. In a time hurry I went for a queenside attack.
 [ R f x f8 ] , [ B e6 ]  abandoning the poor lonesome b pawn to his doom
 [ e x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ B x e3 + ]  [ Q x e3 ] , [ Q x d5 ]  Following the series of exchanges Black has the stronger looking position but his Q is vulnerable to attack.
 [ e5 ] , [ B e3 ]  should have take
 [ b5 ] , [ B a2 ]  Enough of those childish games ...
 [ N c3 ]  [ a6 ]  [ a4 ]  [ h6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ h3 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B e2 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ B x d3 ] , [ Q x d3 ]  The challenge in this structure is to figure out something useful to do with the Nb8.
 [ K c5 ]  [ Q x d7 ]  [ K b6 ] , [ Q x c6 + ]  The end is nigh!
 [ N d7 e5 + ] , [ K e4 ]  Threatens the pawn.
 [ O-O ] , [ N d b5 ]  I have always thought this a strange move. If I had played [ g5 ] and he had responded [ B g3 ] this move could be particularly annoying. With [ c7 ] guarded well attempts to control the square amount to [ N a6 ] or e5.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ d3 ] , [ N d4 ]  Try and complete your development before you begin an attack. [ B g5 ] pinning the knight is a good idea too.
 [ B b2 ] , [ O-O ]  Both men have secured their Kings but Lange has a slight lead in development.
 [ R e8 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ K g2 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ R f8 + ]  [ K g7 ]  [ R e8 ] , [ B c1 ]  A hunting we will go.
 [ N c3 ] , [ e6 ]  Although the book recommend dxc I don't like to loose tempo.
 [ B x e5 ]  [ B x e5 ] , [ N x e5 ]  My lead decreases as my opponent wins a knight.
 [ Q x d5 ]  [ R x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ Q x d5 ]  [ R h d1 ]  [ Q f3 ]  [ R d f1 ]  [ Q h5 + ]  [ K g2 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ R f2 ]  [ R e2 ]  [ R a f1 ]  [ Q d5 + ]  [ K g1 ]  [ R x f2 ]  [ R x f2 ]  [ Q d4 ]  [ K g2 ]  [ K g7 ]  [ b3 ]  [ Q c5 ]  [ g4 ]  [ a5 ]  [ a4 ]  [ Q d5 + ]  [ R f3 ]  [ Q e4 ]  [ K g3 ]  [ Q b4 ]  [ h3 ]  [ b5 ]  [ a x b5 ]  [ Q x b5 ]  [ K g2 ]  [ h5 ]  [ K g3 ]  [ h x g4 ]  [ h x g4 ]  [ Q g5 ]  [ R f4 ]  [ f5 ]  [ K f3 ]  [ f x g4 + ]  [ R x g4 ]  [ Q d5 + ]  [ R e4 ] , [ Q x b3 + ]  To me this was a very fun game and despite some mistakes that could have ruined my plan I think it is a good example of how important it is to think of the possibilities you have many moves ahead not just the obvious ones that are right in front of you in plain sight :)
 [ c x d4 ] , [ Q x d4 ]  Chess is all about time. What that means is that do you have the checkmate before your opponent can checkmate you. Thus making queen moves like this one are bad because now you have to borrow "future time" in order remain balanced in the present. At this point if a move is not part of standard theory then there is a good reason for that.
 [ B g7 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ O-O ]  The other main move is 5...[ c5 ] after which I would surely have gone for the famous drawing line 6.[ B b5 + ] [ B d7 ] 7.[ e5 ] [ N g4 ] 8.[ e6 ] fx[ e6 ] 9.[ N g5 ] [ B x b5 ] 10.Nx[ e6 ] [ B x d4 ] 11.[ N x d8 ] [ B f2 + ] 12.[ K d2 ] [ B e3 + ] 13.[ K e1 ] [ B f2 + ] with perpetual check (there are ways to deviate for Black but then White has a better position). I would've been very content with a draw against such a strong player but now I'm glad it didn't end this way. After the text move I had to think on my own.
 [ g3 ] , [ B x g3 ]  ! also unexpected. Black jemmies open White's position.
 [ N b d7 ] , [ O-O-O ]  O-O-O. Long castling my goal was a pawn storm against Blacks castled King because of that plan it was necessary for me to castle long.
 [ a4 ] , [ N a3 ]  Good place to be. White has to block all the pawns and all the passages that Henri may use... Done for the a b c and d file. Now let's organise the right side.
 [ R b6 ] , [ Q f8 ]  And it happens now
 [ K e1 ] , [ Q g4 ]  Maintaining his positional advantage.
 [ c5 ]  [ d x c5 ] , [ d x c5 ]  Attempting to create a safe square on d6. But it has another problem.
 [ B e7 ]  [ O-O ]  [ d6 ]  [ c3 ]  [ N b d7 ] , [ R e1 ]  Preparing the knight maneuver Nd2-f1-[ g3 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N f1 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ N g3 ]  [ O-O ] , [ B g5 ]  The knight is pinned.
 [ e x f3 ] , [ N d4 ]  because he have castle more than me- im thinking of keeping either my pawns in a chain/or his/ from preventing castles to move about board...remember...we play an opponent that can predict moves well in advance...
 [ c x d4 ]  [ e x d4 ] , [ Q f4 ]  The Queen start the Black's attack. The pawn on [ d5 ] and [ g5 ] are in danger.
 [ c x b3 ]  [ Q b4 ]  [ N x h7 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ N f6 + ]  [ K e7 ]  [ Q g5 ]  [ Q a5 ]  [ N d5 + ] , [ K e8 ]  thirst thougt about remise then again i could play for victory
 [ K h4 ]  [ B e8 ]  [ N c2 ]  [ R g h3 + ]  [ K g5 ] , [ R a g3 + ]  45. .... [ R a g3 + ] - the black rooks chase the WK about but alas they cannot weave a mating net around the WK.
 [ N x f6 ]  [ R x f6 ]  [ Q g7 + ]  [ R f7 ]  [ Q g5 + ]  [ K e8 ]  [ f3 ] , [ Q d4 + ]  Centralizing the Queen with check and tempo gain.
 [ K e7 ] , [ B e4 ]  This is not a good move but the bishop belogs to here as the rook will get into the game.
 [ N e7 ] , [ d x c5 ]  Finally!
 [ Q e7 ] , [ Q x h6 + ]  Check again.. this is a forced mate. Still only move here is Rook to g7.
 [ N c3 ] , [ N f6 ]  in my opening I consider this and 2...[ c6 ] interchangable one happens and the other follows immediatly I have no preference of which goes first
 [ R f d1 ]  [ R d8 ] , [ Q x c6 ]  ?? the sacrifice of the pawn is beneficial to black as the h1-[ a8 ] diagonal is now open
 [ Q a4 + ]  [ K f7 ]  [ Q f4 + ]  [ K e8 ]  [ N e5 ] , [ B x e5 ]  If Black plays 23.../[ R f8 ] White answers 24.[ Q a4 + ] and then [ R x d5 ] and if 23.../[ Q c7 ] 24.[ R x d5 ] follows.
 [ g x f4 ]  [ R d x f4 ]  [ R x f4 ]  [ R x f4 ] , [ R e4 ]  White seeks a further Rook exchange. After 39. .. [ R x e4 ] 40. [ d x e4 ] Black's king couldn't advance to remove the [ h4 ] pawn via [ f5 ] since the [ d4 ] pawn would be guarding it. Black would thus have no hope of making it in time to prevent a White promotion on the b-file even if the King bagged two pawns.
 [ B x e5 ]  [ Q x e5 ] , [ Q d7 ]  White finally forces the passive queen retreat I mentioned several moves ago. Now the focus suddenly changes since Black has exchanged a fianchettoed bishop for a knight always a dangerous move. It's time to storm the citadel.
 [ B e3 ] , [ B x e3 ]  I didn't really want to exchange dark-squared bishops but took the opportunity to isolate a pawn. I could have played [ Q c7 ] but I was anxious about the fact that I was still two moves from castling.
 [ B x d8 ]  [ Q x d8 ]  [ R x e6 ] , [ Q d7 ]  Hitting my Rook.
 [ c2 + ]  [ K d2 ] , [ c1 = Q + ]  and mate in 1 the bad 7.Qd3?? sealed the fate of white on this game. Some bad choices of moves including an easy recapture that didn't happened allowed for a small material advantage easily converted in to a won endgame.
 [ g6 ]  [ R a c1 ]  [ Q d6 ] , [ R e d1 ]  18. [ R e d1 ] - threatening [ B x g6 ] discovering an attack onto the Wicked Witch of the West. Thierry however sees this attack and the Witch moves out of the way.
 [ f5 ]  [ N e4 c3 ]  [ N c5 ] , [ d4 ]  White declares his challenge.
 [ B e5 ] , [ Q d2 ]  Defending the [ b2 ] pawn while threatening 16 [ Q h6 ] 17 [ Q g7 # ] which can only be stopped one way...
 [ B h4 ]  [ g5 ] , [ f x g5 ]  Now I had to give up my little pawn chain and the e5-pawn was destined to die. But I thought that I might get quite some pressure on the kingside to compensate for that. He is behind in development - even more so if he plays dxe5. If he doesn't I can play [ e x d6 ] after which his pawn structure is no better than mine if we reach an endgame. At this stage I found it rather unlikely however that we would reach an endgame. The position is absolutely not balanced; a perfect setup for a future tactical strike.
 [ K h8 ] , [ c x d4 ]  An okay move; White has to be really careful about his next move
 [ B x b3 ] , [ B f2 ]  To take the f pawn.
 [ O-O ]  [ N x b5 ]  [ N x b5 ] , [ d5 ]  Challenging the center with a bit of a gambit move.
 [ B d2 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ e3 ]  [ e5 ]  [ d x e5 ] , [ N x e5 ]  free pawn!
 [ R x d8 + ]  [ B x d8 ] , [ B d4 ]  I don't know what else to do!
 [ d3 ] , [ B x h3 ]  Left her knight hanging so I took that too.
 [ Q e3 ]  [ Q x a2 ]  [ g4 ]  [ g5 ] , [ h x g5 ]  Oh no the white queen shares the same diagonal with the king. With this blunder black can pin the white queen with BxPg5.
 [ N c7 ]  [ d5 ]  [ c x d5 ] , [ h x g5 ]  White's only option.
 [ N x h7 ] , [ Q x d5 ]  picking up stranglers oponent did not see [ b5 ] was defended by his queen?
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ] , [ B b5 + ]  I don't know what this Sicilian is called. Not the most common I think.
 [ R e4 x e7 ]  [ R x e7 ]  [ B h4 ] , [ Q x a2 ]  39. ........ [ Q x a2 ] - my rook on [ e7 ] is pinned and lost next move so Glenda decides to take off the white isolated a pawn. It turned out to be a match-winning decision.
 [ h4 ]  [ K f6 ] , [ g4 ]  White is hoping to grind this one down.
 [ B g7 ] , [ N c3 ]  Blocks the pressure of the BSB on [ b2 ] and allows for a development there for white trying to trade both bishops.
 [ e5 ] , [ N d5 ]  Still mainline. Black's knight seeks to prevent white from playing a pawn to [ f4 ] where it would support that advanced [ e5 ] pawn. This position bears a little resemblance to Alekhine's Defense one move delayed with the pawns on [ c3 ] and c5. That extra oomph in the center makes this stronger for black than Alekhine's is.
 [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ N c3 ]  5. [ N c3 ] - after a very standard Sicilian pawn trade both sides continue to develop.
 [ f x g6 ]  [ h x g6 ]  [ Q g4 ]  [ g5 ] , [ N f5 ]  Instead of a mere retreat to safety I aggressively counter planting the Knight on a great square and attacking the Black Q.
 [ K g2 ]  [ B x g3 ]  [ B g8 ] , [ K g5 ]  the same applies with white.
 [ Q x b5 ] , [ N a3 ]  Driving the BQ away and offering the pawn on b2-- White's position is very strong after 17...[ Q x b2 ] 18. [ R a b1 ] [ Q x a2 ] 19.[ Q x b7 + ] [ K d7 ] 20.[ R f d1 + ] [ K e8 ] 21.[ R x d8 + ] [ K x d8 ] 22.[ Q x c7 + ] [ K e8 ] 23.[ R b8 + ] [ K f7 ] 24.Nb5.
 [ B b7 ]  [ R a c1 ] , [ f4 ]  got the push!! but at the cost of a pawn
 [ R x d1 ] , [ B d4 ]  Move the bishop out of the shadow of the knight blocks the d-file and covers all three pawns at the same time as well as preventing [ N c3 ] for the time being.
 [ B a6 ] , [ R x c2 ]  :(
 [ f5 ]  [ N x c3 ]  [ b x c3 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ B e2 ] , [ Q h4 ]  17. ...... [ Q h4 ] - hoping for a perpetual but Janet prevents this by moving her king forward. I try and lose my bishop in the most destructive way possible and that is to break up Janet's kingside pawns and to increase my chances of creating a perpetual check later on. However Janet ensures that this is not to be.
 [ b x c3 ]  [ c5 ]  [ O-O ] , [ N c6 ]  Normal looking move lead to disaster![ Q c7 ] is better bust still white keep some safe edge.
 [ f5 ]  [ Q b1 ]  [ Q f6 ]  [ B d5 ]  [ f4 ] , [ e4 ]  31. ... [ f5 ] 32.[ Q b1 ] [ Q f6 ] 33.[ B d5 ] f4! 34.[ e4 ] ... After 34 [ B x e6 ] [ Q x e6 ] I will force a breakthrough on Black's [ e3 ] point. Now beside the game continuation [ N f8 ] I had a strong alternative in 34..[ f3 ] which cuts off support of the White e-pawn from his comrades and imposes a powerful decisive cramp on White’s king position.
 [ B c5 + ]  [ K h1 ]  [ N d6 ] , [ B b2 ]  Opening up development and grabbing a diagonal
 [ g x h4 ]  [ Q g4 + ]  [ R g7 ]  [ Q x h4 ] , [ h5 ]  White dare not take the pawn.
 [ b3 ]  [ e5 ]  [ B b2 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ e4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ d3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ h3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N f3 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ N b d2 ]  [ N f4 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B f5 ]  [ R e1 ] , [ B x h3 ]  if [ g x h3 ] then 13...[ N x h3 ] followed by capturing the [ f2 ] pawn.Black would have 3 pawns for the piece which it apprears would be enough compensation .
 [ B x f5 ] , [ Q x g7 ]  Mistake the computer says!! best it says would have been : 29. [ B d2 ] [ K b5 ] 30. [ a4 + ] [ K a6 ] 31. [ Q x g7 ] [ Q c6 ] 32. [ N e3 ] [ B e6 ] 33. [ Q h7 ] [ e4 ] 34. [ B c3 ] [ Q d7 ] 35. [ Q h5 ] [ K b6 ] 36. [ B d4 + ] [ B c5 ] 37. [ a5 + ] Kc6. But I have long term plan and my king is protected enough and [ B d2 ] can still be done.
 [ R x e5 ]  [ e4 ]  [ c4 ]  [ K g3 ] , [ c3 ]  End game running for the finish line.
 [ Q e2 ] , [ B b7 ]  [ a3 ] is pressured and pushes the bishop to remain at hand. But the white knight on [ f3 ] will need to have support or move if an exchange here would expose the king.
 [ N x g6 + ]  [ K d6 ] , [ N x f8 ]  Black resigns with bishop and rook unmoved during the entire game. Even without the aid of the sacrificed bishop white still controlled the play.
 [ K g2 ] , [ N x d6 ]  30. [ K g2 ] seals white's fate. Yes it was fairly well sealed anyway but now his king is trapped and will never be able to get past the black rook. 30. [ K f3 ] seemed to be called for so the white king would at least have a chance to stop the pawn on the e-file from promoting and he might also support his own queenside pawn majority although it would mean he could never reach black's passed pawns on the g and h files.
 [ B x e6 ] , [ Q x e6 ]  he used his queen So a free rock
 [ R h e1 ]  [ B e4 ]  [ B h5 ]  [ N x h5 ]  [ R d8 + ]  [ K f7 ] , [ Q x h5 ]  Alternative variation: 19. [ Q x h5 ] [ K g7 ] 20. [ N x e4 ] [ f x e4 ] 21. [ B h6 + ] [(Alekhine)]
 [ B x d6 ] , [ N g5 ]  
 [ N f6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ N b d2 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ b3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B b2 ]  [ e6 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ N b d7 ]  [ O-O ]  [ a6 ] , [ c4 ]  I would rather keep his bishops hemmed in even if for the moment I suffer from the same.
 [ K g6 ] , [ R b2 ]  It's proven with this move because after getting out white comes back here since white must defend against the pressure.
 [ B x e5 + ]  [ B d4 ]  [ N b d3 ]  [ K a2 ]  [ B x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N e2 ]  [ N f2 ]  [ R f1 ]  [ N x d1 ]  [ R f x d1 ]  [ R x b3 ] , [ R d2 x d6 ]  White has at least got rid of one of the black knights. Although material is even the computer puts black 2.33 ahead
 [ a6 ] , [ Q f3 ]  8. [ f4 ] must be better than Qf3...
 [ e5 ] , [ f4 ]  The King's Gambit a very powerful opening giving up a pawn for the sake of rapid development. The King's Gambit was very popular in Anderssen's day. The King's gambit is very rarely seen in top chess today.
 [ K c5 ] , [ K a4 ]  white is out of moves... resigned...
 [ R d a2 ]  [ N x d6 ]  [ a x b5 ]  [ N x b5 ]  [ R a2 x a6 ]  [ N c7 ]  [ R c6 ] , [ e4 ]  I don't know Black's intention but I think this is not a good move.
 [ R h6 ]  [ R x c8 + ]  [ K e7 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ R f4 ]  [ R e8 + ]  [ K f7 ]  [ Q c4 + ]  [ K g6 ]  [ K h1 ]  [ R x e4 ]  [ Q e6 + ]  [ K h7 ]  [ Q g8 + ]  [ K g6 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ Q f5 ]  [ B x e4 ]  [ Q x e4 + ]  [ K g1 ]  [ d3 ]  [ R e6 + ]  [ K g5 ]  [ h4 + ]  [ K h5 ]  [ Q f7 + ]  [ g6 ]  [ R x b6 ]  [ K g4 ]  [ Q e6 + ]  [ K h5 ]  [ R c6 ]  [ Q x b4 ]  [ R x c7 ]  [ Q d4 ]  [ R g7 ]  [ d2 ]  [ R d7 ]  [ Q b2 ]  [ g4 + ]  [ K x h4 ]  [ K g2 ]  [ Q a3 ]  [ R h1 + ]  [ K g5 ]  [ R x h6 ]  [ K x h6 ]  [ R x d2 ]  [ Q c3 ]  [ R e2 ]  [ K g5 ]  [ R x e5 + ]  [ K h4 ]  [ Q f6 + ]  [ g5 ] , [ Q x g5 # ]  end of a well fought game
 [ B c5 ]  [ N c4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ] , [ Q x d5 ]  ?! dubious better is Bxd5...
 [ g5 ] , [ N g6 ]  My neat trap is gone.
 [ a6 ]  [ B x c6 ] , [ d x c6 ]  Of course black recaptures with the d-pawn otherwise [ N x e5 ] cannot be met by Qd4!
 [ c3 ] , [ c4 ]  Oh dear. Like a complete plonker I close the box around my knights again.
 [ Q x e2 ] , [ b6 ]  Necessary otherwise my position will collapse. There is no mate anymore for black.
 [ f x e4 ]  [ f x e4 ]  [ B d7 ] , [ R a3 ]  At that point I knew to things: I couldn't use the [ a5 ] pawn the way I thought and my [ e4 ] pawn was in danger. My problem I'm not very keen managing the rooks ...
 [ B x c6 ]  [ N e5 ] , [ B d5 ]  Now not Bxa7? [ R a8 ] followed by Rxa2.
 [ h5 ]  [ B d5 ] , [ K h7 ]  24. .... [ K h7 ] - trying to unpin Fou Lenoir.
 [ Q x b8 ] , [ K e2 ]  Don't want the king pined in front of a defenseless rook
 [ K d1 ] , [ h2 ]  I was expecting him to sack the knight after which I would play Rg1. But...
 [ Q c1 ]  [ Q x c3 ]  [ Q d1 ] , [ N c e7 ]  I played this move as I was afraid of White crashing through with 33.[ B x d5 ] ed 34.[ Q x d5 + ]  [ K f2 ]  [ a6 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ Q b2 + ]  [ N e2 ] , [ Q x a3 ]  Winning pawn number 3.
 [ Q e2 ] , [ N d4 ]  The 2nd knight defends the 1st [ Q x e3 ] would be a royal split
 [ B g7 ] , [ R e3 ]  bringing up the heavy artillery before the cavalry
 [ K c7 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ K d7 ]  [ K f5 ]  [ N c1 ]  [ K g5 ]  [ N d3 ] , [ B f8 ]  54. [ B f8 ] - Frere Lenoir must not allow himself to be exchanged off - see my earlier note about K & P endings with a pawn minus.
 [ Q d8 ] , [ Q f7 # ]  And checkmate. Thanks for watching and commenting. Have a nice day.
 [ e4 ] , [ c5 ]  A Fast Ladder game. I'm the challenger so my opponent begins with the Open Game and I take it to the flank with the Sicilian.
 [ B x c4 ] , [ b x c4 ]  ...so we swap bishops.
 [ R e h1 ]  [ h3 + ]  [ K f2 ]  [ R a6 ] , [ a4 ]  Preventing K-side expansion and locking in the Black KR.
 [ B x e6 ]  [ f x e6 ]  [ R e7 ] , [ R f c8 ]  Aha cunning. Ok I'll take two pawns for the one I lose at c3.
 [ f6 ]  [ R g3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ R a g1 ]  Doubling the rooks
 [ c x d4 ]  [ e x d4 ] , [ R c8 ]  Black is playing very good building pressure on the queenside while my attack on the kingside is still far.
 [ Q g6 ] , [ Q x g6 ]  take obviously he'll have to take mine and I get both his rooks
 [ B x d7 + ]  [ Q x d7 ]  [ Q x d4 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ O-O ] , [ B e3 ]  This game is showing no signs of lasting 102 moves.
 [ e x f5 ] , [ O-O ]  The idea behind this is 11.... [ f x e4 ] 12. [ B x f6 ] [ g x f6 ] 13. [ N x e4 ] [ B e7 ] 14. [ Q f3 ] giving white a good position although a pawn down however after blacks next move white has a good advantage and should be able to capitalise.
 [ K x f8 ] , [ B b4 + ]  I think 32.[ R f1 + ] [ K g8 ] 33. [ B f4 ] would have been better.
 [ a6 ] , [ a3 ]  ?! I'm not quite sure what this move accomplishes. white should probably make something happen on the kingside.
 [ Q x c3 + ]  [ K e2 ]  [ Q x c2 + ]  [ K e1 ]  [ h6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ Q x d3 ]  [ N d2 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ Q g4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ Q g3 ]  [ B x e4 ]  [ B e5 ]  [ N h5 ]  [ Q g4 ]  [ g6 ] , [ N x e4 ]  Better was 30.[ Q x e4 ]  [ Q d3 + ]  [ K f2 ]  [ Q d4 + ]  [ K f1 ]  [ Q d3 + ]  [ K f2 ] , [ Q c2 + ]  Stopping the draw damn it.
 [ B h4 ] , [ N b6 ]  on route to [ d6 ] and allows black to develop the light bishop.
 [ Q g2 ]  [ R x h1 + ]  [ Q x h1 ]  [ N g4 ]  [ N d1 ]  [ f5 ]  [ f3 ] , [ N e3 + ]  Forked his king and Knight well not really. Good to exchange pieces off.
 [ Q e7 ]  [ c3 ] , [ N h5 ]  Again trying to assail my queen.
 [ Q d8 ] , [ N g3 ]  Now I have left that pawn hanging. As well as blocking in my own Bishop. That was OK with me though.
 [ K b6 ]  [ Q d4 + ] , [ R c5 ]  Carefully plotting my kings escape route.
 [ K f6 ]  [ R x b7 ]  [ d3 ]  [ R b6 + ] , [ K e5 ]  trying to counter-play
 [ B e7 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ K c8 ] , [ h3 ]  preparing for a pawn storm.
 [ Q x c7 ] , [ N c4 ]  Now I have to be careful. Black threatens mate and there are two wasys to avoid this of which one is correct. 31.c3?? loses to 31...Bf5+! 32.[ g x f5 ] Qxc7. But I make the correct move.
 [ d3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N f3 ]  [ h6 ]  [ B e3 ] , [ R e8 ]  8. ..... [ R e8 ] - bit stuck for a sensible plan here.
 [ g6 ] , [ e5 ]  Black stopped to reinforce e5. It is my duty to take advantage of it! Taking would allow White to screw up blacks King safety
 [ Q x f3 + ]  [ K c2 ] , [ Q h5 ]  The game is just about done.
 [ N g5 ]  [ b x a5 ] , [ N f3 + ]  The defending knight of [ e1 ] is dead (unless RxN). Otherwise Rg1#.
 [ N f3 ]  [ B d7 ] , [ N g5 ]  (?) A mistake but a very plausible one. Seeing an opportunity to strike at the f7-square White goes for it. The threat is 14.Qxf7ch [ K d8 ] 15.Nxe6ch. In response I did briefly consider 13...[ N x e5 ] but quickly found Black had a much better reply...
 [ e5 ] , [ N f d5 ]  Success! The knight is stabled.
 [ N x d4 ] , [ g4 ]  White prepares f5.
 [ O-O ] , [ h3 ]  Question: Why does white move his h-pawn? Isn't he neglecting the center? The answer: Nimzowitish once said that chess mastery was revealed by making a pawn move on the wing with your mind on the center. With the prophylactic 9. [ h3 ] white prevents the pin that would otherwise undermine the defense of the d4-pawn after 9. [ d4 ] Bg4!
 [ K e2 ] , [ B c5 ]  restricting more squares
 [ R e8 ] , [ N g5 ]  "Now attack !"
 [ N g4 ] , [ R b6 ]  Nice active defensive in a desperate situation. At least white is giving black something to think about!
 [ N g3 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ b5 ] , [ b4 ]  I could have won a pawn here but think it is too early to exchange a bishop for a knight
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ] , [ g3 ]  Already something odd fianchettoing his bishop would be inadvisable due to the fact that his e pawn block the diagonal.
 [ f x g5 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ R f1 + ]  [ K e7 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N g6 ] , [ B c1 ]  The only plan was [ B f1 ] [ N b2 ] and [ N f4 ] exploiting a6's weakness... but not very appealing.
 [ N c3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ g3 ] , [ b6 ]  [ g6 ] is more common and so I was thinking of play a Botvinnik type formation but with this I decided to look for a [ d4 ] break.
 [ N d4 ] , [ Q b1 ]  there was not much to save here for white anymore... even after [ Q x c8 ] [ B x c8 ] [ N x d4 ] [ Q x e4 + ] [ N e2 ] things are looking very bad... but this move takes too much out of whites' defenses...
 [ N x e5 ] , [ Q x e5 ]  ...and I get the knight exchange and the queen gains the tempo she was hoping for sitting in the middle of the board...
 [ R c g1 ] , [ R h2 + ]  Here white announced mate in 4 beginning with 30. Rh2+. If 31. [ K f3 ] then 31. ... Qf4#. If 31. [ K d1 ] then 31. ... Qd2#. If 31. [ K e1 ] then 31. ... [ Q d2 + ] 32. [ K f1 ] Qe2#. And finally if 31. [ K f1 ] then 31. ... [ Q f4 + ] 32. [ K e1 ] [ Q d2 + ] 33. [ K f1 ] Qe2#. Instead of playing it out white resigned.
 [ B f4 ]  [ N c4 ]  [ B f3 ] , [ N e6 ]  Forking [ d4 ] and [ [ f4 ] ] defending against the threat of [ R x c4 ] and ready to meet [ R x d5 ] with ...N[ d4 ] attacking the bishop all at once. After [ R x d5 ] N[ d4 ] White cannot retreat the bishop as he loses either the rook or allows the knight to hop into [ e2 ] forking King and Queen. If White retreats his rook instead Black can play ...[ B a3 ] and the [ [ f4 ] ] bishop must fall. Instead White trys something else but the refutaion of that is easy...
 [ K f8 ]  [ B c2 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ N h4 ]  [ B e8 ]  [ N g6 + ]  [ B x g6 ]  [ B x g6 ]  [ R c8 ]  [ Q g4 ]  [ f5 ]  [ Q h5 ] , [ B f6 ]  ! Bishop-[ f6 ] will prove to be a powerful piece on the a1-[ h8 ] diagonal.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ N c6 ]  The game starts with arguably the most famous position in chess. Let me note that I truly appreciate all questions comments and critiques particularly in the endgame. My endgame is the weakest part of my game and I'm trying to improve it so all helpful tips are greatly appreciated!
 [ K b1 ]  [ N b4 ]  [ a3 ] , [ B e6 ]  Banking on the threat of [ Q a2 + ] [ Q a1 + ] Qxb2.
 [ B x f3 ] , [ B e7 ]  I was actually expecting him to attack with his [ d4 ] knight but he had other plans.
 [ Q g7 ] , [ N g3 ]  and the game was timed out. This was a bad game to annotate as the result was really unresolved.
 [ K e2 ]  [ K e7 ]  [ K f2 ]  [ R a7 ]  [ K e2 ]  [ K d6 ]  [ K d1 ]  [ R a1 ]  [ K c2 ] , [ R a7 ]  now that I tested the waters I set about preparing for my central break ...[ K c5 ] was also a consideration which puts [ e4 ] on the board in one move.
 [ B b5 + ]  [ N d7 ]  [ B x d7 + ]  [ B x d7 ]  [ N x d7 ]  [ K x d7 ]  [ Q g4 + ]  [ K e8 ]  [ Q e4 + ]  [ K d7 ]  [ Q f5 + ]  [ K d6 ]  [ Q f4 + ]  [ K c6 ]  [ Q x f7 ]  [ K b6 ]  [ Q x d5 ]  [ K b5 ]  [ Q x b7 + ]  [ K a5 ]  [ Q x a8 ]  [ K b4 ]  [ Q e4 + ]  [ K b5 ]  [ O-O ]  [ K b6 ]  [ Q e6 + ]  [ K b7 ]  [ Q d7 + ] , [ K a8 ]  It all ends badly.
 [ K g7 ] , [ R g8 + ]  It is clear tthat the king will be trapped.
 [ R x g7 + ]  [ N x g7 ]  [ B x h6 ]  [ N g4 ] , [ N f5 ]  Don't exchange when down and also His Bishop is better than mine
 [ Q d2 ] , [ d5 ]  8. [ Q d2 ] is the Rauser variation of the Yugoslav attack. All by the book so far.
 [ K x e6 ] , [ B c5 ]  White still ahead is better off trading.
 [ N h5 ]  [ N x f5 ]  [ R x f5 ] , [ B h4 ]  Now I spent a lot calculating his [ R f4 ] and my Bg5. You see it seems that [ f2 ] is weak black has the open f column and two pieces into the attack and easily the queen can go to f8... nevertheless the white position is not as weak as it seem and there is no real danger if I play with care. The trick is not to take away the bishop from the f2-[ h4 ] diagonal. His move would have been g5! to which I would have played e4...
 [ B f5 ] , [ N b d2 ]  Threatening e4.
 [ Q x e4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ Q c2 ]  [ c5 ] , [ R f e1 ]  My general plan was to develop my pieces and work slowly toward exchanging down into an endgame with a material lead. I wanted to maintain initiative as well. This never seems to happen when I play freddy--well not yet anyway.
 [ N b5 + ] , [ K d7 ]  [ N x a7 ] does not win a pawn because of [ R e8 + ] [ K f2 ] [ f4 ] gx[ f4 ] gx[ f4 ] [ R e1 ] [ R x e1 ] [ K x e1 ] [ B x f3 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ K c6 ]  [ N x d5 ] , [ K x d5 ]  My king has now replaced the bishop as the blockader of the pawn.
 [ O-O ]  [ O-O ] , [ N c4 ]  White realizes that [ N e5 ] does not really help: but this retreat is already too much...
 [ g5 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ N a4 ] , [ N f3 + ]  Now we see me storming through Raj’s defences!
 [ g4 ]  [ h x g4 ] , [ h x g4 ]  Black has managed to exchange some pawns and even create a passed pawn on [ e4 ] but the Kingside pawns are now firmly blockaded and the initiative passes to White.
 [ B x e7 ]  [ Q x e7 ] , [ Q a4 ]  The point. The queen attacks the pawn on [ a7 ] and simultaneously prevents black from castling since that would leave the knight 'en prise'. (For your information en prise is a French expression meaning that a piece is unprotected and may be captured.)
 [ K h6 ] , [ Q h4 # ]  I think at a few places he may well have had the game. Letting his castle crumble too early on and allowing me long range shots ( like move 36) were strategic errors that can be hard to see at time because one is trying to just attack something somewhere. A good game and tense. Manfred is not to be underestimated but just needs to slow down a bit now and then then he will become quite a dangerous player.
 [ h6 ] , [ d x e5 ]  As he didn't capture my pawn I capture his. There is the possibility of another pawn advancing on either side of the king turning this into some sort of gambit...
 [ R e6 ]  [ Q g3 ] , [ K h8 ]  Black's king doesn't want to share the g file with the white queen.
 [ f6 ] , [ f4 ]  why not?
 [ B e2 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ O-O ] , [ R c8 ]  11. .... [ R c8 ] (after developing my bishop and rook as planned white starts to pile up on the d file with 12. [ R f d1 ] - Wayne remarked that [ R c8 ] was a little slow and wondered whether I was preparing to advance the c pawn).
 [ d4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ d x c5 ]  [ Q a5 ]  [ N d4 ] , [ N e4 ]  I'd prefer that he castles kingside but I can't imagine him doing it. I wasn't brave enough to try [ e5 ] to force him to play fx[ e5 ] and I'd have an open file to attack that weak pawn on e3.
 [ f x e6 ] , [ h x g4 ]  and get the pawn back
 [ N h7 ] , [ Q b3 ]  setting up a change of scenery...
 [ B b4 ] , [ R f1 ]  Move to protect rook from bishop's glare.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ] , [ N f3 ]  King's knight.
 [ d5 ] , [ B f2 ]  This again was a GameDB move which suggested it was the best option for white at this stage I was aware of the rule of not moving a piece more than once in the opening but felt no choice other options looking at this position could have been [ N c3 ] but not really comfortable with the position of the bishops
 [ K f2 ] , [ B a4 ]  To allow the king to get into the game and still guard the [ c6 ] square...
 [ R x e4 ]  [ K g7 ]  [ K g2 ]  [ R f5 ]  [ R f2 ]  [ K f6 ]  [ R x f5 + ]  [ K x f5 ]  [ K f3 ]  [ R x e6 ]  [ R x e6 ]  [ K x e6 ]  [ K e4 ] , [ b5 ]  This move seems necessary. My opponent told me there is a win in this pawn ending for White but I haven't found it yet. He's probably right though.
 [ e x f5 ] , [ B x f5 ]  Amazingly neither player now has a piece covering [ d5 ] that gaping hole in my position!
 [ R c8 ]  [ R x h5 ]  [ R f8 ] , [ K e3 ]  Presumably [ K e3 ] is to break the pin on the f file.
 [ Q d7 ]  [ h3 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ B x e4 ] , [ d x e4 ]  joeyjp has a really bad pawn structure here. He had doubled pawns and then a gap on both sides of the pawns....not good. For the most part pawns are at their strongest when there is a chain of them with protection support from other pawns on either side of them.
 [ f3 ]  [ Q d4 ]  [ N g5 ] , [ Q x e5 + ]  Give check take material. Lather rinse repeat.
 [ N f3 ] , [ B g4 ]  Pinning the knight but it just gives up the two Bishops after [ h3 ] better is Bf5.
 [ e4 ]  [ c6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ d5 ] , [ N f3 ]  The Two Knights variation of the Caro-Kann
 [ g x f3 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ B x b7 ]  [ R b8 ]  [ B c6 + ]  [ B d7 ]  [ B x d7 + ]  [ Q x d7 ] , [ h x g5 ]  Attacks beginning to form on the g and h ranks.
 [ B x a3 ]  [ R x a3 ] , [ Q b4 ]  Black at least wins a pawn.I pretty much calculated this ahead of time.
 [ B d3 ]  [ N b d7 ]  [ B b2 ] , [ O-O ]  ..and that is out of the database.
 [ f5 ]  [ e x f6 ]  [ e ]  [ p ]  [ B x f6 ] , [ c3 ]  21. [ c3 ] - necessary to block the diagonal off from that nasty black dsb!
 [ R f8 ] , [ R d2 ]  Guess what this modest advance portends!
 [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ d3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ B g4 ]  All standard developing moves for both sides so far -- this is a standard KGD position. My move here as black is aimed at getting that knight off the board as it controls too much of the center here.
 [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ] , [ e5 ]  At this point I morph it back into a king's pawn opening.
 [ N x e7 ]  [ Q f6 ] , [ R d g8 ]  At first I thought this move would stump my opponent and give me a little breathing room but it didn't.
 [ N h5 ] , [ B e3 ]  I was very doubtful about this move. [ B [ h2 ] ] seemed natural. But what if black wakes up on the Q side and I find my lsb useless in [ h2 ] byting granite on [ d6 ] while my diagonal is undefended? So I preferred to place it here so to support [ d4 ] and trheaten either to exchange black's lsb for the N or to force [ e5 ] (dxe6ep!?)... a classic and juicy situation with some interest. Stronger players will see the weaknesses better than me...
 [ d x c5 ] , [ N x c5 ]  Aiming at b3. Now white can hardly send pieces toward black's kinside for there is need to protect the king...
 [ e4 ] , [ c5 ]  I find this game interesting and therefor I have decided to annotate it.
 [ B f3 ]  [ Q a2 + ]  [ B d5 ]  [ Q a7 ] , [ h6 ]  Black doesnt have to hurry. 32..[ h6 ] was necessarry in view of [ Q b8 ] and suddenly it is white who wins.
 [ Q h5 + ]  [ g6 ]  [ N x g6 ] , [ N f6 ]  This is somewhat stronger than 8...[ h x g6 ] 9. [ Q x h8 ] Nf6.
 [ a1 = Q ] , [ Q d8 # ]  Black has two queens but in his haste to promotion he failed to ask why white made that strange queen move 43. Qg5. I really hated to play the final move. Remohgramps is a friend and he played this game quite well. Had he seen the checkmate and prevented it white could probably still get a draw by chasing the black king around and looking for ways to get the white queen on a1. Or maybe not. Maybe black could tuck his king away and promote his pawn then win with two queens to white's one. I really hoped Remohgramps would see white's little trap and play something like 43. ... [ Q b8 ] or 43. ... Ke8. Instead he played 43. ... a1=Q??? (how often does a pawn promoting to queen get ???). Now that black had the two queens white is faced with winning or losing - no chance of a draw now. My hand was forced but I hated playing the move.
 [ N f3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ N c6 ]  The four knights variation.
 [ B f4 ] , [ Q d4 ]  Looks dangerous but it's the only move to at least stay in the game. 19...Qf6?? loses a piece to 20.e5.
 [ e6 ]  [ d x e6 ] , [ Q f6 ]  Giving the pawn back in order to keep a relatively stable king side.
 [ c x d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ R x d4 ] , [ N h5 ]  In a game like this where you should not deviate I'm all but certain that Boris has made his position worse due to the N being on the rim.
 [ R h2 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ Q b8 ]  [ N c5 ] , [ R e h5 ]  He keeps going to play for the win.
 [ B b2 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N b4 ] , [ R c1 ]  He sees my threatened fork and moves to defend..
 [ N x e5 ] , [ B c1 ]  Brilliant move! Rather than taking my knight as I was sure he would do my opponent put up annother death threat! This time on h6.
 [ K f7 ] , [ N g5 + ]  ...hold on...are we seeing a come back...?
 [ R h2 ]  [ K b4 ]  [ R x h4 ] , [ K x b5 ]  So both of us have outside passed pawns. Who will get there first?
 [ f x g3 ]  [ Q h3 + ]  [ K f2 ]  [ Q x h2 + ]  [ K e1 ]  [ Q x g3 + ]  [ R f2 ] , [ R h1 + ]  The end is almost near.
 [ R h g8 ]  [ h4 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ B x e7 ]  [ R x e7 ] , [ R a b1 ]  All the minor pieces are gone. I feel I have a decent shot in the all-heavy-piece end game due to my better Q-side Pawn position.
 [ d x c5 ] , [ R x b7 ]  Now W's attack is on and it is a stronger attack than what B is able to muster at this point.
 [ Q d2 ] , [ N c d5 ]  move for nothing black had no special plans
 [ e x d5 ] , [ Q d7 ]  long overdue and a clear mistake at this point; last option was [ c5 ] (covers Na5) [ a x b5 ] [ a x b5 ] [ N d2 ] (against [ e4 ] supporting c4) Ra8...
 [ g x h5 ] , [ N x b4 ]  Maybe white figured out the combination I just described and decided on the move that wins him material. Either way black has now accomplished his overwhelming advantage on the queenside and white is doomed.
 [ K g5 ]  [ g3 ]  [ R f6 ] , [ R x f6 ]  the first exchange
 [ Q h4 ] , [ g3 ]  the only way to delay mate I could think of...
 [ N b4 ]  [ Q a4 + ]  [ K f8 ] , [ N e2 ]  Clearly the losing move brought about by the undended squares deep in the white position.
 [ Q h5 ]  [ N g6 ]  [ R a b1 ] , [ b6 ]  I would have looked at [ N x e5 ] or even RxN
 [ B e3 ] , [ B d6 ]  [ b6 ] 15.[ B b5 ] [ B b7 ] would have been probably a better solution.
 [ K d6 ]  [ R b1 ] , [ h3 ]  The problem is that black will eventually win [ d3 ] and I will have two passed pawns to contend with.
 [ K d7 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ Q g6 ] , [ Q e2 ]  No trading queens. If I can bring my queen up the left side I will have a strong attack.
 [ N f3 ] , [ N f6 ]  Pawn for bishop? P[ c5 ] would work with [ c3 ] answered by Bf6. But that is moving the bishop a lot at the expense of development. Still black would gain better control over the center.
 [ B f1 ] , [ R a8 + ]  After seeing what has happened to me in a couple of games combined with what Susan Polgar showed in a stalemate lecture that would end the game in draw by repetition instead I attempted the same idea. That's right I'm trying to trick to black into a draw by repetition. And that's by checking on the seventh and eighth rank. Jack even asked me what I'm trying to do and I told him that I thought that this might be a draw. So I persist on these checks.
 [ N f3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ d3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N x e5 ] , [ d x e4 ]  Simple exchange leaving him slightly more positionally advanced
 [ N g5 ] , [ Q x a2 ]  The white king is quite safe and the defense of the bishop has been abandoned.
 [ Q e2 ] , [ B e6 ]  I considered moving my bishop to [ g4 ] and hopping his queen would take it but I decided that it would be too trappy.
 [ K a7 ]  [ B e3 + ] , [ d4 ]  29. ..... [ d4 ] - this block is as flimsy as a meringue and Afro's steed will crush it.
 [ R e1 ] , [ Q f3 ]  36. ......... [ Q f3 ] - here she is! Oooh nasty nasty now the rook on [ h1 ] is en prise. I move the rook to [ h2 ] thinking I have covered everything but here comes a stunning Master Pseudo-Sacrifice.......
 [ Q x h7 ] , [ c6 ]  The pretending ends.
 [ g x f6 ] , [ Q h5 + ]  The point of my rook sacrifice. Black's King is now out in the open and if [ K d8 ] [ N f7 ] picks up the rook and black is way out of position
 [ B f5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ N x e4 ] , [ B x e4 ]  10. ...... [ B x e4 ] - knight trade.
 [ R x f8 + ] , [ Q x f8 ]  not accepted
 [ c5 ]  [ R b c8 ]  [ a4 ]  [ R c b8 ]  [ Q g3 ]  [ R b c8 ] , [ R h4 ]  30. [ R h4 ] - Freddy tries to pile in on the h file but it is gonna be hard for him to get 3 heavies on it!
 [ f4 ] , [ B x f4 ]  29. [ B x f4 ] - the pawn drops now though.
 [ c3 ]  [ h6 ]  [ h3 ]  [ Q d6 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ B c7 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ Q e6 ] , [ N g3 ]  The position was gaining tension and I had to be careful or I would lose something valuable.
 [ B g5 ] , [ O-O ]  (?) Castling right into where my rooks will aim.
 [ e4 ] , [ Q d8 ]  I wanted to keep up the pressure on the d pawn. I did consider [ Q a5 ] too. The computer likes [ Q b5 ] and considers the resulting position equal.
 [ K x d4 ] , [ B b2 + ]  Skewer for Bxh8. Okay with me. I'll still be a point ahead.
 [ K g5 ]  [ Q h4 + ]  [ K f5 ]  [ Q f4 + ]  [ K e6 ] , [ Q e4 + ]  ? Here the computer prefers [ Q c4 + ] followed by a series of checks and king advances that force Black backwards: Best: +1.03 » 59. [ Q c4 + ] [ K e7 ] 60. [ Q c7 + ] [ K f8 ] 61. [ Q b8 + ] [ K g7 ] 62. [ Q b7 + ] [ Q f7 ] 63. [ Q b2 + ] [ K h7 ] 64. [ Q h2 + ] [ K g8 ] 65. [ Q h6 ] [ Q f5 ] 66. [ K h4 ] [ K f7 ] 67. [ Q g5 ] [ Q e4 + ] 68. [ Q g4 ] [ Q e1 + ] 69. [ K g5 ]  [ Q b7 + ]  [ Q e7 ]  [ Q f3 + ]  [ K g7 ]  [ Q c3 + ]  [ K h7 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ Q e5 + ] , [ Q f4 ]  ? allowing the exchange again: Mistake: +2.64 » 64. [ Q f4 ] [ Q x f4 + ] 65. [ K x f4 ] [ K h6 ] 66. [ K [ g4 ] ] [ g5 ] 67. [ K h3 ] [ K h5 ] 68. [ K g3 ] [ g4 ] 69. [ K g2 ] [ K h4 ] 70. [ K f2 ] [ K h3 ] 71. [ K f1 ] [ K g3 ] 72. [ K e2 ] [ K g2 ] 73. [ K e3 ] Best: +1.15 » 64. [ K [ g4 ] ] [ Q f5 + ] 65. [ K h4 ] [ Q e4 + ] 66. [ K g3 ] [ K g7 ] 67. [ Q c3 + ] [ K f7 ] 68. [ Q c5 ] [ K e6 ] 69. [ Q b6 + ] [ K f5 ] 70. [ Q f2 + ] [ K e5 ] 71. [ Q c5 + ] [ Q d5 ] 72. [ Q e7 + ] [ K f5 ] 73. [ Q f8 + ] [ K e4 ] 74. [ Q f3 + ] I think the computer's analysis is flawed in the first line. At move 70 [ K f2 ] looks like a blunder to me. White needs to maintain the opposition.
 [ N e2 ] , [ d5 ]  Would have been strong if not for en passant!
 [ e x d5 ]  [ R e1 ] , [ N f6 ]  ? 10...[ B e7 ] was called for. Can you see the mate?
 [ N b5 ]  [ d6 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ a6 ] , [ N c3 ]  whilst that knight forray seems a little pointless white's developed his queen in the last two moves whereas black just has some funny looking pawns
 [ h5 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ B e4 ]  [ f3 ]  [ B f4 + ]  [ K d1 ]  [ B d5 ]  [ N f5 + ]  [ K e6 ]  [ N d4 + ]  [ K d6 ]  [ N f5 + ]  [ K c7 ]  [ N e7 ]  [ B b3 + ]  [ K e1 ]  [ b5 ]  [ R c8 + ]  [ K d6 ]  [ N f5 + ]  [ K d5 ]  [ N e7 + ] , [ K d6 ]  [ K e6 ] would prevent another check by knight though P[ c6 ] would be lost. It is lost anyway white has two pieces on it (knight and rook).
 [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ] , [ N c6 ]  The Accelerated Dragon from the Sicilian could reach this position and also a lot of different [ N f3 ] openings. The Maroczy Bind is feared by some players but I am happy playing against it since I am familiar with its principles. White wants to consolidate and slowly grind me down so I need to break the bind before White can consolidate
 [ a5 ] , [ R h3 ]  
 [ K f6 ] , [ Q e5 + ]  ...and the game is over. Black can struggle more and white can allow himself not to take the black's queen with: 25. ... [ K e7 ] 26. [ Q c7 + ] [ K f6 ] 27. [ Q d8 + ] [ K f5 ] 28. e3-[ e4 + ] [ K x f4 ] 29. [ R f1 + ] [ K e5 ] 30. [ Q c7 + ] [ K d4 ] 31. c2-[ c3 + ] [ K e3 ] 32. [ Q f4 + ] [ K d3 ] 33. [ R f3 + ] [ K c4 ] 34. [ d5 + ] any 35. [ Q b4 # ] Sure there are more defences for black but the game is won if white just gets the black's queen.
 [ K a3 ]  [ g6 ] , [ K a4 ]  Now white has successfully blockaded the a pawn due to my poor play.
 [ K g4 ]  [ K e5 ]  [ R a5 + ]  [ K e4 ]  [ R a4 + ]  [ K d3 ]  [ K f3 ] , [ R h8 ]  
 [ R a c8 ] , [ N g5 ]  White seeks to provoke a pawn move thus weakening Black's fortress. It costs him two tempi.
 [ B g2 ] , [ O-O ]  But I decided to get my K to safety first. It's hard to know which is better but when by my gut which told me to do this. The reason being is that after 11...[ N x d5 ] 12.[ c x d5 ] I'm either forced to bring my N on the rim with 12...[ N a5 ] or undevelop it back to it's original square. Even on the rim I felt that Nathan might be able to find a way to prevent me from castling. He probably wouldn't have especially since I also have ...[ N e7 ] which will happen. But I asked myself why I should even chance it. As he has played moves that have taken me by surprise. In one or two cases his surprises is what stopped me from doing so which just wasn't good. I figured that this however would stop Nathan from bringing his K to safety. As my anticipation was that he'd play 12.[ N c3 ] to prevent what I'm about to do liquidate. And my answer to that would've likely been 12...[ a6 ] to open up a file for my R and prevent 13.[ [ b5 ] ] I realize now that attacking on [ [ b5 ] ] would've been of no concern because Nathan would've done so earlier if it were. But once he castles that's when go forward with my liquidation plan.
 [ B x d3 ]  [ Q x d3 ] , [ e6 ]  calmy handled by Donner...
 [ f3 ]  [ O-O ] , [ g4 ]  I think that [ B e2 ] with 0-0 and [ a3 ] is more safe.
 [ K g8 ]  [ N x h6 + ]  [ g x h6 ] , [ Q x h6 ]  At this point I almost resign but than I took another look at my position a further more and said"I'm no where near losing." If my rook wasn't on [ b7 ] I would have resign right on the spot. After playing [ f6 ] my fear of losing right away is all gone and I'm not worry about [ R g3 ] because my knight would simply take it. Also there's a reason why I like my knight on e4. JUST WATCH
 [ N f6 ] , [ f3 ]  White definitely is not moving a piece. Now this makes weak the important square g3.
 [ N f3 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ B d3 ] , [ B g7 ]  6. ...... [ B g7 ] - I complete the kingside fianchetto and the Fool's Mate diagonal is firmly closed off.
 [ c3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e5 ]  [ Q e4 ]  [ Q x e4 ] , [ d x e4 ]  Pleased to exchange queens. With such an aggressive opponent I figure the less material the better.
 [ c5 ]  [ R c7 ]  [ R d4 ]  [ R x c5 ]  [ R x e4 ] , [ K h1 ]  ????
 [ e x d5 ] , [ Q x d5 ]  I debated this for a while. 8. ...[ N x d5 ] is clearly very strong but I wanted to keep a hold on [ e5 ] with that knight so I went with the queen. Also I figured I had at least an even game after 9. [ B d2 ] and a winning game after 9. O-O so why not.
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ g6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B g7 ] , [ e4 ]  I thought we were heading to a four pawns game which OldGus just finished a mini-tournament.
 [ Q f8 ] , [ Q g6 + ]  launching another attack on the king (and the a pawn proves its usefulness because in this situaltion Black might have been safer with Kb5)
 [ Q g5 + ]  [ K c8 ]  [ Q x c5 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ Q x c7 + ] , [ K x c7 ]  White should win this...
 [ B d3 ] , [ b6 ]  I'm following my plan.
 [ K d6 ]  [ K c3 ] , [ c5 ]  41. ........... c5!! - I think this is the winning move. If 42. b5?? then I will play [ a x b5 ] and Henry will be able to catch up with the a pawn in time. My opponent will be faced with a wall of black passers and I will be spoilt for choice as to which one will have a sex change back into Glenda!
 [ B e3 ] , [ Q d7 ]  setting a trap
 [ K f5 ] , [ R x c2 ]  ...but two pawns putting me ahead by four pawns for a bishop giving me a fighting chance.
 [ N x f3 + ]  [ g x f3 ] , [ Q b6 ]  I got myself into a trap. The N can't retire and now BxN is possible. But...
 [ c5 ]  [ K d2 ]  [ c4 ] , [ K c3 ]  King on right time at right place.
 [ N c6 ]  [ e5 ]  [ Q e8 ]  [ B e4 ]  [ N d8 ]  [ B d5 + ]  [ K h8 ] , [ b3 ]  Wasn't sure about this move. It's pointless when you've already got a k-side attack and initiative is so important. Anyway computer doesn't like it but he played in to it so he was obviously distracted by it. Mission accomplished.
 [ B e3 ]  [ R f c8 ] , [ Q a4 ]  The position is fairly equal here and White looks to trade queens.
 [ B x f4 ]  [ b x c3 ] , [ B d6 ]  I could ahve taken the pawn but as you can see this pawn is going now where so why take it now when you can take it later. With [ B d6 ] I have ensured that your king is in the centre. This move follows advanced rules in positional play so I totally expected this one to be a superise for you.
 [ N f3 + ]  [ K g2 ]  [ Q h5 ]  [ R f h1 ]  [ Q g6 ] , [ B b6 ]  Defends against the mate threat with tempo
 [ h4 ] , [ h3 ]  21. [ h3 ] - to halt the advance of the h pawn.
 [ N c7 ] , [ R e d1 ]  GK doesn't like 18. Red1. This is because this could eventually leave the knight at [ e4 ] unprotected and break up W's king's defenses. Post-game analysis prefers 18. [ B g3 ] which threatens the pawn at [ d6 ] and keeps the initiative with W.
 [ K d2 ]  [ R d8 ]  [ g3 ]  [ a5 ]  [ R f1 ]  [ B c6 ]  [ f5 ]  [ B a4 ]  [ f x g6 ]  [ f x g6 ]  [ R f6 ] , [ B e8 ]  Check the computer here but I think 51.[ N f4 ] should hold. definitely better than the move i played
 [ Q x c8 ] , [ R f x c8 ]  Queens off the board now black should have enough to win this game now although he is rather blocked in by his own pawns my general plan at this point was to just advance everything together and with a few simplifying exchanges the extra pawns should lead to a relatively simple endgame win.
 [ R d3 ] , [ R x h6 # ]  Notice how White got a small advantage (a piece positioning) and exploited it trading pieces to make the advantage more dramatic.
 [ B x f4 ] , [ N x f4 ]  As I took back with the N. I had considered 18.[ Q x f4 ] but didn't want to exchange Queens. As I'm just ready to do that yet.
 [ e5 ]  [ f4 ]  [ e x f4 ] , [ N f3 ]  King's Knight Gambit. Once you play this move you'll most commonly see the Fischer Defense (3..d6) the Schallop Defense (3..Nf6) or the Cunningham (3..d7). In this game my opponent played the still-popular classical variation (3..g5).
 [ Q e2 ] , [ O-O ]  I now have full power on the f-file.
 [ d4 ] , [ e3 ]  never attack a gambit pawn: best is probably a3...
 [ Q a5 ] , [ N c7 + ]  Starting a nice maneuver that results in gaining the [ g7 ] pawn and then starting the final attack.
 [ Q e2 ] , [ Q e5 ]  centralising the queen and hitting the g pawn.
 [ d5 ]  [ R e d8 ] , [ N a6 ]  sure this is too bad for you because trades are good for me as long as I'm ahead. But it isn't catastrophic. You have 2 central pawns on dark squares right now so your bishop has limited scope and that knight has been jumping around everywhere causing trouble. So this trade is not that terrible for you. But if you were worried about it you could have moved one of those pieces a few moves earlier.
 [ K f7 ]  [ N x d6 + ]  [ K e7 ]  [ N f5 + ]  [ K d7 ] , [ R h7 + ]  Here I think black was just moving and had ceased really considering the board but his game has been lost for a few moves now.
 [ B d6 ] , [ B g2 ]  A little late. I wanted to castle first!
 [ N c3 ]  [ e6 ] , [ N f3 ]  4. [ N f3 ] - this was the most popular move and most favourable to white in the database and it does develop a piece. However I wonder whether I should have now taken the opportunity to have exchanged on d5.
 [ N c3 ] , [ B e6 ]  ? It's never fun when that was a mistake flashes through your head and it's about your own position. Better to slow down!
 [ Q b7 ]  [ Q c2 ] , [ B e7 ]  Preparing to castle
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ f4 ] , [ e x f4 ]  Probably the world's oldest opening.
 [ N x e7 + ]  [ K h8 ]  [ a3 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ B x e4 ]  [ Q x e4 ]  [ g4 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ N f5 ]  [ Q e6 ]  [ Q b5 ]  [ b6 ]  [ R h e1 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ B d4 ]  [ f6 ]  [ f4 ]  [ Q d7 ]  [ Q d5 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ h4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ R x d4 ]  [ R a e8 ]  [ R d e4 ]  [ K h7 ]  [ h5 ]  [ g6 ]  [ R e4 e7 + ]  [ R x e7 ]  [ R x e7 + ]  [ Q x e7 ]  [ N x e7 ]  [ g x h5 ]  [ Q x h5 ]  [ c5 ]  [ Q g6 + ]  [ K h8 ] , [ Q x h6 # ]  
 [ e x d5 ]  [ Q x d5 ]  [ B h6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B x g7 ]  [ K x g7 ]  [ Q g5 ]  [ Q e6 ]  [ O-O-O ]  [ d6 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ Q f5 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ Q f6 ] , [ R e4 ]  Thrilling move I hardly manage my h-file.
 [ O-O ] , [ B d6 ]  The bishop will become a target on this square and it will be easier for White to open the position for his better coordinated and developed forces.
 [ K g2 ] , [ Q h5 ]  offering a queen trade. It is slightly inaccurate though since the task of defeating black is now slightly more complex.
 [ R f1 ]  [ e7 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ N h6 ]  [ h3 ]  [ N f5 ] , [ B f6 ]  Caruana still has to be careful. There are still some tricks left. He must stay focus to hold this very important game. The good news is Caruana's position is better than half and hour earlier. The bad news is Carlsen will squeeze him until breakfast tomorrow.
 [ R d f1 ]  [ B x f3 ]  [ R x f3 ]  [ c6 ]  [ b3 ] , [ d5 ]  chalanging the centre
 [ Q e7 ]  [ N x g5 ]  [ R x f1 + ]  [ R x f1 ] , [ Q x g5 ]  21. ...... [ Q x g5 ] - Matthew forces an exchange of rooks before taking off Freddy's knight. Now if Matthew can maintain his material advantage into the endgame it will be decisive.
 [ R f8 ] , [ N e4 ]  27. White is beginning to close in around Black's King.
 [ b x c5 ] , [ g x f4 ]  Now to get the queens that already developed out of the way.
 [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ h6 ]  Black develops the King’s Knight to [ f6 ] trying to stake his claim into the center with both Knight and Bishop attacking the e-pawn. Again I debated with which approach I should take – should I play [ [ e5 ] ] and go with the slow but more solid approach or should I try to develop quickly and hope to overwhelm my opponent? I decided to move forward with [ N c3 ] – grasping more control over the center with a simple developing move. Although the e-pawn is defended by both knights if one can be immediately displaced then the central pawn could fall. However as we will see White has an interesting option available to create a strong imbalance while his pieces are mobile and his King relatively safe. Instead of 9…[ h6 ] I believe Black would have been safer with 9…O-O to be followed up with 10.[ [ e5 ] ] [ N d5 ] 11.O-O.
 [ b6 ]  [ R f6 ]  [ a5 ]  [ a4 ] , [ K b7 ]  34. ....... [ K b7 ] - the only move to avoid going further behind in material.
 [ K b1 ] , [ Q e4 + ]  First check of the game lol
 [ e5 ]  [ N g8 ]  [ f4 ]  [ a5 ]  [ N b d4 ]  [ B a6 ]  [ b3 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ B f3 ]  [ N e7 ] , [ h5 ]  Hadn't quite calculated this fully- 22.O-O-O fails to hg when the N is pinned. 22...[ N f8 ] 23.[ B f6 ] [ R g8 ] ([ R h7 ] hg [ R x h1 ] gf ) 24.[ h6 ] [ N h7 ] 22...[ R c8 ] 23.hg [ N x g6 ] 24.[ B h5 ] Ndxe5!? 25.fe [ N x e5 ] maybe hangs on but 24.[ R x h8 ] Nx 25.[ R h1 ] [ N g6 ] 26.[ f5 ] ef 27.[ B x d5 ]  [ N f8 ]  [ B f6 ]  [ R g8 ] , [ h6 ]  Hmm this can't be right. After 24...[ N h7 ] Black is suddenly looking pretty good. Black currently can't castle and once the [ R h8 ] is exchanged off this kingside looks a little exposed. It's difficult to see quite how White should procede however since the tempting [ R d g1 ] starts to look a little uncomfortable after moves like [ Q b6 ] and Nf5. Maybe the simple 24.hg followed by swapping rooks and [ R h1 ] will suffice.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ d6 ] , [ B d5 ]  All book up to here. This move is strange and probably bad but not terrible.
 [ N x f7 ]  [ Q b6 ]  [ N x h8 ] , [ c4 ]  Sort of overlooked but am not surprised to see Ted play this. I was wondering what to in order to capitalize on my advantage. Yes he is going to a piece but the question is can I get something to exacerbate the situation? Definitely and I am going to do that with my next move.
 [ K e6 ]  [ K c3 ]  [ K e5 ]  [ d4 + ]  [ K e4 ] , [ d5 ]  d5! My plan is to sacrifice bishop pickup [ g2 ] and then begin my queenside attack.
 [ B x e2 ] , [ K g3 ]  This is still winning.
 [ K c2 ] , [ R e3 + ]  [ R x d1 ] would give white a definite advantage but I thought of finishing the game instead.
 [ B b4 ]  [ B d2 ]  [ b6 ]  [ e3 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ B d3 ] , [ O-O ]  The game has moved into a typical queen pawn setup.
 [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ] , [ d6 ]  I think this is where we leave the book lines.
 [ R f8 ] , [ N x b7 + ]  Black saves the rook but nothing can really save him now. He's doomed to lose material. Black's king stands on an open file but the white knight is in the way. He needs to move with check. So he does. Sacrifice #3.
 [ Q e7 ]  [ B c6 ]  [ Q x f7 + ]  [ K x f7 ]  [ N e5 + ]  [ K f8 ]  [ N x g4 ]  [ B x b5 ] , [ c x b5 ]  And White has turned the tables on Black coming from a pawn down to a pawn up. My only hope is to liquidate to a drawn ending.
 [ d x e5 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ B x e3 ] , [ f x e3 ]  Exchange of pawns and bishops leaves us with an open d-file and half-open f-file and I have no immediate control over either due to my knights. I also have some horrible double pawns on the e-file that are threatening the Black knight however my LSB is more attacking with a sight over h7...
 [ N x c3 ] , [ d x c3 ]  I'm gonna do [ c4 ] at the right time there is no hurry. It's better to keep the bishop right now.
 [ R x h7 ]  [ R x h7 ]  [ Q x h7 ] , [ g x f5 ]  ? This allows a combination by white. However if black had allowed [ f x g6 ] that looks unpleasant too.
 [ e4 ] , [ B e6 ]  This Bishop has now spent four moves to arrive at a square it only needed one move to reach.
 [ K b8 ]  [ h5 ]  [ R d c8 ] , [ K f1 ]  20. [ K f1 ] - interesting move - that is to make way for Freddy's other knight to perhaps do a tour de France into my position.
 [ N a2 ]  [ R a4 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ R a1 + ]  [ K d2 ]  [ R x d1 + ] , [ R x d1 ]  hes got three islands i want to get in the endgame.
 [ N x g6 + ]  [ h x g6 ]  [ B x g6 ] , [ B h6 ]  ...and my K is miserably closed in!
 [ Q x f2 ] , [ B f3 ]  So I block the queen's retreat. Believe it or not this has all been seen before and I reached this position with white having been following the opening databases on Gameknot. This position is roughly equal. Although white is 3 pawns down it is hard for black to complete his development.
 [ h4 ]  [ K d6 ] , [ g6 ]  Desperately marching pawns
 [ N c3 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ e3 ]  I was tempted to play 5. [ B g5 ] here too. I was influenced by the fact that [ e3 ] was more popular on the opening databases.
 [ R d1 ]  [ N e6 ] , [ R d5 ]  i'm glad to exchange but first i make the winning move do you see it?
 [ K x f8 ] , [ a3 ]  Hoping to harass the Black Queen.
 [ B x a8 ] , [ c6 ]  ! sealing the B's fate
 [ b3 ]  [ N b6 ] , [ Q c2 + ]  Nothing gives another queen's check. White is doomed.
 [ d4 ]  [ e x d4 ] , [ N x d4 ]  4. [ N x d4 ] - the Exchange Variation of the Philidor - white appears to have command of the centre but black has a few surprises up her sleeve.
 [ g6 ] , [ Q d2 ]  Any idea's for white? The main threat now is Nb6...
 [ R e2 ] , [ Q b3 ]  Setting up a more dangerous threat. Black needs to remove the obstructions on the open e-file now.
 [ d5 ]  [ B b3 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N b d7 ]  [ N x d7 ] , [ Q x d7 ]  8. ....... [ Q x d7 ] - knight trade.
 [ K g8 ] , [ Q d5 + ]  If it weren't for my knight on [ d8 ] he'd have mate. As it is he's got an extremely strong attack.
 [ K h7 ] , [ Q h4 + ]  ok... back on track
 [ Q d7 ] , [ N b c3 ]  I wonder if Black expected immediate castling.
 [ N g f6 ]  [ O-O-O ]  [ B d6 ] , [ N e4 ]  So as to avoid a potential exchange on [ g3 ] doubling White's pawns on the g-file
 [ N c6 ] , [ e4 ]  Trying for a strong center presence.
 [ B g6 ] , [ e4 ]  The fact that all my manouver from [ Q b3 ] was aimed to contest the center block the lsb's action etc. etc. made me kind of happy but maybe [ B b5 ] or [ B g2 ] were better plans. It is normal to delay the lsb's developement: I want to bring it out when it attacks not a plain [ B e2 ] just to put it somewhere. And [ B b5 ] means to exchange it with the knight with no scope.
 [ Q h4 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ B e3 ] , [ b6 ]  24. ......... [ b6 ] - screens out white's dsb and releases my queen rook for action as he will not be tied down to the defense of my a pawn.
 [ e x d3 ]  [ c x d3 ]  [ d x e3 ]  [ B x e3 ] , [ R f e8 ]  23. Qg3?? - I think this was my fatal mistake. I think [ B d2 ] had to be played here. Do you the Inquest Jury agree?
 [ d6 ]  [ B b5 + ]  [ c6 ] , [ B c4 ]  Black must defend against QxPf7#. This is not difficult to manage though.
 [ B d3 ] , [ B g4 ]  A line that leads to sharp play. 6.. [ g6 ] is a popular alternative
 [ R f8 ]  [ Q g7 ] , [ K e8 ]  [ Q [ d8 ] ] and letting the pawn would have been better. It may lead to draw but not now. The black King and rook are fixed and I have to manage to join other piece in the attack. One possibility was my rook moving as it followss to a1-a2-a1-h1-h8. It's long. There is another also that long plan. Moving my knight as it follows on g1-f3-h2-g4-f6. I decided thats stronger cause queen on [ d8 ] might help against rook on [ h8 ] but not that much against knight on f6.
 [ c4 ]  [ N h6 ]  [ d3 ] , [ g6 ]  Defending the Knight.
 [ h3 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ d3 ] , [ N c6 ]  10. ..... [ N c6 ] - a developing move. I would have liked to have played [ [ a6 ] ] here but it would have been no use because the pawn on [ [ a6 ] ] is pinned to the rook on a1.
 [ R x d8 ] , [ Q x d8 # ]  I hope it helps. Remember: I'm not an expert I'm just an amateur and I can be deadly wrong.
 [ N d7 ] , [ R f f3 ]  after [ e5 ] dx[ e5 ] [ B d3 + ] [ K h8 ] [ Q h5 ] [ N f6 ] White would have a serious attack...
 [ K e8 ] , [ Q h5 + ]  If the white queen could now have given check on [ g6 ] then [ Q g7 ] with attack on [ R f8 ] would be possible. So here is the idea: Move the dance to the h-file eliminate [ h7 ] and then bring the dance back to the g-file.
 [ Q x f6 ] , [ d4 ]  Threatening Qg2#.
 [ f x e4 ] , [ d3 ]  poisoned paw offered
 [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ g6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ e4 ]  [ d6 ]  [ f4 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B e2 ]  [ c5 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e6 ] , [ e5 ]  Normal would be here 8.[ N f3 ] ed 9.cd [ R e8 ] 10.0-0
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ] , [ b3 ]  The Snyder Sicilian variation (played by none other than Master Short). I had meant to play an Alapin with 2.[ c3 ] but didn't realise I had played [ b3 ] instead. I'm quite fond of the queenside fianchetto in general so it was just a little mind-slip and fortunately I'm quite familiar with the position. With best play White doesn't really obtain an advantage in the opening but what matters is who is more familiar with the resulting positions and plans. With this position White looks to get the dark squared bishop working through the center to the kingside from the start.
 [ B a5 ]  [ b6 ]  [ B c3 ] , [ N c6 ]  Both sides have missed an opportunity. White's [ [ h3 ] ] seemed likely to stall the attack for now and black has not yet proceeded with the attack playing [ N c6 ] heading away from the offensive. [ [ h3 ] ] for black was important now.
 [ Q x a6 ] , [ R c7 ]  I think here that [ K e7 ] would be better as it would link the rooks and allow for castling the hard way
 [ Q c8 ] , [ Q g4 ]  22 [ Q g4 ] threatens mate at [ g7 ]  [ Q h4 ] , [ N f5 ]  24.....[ N f5 ] QR fork
 [ c3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ d3 ] , [ d5 ]  Seems like a good time to strike at the center.
 [ h3 ]  [ R c8 ]  [ O-O ]  [ Q d7 ] , [ N b6 ]  Nice fork but he has options
 [ N c3 ] , [ a6 ]  I do not like a bishop to roost with his sites on my king. Do a6.
 [ R x e4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ c4 ] , [ R a b8 ]  Black resigns
 [ N h7 ] , [ N e4 ]  As Black I'm looking to restrict the movement of White's knight and hopefully use it's lack of mobility to my advantage. It's only 'safe' square is [ f8 ] which is actually a trap that I'd seen as a possibility just after White turned down the draw.
 [ f4 ] , [ B c7 ]  So now I retreat the [ B d6 ] to prevent him from exchanging on d6. Now he should continue with [ f5 ] continuing his king's side play. I thought [ a4 ] preventing [ b5 ] was quite a sound move too. Instead he increases pressure on [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ b5 ]  So I immediately reduce the number of pieces he has attacking e5. I want to always have enough pieces to recapture in [ e5 ] with a knight or bishop rather than the pawn.
 [ N f6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ a6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ e6 ] , [ f3 ]  preventing [ N x e4 ] and preparing for [ B e3 ] (without the annoying Ng4)
 [ c x d3 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ N e3 ]  [ Q d7 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ g x f6 ]  [ O-O ] , [ B g6 ]  ? a wasted move.
 [ g x h4 + ]  [ K x h4 ] , [ R f8 ]  Black recognizes 35.[ B h5 ] and moves the Rook that would have been captured otherwise. What is missed is the potential for a fork on the 7th Rank when the King is forced to retreat. The option of exchanging Rooks with 34...[ R d8 ] was available but possibly even better was 34...[ R h8 ] which would have forced 35.[ K g3 ]  [ B h5 + ]  [ K h7 ]  [ R d7 + ]  [ K h8 ] , [ R x b7 ]  White is finally ahead in material with plenty of opportunities available.
 [ h4 ]  [ R e5 ]  [ Q c4 ] , [ R e e2 ]  Reopening the mate in 2 threat!
 [ R x h1 ] , [ f6 ]  My only chance here was to try and push the e pawn. Sadly I think this position is probably lost for black at this point with proper play.
 [ R c6 ]  [ N a2 ]  [ a5 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ Q c7 ] , [ R c3 ]  26. [ R c3 ] - challenges the c file and one pair of rooks is now exchanged.
 [ R g d2 ]  [ B x f5 ] , [ R d2 x d8 ]  The bishop will still be there
 [ h6 ] , [ N x f5 + ]  Desperation. There were much better moves available than this.
 [ R d5 d8 + ]  [ R x d8 ]  [ R x d8 + ]  [ K g7 ] , [ K h3 ]  another unexpected move as it leaves whites queen completely exposed
 [ B f4 ]  [ d6 ] , [ N f3 ]  [ g5 ] is still possible but it doesn't go well for black (told by experience).
 [ B e7 ]  [ e3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ h4 ]  [ N b d7 ]  [ N d2 ]  [ c5 ]  [ f3 ] , [ Q b6 ]  I am slightly pleased with the position.
 [ N x c5 ] , [ N d5 ]  Not sure what I was thinking here. [ R a b8 ] would probably have been better.
 [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ e6 ] , [ N c3 ]  Often [ N f3 ] is played here to avoid the Nimzo-Indian.
 [ N x h8 + ]  [ K g8 ]  [ Q g6 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ B x h6 ]  [ K f8 ] , [ Q f7 # ]  Trying to move the bishop to escape didn't help. An earlier 15... [ N f6 ] helps much more. Overall an interesting if not silly game.
 [ R f7 ]  [ B h5 ] , [ N c6 ]  n[ x e7 ] r[ x e7 ] was possible but black's dsb is not looking like a very good piece. I think the decision not to take was sound.
 [ N x c2 ]  [ R b1 ] , [ N d4 ]  Black knight has nothing to fear shouldnt waste moves like that instead building rooks on g file would be a good plan for black at the moment.
 [ R a e8 ]  [ B f3 ]  [ N e7 ] , [ Q c1 ]  [ B c3 ] looks better to me.
 [ K g8 ]  [ Q d5 ]  [ Q g3 ]  [ K c1 ]  [ Q g4 ]  [ K b2 ]  [ K g7 ]  [ Q b7 ]  [ Q g5 ]  [ K a2 ]  [ Q g6 ]  [ K a3 ]  [ Q c2 ] , [ Q e7 ]  A simple less-than-objective move here such as: [ Q f2 ] [ Q h2 ] [ Q c4 ] [ Q c8 ] [ Q b1 ] [ Q d1 ] [ K g6 ] [ K g8 ] will result in a draw due to perpetual check. It is in conditions such as these that Black has small hopes.
 [ R e8 ]  [ Q g3 ] , [ B f6 ]  threatens 14...[ B x c3 ] 15...[ R x e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ B e7 ] , [ R a d1 ]  attack queen (in the long run)
 [ N f6 ]  [ g3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ B g2 ]  [ c6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B f5 ]  [ d3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N b d2 ]  [ h6 ]  [ b3 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ B b2 ]  [ O-O ] , [ Q e1 ]  Normally I'd annotate more because my belief is that the more you annotate the better. But because of what Joe outlined it's not needed as there's no thought process that goes into this. Another reason was for chess terms when I didn't understand. Slowly but surely I'm doing less of that since the idea is seeing the big picture and what the board is telling me. Well what's mentioned shows that there's no big story yet. The other reason for annotating more is once I feel that we've moved passed book and now going by what I'm thinking and trying to access the opponents thought process. But at a much stronger given that there hasn't been any deviation there's nothing to keep about. The idea is staying in book against a Senior Master. Therefore I'm basing things on what Joe said for this annotation. Therefore it continues with "Moves 1 through 9 are in book.My central dominance is already apparent at this juncture white sq control my Bishops have much more open control than white especially with his blocked in [ g2 ] Bishop."
 [ Q x b4 ]  [ Q x b4 ]  [ N x b4 ]  [ g6 ]  [ B x e6 ] , [ R x e6 ]  This is first time I see this in 4 or 5 year. I recall this type of position draw but my opponent disagree.
 [ b5 ]  [ c x b5 ] , [ a x b5 ]  23. [ a x b5 ] - pawn trade.
 [ N x f4 ]  [ N x f4 ] , [ N x e5 ]  With the white bishop gone I win a pawn.
 [ R f2 ]  [ R a1 ]  [ R f1 ] , [ B a3 ]  White has properly defended against the pin but black can still force trades that further the developoment of black's pieces.
 [ d5 ] , [ d4 ]  With this [ a4 ] is a loss of tempo.
 [ d6 ] , [ B c4 ]  Oh oh. White seeks an early end to the game with QxPf7#. Doesn't seem very sporting.
 [ R g1 ]  [ B e4 ]  [ Q g4 ] , [ B f5 ]  The bishop was en prise.
 [ O-O ]  [ N e7 ] , [ B e3 ]  it has to come at some point...
 [ R b1 + ] , [ K a5 ]  Oof.
 [ h6 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ a6 ]  [ e5 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ B h2 ]  [ N b d7 ] , [ f4 ]  White is conquering the center...
 [ g5 ]  [ B g3 ]  [ e6 ] , [ e3 ]  After [ N d2 ] [ B b4 ] also...
 [ N d6 ]  [ B g3 ] , [ N f5 ]  With a plus for white but nothing decisive. Black is passive but his position is tough to crack.
 [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ] , [ N c6 ]  seems not a successful opening for the black. development of knights before pawns might give white to conquer the center and initiative to develop the game on either side he wants
 [ b3 ]  [ c5 ] , [ d5 ]  Locking my Knight into a poor position
 [ B x e7 ]  [ Q x e7 ] , [ R f d1 ]  the D file is critical because it is half open and my pawn is not part of my chain.... my opponent is trying to exploit this weakness while i try to prepare for a [ d5 ] push
 [ R f e1 ]  [ R d e8 ]  [ R a d1 ] , [ R e7 ]  I'm not sure if this is the right sort of idea. Comments welcome.
 [ K b8 ]  [ Q x b5 + ]  [ K c8 ] , [ Q a6 + ]  Do I have draw? Will it be wise? I have +3 I can afford the loss of the knight but I wanted to use it into the attack. RxN to [ N e5 ] would work?
 [ O-O ] , [ e5 ]  9. e5? - I think this is where my position goes down south. I would appreciate some feedback from the floor here as to:- a. Is the question mark too harsh i.e. could white have played better further on in the game and saved it or b. if that is not the case then any suggestions? They will be much appreciated. Cheers. Joanne
 [ d6 ] , [ R g5 ]  surprised he missed that.
 [ Q x c7 ]  [ R x c7 ]  [ K g3 ] , [ R d7 ]  Black's R threatens to penetrate.
 [ N d5 ]  [ B e4 ]  [ c6 ]  [ B x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ] , [ Q d2 ]  26. [ Q d2 ] - the queen moves onto the d file because it is blocked. He moves his rook from the d file onto the e file and I put my queen on [ f2 ] to give additional protection to the f pawn.
 [ N b6 ] , [ Q h5 ]  ?! A risky decision which is not altogether certain in its prospects. Sacrificing a pawn to attempt an attack.
 [ R x e5 + ] , [ N e6 ]  Sealing off White's attempted counter-attack.
 [ K c6 ] , [ R d8 ]  [ e4 ] was the alternate move. Not [ N f4 ] g5.
 [ R c8 ]  [ Q x c7 ] , [ R x c7 ]  15. ........ [ R x c7 ] - the queen trade duly occurs.
 [ R e7 ]  [ R x e7 ]  [ Q x e7 ] , [ Q x e7 ]  The game is over! Good job gfb3! You were at a disadvantage for most of the game. However black made some bad moves and you took advantage of it! Sometimes that's how you win you know? I know I've won some games where I made some mistakes in the early game but then my opponent made some mistakes in the mid game. I was able to take advantage of his mistakes and come back for the win. In essence I felt this game was won due to black's poor play in the mid game. He had better position and piece advantage...but made some grave errors and [ g f b3 ] made him pay for it! At this point the game is basically over and I don't have any more relevant thoughts on the game. Congrats gfb3! Good game!
 [ R x g8 ] , [ R g3 ]  ! stopping any hope of the g-pawn promoting
 [ e5 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ d4 ]  [ d6 ]  [ c4 ] , [ N b6 ]  Already violates important opening rules about having to move the same piece twice. But I guess as a master you are allowed to break the traditional rules every once in awhile.
 [ K g8 ]  [ Q b3 + ]  [ K h7 ] , [ Q e6 ]  Wow! Totally unexpected. This is when I started taking the game seriously. I was expecting [ N d2 ] (which as game shows later was necessary...) but with such a drastic centralisation of the white queen I suddenly have few squares to defend. After long (20 minutes or so) deliberations I decided to play Ne5. Interesting sequence would be 20...[ N [ [ e5 ] ] ] 21. B:[ [ e5 ] ] de 22. Q:[ [ e5 ] ] and here N:[ e4 ] seemingly a nice move comes across simple 23. Rf7. Hmmm interesting...
 [ R d c8 ] , [ h4 ]  increasing the pressure on the kingside
 [ e4 ]  [ B g7 ] , [ f4 ]  With 3. [ f4 ] White initiates the aptly named Three Pawns Attack.
 [ K a5 ]  [ h4 ] , [ K x a4 ]  68. ..... [ K x a4 ] - I was half-expecting [ h4 ] here but I think I can still win from there.
 [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ B b4 + ]  The Bogo Indian instead of the "normal" Queens Indian. I never had much respect for it but now I do have!
 [ e4 ] , [ N f6 ]  I adore Alekhine's defense - this may be because it is an opening one is told repeatedly not to play and its naysayers have a ver serious point. Unlike others of my pet openings (specifically Reti and the Dutch) - which are unpopular but still played at the grandmaster level - this one is specifically considered sub-standard and many theoretical articles on the subject will say that [ N f6 ] is not a serious reply to 1.e4. Nonetheless I have found that it is in fact quite playable *if* you play it often and prepare well. The biggest problem with Alekhine's in my opinion is not the tempo loss from 2.[ e5 ] [ N d5 ] but the sheer instability of the structure. Simply stated you have to memorize variations - a lot of variations - because so many moves are playable for white and several of them lead to fundamentally different structures with a TON of tactical traps that either player can fall in to. The plus side to this memorization chore is that Alekhine is rare at all levels of play and if you prepare you will reach very sharp very tactical positions which you know and your opponent does not - the result is that your opponent is busy calculating while you're still playing on book. This particular game is one I played against someone who usually plays more precisely than I do on the whole - he is consistently 100+ points higher rated and a dedicated [ e4 ] player. The first time I used Alekhine's defense against him he played 2.[ [ d3 ] ] and went on to win after squeezing out a middle game advantage (and I played a howling blunder at the end...oops). After that loss I developed a refined system for 2.[ [ d3 ] ] and this game is I think a beautiful example of that preparation coming to fruition.
 [ g x f3 ]  [ R a c8 ] , [ f4 ]  Was trying to temporarily prevent 19. ... [ Q g5 + ] while providing additional support to my e pawn. 18. ... [ R a c8 ] seems to be an attempt to undermine that pawn (as far as I can tell).
 [ e x d5 ]  [ c x d5 ] , [ Q c5 ]  A powerful move that protects the d pawn and pins the [ e7 ] knight.
 [ f4 ]  [ e x f3 ]  [ e ] , [ p ]  This is what White wanted you to do! It enables him to develop his knight and he also gains an open file for his attack on your king. Better was 9...b5.
 [ N d4 ] , [ Q c5 ]  pins the knight with the idea of playing [ e5 ]  [ Q e3 ] , [ Q d5 ]  now threatens mate but is also aimed at [ a2 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ Q x a2 ] , [ Q h6 ]  the idea must be to try forcing a draw or even play [ N g5 ] to go for a win so the knight must go
 [ R a6 ]  [ B g6 ]  [ a4 ]  [ B e8 ]  [ K f3 ]  [ K f7 ]  [ f5 ]  [ g6 ]  [ K e4 ]  [ g x f5 + ]  [ g x f5 ] , [ R a8 ]  Game note: "41...[ R a8 ] obvious fork if 42.[ R x a8 ] Bc6"
 [ R b2 b5 ] , [ K a4 ]  Again I was more comfortable moving towards my pieces where I had better chances for evasion.
 [ B d7 ] , [ N e8 ]  !! very strong move.
 [ B b8 ]  [ R c8 ]  [ B d6 ] , [ R d8 ]  Now the move 41. [ R d7 ] winning the [ a7 ] pawn is inevitable
 [ Q a6 + ]  [ K f2 ]  [ Q b6 + ]  [ K f1 ]  [ Q b5 + ]  [ K f2 ]  [ Q c5 + ]  [ K f1 ]  [ Q c1 + ]  [ K e2 ] , [ Q g1 ]  I considered that this move will block the situation on this side of the board and that black would have had to lose the game to my joined pawns. But black found a way to unravel.
 [ N e7 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ N f7 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ B h6 ]  [ B x h6 ]  [ N x h6 ]  [ N b d2 ] , [ f4 ]  I didn't want to take [ f4 ] as I felt that I'd be opening up my King.
 [ g3 ] , [ B f8 ]  Carlsen has nothing. All he is doing is trying to grind hoping that Caruana will get careless. Seriously neither side has anything here.
 [ K b5 ] , [ N d5 ]  At least I can move another piece! NxN gives a check followed by Rxf5... at last. But too late!
 [ N f6 ]  [ B x c4 ] , [ e6 ]  Thar she goes. Let the bsb out for early castling.
 [ e x d5 ] , [ c4 ]  10. [ Q b3 ] [ B d3 ] and [ a4 ] are also good choices.
 [ K e2 ]  [ R b1 ]  [ R c2 ]  [ Q d4 ] , [ Q x b6 ]  I try to offer my Q to defend me better...
 [ e x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ] , [ N f6 ]  The other common line is 4. …[ B c5 ] where White has either 5. [ B e3 ] [ Q f6 ] 6. [ c3 ] 0-0 7. [ B c4 ] with a tense position or else 5. [ N x c6 ] [ Q f6 ] 6. [ Q d2 ] [ d x c6 ] with Black's activity compensating for the slightly damaged pawn structure. Of course not [ N x d4 ] 5. [ Q x d4 ] when White's Queen radiates power over the entire board and cannot be easily challenged. I chose 4. …[ N f6 ] because in my opinion it gives Black good chances to complicate the game and outplay the opponent.
 [ Q x c2 ]  [ R x a1 ]  [ R x a1 + ] , [ K h2 ]  ...so looking at it...black is in a completely won game ...a rook up and beautiful bishops...against awkward donkeys...
 [ Q f5 + ]  [ K e2 ] , [ Q e4 ]  My queen is very nicely situated on [ e4 ] it's central and it pins his knight. Black has a huge advantage. This also threatens [ N x d4 ] as both his knight and his pawn are pinned.
 [ e6 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ B b4 + ]  [ N d2 ]  [ B x e2 ]  [ Q x e2 ]  [ N d4 ] , [ Q d1 ]  At some point here I'm hoping for a sneaky Q-[ a4 ] for + and grabbing one of his minor pieces.
 [ Q x d3 ] , [ d5 ]  Allows me to centralize a knight make space for my LSB to get into the game and gets me closer to finishing my development. While I could have moved my b pawn to allow my LSB out I don't want to give up the angle for my queen to attack the king by blocking the [ b6 ] square.
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ] , [ N c3 ]  I'm going to play the Closed variation against the Sicilian looking to close off the queenside and attack and win on the king-side---although here it didn't work out that way. But my position was strong enough to allow changes to the plan and still deliver a strong attack.
 [ N e1 ] , [ N g6 ]  Preparing for ...P-KB4-[ B5 ] and also opening the diagonal for ...Q-[ R5 ] ch.
 [ Q x b3 + ] , [ K a1 ]  [!] This time it's good as Black can't take the c-pawn with check.
 [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ e6 ]  Block propably hoping for Nimzo-Indian... Anyway nothing special yet
 [ B d6 ] , [ B e2 ]  lsb now developed
 [ h5 ]  [ b4 ] , [ R d g8 ]  Now what the position tell us? What about the disposition of the pieces? Had he played that [ f4 ] or not moved his king I guess he would be a little less late.
 [ h6 ]  [ h5 ]  [ B h7 ] , [ N c5 ]  A mistake by white as you will see
 [ B b7 ] , [ R c1 ]  Shoring up the c file which may very well be opened soon.
 [ f5 ]  [ B h7 ] , [ f6 ]  Trying to force Erika to undevelop the B but it won't work.
 [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ] , [ N x d4 ]  4. [ N x d4 ] - all standard Sicilian moves. Black now moves his knight to [ f6 ] and Freddy leads the development race by moving his knight to c3.
 [ N b6 ]  [ B a3 ]  [ a5 ] , [ Q x c3 ]  I am expecting you to play 16 ...[ N x a4 ]  [ N x a4 ] , [ Q b3 ]  I am prettry sure you saw 17. Qxc3? Bd7! and black is defending
 [ N x e8 ] , [ c4 ]  In the meantime I am still interested in promoting.
 [ e4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ] , [ e x d5 ]  Exchanging right away against the French Defense. White has better moves.
 [ h6 ] , [ e5 ]  Time to open up the game. I don't have time to get my K saved.
 [ f x e5 ] , [ N e4 ]  then go on whith plan
 [ f5 ]  [ e x f5 ]  [ e6 ]  [ f x e4 ] , [ R x f7 + ]  Not [ e x d7 ] of course
 [ R b1 ]  [ N a4 ]  [ B x c7 ]  [ B c3 + ] , [ K d1 ]  
 [ K d7 ]  [ K b5 ] , [ K c7 ]  37. ..... [ K c7 ] Henry comes to the defense of the [ b7 ] pawn.
 [ c5 ]  [ f4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ N g5 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ Q x g4 ]  [ N x g4 ]  [ B x f7 + ]  [ K d7 ]  [ B e6 + ]  [ K c7 ] , [ B x g4 ]  The King has been chased off to the Q-side where it is exposed to attack by White's swarm of minor pieces. White has garnered two minor pieces for his Q but both of his extra two are as yet undeveloped so this is his priority even with the potential fork on [ f7 ] available.
 [ K b3 ] , [ Q g6 ]  ? With this move Black allowed me to force the draw which I gladly did since I could not see a way to win this game.
 [ K f1 ]  [ N f4 ] , [ Q a4 ]  Oh great. He blunders away his king.
 [ O-O ] , [ B g5 ]  Strengthening white's grip on the fields d5/[ e4 ]  [ d x c6 ] , [ b x c6 ]  Keeping the option open to attack the center with c6-[ c5 ] but at the const of another tempo. Its probably better than [ N x c6 ] however as that leaves white's mighty center formation unchallenged
 [ R e6 ] , [ N e2 ]  The white knight wants to sit on [ c3 ] but the [ c2 ] pawn is itching to get into this game even if only briefly.
 [ B e7 ] , [ N c3 ]  I see that Black's Bishop and Queen are aiming at [ h4 ] threatening mayhem. Not seeing any defense I Continue my development and aim a second piece at [ d5 ] which I hope to seize.
 [ N f6 ]  [ g3 ] , [ g6 ]  This is the Anglo-Indian: Black intends to fianchetto his King's Bishop and attack the White center from the flanks. Of course as yet White doesn't have a center to attack.
 [ N x d4 ] , [ e x d4 ]  ?????? Definitely the losing move. [ B f4 ] is more than black can stand.
 [ R e7 ]  [ g x h4 ]  [ R d x d7 + ]  [ K c6 ] , [ B b2 ]  Trying to attack his rook on h8.
 [ N x h5 + ] , [ K f7 ]  33. ........ [ K f7 ] - a centralisation of the BK - vital for the endgame.
 [ a x b4 ]  [ O-O ]  [ Q e2 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B f5 ]  [ N d4 ] , [ N d6 ]  Discovering an attack against the queen winning a bishop she can no longer hang around to protect.
 [ N x e5 ]  [ d x c3 ] , [ Q b5 + ]  Looks like it wins a piece but doesn't because...
 [ K d8 ]  [ N x d5 ] , [ B f8 ]  The other option was [ B h8 ]  [ Q x f6 + ]  [ K d7 ] , [ Q f5 + ]  !!
 [ d5 ] , [ d4 ]  ...such as a Queen's Pawn opening...
 [ O-O ] , [ d x e5 ]  White didn't defend his fragile center so it's time to win a pawn.
 [ Q c7 ] , [ R d c1 ]  hmm .. was that the wrong Rook on d file ?. at this point I am getting tempted and looking for ways to play [ e5 ] ....or /and [ d5 ]  [ Q d7 ]  [ R f d1 ]  [ R f e8 ] , [ B g5 ]  I considered giving up the Bishop for Knight and then [ e5 ] ?
 [ K f2 ]  [ Q g3 + ]  [ K e2 ] , [ d5 ]  preparing [ B g4 ] and adding pawn "d" in the battle
 [ N e5 ]  [ B h7 ]  [ c3 ]  [ B d6 ] , [ f4 ]  This is the good move by white.
 [ B x f2 + ] , [ K g2 ]  As said Black now has two hanging bishops it is hard to see where to go from here.
 [ g6 ] , [ N c3 ]  in order to move Ra [ d1 ] and then ...[ B x h7 + ] ...[ R x d4 ]  [ a6 ]  [ R a d1 ] , [ Q c5 ]  i still can attack the knight
 [ K e4 ]  [ c6 ]  [ B c4 ] , [ Q g2 + ]  only one place to move to
 [ h5 ] , [ K g2 ]  This kicks the knight and protects the weak [ h3 ] pawn.
 [ R e1 ]  [ R d7 ]  [ Q e3 ] , [ R f7 ]  Black has wasted two moves and it has not cost him anything; this is a mark of how claustrophobic white's position is.
 [ N h5 ]  [ N g5 ]  [ N f4 ]  [ g3 ] , [ N g6 ]  19. ..... [ N g6 ] - this move allows me to win another pawn. You will see how.
 [ O-O ]  [ N a4 ]  [ R f c8 ] , [ N x c5 ]  ! reducing pieces for a won endgame.
 [ f x e4 ] , [ B x c8 ]  Threatening Fork still
 [ f x e6 ] , [ f5 ]  Freeing [ f6 ] for the queen since White's knights currently prevent her moving anywhere useful.
 [ Q g3 ] , [ O-O ]  Looks like it blunders away a bishop but if my opponent plays [ B x f6 ] then I play [ Q x f6 ] [ Q x g4 ] [ Q x f2 + ] [ K d1 ] Qf2[ b2 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ Q x f6 ]  [ Q x g4 ]  [ Q x f2 + ]  [ K d1 ]  [ Q x b2 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ Q x a1 ]  And I end up ahead by a rook and two pawns for a knight
 [ K a4 ]  [ R e4 ]  [ R h1 ]  [ B x h6 ]  [ R x h4 ]  [ B f8 ]  [ R h1 ] , [ K d4 ]  Yay! I finally break into the fifth rank. Now my king can eventually support my pawns to the end.
 [ Q f4 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ B a6 + ]  [ K d8 ] , [ R h e1 ]  trying to trade pice for piece.
 [ d5 ]  [ B g2 ] , [ d x e4 ]  All too happy to exchange the pawn and get my knight out with tempo.
 [ B x h6 ]  [ B x h6 ] , [ R d1 ]  Black has three options [ Q b6 ] [ Q e7 ] and Qg5. I think [ Q g5 ] would have been best. If you can find a way for white to force the win after [ Q g5 ] please let me know I couldn't find it.
 [ g6 ]  [ g4 ]  [ B g7 ] , [ a4 ]  6. [ a4 ] ? White are making a lot of mistakes. After 5. g5?! I thought that the would push against my castle and control [ f6 ] which would have forced my knight to go to [ e7 ] which is not really a good place.
 [ R e2 + ]  [ K g3 ]  [ R g4 + ] , [ K f3 ]  I have gotten the pieces into the proper positions.
 [ Q x f7 ] , [ R e8 # ]  Nice mate by the Rook and that cheered me up because I lost my membership on Queenalice. Good Game.
 [ B x e3 ] , [ R x e3 ]  Black has won the Exchange.
 [ K d6 ]  [ N x h6 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N f7 + ]  [ K c5 ]  [ N x g5 ] , [ b5 ]  Again to mention that playing 28. [ a4 ] is correct to make a passed pawn and provide King infiltration.
 [ B g2 ] , [ B b7 ]  A well known double edged position. 11. f2-[ f3 ] d5-[ [ [ [ d4 ] ] ] ] 12. c3-[ [ [ [ d4 ] ] ] ] c5-[ [ [ [ d4 ] ] ] ] 13. e3-[ f2 ] f6-[ g4 ] 14. c2-[ a4 + ] b7-[ c6 ] 15. a4-[ [ [ [ d4 ] ] ] ] f8-[ [ c5 ] ] 16. d4-[ [ c5 ] ] b6-[ b2 ] 17. c5-[ c6 + ] e8-[ e7 ] 18. f2-[ c5 + ] e7-[ f6 ] 19. f3-[ g4 ]  [ O-O ] , [ B e7 ]  White has a weird position with the bishop in e3. The idea was to sacrifice the pawn's central advance in order to cause some problems to black. Now the point is white has the chance to recover the pawn via [ Q [ a4 ] + ] so currently black cannot go [ [ [ [ d4 ] ] ] ] due to cx[ [ [ [ d4 ] ] ] ] cx[ [ [ [ d4 ] ] ] ] Qa4+! and whatever black does white recovers the pawn. This also happens if white goes BxB. The queen must retake leaving the black diagonal guarding d4. Those are the two reasons black can't play [ [ [ [ d4 ] ] ] ] and crush me. Now it is clear that black is just preparing his castling seen that my developement is not quick or easy. The knight needs two moves to become an useful piece and I don't see a good future for it. On [ d2 ] it blocks the rook's action and white wants to have a rook on [ d1 ] stopping [ [ [ [ d4 ] ] ] ] even after the castling. But that means the knight has to develop to a3... an almost useless square in this position. So I considered: 12. R[ d1 ] o-o. And then? 12. [ [ [ f3 ] ] ] seemed interesting. We have to take into account that black missed Ng4! where my dsb must retire or be awfully exchanged. Based on the previous move black is not considering it... but hey at any moment black can change his mind and attack that way. So 12. [ [ [ f3 ] ] ] stops both knight's jumps ([ N [ e4 ] ] is not really dangerous but...). It also prevents black to play BxB at some point (in some lines she has to or she will lose d4). It also prepares [ B f2 ] and [ e4 ] a good plan for white not being squeezed and keep the pressure on [ c5 ] and avoiding d4. All this sounds good but now seriously: you play to win not to defend. 12. [ [ b4 ] ] could be a good way to proceed. I am not really threatening anything. [ N [ e4 ] ] can't help black because of [ [ [ f3 ] ] ] but [ R c8 ] that is a move surely on her agenda anyway. I don't want to help her to develop. And then? 12. [ c4 ] may seem crazy but look: if black moves [ [ [ [ d4 ] ] ] ] BxB and black has to decide among QxB cxd cxd Bx[ [ [ [ d4 ] ] ] ] or d4[ x B d3 ] B[ x R a8 ] d3[ x f2 + ] [ R x f2 ] c4!. But it is doubtful the attack will compensate the material loss. But anyway: Why should black move the pawn in d5? He has no reason to do it. If I take [ c x d5 ] her knight gets into the action so I won't do it. Now: look this funny line starting with an original idea: 12. a4!?. It is based on the idea that I have a "spare" tempo. And I want to avoid to "simply defend". The advantage of the next [ [ [ a5 ] ] ] is that it threatens the queen so it blocks any black's action (except a check) and gives me more power on d4. If [ Q d6 ] R[ d1 ] becomes attractive for white and [ [ b4 ] ] comes again into consideration. [ [ [ a5 ] ] ] blocks the square for the queen checks but still BxB is "on" against d4. But I didn't see it at once and analyzed the following: 12. [ a4 ] d4!? Just suppose. Of course black wouldn't play it but if he does and white overlooks the BxB line it goes: 13. [ [ [ a5 ] ] ] Qa6. If [ Q b5 ] 14. [ N a3 ] becomes a developement move giving me an edge. If Qx[ [ [ a5 ] ] ] N[ c4 ] is a freeway to [ e5 ] or a5... But this move gives white another chance: 14. Qb3. You'd say it is futile since [ R b8 ] followed by o-o is good f
 [ f5 ] , [ B d2 ]  Hangs the pawn at b2. Leads to 24...[ N x b2 ] 25.[ R b1 ] [ N d3 ] 26.[ f3 ] [ c4 ] 27.[ R b7 ] [ R c7 ] 28.[ R x c7 ] [ Q x c7 ] 29.[ f x e4 ] [ R e8 ] 30.[ B e3 ] [ R x e4 ] which wins a rook and a pawn for a rook and a pawn. Better is [ B f4 ] leading to 24...[ N b6 ] 25.[ a3 ] [ Q a4 ] 26.[ R f e1 ] [ R f d8 ] 27.[ B g5 ] [ R d7 ] 28.[ N f1 ] which results in no captures.
 [ e x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ] , [ Q x d5 ]  Now I had total control of the centre.
 [ N b5 ] , [ Q h5 ]  The Queen is hoping to dethrone the black king with various moves including [ B x h6 ] and Be4.
 [ B x b2 ] , [ Q g5 ]  ? [ d5 ] [ N f6 ] or even [ d6 ] were better alternatives. While it appears that black is salivating over yet another pawn (the g pawn) it's somewhat poisonous after..............
 [ O-O ]  [ N f6 ] , [ d4 ]  I played [ d4 ] sacrificing the e pawn for quick development
 [ g6 ]  [ N x c6 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ B d5 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ N f4 ]  [ N h4 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ N a5 ]  [ N x b4 ]  [ c3 ]  [ N x d3 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ N c5 ]  [ B f6 ]  [ Q d7 ]  [ R a d1 ]  [ Q e6 ]  [ N b7 ]  [ N x b7 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ R a b8 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ R e c8 ] , [ B a7 ]  
 [ b3 ] , [ N f6 ]  Bringing the reserves up to join the attacking forces while simultaneously screening the Rook.
 [ Q g3 ]  [ N e7 ]  [ Q d6 ] , [ B e5 ]  ? The black bishop is undefended. The white queen may snatch it gratis (free of charge) and threaten the [ h8 ] rook.
 [ g x f3 ]  [ N h4 ] , [ f4 ]  White tries to save the pawn at [ f3 ] but I don't want the pawn I want the square.
 [ R x b2 ]  [ R x d6 ]  [ R x a2 ]  [ B c3 ] , [ R x c2 ]  21. ....... [ R x d2 ] - now all the queenside pawns have vanished!
 [ N x b5 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d3 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ Q e1 ]  Preparing to aggressively attack the kingside. White's potential whether his kingside attack succeeds or not is more than enough to make up for the exchanged bishop.
 [ Q h3 ] , [ Q x h3 ]  white goes for the exchange knowing his rook is nearby.
 [ Q c2 + ] , [ K g3 ]  King - HAHA! I got my wish.
 [ d6 ] , [ O-O ]  Removing the pin
 [ N x e3 ]  [ f x e3 ] , [ b6 ]  i want to get rid of his pawns
 [ b5 ]  [ a x b6 ]  [ e ] , [ p ]  White can capture [ b5 ] using a5-pawn a legal move called "en passant". Just move [ a5 ] to [ b6 ] then white captures a pawn.
 [ Q b3 ] , [ Q x b3 ]  White should have been more reluctant to exchange queens while behind in material.
 [ Q x d7 ] , [ Q x b7 ]  Qxb7??...what a blunder! I had a comfortable lead and I didn't take time to calculate Black's possible responses.
 [ Q x d5 ] , [ Q d8 ]  Wanting to exchange Q's. But the thing to note is that unlike before you're only up a pawn now. While 18...[ Q h3 ] was still the best move better then what you'd play would've been to attack the Q with either R 18...[ R a d1 ] or 18...[ R f d1 ] and then after retreating and then exchanging with 19...[ R x d1 + ] 20.[ K x d1 ] almost as strong as ...[ Q h3 ] would be 20...[ Q h5 ] pinning the N which would tie down white's pieces. And that's generally not a good way to go when we're nearing the endgame. With this move Erika's position is about to become passive which is not so good either.
 [ Q h8 ] , [ Q x h8 + ]  I missed [ R g5 ] again (mate in 2 this time)... A queen exchange still benefitted white though.
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ] , [ c4 ]  The game starts off with a Queen's Gambit...
 [ R g2 ]  [ K f7 ]  [ R h g1 ]  [ R g8 ] , [ B e1 ]  32. B's rook is [ f6 ] is horribly misplaced...I would have looked at c4...worth a pawn to open the long diagonal for the Black squared B...the doubled pawn on [ c4 ] couldn't be held anyway
 [ N h f6 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ d x e5 ] , [ N h7 ]  Now [ Q x d6 ] is tricky but I have my 3 pawns for the piece. But no attack anymore.
 [ K f5 ] , [ g4 # ]  Mate. I think several of Black's key mistakes in this game were 1) move number twelve when he didn't take precautions against the King being pinned and I was able to gain myself a Rook and 2) leaving a lot of pieces unprotected and taking too many unnecessary risks. Like the knight on b4; that knight could have easily retreated to [ c6 ] but instead Black moved the other knight forward into my territory. That knight was protecting the key square at d6; if that knight hadn't moved last turn my queen wouldn't have been able to move to that square to check the king.
 [ B f4 ]  [ Q c6 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ Q b7 ] , [ a6 ]  The Queen is lost.
 [ Q d2 ] , [ b4 ]  Off the reservation now. No more DB. I decide to hunt the knight since he has nowhere to go but back to the back rank.
 [ B e3 ]  [ c x d4 ] , [ B x d4 ]  14. [ B x d4 ] - pawn trade.
 [ N d1 ] , [ B h6 ]  25. ...... [ B h6 ] - threatening [ B x f4 ] as the [ e3 ] pawn is pinned to the Witch.
 [ B e4 ]  [ N c7 ]  [ Q e3 ]  [ N e6 ] , [ a4 ]  lost direction I feel
 [ N x d4 ] , [ B x d4 ]  An excellent reply involving a little trap. If now black recaptures the bishop with the queen NxQ is hard to meet for black because of the knight fork on c7. After O-O-O the a pawn is lost.
 [ g3 ] , [ R e2 ]  ...but this is a nice shot I planned. The white queen cannot keep defending [ f2 ] and [ R x f2 + ] is lethal.
 [ e x d5 ]  [ c x d5 ] , [ N x d5 ]  [ N b5 ] is met with Qa5...
 [ Q c8 + ]  [ K f7 ] , [ K h2 ]  If [ R a7 ] the black queen starts with its lethal penetration.
 [ N h5 ] , [ K f8 ]  One move too late.
 [ e5 ] , [ Q e7 ]  One of the only squares that saves my queen some potential in the future or so I thought...
 [ B x d3 ] , [ c x d3 ]  I discover my king but now I have a decent defence against the black's avalanche.
 [ N c3 ]  [ N x e2 ]  [ Q x e2 + ]  [ N e7 ] , [ N d5 ]  Attacking the pinned piece.
 [ N c5 ] , [ R x b4 ]  Now I decide to experiment. Of course there is an easier way to get the pawn and I saw the N fork....but I wanted to play...
 [ B d2 ] , [ Q b6 ]  Looking for the weak pawn at b2.
 [ B h6 ]  [ B h8 ]  [ h5 ]  [ N x h5 ] , [ g4 ]  ?! The sac of the pawn was good but this move is not that accurate. Perhaps 17.[ R x h5 ] [ B x d4 ] 18.[ N x d4 ] [ e5 ] was better.
 [ f4 ] , [ B x c6 ]  the most dangerous white piece is gone
 [ N b6 ]  [ Q x d4 ] , [ N c6 ]  I just gain a tempo on the queen.
 [ R c c8 ]  [ a4 ]  [ R c4 ]  [ b3 ]  [ R c3 ] , [ b4 ]  Trying to be sneaky. I'm dead anyway might as well bait the trap. If black plays 32. ... Rxb4??? then white wins with 33. Rd8#. I know it's too obvious but hey so was 27. Rc3?? and I still blew it. One can always hope for a little tit for tat.
 [ g5 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ b5 ] , [ R f1 ]  White offered a draw here since he doesn't seem to be able to make progress but I just need a bit more progress to win this. White's horribly placed king will lose the game for him
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ a6 ] , [ B x c6 ]  As per plan.
 [ d4 ] , [ N x e4 ]  he takes now I have the option - and go for the Bish of course mainly based on the horrible-looking continuation of B or N taking my f-pawn if I go for the knight (though it would give me check with the queen on [ f3 ] next go - leave that one for someone else to look into..)
 [ O-O ]  [ O-O ] , [ c4 ]  With the intentions of playing [ c5 ] at some point to protect the [ d6 ] pawn or [ c x d5 ] to open the c file.
 [ N c6 ] , [ d4 ]  8. d4? white overlooked 8. ... [ N x d4 ] 9. [ c x d4 ] [ Q x d4 ] winning 2 pawns
 [ Q x b2 ]  [ N d2 ]  [ B x c2 ]  [ Q c1 ] , [ Q x c1 + ]  Fritz shows [ B a3 ] to be the move here instead of trading Queens. I remember thinking about this move for a long time and the only option I could come up with was trading Queens.
 [ Q c7 ]  [ h5 ]  [ K h8 ] , [ g5 ]  13. [ g5 ] - the pawn storm gathers pace and Joe's [ f6 ] knight is en prise. I think Joe ought to have played [ b5 ] on the previous turn. However I have not yet committed Henry to the queenside yet so I thought it would be sensible to get my attack rolling first before I do put Henry there so if Joe does start up something there I will now be ahead of the game.
 [ B x h6 ]  [ N x f3 + ]  [ Q x f3 ]  [ g x h6 ]  [ Q g3 + ]  [ Q g5 ]  [ Q x g5 + ] , [ h x g5 ]  I'm happy to have got an exchange of Queens.
 [ K c3 ] , [ R e3 ]  [ R a2 ] a5. A this point I lost my cool blood and I didn't see the next white move so I played...
 [ f4 ]  [ Q h3 ]  [ R f1 ] , [ R e4 ]  (!) A powerful blow! White is now scrambling for his life!
 [ R f2 ] , [ B c2 ]  ! And now there's nothing White can do to prevent the loss of the b-pawn.
 [ K f6 ] , [ Q d3 ]  The black king moves to [ f6 ] and white moves queen to [ d3 ] to protect the rook at [ e2 ] which is under threat of capture by the knight at g3.
 [ N x e5 ]  [ B x e5 ] , [ N x c3 ]  Now I'm at least a pawn up but I saw his light square bishop as a new problem
 [ N f6 ] , [ b3 ]  Book is [ g3 ] preparing to go into a Kings Indian Attack structure Though with this move I hope to strengthen my dark squares [ d4 ] and e5.
 [ B x f4 ]  [ B x f4 ] , [ R d h8 ]  Forcing the attack and the bishop on [ f4 ] hanging now.
 [ N x d4 ]  [ Q a4 + ] , [ c6 ]  Now white has to be careful about [ b5 ] pawn fork.
 [ B e1 ]  [ B x e1 ] , [ R x e1 ]  here my opponent offered a draw I was tempted to accept but then I can play some more moves without risk of losing the hypothesis of a draw either plus I have some strategic point to test: a) I can now profit from a better bishop b) my knight is also more active I have some outposts in [ c5 ] [ [ [ e5 ] ] ] and even a possible outpost on [ d4 ] after playing [ [ [ e5 ] ] ] c) by playing [ [ [ e5 ] ] ] I'll improve my pawns by placing them on a dark square plus I have an attack objective on white's h pawn that may be exploited after some pawn break d) maintaining the [ c6 ] pawn defending against [ N b5 ] or [ N d5 ] is also an hypothesis as it keeps white's knight more constrained
 [ Q d6 ]  [ c3 ]  [ B c5 ] , [ d4 ]  7. [ d4 ] - hits at the black dsb and opens up the diagonal for Fou Lenoir.
 [ c5 ]  [ b6 ]  [ R d1 ]  [ b x c5 ]  [ R d7 + ]  [ K e6 ]  [ R x h7 ]  [ c4 ]  [ R b7 ]  [ c3 ]  [ R b1 ]  [ c2 ]  [ R c1 ]  [ K d5 ]  [ K g2 ]  [ K d4 ]  [ K f1 ]  [ K d3 ]  [ K e1 ]  [ a5 ]  [ h4 ] , [ R c7 ]  White is in zugzwang and is again several times in the remainder of the game. However 34... [ f4 ] would have been more clinical.
 [ B e3 ] , [ R d8 ]  I was anticipating 16 QxP evening up the material.
 [ e x d5 ]  [ Q x d5 ] , [ d4 ]  Finally something - and better IMO - than Nc3! It is very dangerous to play against this.
 [ R a2 + ]  [ K d1 ]  [ R b b2 ] , [ K c1 ]  I thought I had seen a way to exchange the White queen for a Black rook and an unstoppable pawn but after reconsidering the pawn was stoppable after all 43. [ Q e8 + ] [ K g7 ] 44. [ Q e5 + ] [ K f8 ] 45. [ Q x b2 ] [ R x b2 ] and I couldn't find a way to promotion.
 [ B x f6 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ N x e4 ] , [ B g7 ]  I am still threatening [ [ a2 ] ] and [ d3 ] but my bishop is hanging. I move it to safety. White now must chose whether to lose the [ [ a2 ] ] pawn or lose the exchange.
 [ N f6 ] , [ Q e2 ]  Too early to be moving the Q especially with all the minor pieces still awaiting development. This move will likely cause some pain for white later on as it will require moving the Q again before the light square bishop can get going. The castle is going to require giving up tempo to black.
 [ Q e2 ] , [ Q h4 ]  In this position he is clearly trying to mate in two. 23...[ Q h2 + ] 24.[ K f1 ] (forced) Qh1#. Therefore I have to prevent this threat. Of course 23...[ g3 ] is not going to help. In fact I analyzed the position and came to the conclusion that 23.[ h3 ] is my only option.
 [ Q x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ] , [ B e3 ]  ???? This loses a rook.
 [ c5 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ Q x d4 ] , [ N c6 ]  I'm simply taking advantage of the fact that White's queen is in the center of the board.
 [ Q d8 ]  [ N x f6 + ] , [ Q x f6 ]  At this stage Black looks desperate. At a glance his position looks weak. It appears he has returned control to White with the loss of a pawn in the process. His Queenside pawns appear ragged and his Queen appears to be too enclosed to make an impact. He has yet to develop his King's Bishop which appeared to be part of his plan earlier. Has he lost the plot or is White bringing the game to Black?
 [ B h5 + ] , [ K e7 ]  this costs an exchange. giving up a pawn with 11 ... [ g6 ] might be preferrable
 [ K d7 ]  [ B x f8 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ Q g7 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ N d2 ] , [ c5 ]  "There is no defeat in failure when striving to do the impossible ... "
 [ h5 ]  [ B e4 ] , [ B e2 ]  white will happily swap knight for bishop
 [ R b8 ]  [ f4 ]  [ N x f4 ]  [ B x f4 ]  [ e x f4 ]  [ R x f4 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ e5 ] , [ B e7 ]  if black plays 15....BxP then 16.[ R e4 ] (pinning the B) and black must decide between delegating his Q to guard duty or pushing the f-pawn forward to support the B leaving the K vulernable to check from white's Q at [ h5 ] forcing black to move his K into the center of the board or push the g-pawn forward causing further weakening of possible king-side castle. black opts to retreat.
 [ B c5 ]  [ c3 ] , [ N e5 ]  19. ...... [ N e5 ] - fearing a possible knight incursion on [ d3 ] I move my knight to c1.
 [ g5 ] , [ B f5 ]  At this point I was doubting this game is drawable unless white blunders. Apparently [ R b5 ] would have lead to a combination winning the pawn.
 [ R f g8 ]  [ B g4 + ]  [ B x g4 ] , [ f x g4 ]  Now with an extra pawn and the weak pawn on [ f3 ] gone White should be able to win this with a little technique. Still there is a lot of room for error at the amateur level -- Rook ending are notoriously tricky.
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B c4 ] , [ B c5 ]  Giuoco Piano straight out of the book.
 [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N g5 ]  [ Q d7 ]  [ Q f3 ]  [ f6 ]  [ B x d5 ]  [ f x g5 ] , [ Q h5 + ]  not such a bad move because after [ g6 ] q[ x g5 ] bxb [ e x d6 ] the bishop must move or be protected giving two pawns for a bishop
 [ B h2 ] , [ R x f1 # ]  
 [ c6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ N x b3 ]  Breaks up White's pawns and hopes to snap up the d-pawn restoring at least the material balance. I felt that White retained an edge though however marginal.
 [ Q c8 ] , [ N x e7 + ]  The plan is to remove the dark-squared bishop before Black can shore up the dark-squares.
 [ R d1 + ]  [ K c7 ]  [ B e5 + ]  [ K c8 ]  [ R g1 ] , [ N g6 ]  ! Good! The knight is always the best piece to put infront of a pawn!
 [ Q x b1 + ] , [ N c1 ]  Forced.
 [ O-O ]  [ R f e8 ]  [ R f e1 ]  [ N c5 ]  [ Q c2 ]  [ R a d8 ] , [ K f1 ]  !? Threatening discovered attacks at the black Queen. Also the King moves to a light square where it's less likely to be checked since the black pieces seem to be moving more on the dark squares..
 [ B d2 ] , [ R x f6 + ]  Wham! At this stage I believe my king is doomed.
 [ K x c3 ]  [ B x b5 ]  [ K d4 ] , [ K f3 ]  Black no longer needs the king to protect against the h pawn because the bishop can do that.
 [ f6 ]  [ e5 ]  [ a6 ] , [ N d6 + ]  wow i liked that
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N d2 ]  [ c5 ]  [ e3 ] , [ Q b6 ]  Starting the known game of the poisoned pawn (b2).
 [ e3 ]  [ Q e7 ]  [ B e2 ] , [ e5 ]  Black has a poor bishop but has decided to put the ball in White's court
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ] , [ N c3 ]  closed sicilian very popular these days. don't know why... in my opinion it's a bit passive for white.
 [ R e4 ]  [ R d5 ] , [ R f7 ]  The rook on the 7th rank is a dangerous attacking weapon. White is winning.
 [ R h2 h1 + ]  [ K e2 ]  [ R h8 h2 + ]  [ K d3 ] , [ R x d1 + ]  I really nice game succesful vertical attack!! Thank you
 [ N a5 ] , [ d6 ]  Instead of [ d6 ] white can't defend [ c4 ] with [ Q a4 ] and after exd the c pawn can't recapture as white would lose the [ B d3 ]  [ B x c4 ]  [ N x c4 ]  [ Q d3 ] , [ N a5 ]  Black has won a pawn but white has compensation
 [ R h8 ]  [ h3 ] , [ R h5 ]  Black is willing to trade a flank pawn for my isolated central pawn a positionally good move since it temporarily banishes my bishop to the side of the board but in my opinion is not good enough to salvage the negatives.
 [ Q g3 + ]  [ K h6 ]  [ f4 ]  [ K g7 ]  [ f x g6 ] , [ R x g6 ]  It says the pieces are equal.
 [ N c3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ O-O ] , [ B e7 ]  With Alekhine having secured his King Capablanca prepares to do the same.
 [ Q x f4 ] , [ B a5 ]  thinking to go after my c pawn due to rook pin.
 [ b6 ]  [ K e2 ]  [ b5 ]  [ c4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ e5 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ Q x e5 ]  [ b x c4 ]  [ b x c4 ]  [ a5 ]  [ b3 ]  [ K h8 ]  [ g4 ]  [ K h7 ] , [ Q e7 ]  If he doesn't want to lose his queen he should make a [ Q g8 ] move which makes him lose a pawn more. So he resigned.
 [ B d7 ]  [ N d f5 ] , [ B x f5 ]  I beieve Black should have casled on queen side here instead of trading
 [ N f6 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ B e7 ] , [ B x f6 ]  ? Gives up the bishop pair for nothing.
 [ R b4 ]  [ B d1 ]  [ c4 ]  [ K e1 ]  [ B x e4 ] , [ f3 ]  White can't allow the bishop on to [ g2 ] so this is necessary. Although it does give room for the black rook to get in from [ b2 ] to [ h2 ] and attack the [ h3 ] pawn.
 [ Q c4 + ] , [ R e2 ]  41. [ R e2 ] and Draw Offer which was accepted by Steve. Whew! Glad I survived that one! Cheers and bye for now - Joanne
 [ Q e7 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N f6 ]  [ d3 ] , [ h6 ]  I launch my own attack on whites [ e4 ] pawn which is quickly countered by d3. I fear the file now opened for White's black bishop and advance h6.
 [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ] , [ d4 ]  I like to go after the center early so I usually will end up pushing both [ e4 ] and d4; although I open myself up most players don't capitalize on this opportunity
 [ N g7 ] , [ h4 ]  The second legionnaire joins the tortoise formation.
 [ N b d7 ] , [ B e2 ]  Here with the aftersight of how the game progressed its pretty easy to see that my opponent's bishops queen rook and the [ d4 ] knight were perfectly set up for a pawn attack against my dragon formation. I've discovered that this might be a weakness of the dragon...in my past games it has seemed to depend on the pawn structure and bishop remaining in that formation. I might need to think of a defense that can answer this threat if I'm to continue using it.
 [ g5 ] , [ N h7 ]  Knight retreats. Black doesn't seem to have alot of counterplay. Whites bishop still on [ c1 ] is doing a good job covering d2.
 [ N g4 ] , [ d4 ]  Inconsistent with his earlier moves. I would play 6 B-[ [ K3 ] ] instead. Black can win a Pawn in the ensuing exchanges but I end up a Pawn ahead anyway after the move actually played and 6 B-[ [ K3 ] ] would enable White to maintain strong central Pawns as compensation.
 [ K e3 ] , [ K g5 ]  ...and now quickly switch to the K-side where I threaten to massacre White's pawns.
 [ e4 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N b d7 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ c6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ b5 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ b4 ]  [ N e2 ]  [ e5 ]  [ c3 ]  [ b x c3 ]  [ b x c3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ Q b3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ N g5 ]  [ O-O ] , [ B c4 ]  White is imprudently focused on attacking [ f7 ] while neglecting development
 [ Q d1 ] , [ R a d8 ]  As I then use that time to centralize my other Rook since both are in the center.
 [ N x d1 ]  [ h3 ]  [ R x a2 ]  [ K h2 ]  [ N x f2 ] , [ R e1 ]  slightly better is [ Q x b7 ] [ B d5 ] Re1...
 [ Q x f3 ]  [ g x f3 ] , [ K f6 ]  The center is all mine along with the game.
 [ B d7 ] , [ N g e2 ]  Hooking up my Knights.
 [ B e6 ]  [ N b d2 ] , [ Q c8 ]  The development of both sides are nearing its end; Black fears a possible [ N e5 ] after [ Q c8 ]  [ B h3 ] , [ B h1 ]  ...so that he can preserve his light-square bishop. Of course that bishop could be disastrous should White lose control of the white squares around the king but with the position of that [ h1 ] bishop Black's lsb shouldn't be a problem...right?
 [ Q x a5 + ] , [ K x b7 ]  [ R e7 + ] now was the good one.
 [ K h6 ] , [ g4 ]  (!) Good move: breaking up Black's last asset her K-side majority.
 [ B e6 ] , [ f x g7 ]  Either Black takes the pawn and exposes himself to White's Q or he leaves it alone and it forms a thorn in his side.
 [ e5 ]  [ b3 ] , [ h5 ]  I read up up another opening called the Anti Borg where white rams the h side pawn up black's throat to obstruct him from castling king side. I thought it might be fun to see if black could do the same.
 [ f x e3 ] , [ c6 ]  I would've brought my remaining piece into play. But this is very understandable.
 [ Q b3 ] , [ B f7 ]  an illusion if I had any thoughts about [ N x f4 ] with a discovered attack on the queen... but one never knows!
 [ B x f3 ]  [ R x f3 ] , [ d5 ]  This move comes too late.
 [ O-O ]  [ e3 ] , [ c5 ]  A huge battle in the center broods.
 [ R f8 ] , [ R e f1 ]  wants f4.
 [ B b2 ]  [ B c3 ]  [ B x c3 ]  [ R x c3 ] , [ R b1 ]  He has no way of avoiding the forking of two pawns by ...R-B5.
 [ B x d7 ]  [ Q x d7 ]  [ Q x d7 + ] , [ K x d7 ]  the rook idea was played well on time
 [ R b8 ]  [ N x b5 ]  [ R a8 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ e5 ]  [ R c1 ] , [ B d6 ]  Preparing to castle
 [ N f6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ d3 ] , [ d5 ]  just natural development for Black: but somehow White observed an elephant in the room; after [ B a2 ] [ d x e4 ] [ N x e4 ] [ N x e4 ] [ d x e4 ] [ Q x d1 + ] [ K x d1 ] [ b5 ] (of course not ax[ b5 ] axb5: [ B a2 ] is in the way) Ke2! (preparing c3) Black has only a slight advantage or maybe none...
 [ K h1 ] , [ R x e2 ]  0-1. From a symmetrical opening the game appeared to be finely balanced for about 20-25 moves. A series of mistakes at moves 24 and 25 seemed set to rock the boat but neither side made the best use of the chances then offered. Although Black appeared to be setting the pace for perhaps the final 15 moves or so of the game White was just about preserving the balance and even threatened from time to time to wrest the initiative away from Black. It was the unfortunate manoeuverings of the rook on the 4-rank coupled with the bishop's losing the opportunity to break out from [ h3 ] that finally tipped the balance Black's way. After such prolonged tension perhaps it is no surprise that the denouement should be so catastrophic.
 [ e x f5 ] , [ f6 ]  ? This seems to have been the idea behind 19...gxf5. I think it's the right idea (blocking the f-pawn's advance) but the wrong execution. 20...[ B f6 ] looks much stronger to me: that Bishop is really a huge blockage to Black's troops right now.
 [ d5 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ c6 ]  Im looking to transpose into the caro-kann
 [ N c3 ]  [ d5 ] , [ d4 ]  The game has transposed from the English to the Queen's Gambit Declined.
 [ N x h3 + ] , [ K f1 ]  Protecting the rook but....
 [ Q d5 ] , [ Q f7 + ]  followed by [ Q f8 ] ++ next move.
 [ e x d5 ] , [ B x d5 ]  Preserving the positional integrity of Black's kingside pawn structure while turning Blacks wsb into an attacking piece: [ f3 ] is under direct attack and [ a2 ] is under potential threat.
 [ N f5 ]  [ Q x g1 ] , [ Q g7 # ]  Two extremely potent attacks but white was able to get there first. I hope that you enjoyed this annotation. Feel free to PM me if you find a way to improve it or if you see something I missed.
 [ B e4 ] , [ g6 ]  I accepted to scramble my pawns but I overlooked the resource I would have used if white.
 [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N a3 ] , [ N a6 ]  The whole board is just oddly configured at this point.
 [ Q x g4 ]  [ R g1 ]  [ Q x h5 ]  [ Q d7 ]  [ R f8 ]  [ Q d6 ]  [ Q h2 ]  [ Q d1 ]  [ Q f2 ]  [ g4 ]  [ Q e3 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ Q c3 ]  [ Q c1 ]  [ Q d4 ]  [ Q d1 ]  [ R d8 ]  [ Q e2 ]  [ Q c3 ]  [ R d1 ] , [ R d4 ]  I enjoy paralyzing moves like these. White has no good continuations - there is tactics that can happen with [ Q [ b6 ] + ] and [ R d2 ] if the rook moves away - if [ Q b2 ] then checkmate on [ b6 ] with the queen - if black exchanges rooks I get a dangerous passed pawn.
 [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N c5 ] , [ Q g3 ]  This was the counter-idea: now I'm pressing his castling side.
 [ N f6 ]  [ Q g2 ]  [ N h5 ] , [ B d1 ]  19. ... Nh5? was another gambit. That knight would have been safer on e8. And the pawn on [ h6 ] would have been safer if it had at least one defender that isn't pinned to the black king.
 [ Q x f2 + ] , [ K d1 ]  [ N e3 + ] is a force mate. [ K c1 ] is better.
 [ R x e2 + ] , [ K x e2 ]  ...and we again exchange rooks. Unbelievably I managed to hold out despite heavy losses: half my pawns and my light-square bishop (which en prise early in the game) remain along with the king against seven pawns (only one removed on my third move). Is a bishop the third best piece to help the king and pawns attack enemy pawns (after a queen and a rook) due to its range?
 [ f3 ]  [ N e3 ]  [ K f2 ]  [ N c4 ]  [ R c1 ]  [ N e5 ] , [ N f5 ]  ?? Giving you a big opportunity which you duly take advantage of. Had White not done this the game could have continued indefinitely unless you started playing much more intentionally.
 [ N g e2 ]  [ B x c4 ] , [ f3 ]  Exactly what you can expect:
 [ g x f4 ]  [ N x b6 ] , [ R c b8 ]  I wasn't paying enough attention and lined up my rook for a king/rook fork by the knight leaving me even more significantly behind.
 [ K d8 ] , [ B x b6 + ]  The walls are closing in :D
 [ N g3 ] , [ R x d3 ]  Instead white chooses to save neither pawn and now he has his bishop en prise at [ c3 ] and two pawns [ a3 ] and [ f3 ] en prise as well.
 [ N h5 ] , [ B x h6 ]  ! Nice move! It's also nice to see how all the white pieces are active in the attack. (the knight on [ c3 ] will jump to [ e4 ] in some lines to assist.)
 [ B x d7 ]  [ Q x d7 ]  [ B e3 ] , [ N a6 ]  11. .... [ N a6 ] - gotta get my pieces out somehow!
 [ Q c1 + ]  [ K h2 ]  [ Q f4 + ]  [ K g1 ] , [ K g3 ]  The net closes. If White doesn't find the correct defence it could be mate in 2.
 [ a4 ] , [ a5 ]  symmetrical
 [ d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ N c3 ]  All fairly normal I'd say.
 [ N f6 ] , [ K x f7 ]  Black begins his fierce counterattack with his King...
 [ a5 ]  [ h6 ]  [ a4 ]  [ h7 ]  [ B x h7 + ]  [ K x h7 ]  [ a3 ] , [ g8 = Q ]  As I expected mine Queens first.
 [ e4 ] , [ c5 ]  Surprise not the French but my old friend the Sicilian.
 [ N c4 ]  [ B x c4 ]  [ B x c4 ] , [ N c2 ]  31. [ N c2 ] - and now a N v B ending.
 [ K g8 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ K g2 ]  [ Q a5 ] , [ f4 ]  With most of his pieces on light squares and the [ e5 ] square under control for the time being white can now make the thematic [ f4 ] move. This opponent actually took the time to prepare f4.
 [ B x c3 ] , [ B x c3 ]  In this middle game blacks knight could well prove a superior piece to the embarrassingly cloistered dark-squared bishop. Nonetheless there are ideas of an eventual C4 break.
 [ R f7 + ]  [ K g4 ]  [ R x g6 + ]  [ K h4 ]  [ g3 + ]  [ R x g3 + ]  [ h x g3 + ]  [ K h3 ] , [ R h7 ]  And black resigns due to ...[ R h8 ] being the only defence to Rxh5.
 [ K f7 ]  [ K e3 ]  [ N b6 ] , [ B a3 ]  White plans to advance the pawn by relieving the pin and also to penetrate to [ d6 ] with the bishop if possible.
 [ c4 ] , [ B a5 ]  Push thee rook.
 [ K h6 ]  [ R x f7 ] , [ g5 # ]  After 26th move game was very simple for Blk.
 [ c4 ] , [ f5 ]  I stick with a Dutch which I've done okay with this year.
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ d x c4 ] , [ B x c4 ]  Winning a lot lately with the defense.
 [ N b3 ]  [ R b1 ]  [ N x c1 ] , [ R x c1 ]  Every exchange brings the endgame closer.
 [ N d f3 ] , [ B g4 ]  Looking to undermine the white defence of kingside by pinning knight
 [ B e5 ] , [ Q f3 ]  22. [ Q f3 ] - now Glenda must take evasive action.
 [ K d7 ] , [ R x e8 ]  ?? Now for a Zugzwang. (promotion with check then recapture)
 [ B f4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ c5 ]  Black goes on the offensive
 [ Q d6 ]  [ O-O ] , [ N d7 ]  Move for supporting the e-pawn... If f4[ x e5 ] then Kd7[ x e5 ] and I would lose all the try I did to pull his King out. But...
 [ R x c5 ]  [ N x c5 ] , [ Q c2 ]  ! Carlsen curbed black’s queenside activity with this calm move and can claim an advantage as in the addition to a potential target on [ d5 ] he already has something going on the kingside.
 [ Q g7 ] , [ Q c5 ]  I couldn't decide between this or [ R x f7 ] in retrospect the latter is probably the better move but I didn't want to make the same mistake my opponent had made and overstretch my resources although this probably wouldn't have been the case given my material advantage....
 [ f x e5 ] , [ B x h6 ]  Doubling the pawns on h-file was essential to the outcome of the game.
 [ R d f8 ] , [ R f3 ]  ! I like this move because it prepares trebling on the f-file while also defending [ [ c3 ] ] allowing the QB to move and also potentially allowing the rook to swing across the queenside to double on the b-file attacking Black's castled position. One move I also wanted to play at some stage soon was Bg5. I can do this now that the R defends [ [ c3 ] ] and g3; otherwise Black's Q would wreak havoc olong my third rank.
 [ h4 ] , [ R b2 ]  16.[ Q c2 ] W[ a5 ] 17.[ c4 ] [ h3 ] was slightly better.
 [ a3 ] , [ a5 ]  Ok now note I am not necessarily castling queenside.
 [ K f5 ] , [ K d5 ]  White resigns. One of my best performances on GK so far. I'm very happy with the way I played the sicilian having been thrashed with the same line not long ago and picking out the right lines in a closely-fought endgame is a new pleasure for me aswell!! Well played gm_dursley also Brilliant game.
 [ c5 ]  [ e x d6 ]  [ B x d6 ]  [ d x c5 ]  [ B x c5 ] , [ a3 ]  12. [ a3 ] - at last but it only wins piece for 2 pawns.
 [ B a2 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ] , [ Q c7 ]  This was a surprise as it loses a pawn
 [ B f2 ]  [ Q g5 + ] , [ K b1 ]  pretty much forced otherwise I could regain material
 [ K b7 ] , [ Q b3 ]  re positioning by both white and black
 [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ N c3 ]  Book so far but many top level players prefer 5. c4!? here setting up the Maroczy bind. For me however I'm content to go ahead and develop my pieces at leisure.
 [ B x h3 ]  [ R f3 ] , [ B e6 ]  (?!) Eyeing [ c4 ] but ...
 [ Q d5 ]  [ Q e7 ]  [ Q x a5 ]  [ Q d6 ]  [ Q a8 + ]  [ K g7 ]  [ Q e4 ]  [ g5 ]  [ g3 ]  [ g x f4 ]  [ g x f4 ]  [ Q d2 + ] , [ K g3 ]  I couldn't risk to have a too-far-king from the centre of the board.
 [ N x f3 ] , [ N e7 ]  Not 17. [ N d4 ] which loses both e-file pawns.
 [ B d7 ]  [ Q x a7 ] , [ b5 ]  planning to try to trap Queen by blocking light squared Bishop then playing Ra8. But should have played [ b6 ] rather than [ b5 ] as will become apparent later.
 [ B e6 ]  [ K e8 ]  [ K f6 ]  [ K d8 ]  [ K e5 ]  [ K c7 ] , [ B a5 + ]  Black's king can't get closer to the center with [ K c6 ] because I play [ B d8 ] and then Black's knight is forced away from the king.
 [ R f8 ] , [ R e x f8 # ]  ...an immediate mate.
 [ h5 ] , [ R x c4 ]  The rook (5 points) is worth more than white's bishop (3) and pawn (1).
 [ R f7 + ] , [ K h8 ]  this or [ K h6 ] is pretty much the same he can hold it a little longer by playing [ K g8 ] but the result is the same-->checkmate
 [ Q x e2 ]  [ b6 ]  [ a3 ]  [ O-O-O ]  [ b4 ]  [ B c6 ]  [ R f d1 ]  [ e4 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ N x e4 ] , [ R d c1 ]  bad move white soon will lose one of his rocks due to this move should exchange knights.
 [ h6 ] , [ K f2 ]  King activity.
 [ N c3 ] , [ a6 ]  ? Another bad move. 3...[ N f6 ] should be tried though after 4. [ N f3 ] [ N c6 ] 5. [ B d3 ] [ B e7 ] 6. Qe2!? 0-0 7. [ e5 ] dx[ e5 ] 8. dx[ e5 ] [ N d5 ] 9. [ h4 ] f5? 10. [ e x f6 ] e.p [ g x f6 ] 11. Ng5! [ f x g5 ] 12. [ h x g5 ] [ R f7 ] 13. [ Q h5 ] [ N x c3 ] 14. [ b x c3 ] [ Q d5 ] 15. [ B x h7 + ] [ K f8 ] 16. [ B g6 ] Black is going down in flames from Gampe-Kaulfuss Bundesliga 2002.
 [ B e3 ]  [ N x f3 + ]  [ Q x f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ Q g4 ]  [ B g5 ] , [ B x g5 ]  I think I would have preferred 17.[ f4 ] here.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B x c6 ]  [ d x c6 ]  [ d3 ] , [ O-O ]  The computer says this was a mistake for black suggesting that [ Q d6 ] was the better move with a long string behind it showing that black ends up controlling the center largely due to stacked pawns on the e file. That seems presumptuous to me and I don't know who died and put the computer in charge of things.
 [ B e4 ]  [ Q g5 ] , [ Q a7 + ]  [ B f7 ] prolongs the match however black plays.
 [ N g f6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ] , [ f3 ]  In all honesty I don't know what is the meaning of this move and it's going to give me the worst pawn structure in all the game a little later.
 [ K e2 ] , [ N d4 # ]  Just beautiful I'm very proud of this game. Playing as black sacrificing and checkmating in 20 moves really did make me feel brilliant. This is one of those rare moments in chess when it just all went perfectly for me. This is why i play for moments of satisfaction like that. Thx for reading and plz feel free to comment.
 [ f x g6 ] , [ B c3 ]  So I defended this way thinking that I might be a little better off then 27.[ B f4 ] or 27.[ B d4 ] where he can attack again and gain another tempo. I'm also threatening to gain a pawn in a different way. Of course I'm aware that Tom can defend it.
 [ N x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ N c5 ]  [ b4 ]  [ N d7 ] , [ R c1 ]  trying some cheap tactics to gain the queen.([ B h7 + ] k[ x h7 ] Rxq)
 [ B g7 ] , [ f3 ]  Preventing Black's [ N f3 ] to come to g4.
 [ b5 ] , [ B a2 ]  retreat but no surrender..
 [ c5 ]  [ Q d3 ] , [ N d7 ]  Forcing the bishop on [ g5 ] and discouraging his e-pawn from advancing
 [ e5 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ c6 ]  I commonly only bring it up 1 to save room for my bishop on a long range attack
 [ N f6 ] , [ B c4 ]  Already lining up against he K-side.
 [ e x d5 ] , [ e x d4 ]  ?! Since 16... [ e4 ] seems less effective now in view of 17.[ N g5 ] Keres adopts a rather simplistic solution. This attitude could have cost him dearly. Later he came to the conclusion that this line should be continued a bit further with 17... [ R f d8 ] 18.Nx[ e4 ] Nxd5. Indeed Black has definite compensation for the pawn in view of his excellent mobilization and White's problems developing his queenside (to which the b1-bishop belongs now). As for a definitive evaluation of this position tournament practice might some day give an answer. After Keres's move White has a very promising position. With the exception of the a1-rook all his pieces are well situated. His minor pieces are targeting the enemy kingside the e1-rook keeps the e7-bishop under pressure and the queen is ready to join an eventual attack. Black has some problems with his coordination. His a5-knight is quite far from the king and can hardly be of any use in the eventuality of a lightning attack. Even the seemingly active major pieces doubled on the c-file do not threaten anything serious. With his next move Geller causes his opponent big problems with recuperating the d5-pawn.
 [ e6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ b6 ]  Is the a variation?
 [ Q x a5 ]  [ e2 ]  [ N b5 ] , [ R f7 ]  Against the mating attack. I realized the threat (?) 31. [ Q a8 ] only after I made the move but still if he takes the Rook I come up with a Queen of my own!
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ] , [ f4 ]  See my other annotated games I learnt the Kings gambit 4 months ago and I am always trying it out.
 [ N x e4 ] , [ O-O ]  As noted I became overly confident with the last move due to the timing being off. As I was thinking along the lines of 6.[ R e1 ] to get the N. But Tom stops that by attacking my B. And I don't like the position. Whereas in a different game I exchanged because it was possible when I was low on time. The difference here is that I'm not ready to exchange but don't have a choice.
 [ R d6 ] , [ R c7 + ]  ? Pushes his king closer to the middle
 [ R g3 + ]  [ B g6 ] , [ f5 ]  41. f5???? A terrible blunder! By moving the rook to [ g3 ] white blocked the king's only flight square in the case of [ R h1 ] .
 [ Q g3 ] , [ g6 ]  this weakens dark squares.
 [ B c7 ] , [ B x c7 ]  With the Dark square bishops gone I have gained soul possession of the [ e5 ] outpost. It is now safe to put a rook there.
 [ K d7 ] , [ N e6 ]  Forking the queen who must move and the bishop. Not much of a fork since the bishop is only an even trade. Still white is a pawn ahead exchanging can't be entirely bad.
 [ B x e2 ] , [ N x e2 ]  ? I thought that he would take back with the Queen which would certainly force another unwanted exchange. But with this move I feel happy about him exchanging as this enables me to win a pawn by hitting his Queen.
 [ N x c4 ] , [ Q x c4 ]  Had to take the knight because if I tried to sneak another pawn with e takes [ f7 ] he could recapture with the queen and guard his knight and be up a piece
 [ N d7 ]  [ B e6 ] , [ O-O-O ]  This close to the endgame I might have stayed in the middle.
 [ N d5 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ] , [ Q f3 ]  This position I saw back in 14 move when I predicted that my opponent will exchange his peaces. I don't know how black should react in this position.
 [ R x h8 + ] , [ K g7 ]  Forced
 [ h x g5 ]  [ R x g5 ] , [ N e8 ]  White's Rook is hanging and Black should take advantage of it. Instead with fear he defends [ g7 ] (and attack Rg5) but without taking the initiative. Alternative variation: 29...[ N x d5 ]  [ R h5 ] , [ g6 ]  This weakens the already weak [ g2 ] and it fails to threaten [ R h5 ] because of the next-to-come fork Rg1.
 [ e5 ] , [ e4 ]  Not often one can transpose into a kings gambit !
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ a6 ]  [ B a4 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ O-O ]  [ b5 ]  [ B b3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ d3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ a4 ]  [ N a5 ] , [ c3 ]  Instead of [ c3 ] I probably should have done [ B a2 ] to keep the bishop for a longer time.
 [ B g5 ] , [ Q x f3 ]  9. ...[ B h6 ] saves the Queen but after 10. [ B x h6 ] Black still has to move the Queen from her unsafe square when I can play 11. [ B x f8 ] and eliminate Black's last K-side piece for the loss of only my Bishop and I still have an attacking development as well as being a Rook and Knight to the good.
 [ e x f5 ] , [ B x f5 ]  4. ..... [ B x f5 ] - Pawn trade - I am able to use Fou Leblanc to recapture and to have a decent pawn centre and a piece developed.
 [ B d8 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ c4 ] , [ Q x h6 + ]  Collecting anoter pawn now with check
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ N d7 ] , [ N g5 ]  ((This relatively recent innovation breaks one of the classic opening principles ("don't move the same piece twice in the opening") but puts pressure on the weak [ f7 ] square. Kasparov had played this move himself as White at least three times earlier.))
 [ N b5 ]  [ R d8 ]  [ N x d6 ] , [ R d d7 ]  19. .......... [ R d d7 ] - an amazing array of pins here! As an exercise perhaps you the jury would like to tell me how many pins there are and what is pinned to what!
 [ e4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ d4 ] , [ B g4 ]  Mistake. The bishop is better placed in f5.
 [ R a6 ] , [ g4 ]  I fire my last guns.
 [ R x e6 ] , [ K f7 ]  <<<(Tugger) Obvious move really... brings my king closer to my pawns while attacking your rook... and you don't have a great many places to go... you want to try to avoid me attacking your rook again with yet another king move... and you certainly want to continue to contain my king... i need to find a way to release him from his cage if i'm to exploit my linked pawn advantage... don't make it easy for me by moving off the 6th without being forced...>>>
 [ K h6 ] , [ B g5 + ]  White's king is forced toward the corner because of [ K h5 ] [ N f4 # ]  [ K h7 ] , [ K f6 ]  This was the position I told you to imagine on move 82. White is within moves of being mated because it's breathing space is running out thanks to my powerfully placed king and minor pieces controlling the escape routes.
 [ Q x h8 + ] , [ B f8 ]  White queen captures [ h1 ] rook and I bring down DB to [ f8 ] to protect king. The only thing the queen can take is pawn at [ h7 ] which is protected by my knight at NF3.
 [ B g2 ] , [ B b4 + ]  -
 [ B c6 ] , [ R e7 ]  The more I can tie Black's pieces to defense the fewer attacking opportunities he'll have.
 [ R x e3 + ]  [ K x e3 ]  [ R c3 + ]  [ K d2 ]  [ R x h3 ]  [ g x f6 ]  [ R x a3 ]  [ K c2 ]  [ h5 ]  [ K b2 ]  [ R f3 ]  [ b5 ]  [ R x f4 ]  [ b6 ]  [ g5 ]  [ K c2 ] , [ g4 ]  And white resigned. Thanks for reading please comment
 [ R a b1 ] , [ B b6 ]  i forgot his knight was just sitting there being attacked by my queen with my developing. free for my taking. munch munch as people would say.
 [ R x g4 ]  [ c7 ]  [ R g c4 ] , [ c8 = Q + ]  40 [ c8 = Q + ] gets a ? Yes White ends up trading B+P for a R but it could have been much better. 40. [ R h8 + ] [ K a7 ] 41. [ c8 = Q + ] [ R x c8 ] 42. [ B x c8 ] and Black could resign.
 [ e5 ]  [ B x e5 ]  [ B x f5 ]  [ d4 ] , [ B b4 + ]  this was the genius move but at this time i didnt realize it !!! because it will open the [ h7 ] [ b1 ] diagonal...so i'm preparing a mate _moves before ! of course i didnt knew it ...
 [ e4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ d4 ]  [ d6 ] , [ N f3 ]  The main line here is 4 . . . Bg4.
 [ d3 ] , [ N d4 ]  First chance for Offensive
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ] , [ c4 ]  I don't feel really comfortable with the Queen's Gambit I can't help feeling like I'm giving away the piece. But the stats say it's very good so I thought I should give it a try.
 [ N d5 ]  [ B x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ R e5 ]  [ R d1 ]  [ Q e3 + ]  [ K f1 ] , [ c6 ]  Trying to scare the bishop away from the a6-[ e2 ] diagonal
 [ B d6 ] , [ d3 ]  I hoped for 0-0 after which i fork his rooks with [ N e d7 ]  [ f x e5 ]  [ N g4 ] , [ N a4 ]  Chasing down his pawns and setting another trap.
 [ R d4 ] , [ O-O ]  White just has time t do everything whereas black seems to be scrambling around with no real idea of whats going on.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N x e5 ] , [ N x e4 ]  Standard protocol in the Petrov defense is to play ...[ d6 ] removing the knight so you can recapture safely. However recapturing immediately gives white a nice revealed attack threat after 4. Qe2.
 [ Q x b6 ]  [ Q x c4 ]  [ Q b7 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ Q x d5 ]  [ Q x d5 ]  [ R x d5 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ e x f6 ]  [ h5 ]  [ K g2 ] , [ K h7 ]  I'm unsure of the continuation in the order of moves.
 [ R c4 ]  [ B x d3 ]  [ R x d4 ]  [ B b1 ] , [ R x b4 ]  at first sight this looks terrible as white loses the d pawn after 41...[ B x a2 ] 42.[ R a4 ] [ B x b3 ] 43.[ R x a3 ] [ B x d5 ] when black has very real drawing chance due to the opposite coloured bishops however white is not obliged to play [ R a4 ] after black captures the a pawn. black cannot in fact capture the a pawn without immediate disaster
 [ e4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ d4 ] , [ d5 ]  French...not for long.
 [ f4 ] , [ N e4 ]  I push my f pawn to [ f4 ] and black brings down his f knight to [ e4 ] and is attacking my queen at present.
 [ B x d5 ] , [ Q d7 ]  Again this probably should have been played last move.
 [ N c6 ] , [ c3 ]  ...anyway the usual attack/defence...
 [ Q x e7 ]  [ Q g6 + ]  [ K f8 ]  [ N g4 ] , [ Q f7 ]  It is better for Black to keep the queens on the board since the queen trade introduces a knight and pawn ending that heavily favors White. However I see no particular improvement Black can make here.
 [ B x a4 ]  [ R x a4 ] , [ d4 ]  Bishop has an open line
 [ Q x b4 ] , [ B d3 + ]  As ION reserved this move. In other words it was a waiting move by him.
 [ N x f3 + ]  [ Q x f3 ]  [ Q d6 ] , [ B d2 ]  Preparing to chase the Queen around some more.
 [ Q e7 ] , [ Q c2 ]  Now that she's defended her Q I think about what else to do in this position as my B is still hanging. I realize that I can't reattack her Q again. So I come up with a different. No I don't play this just because it attacks a pawn for if that were the case she'd be able to take my B which is worth more then a pawn. Instead I remebered what GM Damian which is that one should create a threat that's difficult to drive off. This is one of those times for black must do something to not only protect [ c6 ] but prevent what's bound to come. It's worth noting that for to come up with this I had to remember and visualize the kind of position that you'd see from the Domino Defense where you give up a piece to win a R. The same thing could be said here because I'm giving something up at this point and if and when she should take there will be consequences. But I also remembered what GM Susan Polgar said about combos that you give something away for something else worth more which will often give you the advantage.
 [ K g7 ] , [ K f2 ]  there was no more short way...
 [ N e5 ] , [ B d7 ]  White would be winning after 10. [ N x d7 ] [ Q x d7 ] 11. [ B d2 ] [ e6 ] 12. [ Q a4 ] [ B e7 ] 13. [ R c1 ] [ a6 ] 14. Qx[ a6 ] O-O (14... [ R b8 ] 15. Nxd5) 15. Qxb6.
 [ g5 ]  [ R x h6 ]  [ R a3 + ]  [ K g4 ]  [ g x f4 ]  [ K x f4 ]  [ R a2 ] , [ f3 ]  and it is over. Hope you enjoyed it.
 [ c x d5 ]  [ B b5 + ]  [ N c6 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ a6 ]  [ d x c6 ]  [ a x b5 ] , [ c x b7 ]  White is two pieces down but his compensation isn't virtual. The [ b7 ] pawn is very strong and the Black monarch is still in trouble.
 [ R d2 + ]  [ K f1 ]  [ R x b2 ] , [ R x a6 + ]  not good actually for he has now disrupted my pawn chain
 [ B x f3 ] , [ Q c4 ]  Renewed attack on c2.
 [ Q h5 ]  [ R e4 e1 + ]  [ R x e1 ] , [ R x e1 + ]  Two headless chickens slain!
 [ c5 ] , [ N x e6 ]  Hoping he doesn't play [ Q x d1 ] leading to a draw-ish endgame. [ N f5 ] maybe?
 [ N f6 ] , [ O-O ]  Yep I was correct a king-side castle.
 [ N c6 ]  [ g3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B g2 ]  [ d6 ] , [ N g e2 ]  I like the closed Sicilian cos even though move orders can vary the basic idea for white is simple. Control [ d5 ] castle then attack kings side with [ f4 ] (usually)
 [ Q e5 ] , [ R h e8 ]  ! Black is hoping to force White into fixing his queenside pawns and trading down to the endgame as taking on [ e8 ] is inadvisible: 26.Qx[ e8 ] Rx[ e8 ] 27.[ R x e8 + ] Kd7! 28.[ R x e2 ] [ Q x h1 + ] leaves Black with an easy win.
 [ B e4 ] , [ N e3 ]  .
 [ c5 ] , [ N f3 ]  Of course the Sicilian slows me down some. Usually.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ B d6 ]  I'm unfamiliar with 2. [ B d6 ] so it was quickly into the unknown for me
 [ f4 ]  [ K f6 ]  [ g4 ]  [ B b4 ]  [ h4 ]  [ B e1 ]  [ h5 ]  [ c4 ]  [ R x d4 ] , [ c3 ]  i could have given my knight for the last pawn but i decided he made such a good job that i didn't want to lose him.
 [ e6 ]  [ B x c4 ]  [ B b4 ]  [ Q d3 ]  [ O-O ] , [ O-O ]  Castles.
 [ Q x e3 ] , [ Q e8 ]  I wouldn't know what to do here and although it's very difficult to say for sure and can't reach since it's at GM level I don't think that Ju has any good moves left. Me thinking that also makes matters that more interesting since if I were playing as white I'd know that white can go wrong. And I'd probably even underestimate how easy it would be do that as I've unfortunately done before.
 [ N c5 ] , [ R d6 ]  Giving in to White's plan and playing defensive chess. Better to create your own threats!
 [ e x f4 ]  [ g x f4 ] , [ O-O ]  And that's when black castles at last.
 [ N x f5 ]  [ g x f5 ] , [ K h2 ]  This move is a sort of waiting move as white wants to see what black will do before deciding on a plan.
 [ B a4 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ O-O ]  reversion: I see you opted for the mainline 5.O-O. Most of the other games I see you annotating had 5.Nc3?! played. Joe: If you had played 4...[ B c5 ] then I would've developed my [ N b1 ] But last week I remember what cplusplus11 said which is that in this position theory states that you castle right away. And I'm into theory which is also the logic behind the annotations involving TA's Q sacs. Joe has noted that knowing theory is very important. So when C++ told me about what they state it changed my attitude.
 [ B g4 ] , [ Q f6 ]  My guess is that black was intending to put pressure on Joe's K side.
 [ R d4 ]  [ Q h2 ] , [ c4 ]  white tries to advance his pawn too.
 [ N c3 ] , [ Q e7 ]  Instead of protecting my bishop pair with [ a3 ] (avoiding Nb5) I go for the typical "Icelandic Threat".
 [ f4 ] , [ f5 ]  Stopping f5! and freeing my king.
 [ e4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ d3 ] , [ d5 ]  2....d5. The French Defense Reversed Philidor Variation. I'm not to familiar with this line but I don't think that I like it.
 [ Q x a2 ]  [ R a8 + ]  [ K d7 ] , [ N x f6 + ]  TIMEOUT: Suddenly White has two passed pawns a5-a4-[ a3 ] is looking useful my king is looking over-worked and the game is still unclear. First things first (as my Dad would say) let's see about stopping that g-pawn.
 [ N c3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ d6 ]  i played this move later than i usually do...
 [ N x f7 ]  [ K x f7 ] , [ Q f3 + ]  pathetic...
 [ R d2 ]  [ R x c4 ] , [ R d8 ]  forced...
 [ d4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ B f4 ] , [ d6 ]  Very passive but solid.
 [ h6 ] , [ B h4 ]  keeping the pressure on that knight
 [ N h6 ] , [ B x f7 + ]  The bishop insists on sacrificing himself. Martyrdom for eternal paradise?
 [ d x e5 ] , [ d6 ]  !
 [ N f7 ]  [ N x c6 ] , [ b x c6 ]  Creating another backward pawn on an open file.
 [ B x e4 ] , [ d x e4 ]  !? Although this damages my pawn structure it gains a tempo forces white into an awkward spot as his knight must move to [ e5 ] or [ e1 ] and gives me time to halt white's pawn advancement pressure.
 [ N f4 ] , [ g x f4 ]  Black tries a desperate swindle to rescue his game with a last-second checkmate. I suppose white could have moved quickly overlooked the weakness at [ g2 ] and continued to play his intended 29. Rf3??? trying to trap the queen. Instead white removes the danger by capturing the knight and extending his overwhelming material advantage.
 [ Q x g5 ]  [ R d1 ]  [ Q g6 ] , [ b4 ]  Prevents the N from coming back to defend the black K
 [ Q f7 + ]  [ K d6 ]  [ Q x f8 + ]  [ K e6 ]  [ Q f7 + ]  [ K d6 ]  [ N b5 + ]  [ K c6 ] , [ Q c7 # ]  
 [ N e3 ]  [ Q c6 ] , [ Q g4 ]  To do Nf5. Note the queen is also defending g2.
 [ K f8 ] , [ Q x d6 + ]  Black resigns. If 17... RxQ 18 RxPch K-[ N1 ] 19 R-[ K8 ] mate.
 [ R c7 c1 + ]  [ R x c1 ]  [ R x c1 + ]  [ K g2 ] , [ R d1 ]  attacking the passed pawn chain
 [ N d5 ] , [ K d8 ]  blunders knight and queen or game deserves ???
 [ N x d3 ]  [ Q x d3 ]  [ e5 ] , [ a x b5 ]  what am I doing ..this loses me a knight !
 [ Q h4 ]  [ R d7 ]  [ R a b8 ]  [ g3 ]  [ Q g4 ] , [ h3 ]  the Black's Queen is suddenly a good target to attack and White gain some Kingside improvement.
 [ h4 ]  [ f x e5 ] , [ N x e5 ]  !?
 [ O-O ]  [ B d3 ] , [ h6 ]  My opponent has delayed castling to attack me so my plan is to attack while the king is still in the centre and I have the better development. If I wait his extra space advantage and attacking pieces could become a problem
 [ Q h5 ] , [ N d3 ]  once he attacked the rook I saw potential mate 4-6 moves ahead. I knew it looked to good for him not to pass it up so I moved [ N [ g5 ] ] hoping that he would take my rook. If he didnt and took my [ g5 ] Knight I knew I'd be at -1 in the same spot as I was before
 [ R e3 + ]  [ K d6 ] , [ N f4 ]  Now a fork against the rook and the bishop.
 [ N d5 ] , [ N a4 ]  ? After he pulls back I decide to place my Knight on the rim which is a mistake. In most cases a Knight on the rim is grim and this is not an exception. My goal however was to wear him down so that he would eventually give something away like one of his pawns on the a-c file. However it is very unusual for players like Jack Stockel to blunder material as I mentioned earlier. It's like your chance of getting four of a kind in a pocker game. In addition myelivuk told me in a PM that you always need a good reason for making a move and that is why he did not want me to "fianchetto the bishop" until I learned more openings. It is especially because my reasons behind a fianchetto are not good. On the other hand the reason for this move was even worse then that of a fianchetto and I did not even know it until yesterday (when I started editing this game.) If that's not bad enough this move is a big mistake and almost a blunder. Why? It is going to result in a serious pin on his next move. As a result this is a bad move and for the wrong reason.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ d6 ]  the Philidor defense...
 [ K f8 ] , [ B b7 ]  Where it can be covered by the Bishop. The Rook is out of play for now!
 [ Q c5 + ] , [ B d4 ]  but he can't
 [ a3 ] , [ B c5 ]  Black would have nothing to gain by trading off this Bishop on [ c3 ] right now.
 [ d x c4 ] , [ e3 ]  White immediately aims to recapture.
 [ N f3 ]  [ c5 ]  [ Q e2 ] , [ a6 ]  6. ..... [ a6 ] - preparing b5.
 [ N h5 ]  [ f5 ] , [ N f4 ]  This threatens [ N e2 ] fork
 [ h6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ a6 ]  Although the opening for black seems totally ridiculous it is easy to understand his idea. Black wants to play on the flanks and hold against any counters in the center. Thats why he set up [ e6 ] and d6. When the position is closed then his lack of development means little. So it is clear white needs to blast the center and start attacking there.
 [ B b2 ]  [ R a c8 ]  [ f4 ]  [ Q b6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ h3 ] , [ B x f3 ]  Here start a combination I was planning for a long time. I just had to get rid of this knight
 [ R f8 ] , [ Q x a6 ]  Now black has some countergame but...
 [ Q x f4 ]  [ f x e4 ] , [ Q x e4 ]  black is now with the advantage of an open column. But white has lost his weakness and is a pawn ahead.
 [ N g f3 ] , [ N f6 ]  Ready to hop onto e4.
 [ Q f6 ] , [ N e2 ]  This move served two purposes for me: I was able to defend the bishop and move the knight away from black's oppressive pawns.
 [ Q x e7 ]  [ N c4 ]  [ N f4 ]  [ N e3 ]  [ Q f6 ]  [ g3 ]  [ N h3 + ]  [ K h1 ]  [ N e7 ]  [ B c4 ] , [ c6 ]  Played after a very long thought.

 [ Q d2 ] , [ Q x a3 ]  I can resist anything ... except temptations!
 [ K e2 ]  [ Q x a1 ]  [ f x g6 ]  [ Q x a2 + ]  [ B d2 ]  [ Q x b3 ]  [ Q f2 ]  [ d3 + ]  [ K f1 ]  [ Q d1 + ]  [ Q e1 ]  [ Q f3 + ]  [ Q f2 ]  [ Q h3 + ]  [ K e1 ]  [ Q h1 + ]  [ Q f1 ]  [ Q x h4 + ]  [ Q f2 ] , [ Q x g4 ]  i was just knocking his pieces off
 [ B e3 ] , [ B x f5 ]  capture with which piece? the bishop jumps to sight as hits another pawn... but the queen allows white the chance for an exchange of queens which might be better for me but one never knows what might be the opponents ideas so I'll go for the more efficient Bxf5...
 [ N e7 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N d7 ] , [ a4 ]  Aiming to gain a little space on the queenside at the expense of the black queen.
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ] , [ e x d5 ]  ! Avoiding the Advanced variation
 [ Q e7 ]  [ e x d6 ]  [ Q x d6 ]  [ Q h5 + ]  [ K d8 ] , [ B g5 + ]  13.[ Q f7 ] is better threatening [ N x e6 + ] and [ Q x b7 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ N b3 ] , [ N d7 ]  misses 20....[ R x d1 + ] 21.[ R x d1 ] [ N f6 ] when Black is close to even.
 [ d5 ] , [ e x d5 ]  Scandinavian defense. I think I examined the player's game history to see which opening he was weakest against--I don't remember. And I'm certainly no expert at any of them--this seems like a waste of a good pawn but I figured I didn't really have much to lose.
 [ N x f3 + ]  [ Q x f3 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ Q e3 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ f5 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ R a d8 ]  [ e x f5 ]  [ Q c6 ]  [ f3 ]  [ g x f5 ]  [ Q f2 ]  [ K h8 ]  [ b4 ]  [ R f g8 ]  [ b5 ]  [ a x b5 ]  [ c x b5 ]  [ Q c5 ]  [ K f1 ] , [ Q b4 ]  This move gives White a very powerful and very influential passed b-pawn...
 [ N x c2 + ]  [ R x c2 ]  [ B x c2 ]  [ Q x c2 ] , [ b4 ]  Noteworthy is how fast the queen-side pawns have moved down the board and how potentially threatening the dark-squared bishop on [ g7 ] is in tandem with them. If black gets time to activate his rooks white will be in trouble.
 [ e5 ]  [ B x f3 ]  [ Q x f3 ]  [ d x e5 ] , [ R c d1 ]  17. Rcd1? - this tempting attack on Glenda will now result in white dropping a pawn. Glenda will now defend the pawn on e5. She is also attacking (well that makes a change!) the white pawn on c5.

 [ Q x h6 ]  [ a5 ] , [ b x a5 ]  Gameknot flags [ b x a5 ] as an inaccuracy suggesting that [ Q d2 ] was a better move. [ b x a5 ] allows my Queen to quickly become more active.
 [ Q h5 ] , [ h3 ]  Hitting my Bishop which is going to force another exchange. Being that what's attacked is pinned I must prevent Tom from winning a piece.

 [ Q f3 ] , [ Q x b2 ]  Winning a Pawn and forking two White pieces.

 [ K x b2 ]  [ B f3 ] , [ K c1 ]  Both Knights were pinned.
 [ N c3 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ B g5 ] , [ N b d7 ]  Alekhine's position is cramped but sound.

 [ K h3 ] , [ K g6 ]  If he takes my pawn then it's just a simple matter of king and rook VS king. He resigns. Please comment and rate.
 [ R g7 + ]  [ K f3 ]  [ R h7 ] , [ f4 ]  The h-pawn is immune due to ... [ K g3 ] threatening mate and attacking the rook.
 [ N h f7 ] , [ N f2 ]  As luck would have it - the knight which seemed all but doomed - now escapes.
 [ R d2 ] , [ R e6 ]  Now I move my rook to [ d2 ] which prevents black's rook from coming down to [ c2 ] to check the king. So black moves his rook to [ e6 ] to attack my other passed pawn at e5.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ f6 ]  hmmm not the best continuation. It opens up the king and locks up the knight on g8.
 [ c x b5 ]  [ B x b5 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ c6 ]  [ B x c6 ]  [ B x c6 ]  [ Q x c6 ]  [ R f b1 ] , [ K d7 ]  Got him on the run.
 [ K f6 ] , [ N h3 ]  Discovered a
 [ Q d7 ] , [ N d2 ]  I like QxP[ h3 ] here. That defends [ B f3 ] from NxB.
 [ B e7 ]  [ B x e7 ]  [ Q x e7 ] , [ c4 ]  I tried to drive back the knight here.
 [ R x h5 ] , [ R x h5 ]  Taking my Queen is still the best move. It's that we both overlooked it for several moves. The reason I did was because of how poorly Jack said that I played which still gets to me even at this phase. When I tend to forget about it is the moment that the game ends. I've got to find a way out of that and no amount of training is going to help me since these things happen to me on the spot against Jack. There's no control of when it happens. I think the lesson is taking the bad with the good and thinking about when I'm playing those good moves so that things like this doesn't get the best of me. That's been an ongoing problem for years to be exact.
 [ R e6 e5 ] , [ B x b7 ]  Loosing more material. Actually the game is already over now.
 [ a x b4 ]  [ B d4 ]  [ R x a8 ] , [ Q x a8 ]  ok forced exchange .. now i had time to wait for the white move i thought what he will do next..
 [ B g5 ]  [ N e4 ] , [ N x c5 ]  that's a wrong move isn't it?
 [ h x g4 ]  [ B x g4 + ]  [ K d2 ] , [ h3 ]  Threatening [ h2 ]  [ B x h3 ]  [ B h5 ] , [ B f1 ]  Creating a net around the king and aiming at gobbling the poor [ d5 ] pawn
 [ N h5 ] , [ f6 ]  The idea is if 14. ... [ e4 ] 15. [ Q g4 ] [ g6 ] and the position is unclear. White would not have lost a piece at that point and would have weakened black's kingside.
 [ K x f5 ]  [ K c1 ] , [ K g4 ]  Now losing is inevitable. It would be impossible to stop all three black pawns with my lonesome king. Thus I resigned and this wonderful game was over. I hope you enjoyed both annotations.
 [ e4 ] , [ c5 ]  Ive seen this response as black a few times not sure what its called but I think its a scandinavian defence?. I can see its aimed at stunting my progress into the centre with [ d4 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ a6 ]  Through review of other annotated games this defensive move is common on GK and ive adopted the defence myself as it prevents the pin on the knight or d pawn with the white bishop on b5.
 [ N f5 ]  [ R e f8 ]  [ N x g7 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ R x f8 ]  [ R x f8 ]  [ N e6 ]  [ R f6 ]  [ B x e4 ] , [ B x e4 ]  It's happening like I planned--white has no advantage.
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N g5 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ B x f7 + ]  [ K e7 ] , [ B d5 ]  6. [ B d5 ] - another fairly popular move keeping the bishop on the a2-[ g8 ] diagonal although Michael does have the option of taking the bishop with his knight.
 [ c3 ] , [ N c6 ]  In light of White's 14th move I think the knight was much better on [ d7 ]  [ Q b3 ]  [ B x f3 ]  [ R x f3 ]  [ b6 ]  [ f5 ]  [ g5 ] , [ Q e6 ]  This is now looking a bit hairy with pieces swarming around my king... I'd missed how strong 14 [ Q e6 ] was. 14... [ Q c8 ] might have been better
 [ B a3 ] , [ Q b6 ]  Joe: I'm thinking of exchanging with 15.[ B x b4 ] The idea is trying to exchange N for B but I'm not sure if this will work out or not. In fact I think it's the way to go for if I don't take you're going to knab my [ c2 ] or [ a2 ] pawn which I don't want to happen as I wind up a pawn down. Ken: you are right that I will take if you don't
 [ a5 ] , [ R c b1 ]  Not sure what was possessing me...
 [ B x c3 ] , [ g3 ]  Supporting h4. if [ g4 ] then black replies with [ R d4 ] winning at least a pawn.
 [ Q d5 ]  [ N x f3 + ]  [ Q x f3 ] , [ Q x c4 ]  Of course not Qxf3?? [ e x f7 ] mate.
 [ d5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ e3 ]  [ g6 ] , [ c4 ]  i maybe should have declined the gambit but i was afraid white might push the pawn to [ c5 ] gaining alot of space.
 [ N c6 ]  [ b x a5 ]  [ K h8 ]  [ B d4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ Q x a5 ]  [ B e4 ]  [ Q c7 ] , [ Q d6 ]  White tries to trade Queens since he has material advantage.
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ Q f3 ] , [ e6 ]  There's no way I am going to fall for that. I think is more orthodox than kn-[ h6 ]  [ d3 ] , [ N d4 ]  just an inconvenience to get the queen moved
 [ B x c7 ]  [ B x c7 ] , [ B d3 ]  Another line is 13.Qg4.
 [ N x e5 ] , [ R x e5 + ]  10.
 [ Q e4 + ] , [ K g8 ]  I moved the King to g8. Moving to [ h8 ] would be a problem for my Queen if white moved the Knight to [ g6 ] creating a fork.
 [ d x e5 ] , [ N d7 ]  ...and I was aiming for this.
 [ Q x e7 ]  [ R x e7 ]  [ R c1 ] , [ N d7 ]  ! [The knight on [ e5 ] holds white’s position together so this move makes the most sense.] [33…[ f6 ] would only create additional weaknesses in black’s camp. 34.[ N g4 ] would follow with a sufficient compensation.]
 [ Q x e5 ]  [ R x e5 ]  [ R x e5 ] , [ B x e5 ]  Due to the open position Whites pair of bishops clearly have a huge advantage over Black's minor pieces.
 [ N f3 ]  [ f x e3 + ]  [ B x e3 ] , [ B x f3 ]  A crucial move in the combination as we shall see . . .
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B b5 ] , [ N f6 ]  ...deferring [ a6 ] since that is exactly that white would appreciate the fact that black has over extended himself on the queenside only assist white in moving his bishop to a square that he was intended to land on anyway! So ... [ N f6 ] is defiant refusal follow white's lead.
 [ c x d6 ] , [ c x d6 ]  White forces a backward d-pawn from me however it's well-covered by my DSB and white doesn't have an obvious way to continue loading pressure onto it. I can potentially push it do ...[ d5 ] in the future as well to support a massive center.
 [ N f2 ] , [ K f4 ]  and now into the fire.
 [ R c x c7 + ]  [ K b8 ] , [ R c b7 + ]  Moving to [ c8 ] would allow checkmate but I knew he wouldn't play that.
 [ R f2 ]  [ B x f2 + ]  [ K x f2 ] , [ N f6 ]  I'm not surprised to see Erika going after the B. What white forgot is that it's protected.
 [ Q x e4 ]  [ K h5 ] , [ Q g2 ]  one move away from checkmate. All good things must come to an end. And he resigns.
 [ g4 ] , [ b5 ]  Tentative book lines start to get closer to each other
 [ R f e1 ] , [ N f5 ]  This move allows 18. [ B f4 ] [ Q a5 ] (back to her former action!) 19. [ N g5 ] [ R f6 ] 20. [ B g4 ] aiming rook knight and bishop at black's backward pawn. White would stand slightly better but that line wasn't chosen.
 [ B e7 ]  [ B x e7 ]  [ Q x e7 ]  [ N b d2 ]  [ O-O ] , [ O-O ]  Finally we've both castled.
 [ g4 ]  [ R e2 + ] , [ K g3 ]  All other moves lose.
 [ Q c4 ]  [ N a5 + ]  [ K b4 ] , [ Q x c4 + ]  If K:[ a5 ] - [ b6 ] #;
 [ h4 ]  [ B d4 ]  [ g5 ]  [ B e5 ]  [ h5 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ K g6 ] , [ B e5 ]  If Knight-[ e7 ] I planned Rook takes Knight. as to win the game.
 [ b3 ]  [ Q c2 ]  [ R d4 ] , [ b4 + ]  I can take this pawn of course but why? It is better to leave it as a potential shield from queen checks.
 [ B f4 ] , [ Q f8 ]  I was worried about White playing [ [ e5 ] ] while my queen was in line with his rook. If he plays [ [ e5 ] ] now then I can play [ N h5 ] attacking the bishop and discovering an attack on his e5-pawn.
 [ a4 ]  [ b4 ] , [ c3 ]  I really don't like my queenside now but just wait: it gets far worse. Dr. Jekyll is fully taking advantage of my laisse faire attitude about those pawns. This last move of mine was due to that careless attitude.
 [ B x c3 ] , [ b x c3 ]  12[ Q x c3 ] doesn't ruin the pawn structure but 12...[ N e4 ] comes with tempo.
 [ N b4 ] , [ R h c1 ]  I would have preferred to play QR-[ Q B1 ] but Black is assaulting my QRP at the moment.
 [ B f4 ]  [ g5 ]  [ R h4 h8 + ]  [ K g7 ]  [ R h3 h7 + ]  [ K g6 ]  [ R h7 h6 + ]  [ K g7 ]  [ R h8 h7 + ]  [ K g8 ]  [ B e3 ] , [ d6 ]  Doing everything I can to hold material here. White is clearly still with a big advantage.
 [ R a d1 ]  [ Q x h2 ]  [ g3 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ Q f5 ]  I was convinced that this would be a rather good defence.
 [ g x h4 ]  [ B x f4 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ B e3 + ]  [ K h1 ]  [ R f4 ] , [ R d3 ]  32. [ R d3 ] - trying to place my rook in a more active position and defending my b pawn at the same time. Henry is stuck in the corner - in fact he is actually stalemated - pity I can move my other pieces!
 [ N x d4 ] , [ N e7 ]  By moving the knight (Ne7) black's queen is blocked.
 [ h3 ]  [ B x f3 ] , [ Q x f3 ]  Black should continue developing with 7... N-B3. Instead he makes a small mistake.
 [ N f4 ] , [ R x b2 ]  Ah that's better. This now looks like a winnable endgame for black.
 [ B g4 ] , [ N b d2 ]  Computer says this is best but I never even considered it’s second suggestion of 11.[ Q e3 ] which I probably would have preferred.
 [ N g e5 ] , [ N h2 ]  To avoid more exchanges I pull back.
 [ K d6 ]  [ N x d5 ] , [ K x d5 ]  Objectively Black is lost and could resign now with a clear conscience but I decided to bluff it out for a while. See if White would return the favour.
 [ B d6 + ]  [ B e5 ]  [ B c5 ] , [ B c7 ]  with tempo.
 [ K f2 ]  [ K f6 ]  [ K f3 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ h4 ]  [ h5 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ B c8 ]  [ b6 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ c5 ] , [ d5 ]  White chooses to gain an advanced passed pawn although it does cost White another pawn.
 [ c3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N b d2 ]  [ O-O ] , [ e5 ]  competely unknown to me... I had to think a lot.
 [ N x e1 ]  [ R x e1 + ]  [ Q f1 ]  [ R x f1 + ] , [ K x f1 ]  A critical moment. Now Black is winning having a knight for a pawn lost in the opening with a sacrifice. He has to improve the position attacking the weaknesses of White searching for exchanges and promote a pawn... easy right?
 [ R g6 ] , [ R h g1 ]  18. [ R h g1 ] - my rook is now passive but I feel I need to preserve my extra pawn as long as possible.
 [ R d8 ] , [ R f d1 ]  Naturally I want to drive Black's Q from the heart of my position. I was expecting 18... Q-N5.
 [ b x c3 ]  [ Q x c3 + ] , [ K d1 ]  All forced. Now this is a critical position which deserves a diagram. Now there are three moves that seem to continue the attack: 19...[ B c2 + ] 19...[ B d3 ] and 19...Qc2+. Two lead to a draw one wins.
 [ B c4 ]  [ N h6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ B b4 + ]  [ c3 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ B x h6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B g5 ]  [ Q e8 ]  [ Q g4 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N a5 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ c6 ]  [ Q h4 ]  [ f5 ]  [ B x e7 ]  [ R f7 ]  [ B b4 ]  [ c x b5 ]  [ B x a5 ]  [ d6 ]  [ N h3 ]  [ h6 ]  [ B b4 ]  [ f x e4 ]  [ Q x e4 ]  [ R d7 ]  [ f4 ]  [ Q h5 ]  [ f5 ]  [ a5 ]  [ B x d6 ]  [ R x d6 ]  [ Q x e5 ]  [ R a a6 ] , [ Q e8 + ]  ?? Obviously didn't see my queen. He told me so in a comment after he'd committed to the move.
 [ Q h4 ] , [ Q e7 ]  I offer up an exchange of queens and an open invite into a quiet endgame politely exchanging off pieces and courteously racing to promote maybe...
 [ R x e5 ] , [ g7 ]  and nothing can stop my pawn. Uffffffff!!!!!!!!!!!!
 [ Q a2 ] , [ R a7 ]  At least I stopped any attempt of castling queen-side!
 [ Q f3 ]  [ R x b5 ]  [ a x b5 ] , [ B d2 ]  This bishop is really strong!
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N b d2 ] , [ e5 ]  Finally someone who goes for the hard play! The issue is that I never faced this before and it seems to become very tactical. I regret not to spend time on theory books.
 [ e4 ]  [ g6 ]  [ b3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c6 ]  [ B b2 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N d2 ]  [ Q d6 ]  [ Q f3 ]  [ h5 ] , [ O-O-O ]  I forgot about the rules of castling wasn't ready for that.
 [ f x e6 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ N x e4 ] , [ B x e7 ]  Order of capture is important. If Black had taken [ N e4 ] first Black gains a piece.
 [ R c3 ]  [ Q x a6 ] , [ B x b3 ]  he infernal blazes full throttle as White is left with few choices. Mate lingers in the air as the tread (or perhaps noose?) White is hanging on gets tighter...
 [ B x g3 + ]  [ K g2 ] , [ Q h2 # ]  As a moral you should always look for sacrifices even as early as move six. As funny as it seems white put a comment saying she would win but ended up losing this quickly.
 [ N b d2 ] , [ N b4 ]  The point of [ N a6 ] is revealed. In my opinion this knight maneuver is premature...
 [ N f6 ] , [ N f3 ]  White ducks standard QP Indian/Nimzo type lines that would have resulted from 2. [ c4 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ d6 ]  [ e3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ O-O ] , [ O-O ]  Black has a standard King's Indian formation. White's is a somewhat conservative formation more commonly seen against something like the Slav I think.
 [ Q b8 ] , [ b3 ]  if he got my pawn at [ c3 ] by using his bishop i will get his knight or bishop by my rock at [ R c1 ]  [ Q e8 ]  [ R c1 ]  [ Q x e4 ]  [ N h2 ]  [ Q e6 ]  [ R e1 ] , [ B e5 ]  now i have a chance to get his bishop ;)
 [ N b3 ]  [ B e5 ]  [ B x e5 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ Q e3 ]  [ R f6 ]  [ c5 ]  [ b x c5 ]  [ N x c5 ]  [ B c6 ]  [ f4 ] , [ B b5 ]  this required a lot of work. The point of this move was to force the rook off of [ f1 ] and bar that square to the other rook. This is important in lines where white can play [ R x f6 ] and black must be able to reply [ Q x f6 ] not having to worry about a R[ f1 ] by white if black has played ... [ K f8 ] in response to a queen check. Whether black can force a win at this point is in question particularly if most of the pieces come off the board and white has a rook left at that point.
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ] , [ c4 ]  The Queen's gambit. I hate playing against this as it usually gives an obvious spacial advantage to White early on.
 [ K g5 ]  [ K g2 ]  [ K g4 ]  [ d6 ]  [ B x d6 ]  [ K f2 ] , [ f3 ]  Zugzwang. A situation when one would rather pass than move. See white above. Black can mark time with the bishop.
 [ e6 ] , [ B x g5 ]  the black king is getting boxed in
 [ O-O ] , [ h3 ]  Not sure of the purpose of this move.
 [ g x f5 ] , [ Q f2 # ]  With the white rook out of the way the black queen is free to checkmate.
 [ c4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ e4 ]  [ d6 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ e5 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N c6 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N e7 ] , [ Q b3 ]  I am not sure of the purpose of this move. I don't like it because it blocks White's b-pawn which he should be pushing.
 [ N b d2 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ N e4 ] , [ Q f5 ]  ? Black should have castled.
 [ d4 ]  [ R e6 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ c3 ]  Nope. P[ d5 ] forks black's rook and knight.
 [ Q g7 ]  [ h x g6 ]  [ Q x g6 ]  [ f x g4 ] , [ R x g4 ]  A difficult position to assess and play with black having the 2 bishops both baring down on the white queenside. I am trying to create threats of my own and watch out for mate
 [ B d6 ] , [ h3 ]  21. [ h3 ] - to prevent Ng4. Alas William's knight goes to [ h5 ] and foments a lot of aggro from there too!
 [ c3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ O-O ]  [ R c8 ]  [ B g5 ] , [ f6 ]  8...the [ e6 ] weakness is not always so easy to exploit it looks worse than it probably is
 [ B x d6 ]  [ R x d6 ]  [ N x d6 ]  [ Q d4 + ]  [ K g2 ]  [ Q x d6 ] , [ Q c8 ]  So white won an exchange and is better in this end-game but there is still a lot of work and dangers remain. [ Q c8 ] is a good move as it protects the important [ g4 ] square.
 [ B b7 ]  [ b5 ]  [ N d8 ]  [ Q b3 ]  [ B x d5 ] , [ Q x d5 ]  Now attack for a rock
 [ N a4 ]  [ Q d8 ]  [ R f d1 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ e4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ Q f3 ] , [ N b6 ]  The Knight is driven away from the vital sector.
 [ N f6 ]  [ B g2 ] , [ N c6 ]  Perhaps I should have waited with bringing my knight out. Maybe Bishop [ f5 ] and then Knight from [ b8 ] to [ d7 ] would have been better. No point in thinking about it now my opponent is over 1750 elo it'd surprise me if he didn't know the theory behind both knight moves.
 [ b3 ] , [ Q d7 ]  Controlling [ g4 ] and a4. I had nothing concrete in mind till now.
 [ B c1 ] , [ N d1 ]  Threatening a pawn but it was also the only safe move for the knight.
 [ N e4 ]  [ B d7 + ]  [ K f7 ]  [ B x f5 ] , [ B d3 ]  I have no idea what my opponent is trying to do. Maybe force a checkmate on me before I can mate him?
 [ B d6 ]  [ Q d7 ]  [ B e5 ] , [ N h5 ]  Nh5! to attack Q and Bishop and protect my B.
 [ c3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ g6 ] , [ h3 ]  [ N f3 ] is most popular here.
 [ f6 ]  [ B d3 ] , [ f5 ]  My bishop is blocked but this allows me to play the sac (Ng5). Black's self blocked pieces are playing in my favour so I have time for another preparatory move.
 [ e5 ]  [ a3 ] , [ N f6 ]  Attacking pawn very standard
 [ K g5 ]  [ N h8 ]  [ Q x e5 + ]  [ K g8 ] , [ K h6 ]  Poor move by my opponent i think he newer saw my horse.
 [ e6 ]  [ N f6 + ]  [ K e7 ]  [ Q g5 ]  [ h6 ]  [ N g8 + ]  [ K e8 ]  [ N f6 + ]  [ K e7 ]  [ N d5 + ]  [ K d6 ]  [ N x b4 + ]  [ N d4 ] , [ R x d4 # ]  
 [ a5 ] , [ N g5 ]  Both knights are now loose and become targets of tactical play.
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ d6 ] , [ Q f3 ]  I have never understood this move except for the novice players.
 [ B x c4 ]  [ R x c4 ] , [ N d6 ]  Bringing back le Chevalier blanc & forcing rook to replace
 [ f x e5 ] , [ c5 ]  A missed opportunity here perhaps. Instead of BxP next better here might have been RxP (threatening RxN and then [ R h1 + ] and Qh3#). If he takes the B now then after RxN he is in serious danger of being mated so he is therefore "likely" to move his f-pawn probably to [ [ f4 ] ] I'd think (note that he can't move the N either without getting mated). This then allows: 33. [ [ f4 ] ] [ B x c5 + ] 34. [ K h1 ] [ Q f3 + ] 35. [ Q g2 ] [ Q x g2 + ] 36. [ K x g2 ] [ R b3 ] (wins another pawn) 37. [ f x e5 ] [ R x b5 ] 38. [ e6 ] [ B e7 ] ... and now with 3 connected passed pawns you have an easy win. I said "likely" above because there is one better continuation for him (but a player at his level could easily not find it): [ Q b3 + ] and then Qd5. So RxP isn't a guaranteed win but it was a very good chance. As a minimum--at no loss of material--it eliminates two pieces in front of his K and gives you current and future mating chances.
 [ R d8 ] , [ R f3 ]  ?! With the idea of doubling rooks on the f file with the option to try a piece swindle after ...Bg4. A better move could be [ R f6 ] which may encourage a knight attack but it will keep the [ h6 ] bishop safe from a rook attack.
 [ Q f6 ] , [ B d1 ]  Still should end in a draw. Caruana was afraid of some potential complication with 27...[ Q x a4 ] so he chose the safe way.
 [ B g5 ] , [ e3 ]  13. [ e3 ] made more sense than to exchange B's and help Black develop her Queen. Of course I'll be doubling my pawns. Is a file considered half-open if only one play has two pawns on the file?
 [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B g2 ] , [ d6 ]  Black's intention is to fix the white c pawns up for attack. White should strive to activate the bishop pair and make it count for something. Therefore he should castle keep the tension between the pawns play in the center with move of e4. Black will try to make white the one releasing the tension by playing ...e5. So white needs to stop this move. However my opponent was not thinking about the planning and just makes ordinary moves that give black an advantage.
 [ e x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ] , [ Q f3 ]  Now cos I've been lazy I'm starting to get into trouble. The direct threat is to [ f7 ] threatening mate. I can block that easily enough but the problem I have is I'm likely to leave two of your queen bishop knight combination attacking [ f7 ]  [ Q x e7 + ] , [ N x e7 ]  Had the choice of pieces to counter take with but didn't want my queenside pawns doubled (if you had taken bxn it gives me great difficulty that side)
 [ K c1 ]  [ B x e3 + ]  [ K b1 ]  [ B d5 ]  [ R d1 ]  [ B e4 ] , [ Q x e4 ]  Blunder: -Mate(2) » 23. [ Q x e4 ] [ Q x d1 + ] 24. [ B c1 ] [ Q x c1 # ] Best: -13.54 » 23. [ R d3 ] [ e x [ f4 ] ] 24. [ B c1 ] [ f x g3 ] 25. [ h3 ] [ Q g6 ] 26. [ B x e3 ] [ f4 ] 27. [ K c1 ] [ B x d3 ] 28. [ Q d2 ] [ f x e3 ] 29. [ Q x e3 ] [ B f1 ] 30. [ Q f3 ] Bx[ h3 ] 31. [ Q x b7 ]  [ d4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ c4 ] , [ b6 ]  English Defence. A variety of moves are possible here. I chose to transpose to a Q Indian.
 [ N g3 ] , [ R a2 ]  White thinks better of the the adventure and further defends g2.
 [ R x b8 ] , [ g6 ]  Not leaving air to breathe anymore. But then it's about what else. However I'm still going to take with check on my next move was the reason behind the way that I captured on my previous move.
 [ b3 ]  [ a3 ]  [ Q d6 ] , [ R h2 ]  At this point I was caught in a corner and could only make subtle moves. There was no way to defend the pawn.
 [ B g4 ] , [ B e3 ]  After 7.[ [ h3 ] ] [ B x f3 ] 8.[ Q x f3 ] [ Q x d4 ] 9.[ B e3 ] [ Q d8 ] 10.0-0-0 [ N b d7 ] 11.[ R h f1 ] [ [ e6 ] ] White has very little to bite on. One ICC game taken from Sawyer's book continued 12.[ g4 ] [ N e5 ] 13.[ Q f2 ] [ Q c7 ] 14.[ g5 ] [ N d5 ] 15.[ N x d5 ] [ c x d5 ] 16.[ B b5 + ] [ N c6 ] 17.[ B f4 ] [ Q b6 ] when White was two pawns down for nothing. ICC games should be taken with a pinch of salt but has White got that many options after 8...Qxd4? Hardly. 7.0-0 [ [ e6 ] ] is the same type of game. Neither 8.[ [ h3 ] ] [ B x f3 ] 9.[ Q x f3 ] [ Q x d4 + ] 10.[ B e3 ] Qe5! 11.[ B f4 ] [ Q a5 ] 12.[ N e4 ] [ N b d7 ] or 8.B[ g5 ] [ B x f3 ] 9.[ Q x f3 ] [ Q x d4 + ] 10.[ K h1 ] [ N b d7 ] gives White enough for his two pawn deficit.
 [ Q e3 + ]  [ K f8 ]  [ B b4 + ]  [ K g7 ] , [ B c3 + ]  this is the end of the game. [ g8 ] is mate [ f8 ] is free rook and great position this game is over either way
 [ R g2 g7 ]  [ K f2 ]  [ Q a3 ]  [ R c3 ] , [ Q a1 ]  Black's queen never was able to exert any influence on White's queenside despite repeated attempts...
 [ N d4 ]  [ N f5 ] , [ R d6 ]  ?! If I was him I'd take the rook
 [ Q x d5 ] , [ e x d5 ]  So two straight pawns less a knight very badly placed (since without the queens the planned attack on the kingside is hardly possible). A pawn storm coming down and I have not even castled!
 [ Q a5 + ]  [ B d2 ]  [ Q x b5 ]  [ a4 ]  [ Q b6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ f3 ]  [ N x d2 ]  [ Q x d2 ] , [ Q b4 ]  all business. a piece ahead and queens off the board black should win easily
 [ B g4 ] , [ Q b1 # ]  I had a feeling I would win with a queenside attack I felt it even before he castled queenside!!!!
 [ a5 ]  [ a3 ]  [ h6 ] , [ b4 ]  I fully expected White to play 18.[ B x h6 ] here with two pawns and a raging attack on my king. This move gives me some play on the queenside and a little breathing room.
 [ c x b4 ] , [ a3 ]  white plans on opening the file for his rook and allowing the development of the dsb to the a3-[ f8 ] diagonal where it plays influence on the development of the e pawn due to the somewhat undermining Bx[ f8 ] Kxf8. I decided that I don't like that plan so instead I decide to start my move on the center and develop if [ a x b4 ] with the move e6.
 [ R x e7 + ]  [ K x e7 ]  [ Q x d6 + ]  [ K f7 ]  [ Q x f8 + ]  [ K e6 ]  [ R d6 + ]  [ K e5 ] , [ Q f4 # ]  
 [ R x f2 ]  [ N x f2 ]  [ K x f2 ] , [ Q f6 + ]  This is early considering black has nothing to support the attack and the knight isn't in danger since it can be pulled back to interpose and defend the king.
 [ d x c6 ] , [ N x e5 ]  Too cocky
 [ R a2 ]  [ R d5 ] , [ R d2 ]  (?!) Very strange. I can only surmise that White hoped to make capital out of mating threats once the rook left the back rank.
 [ K b8 ] , [ N e7 ]  use my knight to block his line to [ d8 ] mate in one
 [ B x b6 ]  [ c x b6 ] , [ Q e8 + ]  [ N c3 ] was better but this also wins.
 [ N d4 ]  [ N b8 ]  [ N f5 ] , [ Q d8 ]  trying to bring his Queen to his King side.
 [ b5 ]  [ h3 ]  [ b x c6 ] , [ B x c6 ]  black pawn on [ e5 ] blocking white bishop
 [ K h1 ]  [ R a d8 ] , [ a5 ]  28. [ a5 ] - passed pawns must be pushed!
 [ R c1 ]  [ a5 ]  [ K g2 ]  [ N b5 ]  [ K g3 ] , [ N a3 ]  Covering [ c2 ] for a possible future advance of my c-Pawn.
 [ d3 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ d2 ]  [ N e3 ] , [ R b3 ]  [0-1] Nothing will stop the d-pawn now. White resigned. An engrossing game with all sorts of chances for both sides. To be fair to White the strong attack he developed late in the game was enormously complicated and not all easy to determine the best way to carry on. Check out the Qh8ch moves as played and in the analysis. Sometimes it was an excellent move occasionally so-so and at other times it was a bad move. It was the sort of game in which you could expect the odd inaccuracy even at the highest levels Well done both players!
 [ N d5 ] , [ h x g6 ]  pxp rather than g2-[ g3 ] best idea? No idea. Going for kn-[ h7 ] Queen rook fork.
 [ e4 ] , [ d6 ]  My standard black response.
 [ O-O ]  [ B g5 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ h3 ]  [ B h5 ] , [ N d5 ]  White will double my pawns.
 [ N f6 ] , [ e3 ]  Blocking his dark squared bishop would be a mistake. The block wasn't forced
 [ e5 ] , [ f4 ]  I'm not good with this opening not good with most openings.
 [ N e7 ] , [ a4 ]  I suspect this is a mistake but white seems unsure how to proceed.
 [ e3 ] , [ B d6 ]  Black takes advantage of quick development and moves towards king safety. The bishop appears awkward here but does offer an attack later via Qd8-[ c7 ] with an attack directed towards [ h2 ] where white must presumedly castle. Its is an ambitious move but I feel [ B e7 ] is better. Maybe because of white gaining space by d4[ x c5 ] Bd6[ x c5 ] b2-[ b4 ] Bc5-e7. Rate as ?! and = because white can make positional gains but black has a lead in piece development. There is the debate of expansion of space for white verses piece development for black. There is an imbalance between the applied strategies.
 [ Q x h7 ]  [ K f6 ]  [ K e4 ]  [ K e6 ]  [ Q f5 + ]  [ K e7 ]  [ Q c5 + ]  [ K f7 ]  [ Q d6 ]  [ K g8 ]  [ Q b8 + ]  [ K h7 ]  [ Q f4 ]  [ K g8 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ K h8 ] , [ Q f7 ]  and there we go he just didn't move his queen far enough he was trying to keep pushing his pawn
 [ B x f5 ] , [ e x f5 ]  So we exchanged them...
 [ K g6 ]  [ K g4 ]  [ K h7 ]  [ K g5 ]  [ K g7 ]  [ Q f5 ]  [ K g8 ]  [ K g6 ]  [ K h8 ] , [ Q f8 # ]  Another lucky win.
 [ B d3 ] , [ N e7 ]  Joe: As with a different annotation I think castling is a good idea at once. One reason for playing [ B d3 ] was to castle. Ken: I don't see a better move
 [ Q x f3 ] , [ R x g6 + ]  Not forced. [ K x g5 ] is playable after Qh3+. I like 31. [ h4 ] as it gives white a shot at checkmate.
 [ b4 ] , [ B b6 ]  weak threat
 [ Q g6 ] , [ Q c5 ]  The bishop may seem to be hanging but in fact all subsequent lines to [ Q x e6 ] involve mate or an enormous material loss. 21...[ b6 ] is necessary to prevent the *immediate* intrusion of the White Queen.
 [ e4 ] , [ e5 ]  Not facing the Sicilian a change!
 [ d4 ]  [ B b6 ] , [ a3 ]  ? A very strange move. It seems white might be trying to get a good pawn structure but on the wrong side.
 [ c3 ]  [ R g6 ] , [ B f4 ]  ?? Missing the finishing move.
 [ N f6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N b d7 ]  [ N b d2 ]  [ R c8 ]  [ Q a4 ]  [ a6 ] , [ N e5 ]  White's plan is not to keep the knight on [ e5 ] but actually to swap knights.
 [ R d7 ] , [ Q c6 ]  And that's when I fork. What I kept in mind was the nasty pin that grace-augustine had on fiercequeen's right before she resigned which was just as effective here this time around. At first I thought that Carl had no way out of it but then I figured out that he can. Had he done so I'd protect with 29.[ c4 ] and would be ready to attack with 30.[ g5 ] as then I'd be trying to figure out a way to safely take on e7.
 [ N x d6 + ] , [ K b8 ]  ... [ K c7 ] was better.
 [ Q b6 ] , [ a3 ]  Preventing [ B b4 ] which would disrupt white's support for his weak pawn.
 [ Q x b5 ]  [ N x b5 ] , [ B x a2 + ]  The attack continues with the Queens off the board.
 [ Q a4 + ] , [ K g3 ]  (??) White now loses. He should have played 20. Kf3. In the resulting analysis he would have to give up his queen but his first blunder made his position hopeless.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ d6 ]  [ h3 ] , [ N a5 ]  I want to get rid of his bishop so i will switch it with my knight
 [ g6 ] , [ N e3 ]  At least that one is blocked. White's plan is to block the a file with the lonesome rider and to take the e pawn with the king.
 [ B x e6 ]  [ f x e6 ] , [ h4 ]  White thinks opening the kingside will benefit him. I was wrong!
 [ e x d5 ]  [ N b x d5 ]  [ B x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ] , [ c x d5 ]  Now that there isn't so much going on queenside a knight on [ b5 ] now isn't as threatening as it was earlier especially since Black would have the option of exchanging it off
 [ R x d5 ] , [ Q b3 ]  White looks to have everything on the queenside defended but that [ d2 ] square now looks a little weak...
 [ g6 ] , [ h3 ]  Or the h pawn can promote. White resigned here after putting up a very good fight.
 [ R d3 ] , [ R c3 c1 ]  What can a rook here can do? You'll see.
 [ R x f6 ]  [ R x f6 ] , [ B x f6 ]  This is the end of my first line of thought when playing 22.[ B x f7 + ] at the start of the combination. The position is very good for white who is winning.
 [ B c3 ]  [ R d3 ]  [ B x a5 ]  [ f4 ]  [ R f d8 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ f6 ]  [ B h6 ]  [ N x f4 ]  [ R f3 ] , [ R d1 + ]  ..at last an opportunity to quickly force off more material if not end the game with a mating threat.
 [ d2 ] , [ Q b5 + ]  White is playing for the draw.
 [ Q x c5 + ]  [ R x c5 ]  [ R x d3 ]  [ R x d3 ]  [ N x c5 ]  [ R x c3 ]  [ N x a6 ]  [ R x a3 ]  [ N c5 ]  [ R a2 ]  [ R d1 ]  [ R b2 ]  [ R d7 + ]  [ K e8 ]  [ R x g7 ]  [ R x b4 ] , [ R b7 ]  ??? White could have gobbled another pawn with no ill effects....
 [ R a1 ]  [ R x a5 + ]  [ K b1 ]  [ R b5 ]  [ N g5 ]  [ N h2 ] , [ Q g2 ]  The idea is to trap the queen and kill her....by bringing the knight across and locking her escape route down
 [ c3 ] , [ N c6 ]  enough is enough I bring out my Knight to Nc6.
 [ K h2 ]  [ R f8 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ N f1 + ]  [ K h1 ] , [ Q x e5 ]  Threatens [ Q h1 # ]  [ e4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ d5 ] , [ e x d5 ]  transposing into the exchange variation
 [ B g6 ] , [ B x g6 ]  Now black gets the choice of which pawn to double. The only compensation I have is that his kingside pawns are pretty far-flung.
 [ B d6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ h6 ]  [ N b d2 ] , [ O-O ]  White has developed all pieces black has 3 out and central pawn control and castled kingside. Solid textbook start for both.
 [ B c4 ]  [ g6 ]  [ Q f3 ] , [ N f6 ]  Still in book
 [ B g4 ]  [ Q d2 ] , [ N h5 ]  Here I started seeing possibilities of if I could move my knight closer some king of sacrifice to draw his king out.
 [ Q b1 ]  [ N d7 ] , [ Q b4 ]  White is slightly better and has a more comfortable position it should be hold-able for Carlsen.
 [ B d3 ] , [ N d7 ]  Opening up the crowded corner
 [ B b7 ]  [ B g2 ] , [ d5 ]  Staking his claim in the center. It is interesting to see that the position after Black's move gives an edge to White in practice.
 [ Q x d4 ] , [ R f c8 ]  I would prefer to put the rook on [ e1 ] and contest the only open file the e file.
 [ B a5 ]  [ e4 ] , [ Q c7 ]  Getting wood off the back row needs to be Black's priority at this point and this also attacks the [ c3 ] pawn.
 [ f6 ]  [ Q x d5 ] , [ e x d5 ]  16. ........ [ Q x d5 ] - this leaves black with two queenside isolanis to compensate for my kingside pawn islands.
 [ N f3 ] , [ f6 ]  I don't why black played this. It's not a developing and does not help to control the center. Therefore as far as I know this move is out of book.
 [ d x e5 ]  [ B d2 ] , [ N h7 ]  17...[ [ b4 ] ] quicker except a pawn exchange on [ [ b4 ] ] could lead to a rook exchange which could displace my Q from protecting [ e5 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ f6 ]  18... I thought this plan involved too much shuffling but it panned out for me.
 [ K g2 ] , [ R d8 ]  24. ...... [ R d8 ] - the knight is trapped but .....
 [ N e4 ]  [ R f5 + ]  [ K e3 ] , [ h5 ]  32. ...... [ h5 ] - trying to hold back g4.
 [ Q x e5 ]  [ R a d1 ]  [ B a6 ]  [ f4 ]  [ Q c5 ]  [ R f3 ]  [ B x c4 ]  [ B x c4 ]  [ Q x c4 ]  [ R d4 ]  [ Q x a2 ]  [ R a4 ]  [ Q d5 ]  [ c4 ]  [ Q c6 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ N x f6 ]  [ h3 ]  [ b5 ]  [ R b4 ]  [ R a b8 ]  [ c5 ]  [ d6 ]  [ R f2 ]  [ Q x c5 ]  [ Q x c5 ]  [ d x c5 ]  [ R b1 ]  [ c4 ]  [ R c2 ]  [ a5 ]  [ K f2 ]  [ a4 ]  [ K f3 ]  [ a3 ]  [ g4 ]  [ R d c8 ]  [ R b4 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ R b1 ]  [ b4 ]  [ e4 ]  [ b3 ]  [ R h2 ] , [ a2 ]  
 [ B e3 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ N b d7 ]  [ a4 ]  [ R c8 ]  [ a5 ]  [ Q c7 ] , [ R f d1 ]  The [ d6 ] pawn is proving to be a real thorn in my side and I am very restricted here... this does not seem a good choice of opening.
 [ e5 ] , [ f4 ]  I start with the Kings gambit as this is something I have played quite a bit recently with some success. My theory is that its not seen so often and so it takes some players out of their comfort zone
 [ N x d5 ]  [ R x c2 ]  [ a x b4 ]  [ a x b4 ]  [ K f2 ] , [ R x b2 ]  Black now has a huge positional plus whereas white's pieces are poorly co-ordinated.
 [ K e8 ]  [ R b8 + ]  [ K e7 ] , [ f4 ]  preventing [ B e5 ] and also opening another escape route for his king At this point I was starting to think I had seriously miscalculated
 [ a5 ] , [ b4 ]  b4? bad move but I am asking myself did he had any better solutions. In fact yes! Saco should resign this game but he hanged out for few more moves
 [ R x f7 ] , [ Q e8 + ]  game over. Funny thing on the end is: madcapsb accused me after this game for using chess programme. I can understand the frustration of loosing with an minus 300 elo player but his own mistake in 23th move is more than clear. The conclusion is - David can beat the Goliath and in chess you never know - and one bad move really changes everything...
 [ N c6 ] , [ N f3 ]  Already I have cold feet and I quickly try to get back to the Knight's Gambit (characterized by 3. [ N f3 ] instead of 3. Bc4) of the KGA with which I am much more familiar.
 [ e4 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ d6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N g e7 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ B e6 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ B x d5 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ B x e5 ]  [ g3 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ R f8 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ a6 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ Q d7 ]  [ R a c1 ]  [ c5 ] , [ b3 ]  Better move is 18.[ d x c6 ] I - (18. ... [ b x c6 ] 19. Bxe7! [ Q x e7 ] 20. [ R x c6 ] +-) II - (18. ... [ N x c6 ] 19. Be3=)
 [ B g5 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ B x f6 ] , [ h3 ]  this is the move I waited for.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ c3 ] , [ N f6 ]  Probably the most aggressive reply but surely the natural one attacking the undefended pawn?
 [ N e2 + ]  [ K f1 ]  [ K x f7 ] , [ K x e2 ]  I am not down ok but I exposed my K for a pawn when a piece was given to me.
 [ N x a3 ]  [ B x a4 ]  [ N c4 ] , [ R d7 + ]  But again in trouble that Knight move giving me to attack King steadily.
 [ e4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B b4 ]  [ e5 ] , [ b6 ]  black chooses to play his pawn. Why noty his Knight to e7? rRule 1: play your knights first. Rule 2: Be careful about making pawn moves especially at the bebginning of the game. This pawn move would latyer on in the game put Black King in a dangerous position.
 [ K x h7 ]  [ Q x d5 ]  [ B x g5 + ] , [ N x g5 + ]  Material is even but my king is under attack.
 [ R a d8 ] , [ R f e1 ]  a quick sum: white has a great space to act with a knught on [ d6 ] and e d c rows open and semi-open. black lmost cant move with a bad bishop on [ b7 ] and a poor king...
 [ N x c3 ]  [ R f6 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ R x f5 + ]  [ e x f5 ]  [ R c8 ] , [ f6 + ]  The irony of this move is that this limits the mobility of the knight.
 [ B x b2 ] , [ a4 ]  30. a4! - [ B x g5 ] loses loses loses because I would then play [ B x a3 ] giving me a remote a passer. I analysed this very carefully and that a pawn passer would become a footman in drag on [ a1 ] (you know black wig black dress black cloak black wand/sceptre black hat with a gold tiara) but taking on Glenda's powers once in receipt of the wand/sceptre). My opponent sees this and moves his pawn to [ a4 ] - this is gonna make the win a lot harder so I thought.
 [ N a6 ]  [ a3 ]  [ c6 ]  [ e4 ]  [ c x d5 ] , [ e x d5 ]  ?! taking with the c-pawn was better.
 [ N d x e4 ]  [ B e7 ] , [ N g5 ]  Threatening mate again. White is begging Black to trade pieces.
 [ N c3 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ B x f7 + ] , [ K x f7 ]  5. ...... [ K x f7 ] - Etienne accepts the sacrifice. However Les can actually recover the loss by playing [ N x e4 ] on the next turn.
 [ h4 ]  [ K f7 ]  [ N f1 ] , [ B d5 ]  34...[ N b3 ] was a lot stronger but why not torment White for being greedy a little longer?
 [ N x e5 ]  [ B b3 ]  [ B d6 ] , [ N e4 ]  If White exchanges knight for bishop then White will have a better endgame.
 [ R h7 + ] , [ K f8 ]  And with [ R h8 + ] I win a rook.
 [ N c3 ] , [ N d4 ]  At this point I expected maybe a trade to destroy my castle structure.
 [ d3 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ e3 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ f3 ]  [ B d7 ] , [ N h3 ]  ...I'd tried Ne2.
 [ Q a2 ] , [ e6 ]  Securing a solid Pawn chain.
 [ b6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ B g7 ] , [ c4 ]  May as well take some more of the centre while I'm being given the chance.
 [ B x e6 ] , [ R e8 ]  Obviously going after my B.
 [ N x g5 ] , [ c6 ]  Preparing [ d5 ] but also containing a tactic that White overlooked
 [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ e5 ]  [ g3 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ B g2 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ h6 ]  [ d3 ]  [ a6 ]  [ e3 ] , [ O-O ]  Now that both sides have castled white is a little behind due to the problem of the limited mobility of my bishops. This is a problem that usually comes up though and I feel as though it is not something that causes me to lose this game.
 [ B e6 ]  [ B x d5 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ Q c5 ]  [ f4 ]  [ h4 ]  [ B f7 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ f3 ]  [ R f1 ]  [ R b6 ]  [ N a3 ]  [ R f6 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ R f5 ]  [ R f2 ]  [ h6 ] , [ B e7 ]  Bringing the bishop to a poor location to defend against my connected passed pawns.
 [ Q d7 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ Q d8 ]  [ O-O-O ]  [ B d7 ]  [ d5 ]  [ a6 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ B f5 ] , [ B c4 ]  building presure
 [ e5 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ B d8 ] , [ e4 + ]  My pawn is protected by the rook. I go for the queen now.
 [ K f4 ]  [ R e7 ]  [ R x b2 + ] , [ K e1 ]  37. [ K e1 ] - this move should have been played instead of [ R e7 ] on the last move according to Gameknot Analysis but all my pawns will now fall like rotten apples tears!
 [ R a d1 ] , [ B a6 ]  ?? The second rook is captured. [ B e7 ] was urgently needed.
 [ h3 ]  [ Q f4 ]  [ Q e2 ] , [ B x f3 ]  Decide to double the f-pawns which will put us on comparatively even ground. If I can win the pawn back then I'll have the better position even! This move turns out to be crucial in to Black's win.
 [ N e6 + ]  [ K h7 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ R f1 ]  [ b6 ]  [ R f7 + ]  [ K h8 ] , [ h4 ]  With the last chance for a back rank mate for black gone my opponent resigns.
 [ c5 ]  [ Q a4 + ]  [ B d7 ] , [ Q b3 ]  Inevitably the queen gets chased around.
 [ B e2 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ B f1 ]  [ B f8 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ B f1 ]  [ B f8 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ B f1 ]  [ B f8 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ B g7 ] , [ B f1 ]  Imagine; I watched this game!!
 [ K f7 ] , [ a3 ]  I want his pawns
 [ K x f1 ] , [ Q a4 ]  This is when I realized I had an open door to the back rank. At this point the best White could have done was 20. [ B b5 ] forking queen and rook but it's too late for him. Keep the pressure on his king and I'll at least save both pieces.
 [ R d1 ]  [ R h e8 ]  [ d5 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ c4 ]  [ Q c6 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ R x d5 ] , [ B g2 ]  black had already seen this move and saw that there was a defense for it with the inbetween move.
 [ N x e5 ]  [ d6 ] , [ N f3 ]  This is the main line of the Defense
 [ N f6 ]  [ Q b3 ] , [ Q e7 + ]  6. ..... [ Q e7 + ] - after Ion's Q and lsb pile up on my poor little [ f7 ] pawn Glenda finds herself pressed into defensive (and attacking?) duties on only move 7.
 [ a5 ]  [ B b2 ]  [ Q d5 ]  [ Q c5 ]  [ Q x b3 ]  [ B c3 ]  [ a4 ]  [ Q x c6 ]  [ Q c2 ]  [ d5 ] , [ a3 ]  It looks as though Black could have got a perpetual check here: 36...[ Q c1 ] 37.[ K h2 ] [ Q f4 ] 38.[ g3 ] [ Q x f2 ]  [ Q f6 ]  [ Q c1 + ]  [ K h2 ]  [ a2 ] , [ Q g7 # ]  
 [ Q a4 ]  [ K h7 ]  [ Q d1 ] , [ R c2 ]  28. .... [ R c2 ] - after the prophylactic move of putting Henry on [ h7 ] to prevent any annoying checks by the WQ I then decided to attack King David's second rank so that I can give him a .......... BONE IN THE THROAT!!
 [ Q x c3 ] , [ Q x e4 + ]  Either way the king go I can take another pawn.
 [ N h5 ]  [ B x e7 ]  [ Q x e7 ]  [ N g3 ] , [ N x g3 ]  Breaking up the Pawn barricade surrounding the King.
 [ Q d6 ] , [ d5 ]  Defends my LSB and clears the way for my DSB to join the attack.
 [ N c6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ O-O ] , [ O-O ]  Double castling
 [ Q e6 ]  [ B x d8 ]  [ R x d8 ] , [ Q x h7 ]  ! However I had no idea that his last move leaves his [ h8 ] pawn hanging. Therefore I decide to take advantage by grabbing it.
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ a6 ]  I'm sure all fairly high rated players have seen this the Najdorf variation.
 [ N x d7 ] , [ R x d7 ]  this is where my notation ends but from memory the last moves where this there realy wasn't much I could do anymore
 [ R x a2 ]  [ N f7 ] , [ R a7 + ]  The rook invades threatening king knight and pawn.
 [ O-O-O ]  [ Q c6 ] , [ h5 ]  17. [ h5 ] - I now try a pawn run down the h column but that is as far as this footman gets. Now Freddy initiates a queen trade.
 [ f3 ]  [ e x f3 ] , [ g x f3 ]  If 11.[ N x f3 ] then 11...[ B c5 ] with the intent to exchange the light-squared bishop for the knight if taken to the task.
 [ b x c3 ] , [ b x c3 ]  Weak king ok but the danger is not so inmediate. And I have some life...
 [ B x f1 ] , [ Q e6 + ]  Much stronger than 18.Qxf1. White can now regain some initiative. Somehow the previous moves of my opponent served as a wake up call for me since I slowly felt my position slip away..
 [ N e5 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ c6 ]  Unfortunately I cannot keep my strong bishop on [ d5 ] which had protected the [ e6 ] pawn and limited the scope of the Black queen on the d-file.
 [ N c3 ]  [ B x a6 ] , [ e4 ]  One of the main lines the other being 7.[ N f3 ] with the idea of following up with [ g3 ] [ B g2 ] and castling. In this line White gets to 'castle by hand'.
 [ N x f2 ] , [ R g1 ]  ?? Blunder despite a long hesitation between 26. [ R g1 ] and 26. [ R h2 ] I choosed the bad solution.
 [ N c3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ e3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B d3 ]  [ N b d7 ]  [ O-O ] , [ e5 ]  What I like about this opening is that it gives you a lot of options. You can attack with the e pawn or the c pawn or you can stay closed and develop the b pawn. Against a weak opponent this opening seems to work well. In this case this was not a weak opponent.
 [ c4 ]  [ B x c4 ]  [ N a3 ] , [ B a6 ]  Why not go all the way back to a6?
 [ a3 ]  [ a4 ]  [ B a2 ] , [ O-O ]  black safly castles
 [ Q e2 ] , [ Q e6 ]  Need to do something with blocking rock. [ f5 ] is only way to do it. Small bonus - pawn on [ a2 ] is under attack.
 [ R f2 ]  [ B x c1 ]  [ Q x c1 ] , [ N f6 ]  After 11. ... [ d6 ] the black king is caught in a mating net starting with 12. [ Q g5 ] . And after 11. ... [ d5 ] the white queen has 12. [ Q g5 ] and 13. [ Q g7 ] snaring a piece without relinquishing the attack. So 11. .. [ N f6 ] looks like the best defense.
 [ B x h3 ] , [ g x h3 ]  ?? And that was 12.Bf3. I was thinking hard about whether to take back or not since the idea is to not trust your opponent. So I wasn't going to think about whether he made a blunder or not. Instead I was basing on whether I saw an immediate threat or not. My thought was that if [ g x h3 ] he might play ...[ Q x h3 ] which I was not worried about. What I was weary of was the possibility of ...[ N h4 ] which I was concerned about. I then asked myself what would become of that. I then thought that this wouldn't cost me either because if ...[ N h4 ] I have [ B g4 ] to stop any threat that's coming. Therefore it wasn't about trust or not but what kind of threat I was dealing with. So I decided to capture here.
 [ Q h3 ] , [ Q x f7 + ]  40. [ Q x f7 ] .......... with 39. ......... Qh3?? he falls for it hook line and sinker. He fatally abandons his f pawn and now if he moves his king to [ h6 ] then Old Matey strikes on g6. If he plays his king to [ h8 ] then the bishop will take on [ g6 ] threatening mate on h7. Black does have one spite check on [ g2 ] or [ h2 ] but the white king can go to [ a3 ] avoiding further checks. Black can only delay mate on [ h7 ] by sacrificing his queen. Black realised this and I was greeted with the white flag and found myself 3.1 rating points better off when I arrived home from work today!!
 [ K h1 ] , [ N x c3 ]  A good chance to gobble up a pawn.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ B c4 ]  I never liked the Italian style...
 [ c4 ] , [ N f6 ]  I almost never face the English but it is far from my known ground. I'd like to transpose to my favourite Q defence but...
 [ R x f7 + ]  [ K x f7 ]  [ K f2 ]  [ K e6 ] , [ K e3 ]  I win the footrace to my back Pawn!
 [ B g5 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ N a4 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ Q d3 ]  [ Q a5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ R x c3 ]  [ b x c3 ]  [ N x b5 ]  [ R a b1 ]  [ N x c3 ]  [ R x b7 ]  [ Q x a2 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ R c8 ]  [ e5 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ Q d7 ]  [ Q c4 ] , [ R e3 ]  Maybe T[ x a7 ] [ K b5 ] T[ b7 ] Kd4T[ b2 ] was too complicated Now black can activate a power full Pawn!!
 [ N x h7 ]  [ N g4 ]  [ Q f8 + ]  [ K d7 ]  [ Q f7 + ]  [ K c6 ] , [ N c3 ]  ! Piling pressure on the indefensible d-pawn. 13...[ d x c4 ] would be ill-advised as it exposes Black to 14. [ Q x c4 + ] [ K d6 ] or 14...[ K d7 ] and White can chase the BK back across the board and trap him in the corner with his Queen and Knights.
 [ Q h4 ]  [ f4 ]  [ O-O-O ]  [ f x e5 ] , [ B g4 ]  But he has a bit of an attack for the material lose
 [ c3 ] , [ c4 ]  I decided to close the game I wasn't interested in fighting over the [ d4 ] spot just yet.
 [ d x e5 ]  [ d x e5 ] , [ N h5 ]  After [ B g3 ] NxB [ e5 ] falls for free. But the e6's weaknes must be exploited. My distractions worked... almost and now I have...
 [ a6 ]  [ c x b5 ]  [ c x b5 ] , [ f4 ]  Now shifting the action to the King-side the f-pawn is a passed pawn so it makes sense to advance it down the board.
 [ O-O ]  [ b3 ]  [ b5 ]  [ B b2 ] , [ R b8 ]  Getting off the long diagonal and preparing ...[ B b7 ] for the inevitable moment when the BQ needs to leave the h1-[ a8 ] diagonal.
 [ e5 ]  [ R b6 x b7 ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ R d5 x d4 ]  [ c6 ]  [ R x b7 ] , [ R x b7 + ]  I had calculated that white would find it tough to promote his newly passed pawn
 [ f3 ]  [ N c5 ]  [ B f5 ] , [ B c8 ]  Finally black is human after all. I assume looking to continue trades. Better was [ K e7 ] connecting the Rs and protecting the doubled pawns. Alternative variation: 23... [ K e7 ] 24. [ K h1 ] [ N e6 ]  [ B h7 ]  [ R g7 ]  [ B e4 ]  [ R b8 ]  [ K h1 ]  [ K e7 ]  [ b4 ]  [ N e6 ]  [ Q e1 ]  [ h3 ]  [ g3 ]  [ B d7 ] , [ B f5 ]  looking at all the attacks i was making and get rid of the [ h3 ] pawn. But better was [ N b3 ] giving the Q room to work and protect b4.
 [ N x f6 ] , [ R a b1 ]  Can't completely ignore the Q side so I seize an open file. All my other pieces will focus on the K side.
 [ Q g3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ Q x e5 + ]  [ Q e7 ]  [ Q x h8 ]  [ Q f8 ]  [ B f4 ] , [ Q b4 + ]  yet another bad move
 [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B b5 ] , [ a6 ]  Although black respond with 3...[ N f6 ] in the Ruy Lopez this move is quite standard. The reason being is that he's attacking my LSB and hoping for an exchange.
 [ N f6 ] , [ h3 ]  My opponent doesn't take advantage of the free tempo to develop a piece.
 [ g3 ]  [ g4 ]  [ N h4 ]  [ N e7 ]  [ d4 ]  [ N g6 ]  [ N x g6 ] , [ h x g6 ]  I get an open h-file which I'll later use for the attack.
 [ B x e6 ] , [ B d3 ]  with that idea over i need to develop some pieces
 [ B e3 ] , [ N b6 ]  trying to deny a white knight control of [ b6 ] but alas white has two knights. 15)..[ B g7 ] is better.
 [ R x g7 ]  [ B g8 ] , [ R f7 # ]  
 [ b4 ] , [ Q b3 ]  I have backward pawns and the black knight can come sweeping around the queen is not too badly placed on the black king's diagonal but the position is fragile.
 [ h5 ]  [ N c2 ]  [ g4 ]  [ N x b4 ]  [ f4 ]  [ a5 ]  [ g5 + ]  [ h x g5 ]  [ f x g5 + ]  [ K x g5 ]  [ K e5 ]  [ K x h5 ]  [ K f6 ]  [ a4 ] , [ K g7 ]  Hoping in a stalemate.
 [ N e7 ] , [ N c4 ]  This bishop in [ b6 ] was dangerous so I wanted to exchange it right now.
 [ Q f6 ] , [ R f1 ]  Defending [ f1 ] so that the queen is free to move elsewhere.
 [ f x g7 ]  [ R x e1 ]  [ R x e1 ] , [ a x b2 ]  24. ...... [ a x b2 ] - that pawn is gonna be a thorn from now on in.
 [ f x g6 ] , [ c x d4 ]  [ Q d3 ] was probably better but the result is the same.
 [ B g2 ] , [ c6 ]  Could have taken on [ g3 ] but first I preferred to limit the bishop and to keep the tension near his king.
 [ N d5 ]  [ d4 ]  [ d6 ] , [ N f3 ]  all book
 [ B b3 ] , [ R b d8 ]  White forces Black to defend passively in order to complete his development.
 [ B d6 ] , [ Q f5 ]  The e-file has been successfully opened.
 [ B c2 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ c4 ] , [ N f4 ]  White is saddled with a very weak c-pawn.
 [ N e7 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ N a3 ]  [ a6 ] , [ N c2 ]  Again this knight now also appears to move towards the kingside so I decide to remove one of white's bishops - this may have been a bad call but my only other options were [ e5 ] which I still did not like and Ne-[ c6 ] which may have been the best choice.
 [ Q c7 ] , [ R f e1 ]  ...and with both of mine connected I contest the open e-file hoping to seize control of it...
 [ N h2 ] , [ e6 ]  Getting rid of the bishop.
 [ R f6 f8 ] , [ R b6 ]  He can't defend his N with the R since he'll lose Rf4. And there is no pin now so the N has to retire and allow me to grab the [ e6 ] pawn.
 [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ] , [ B b4 + ]  ? This doesn't bail black out.
 [ N f2 ] , [ h5 ]  This was the plan. I lose the "good bishop" ok but I have the semiopen column. Anyway this "good" bishop had few places to go since white can play [ f4 ] at any time.
 [ O-O ]  [ B e7 ]  [ f4 ]  [ N b d7 ] , [ N d3 ]  White decides to retreat the Knight. He wants to save it for the attack once Black decides which side to castle on.
 [ Q x f6 ]  [ Q x d5 ]  [ Q x b2 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ R e8 + ] , [ K f1 ]  My castling is now broken and black has a great advantage.
 [ R x a7 ] , [ R d8 ]  finally black get a another piece to work with so he thinks but i stopped that thought in its track on my next move!!
 [ c6 ]  [ h5 ] , [ c7 ]  Here I was too much in a hurry. I was planning to promote while neglecting the defence of my King. Engine says this is a blunder which gives black a checkmate in 7: 34. [ c7 ] [ h4 ] 35. [ Q g8 + ] [ K x g8 ] 36. [ c8 = Q + ] [ K g7 ] 37. [ Q b7 + ] [ R x b7 ] 38. [ N c1 ] [ Q x c1 ] 39. [ c4 ] [ R b1 ] 40. [ g3 ] [ R b2 # ] 34. [ Q c5 ] would still make this a game worth playing.
 [ R x b5 ]  [ a x b5 ]  [ K e6 ]  [ K d2 ]  [ K d5 ]  [ e4 + ]  [ f x e4 ] , [ f5 ]  There he goes !! Black can't stop both my pawns !!
 [ B x e4 ] , [ R x e4 ]  By capturing the bishop white is now down only by 1 pawn instead of a minor piece. White's rook can now threaten the undefended black pawn ahead of it.
 [ e4 ] , [ d6 ]  To stop e5. Fischer actually once played 0-0 here and won easily showing that 5.[ e5 ] is not really a threat but [ d6 ] is still played more often than 0-0
 [ Q g6 ]  [ h3 ]  [ h5 ] , [ f5 ]  If the Bishop on [ g5 ] moves away the pawn will continue to [ h4 ] and win the pinned Bg3.
 [ Q c2 ] , [ c6 ]  Now I have time to dislodge the annoying N.
 [ N c5 ] , [ N d5 ]  At first I wasn't sure why Jack played this. My thinking was that he'd like to exchange my N which I was ready for. Afterall his N is stronger then my [ N f6 ] so I was ready to allow it. But it turns out that he was after my [ e7 ] pawn.
 [ B e3 ] , [ d5 ]  Continuing to press the attack.
 [ B a5 ]  [ b4 ] , [ B b6 ]  without success but at least a bit of the queenside preassure was reduced
 [ f4 ] , [ d5 ]  White camp is attacking on the King side. I answer by 1. ... [ d5 ] right in the center because that is what is important in early game.
 [ Q x d4 ] , [ O-O ]  Black finally gets his king to safety.
 [ Q x e6 + ] , [ f x e6 ]  ...but still maintain a reasonable pawn structure.
 [ N c3 ]  [ B d6 ] , [ N c4 ]  Although I didnt want to retreat the knight off [ e5 ] it would mean a more conventional [ B f4 ] which takes the middlegame into a basic standard route and that as mentioned before was not my intention. It's at this point i determined to attempt to put my opponent into a position on the chessboard that he had never seen. While I'm no master at naming certain openings or plays or even strategies I could see from this point that the game could easily take a turn where simply setting up an attack and/or exchanging pieces was not going to get either player anywhere forcing the situation so that the first to make a mistake would be the one that loses not the one that outsmarts the other.
 [ K h6 ]  [ B c1 + ]  [ g5 ]  [ B x g5 + ] , [ K x g5 ]  blunder: [ R x g5 ] was best. With this move score goes from -4.96 to +17.2 and black loses every hope to win the game. Black is one move away from mate but white can block him first.
 [ Q c5 ] , [ N b4 ]  25. ...... [ N b4 ] - I decided to put the pawn on [ a2 ] under the hammer. If 26. [ a3 ] then [ N d3 ] forks Q and R on c1.
 [ N c3 ] , [ N c6 ]  Inhibits the advance of White's d-pawn to d4.
 [ R f8 ] , [ g5 ]  It's my turn to attack. His tangled pieces on the queenside give me an excellent opportunity I don't have to waste.
 [ f5 ]  [ Q d6 ]  [ f6 ]  [ g x f6 ]  [ R g3 + ] , [ K f8 ]  23. ...... [ K f8 ] - and so the race against time is on. Can Henry make it? Only time will tell.
 [ K h2 ] , [ N e4 ]  And threatens the f-pawn a little desperately.
 [ B b4 ] , [ Q f3 ]  White then gets into a position to attack...
 [ K f2 ]  [ h5 ]  [ K e2 ]  [ g5 ] , [ R c1 ]  34. [ R c1 ] - at least I can now take control of the c column and if John's rook attacks my a pawn [ R c2 ] will cut the mustard.
 [ B e3 ] , [ N e5 ]  Threatens White's bishop at [ c4 ] and blocks White's pawn at e4.
 [ N x b7 + ]  [ K c7 ]  [ N c5 ]  [ B x c5 ]  [ d x c5 ] , [ N g f6 ]  23.
 [ e4 ] , [ B d7 ]  missing [ e5 ] [ b4 ] (we have to prevent Qxc5+) exd4...
 [ h4 ] , [ R f4 ]  pointlessly attacking [ h4 ]  [ R a7 ] , [ g x h7 + ]  k[ h8 ] probably most sensible move here with [ f7 ] well protected
 [ a4 ]  [ b4 ]  [ N b5 ]  [ B a6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ g4 ]  [ b3 ]  [ g x f3 ]  [ Q x f3 ]  [ h4 ] , [ h3 ]  A good move effectively stopping the Black pawn-roller.
 [ N f6 ]  [ Q e2 ] , [ R h5 ]  This kind of theats BxN followed by [ R x e5 ] pinning the bishop... matbe not much but I have to do something.
 [ R x e6 ] , [ N d5 ]  knight centralisation...
 [ Q d2 ] , [ K g7 ]  so that the Q dont move to [ h6 ]  [ f3 ]  [ R a d8 ]  [ R f2 ]  [ R f7 ]  [ R a f1 ]  [ R d f8 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ c6 ]  [ N x e7 ]  [ Q x e7 ] , [ c3 ]  take the biship or go away?
 [ K d5 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ K e6 ] , [ K x e4 ]  
 [ N b c6 ] , [ R d1 ]  The best way to throw black off balance...
 [ R e6 e4 ]  [ N d3 ]  [ N d4 ] , [ a5 ]  Solidifying the black position. I am conscious that my opponent has had a lot of success in rated games. So before pushing forward I decide first to limit any counterplay as much as I could anyways.
 [ Q x c2 ]  [ R x c2 ] , [ R b1 ]  (!) Keeps Black's rook off this file.
 [ R x f7 ]  [ K x f7 ] , [ g3 ]  [ K g1 ] was probably better.
 [ N d4 ]  [ B b3 ]  [ c4 ]  [ B x c4 ] , [ N x c2 + ]  Seems that exchanging a pawn for the rook is the best I could get especially as I felt sure of being able to pin the knight in.
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ b6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ a3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ] , [ Q c2 ]  usually in this variation 7.[ e3 ] is played.
 [ N c5 ] , [ R c4 ]  White is now clearly on the defensive even though he is material up.
 [ a4 ]  [ h x g3 ]  [ h x g3 ] , [ Q c7 ]  Fritz gives white a small advantage here.
 [ N a b1 ]  [ h6 ]  [ B h4 ]  [ b4 ]  [ N a4 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ B g3 ]  [ R c8 ]  [ b3 ]  [ g5 ] , [ B x d6 ]  22 [ B x d6 ] [ Q x d6 ] The DSB exchange.
 [ K c8 ] , [ B b6 ]  and now white achieves his final aim: Zugzwang (forcing the other guy to move in an way that is unfavorable for him). Black has the choice of moving either the bishop or the pawn (since the king now has no legal moves left).
 [ e3 ] , [ e6 ]  Fairly standered openings from both sides.
 [ B x c4 ]  [ g6 ] , [ O-O ]  He castles
 [ N c5 ]  [ Q d6 ]  [ a4 ] , [ b x a4 ]  Insteed of this You can play Ne4! Your N is a worse piece then his N. [ N e4 ] [ N x e4 ] [ d x e4 ] [ Q x e4 ] R7[ h8 ] [ a x b5 ] [ a x b5 ] [ R a8 ] [ K d7 ] seems not so bad. White is better but without his Knight not so good.
 [ B f5 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ h6 ]  [ h6 ] to prevent the [ c1 ] bishop from pinning an already cramped position
 [ Q b3 ]  [ Q e7 ] , [ B d2 ]  To attack a possible BxC3
 [ f5 ] , [ g4 ]  I thought hard about this move because it weakens the kingside safety. Given the material advantage I guess this is a good move but he still has two heavy pieces on the board. Maybe not so smart a move.
 [ N x c4 ] , [ a5 ]  ...[ B a6 ] first. attack the N. if it moves [ B x f1 ] if not then get other side developed.
 [ K x c2 ]  [ Q x a2 + ]  [ K c1 ] , [ Q b2 # ]  
 [ e x d4 ] , [ N d5 ]  ?! (Dubious move) [ N e2 ] is better. This allows black to trade off his knight (which is currently blocking the d8-[ h4 ] diagonal).
 [ B x g4 ] , [ h x g4 + ]  i check again to open up an entire file for my rook for free
 [ K g3 ] , [ Q g4 + ]  Calculating that I'm going to win his Rook after forcing his next move.
 [ Q x c7 ] , [ B d3 ]  Sneaky. The queen on [ b2 ] defends the pawn. I have to admit I was hoping my opponent would overlook that. Regardless this move lets me attack one of the weak isolated black pawns and combined with my queen seems to open some interesting lines of attack into black's home along those long diagonals.
 [ R e8 ] , [ c x d5 ]  I felt good about this move. 14... [ Q x d5 ] is impossible due to 15. Bxf6. 14... [ N x d5 ] could be met with 15 [ e4 ] and possibly later e5.
 [ Q e2 ] , [ f5 ]  with [ f4 ] and Rf6-Rg6. white is standing not so good...
 [ B e6 ] , [ e4 ]  ! This move would have more force with the Knight on [ f3 ] and the Rook on [ e1 ] but it is still an excellent way to break up Black's center.
 [ K x a8 ]  [ K g5 ]  [ R d4 ]  [ K h4 ]  [ R d3 ]  [ K g5 ]  [ R f3 ]  [ K h6 ]  [ R e7 ]  [ K g5 ]  [ K b8 ]  [ K h6 ]  [ K c8 ]  [ K g5 ]  [ K d8 ]  [ K h6 ]  [ K e8 ]  [ K g5 ]  [ K f8 ]  [ K h6 ]  [ K g8 ]  [ K g5 ]  [ K g7 ]  [ K h4 ]  [ R e5 ]  [ g5 ] , [ R e4 # ]  Nice check mate you played a good game!
 [ c x d5 ] , [ B e4 ]  i'm thinking rook but now my bishop isn't protected. another blunder. wtf
 [ Q a4 ] , [ Q e1 ]  Now the Q can move off the second rank so she defends both the [ R d1 ] and the P[ b4 ] at the same time.
 [ R x b4 ] , [ c x b4 ]  Now white has a very dangerous passed pawn supported by his rook. At this point my reasoning was: Should I try to attack the passed pawn? I guess I would have ended up with a very defensive play. So I opted for a kingside attack hoping it would be strong enough before white's b-pawn arrives on the [ b8 ] square.
 [ b6 ]  [ N b5 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ N d6 + ]  [ B x d6 ]  [ R x d6 ]  [ R e2 ]  [ R c1 ]  [ K c7 ]  [ R f6 ] , [ R d8 ]  !!! Black was sure playing better for the endgame. Here he had a chance to double his rooks on his 7th rank A fatal tactic I might add.
 [ R c8 + ]  [ K g7 ] , [ R c2 ]  And this is when Jack gets involved after finishing his training game with Mariann. I am not happy that he made this move. As now not only can I win but as usual by doing this he distracted me as well as Ted. I didn't know what Ted was going to do and then all of a sudden Jack played this for white. That distraction became terrible as you're about to see. It won't change the plan but it causes me to overlook something else which turned into a bad move similar to what you saw in my first training game with Mariann where I coached her as per Ken's comment. That was when I failed to take a piece but took a pawn instead. The intention was to protect the B but I don't need the B when I've got something better. But as noted I missed the opportunity.
 [ Q c2 ] , [ e x d4 ]  25-minutes left on my clock.
 [ R d6 ] , [ B a4 ]  A pointless move. 14.[ R a d1 ] [ B e4 ] 15.[ R x d6 ] [ c x d6 ] was better for white.
 [ e4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ d5 ] , [ N c3 ]  Hoping for the Winawer which always gives an interesting game though I usually lose :-(
 [ a3 ]  [ N a6 ] , [ b4 ]  7. b4. At this point this game has exactly one game in the GK database as a comparison namely akre_pasa v. gasparinov from 2007. So we are in relatively untested waters already.
 [ K h2 ]  [ h4 ]  [ f3 + ]  [ K h5 ]  [ K h3 ]  [ K g6 ] , [ K g4 ]  Black has lost all his activity and with it any hope for counterplay.
 [ Q h2 ] , [ a6 ]  Don't want that knight on b5.
 [ B d6 ]  [ h3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ d3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ h6 ]  [ B h4 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ N b d2 ]  [ N b d7 ] , [ B g3 ]  i liked this move and the idea after.
 [ B e7 ] , [ B x f6 ]  A pawn ahead I am more than willing to liquidate pieces. I expect black to recapture with his bishop then another exchange will follow with 13. Nxf6.
 [ R x c2 ]  [ d x c2 ]  [ Q x c2 ] , [ B h4 + ]  ...[ B b4 + ] as an alternative. not worse just different.
 [ B c2 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ N g5 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ N x e4 ] , [ R a d8 ]  Sensing White's King might try to escape to the Q-side Black hurries to set up inhibiting pins and xrays.
 [ a4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ e3 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ B x c4 ]  White gets back the pawn.
 [ N d4 ]  [ Q d1 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ B g4 ] , [ Q b1 ]  White doesn't have much -- maybe 19. [ R a2 ] -- but this loses a pawn.
 [ R g1 + ]  [ K d2 ]  [ R x g5 ]  [ K e3 ]  [ R g1 ]  [ B d2 ]  [ c3 ] , [ B x c3 ]  Draw accepted by black. Likely RKN vs RK ending is drawn.
 [ d x e4 ]  [ Q f4 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ B e3 ] , [ R d8 + ]  This starts a series of checks to protect my Queen and knight. This ultimately leads to capturing theyank's Queen.
 [ c x b5 ] , [ a x b5 ]  ?? This allows me to win a rook. Better I think was Rxd4. I still would have been winning but not by a whole rook.
 [ N f7 ]  [ h5 ]  [ N d8 ]  [ K x f4 ]  [ N x e6 + ]  [ K g4 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ K x h4 ] , [ N x f5 + ]  White has managed to maintain his slight theoretical plus but the h pawn is a winner!
 [ R x b5 ]  [ R d8 ] , [ f4 ]  36. f4!! - this move prevents [ f4 ] sacrificing my f pawn so that I can get Fou Leblanc onto [ f5 ] protecting my vital g pawn.
 [ h4 ] , [ B b7 ]  Forcing White's hand.
 [ N x h7 ] , [ O-O-O ]  A quick save of the bishop.
 [ d4 ] , [ d5 ]  The strong point of the French -- protect it capture it advance it -- but don't ignore it!
 [ B x f7 + ] , [ K x f7 ]  The reason being is that not only have I lost castling rights but my K is already exposed since the weakest most critical pawn has been removed from the board.
 [ h6 ] , [ N h4 ]  ...and eye up his rook and bishop...
 [ N h4 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ Q g4 ]  14. [ Q g4 ] - uh-oh! Here comes the Wicked Witch of the West and the threat of [ B x h6 ] winning the exchange plus a pawn due to Henry being in Old Matey's shadow.
 [ B x d5 ]  [ B x g5 ] , [ B x a8 ]  I take the Rook and now wind up ahead. Don't forget that I remember the mistake I made with nuntar by forgetting to capture which would've left him in rough shape since he'd be down by a pawn and lose castling rights. Well I did not forget about that and in return left Jack clinging as archduke_piccolo put it in our first game where I also could've taken. But that happens here.
 [ b3 ] , [ g6 ]  Interesting I rather like the bishop here so I will lay a trap that in the worst case leaves a straightforward material exchange. 12. [ N x f6 ] only allows a King capture (before [ g6 ] the pawn was possible) now as 12... [ N x f6 ] 13. [ Q x d8 ] seems losing. 12... [ K x f6 ] 13. [ Q d5 ] leaves some interesting threats. The rook is hanging but if 13... [ R b8 ] 14. [ Q e6 ] [ K g7 ] 15. [ Q x g6 # ] is a straight win. interestingly 13... [ g x f5 ] 14. [ e x f5 ] is also good as the pawn can replace the bishop in the mating attack if 14... [ R b8 ] Alternatively 13. [ N e5 ] is also strong with 13... [ K x e5 ] 14. [ Q d5 ] winning material for white. 12. [ N x f6 ] seems therefore to give white a potentially winning advantage unless there is some trickery I have missed!
 [ Q b4 ] , [ N x d5 ]  sweet and i pick up some tempo
 [ B d5 ] , [ N d3 ]  Why did I play my knight there instead of g6? I could possibly have mated in one move...
 [ f4 ]  [ e x f4 ] , [ R x f4 ]  21. [ R x f4 ] - You would never believe that white could lose from here now would you?
 [ h4 ] , [ g6 ]  ...and I now decide to shorten the chain to contest my 4th rank...
 [ R c1 + ] , [ K x c1 ]  56. [ K x c1 ] (draw by stalemate) - .... that if he takes my rook he can only give me the wrong kind of mate. Ben duly takes my rook and gets High Draw honours. Well played Ben - Joanne.
 [ R x e3 ]  [ R x e3 ]  [ b6 ]  [ B d4 ]  [ R d8 ] , [ B c3 ]  The resulting position is clearly winning for white but not without some difficulty - black maintains a solid defence on all fronts. For white to win would require careful planning as to how to advance the three extra pawns.
 [ N x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ] , [ B h6 ]  Typical method of slaying the dragon.
 [ a4 ]  [ R d8 ] , [ B g2 ]  I'm just trying to find a way to get the queen to back up some.
 [ Q d6 + ]  [ B d7 ] , [ Q x d7 # ]  Using all of my pieces from beginning to end helped out a lot in the process of checkmating.
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ a6 ]  [ B a4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ d3 ]  [ d6 ] , [ c4 ]  White's set-up has been played before and aims to clamp down on any future Black hopes of the freeing advance of his d-pawn to d5.
 [ e3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ c3 ] , [ O-O ]  Here black's left side is well developed while nothing has happened on the right. This is ok because white has chosen to create a pawn phalanx. White dominates the center but largely only with the pawns.
 [ K e2 ]  [ h2 ]  [ K f2 ] , [ h1 = Q ]  53. ..... h1/Q - well you see on [ [ h1 ] ] there is now a big black queen her name is Glenda and she is loaded with 9 units of checkmate! So that is why white waves that white flag! As both Henry and Glenda have shared an intimate dinner for two of garlic prawn vindaloo to celebrate their tearful reunion her breath and tongue will smell and taste particularly unpleasant to the WK so I do not blame Etienne for trying to avoid this. Now how will she force mate from here? Well here is a sample line. 54. [ K e3 ] [ Q d5 ] 55. [ K f4 ] [ K f7 ] 56. [ K e3 ] [ K f6 ] (Henry starts moving in for the kill) 57. [ K f4 ] [ Q e5 + ] (forcing the WK back) 58. [ K f3 ] [ K f5 ] 59. [ K g2 ] [ Q e3 ] (Glenda forces the WK to the first rank or file by moving a knight's move away from the WK) 60. [ K h2 ] [ Q g5 ] (Glenda does not wish to allow the wrong kind of mate so she allows the WK some freedom until her better half moves in ever closer!) 61. [ K h3 ] [ K f4 ] 62. [ K h2 ] [ K f3 ] (now the WK is either forced to [ [ h1 ] ] or opposite Henry which will enable Glenda to give the WK the kiss of death) 63. [ K h3 ] [ Q g3 # ] (here it is Glenda now French kisses the WK euuuuw and he now falls to the ground - aaargh!) Hope you have had a good read and soon I will have another annotation for you. Anyhow I hope you are all enjoying your weekend - bye for now - Joanne
 [ B e3 ]  [ R x b5 ] , [ K g4 ]  (!) It was precisely here that realisation dawned just how bleak Black's prospects had become. The problem is the b-file and the pin on the bishop at [ b2 ] not only against the rook - that can move away - but against the [ b7 ] and [ b8 ] squares. In immobilising White's rook Black had stymied his own pieces even more.
 [ B x a6 ] , [ b x a6 ]  my queen side pawn structure is busted
 [ g x f5 + ]  [ e x f5 ]  [ R d g1 + ]  [ K f7 ] , [ R h7 ]  Forcing Black to pull some pieces back to defend. Notice how strong White looks despite being a full piece behind. As long as White can remain the aggressor he has a chance to regain equilibrium with his activity advantage.
 [ N d4 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ R f8 + ]  [ K e1 ]  [ R f5 ]  [ h4 ]  [ R x e5 ]  [ R f1 ]  [ N g f6 ]  [ B x f6 ] , [ g x f6 ]  This move was done to remove the bishop in exchange for a knight
 [ Q x c6 + ]  [ N x c6 ]  [ c3 ] , [ Q e7 + ]  ..it`s my turn..
 [ B x f6 ] , [ Q a7 + ]  ..check it out ....! Now winning the piece with [ Q e3 ] (forced) and [ R x c3 ]  [ Q e3 ]  [ R x b3 ]  [ Q x a7 ]  [ N x a7 ] , [ B e7 ]  ...i can let black take the rook and have less pieces to deal with...also if [ B x d6 ] [ R d8 ] follows.
 [ b6 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ B b7 ] , [ B x d6 ]  Again a surprise decision undoubling Black's pawns. White has calculated that the Knight he will post at [ e6 ] will prevent Black from coordinating his pieces and the White Rooks will threaten to penetrate on both sides of the board.
 [ N c3 ]  [ R x f1 + ]  [ B x f1 ]  [ R f8 ]  [ B x h3 ] , [ Q c4 ]  introducing new trouble...
 [ B e3 ] , [ Q f6 ]  This move does not look especially bad at first glance but remembering some of the team tips here are a few pointers - usually develop N and B before R or Q - early Q development can leave it vulnerable - Q is blocking [ f6 ] (stops Nf6) - creates weaknesses like [ c7 ] - [ B c8 ] is still blocked in - still 2 moves required to castle
 [ N c3 ] , [ B f4 ]  Focusing my fire on the advanced KP.
 [ Q d2 ]  [ c4 ]  [ b3 ] , [ c3 ]  This move 18. ... [ c3 ] made me nervous. I really feel overextended here but I didn't see any immediate danger so it seemed like a good way to bind the white queenside. Truth is a pawn avalanche against a castled king can be very powerful but I've rarely used it. Playing this move and the other pawn moves that follow and not just seeing it in action but actually working it out and putting it in action myself taught me a lot about this kind of strategy.
 [ K d1 ]  [ B c2 + ]  [ K d2 ] , [ B x b3 + ]  walks into it again?!?
 [ B d4 ] , [ B x f4 ]  Black forgets that I can take the Rook.
 [ d4 ] , [ N f6 ]  Gary kasprov describes dis as the best defence
 [ B f6 ]  [ R a3 ]  [ Q e2 ]  [ R x f3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ B x g7 ]  [ f6 ]  [ B h6 ]  [ R f7 ]  [ B x g6 ]  [ R a f8 ]  [ B x f7 + ]  [ K x f7 ]  [ Q g7 + ]  [ K e8 ]  [ Q x f8 + ]  [ K d7 ]  [ R x f6 ]  [ Q x e4 + ]  [ f3 ]  [ Q x d5 ]  [ R f7 + ]  [ K c6 ]  [ Q c8 + ]  [ K b6 ]  [ Q x b7 + ]  [ Q x b7 ]  [ R x b7 + ]  [ K x b7 ]  [ B d2 ]  [ K b6 ]  [ R d1 ]  [ c4 ]  [ B c3 ]  [ K c5 ]  [ B x a5 ]  [ d5 ]  [ R c1 ]  [ d4 ]  [ b4 + ]  [ K d5 ]  [ b5 ]  [ c3 ]  [ b6 ]  [ K c4 ]  [ b7 ]  [ d3 ]  [ B x c3 ]  [ K b3 ]  [ b8 = Q + ]  [ K c4 ]  [ Q x e5 ]  [ K b3 ]  [ Q b5 + ]  [ K a2 ] , [ Q b2 # ]  
 [ c4 ] , [ a4 + ]  White is losing...
 [ Q x e2 + ]  [ K g5 ] , [ R c8 ]  Still got my pawn but I have a feeling it won't last
 [ N x d2 ]  [ Q x d2 ] , [ R e8 ]  Prepping for a future 16...[ e5 ]  [ R f e1 ]  [ c x d4 ] , [ e x d4 ]  White now has "hanging pawns" on [ c4 ] and d4. These pawns are certainly not bad but White should not trade down because their weakness will be exposed
 [ a5 ]  [ a3 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ B x d4 ]  [ c3 ]  [ B b6 ] , [ N d2 ]  White completes his development. The position is basically equal.
 [ Q x d6 ] , [ B x d6 ]  it will not be easy to move the B off [ d6 ]  [ O-O ] , [ h5 ]  now two pawns not protected by pawns potential targets. if the pawn advance continues perhaps white will have to address the threat. in the meantime will work fast to avoid any such issues.
 [ B b3 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ O-O ] , [ h3 ]  Mostly waiting for black to commit while restricting black's potential for king side expansion
 [ K x e5 ]  [ R e1 + ] , [ K d4 ]  Black still has little choice in the matter is forced to keep running around with his King.
 [ B x d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ Q c4 ] , [ B d6 + ]  With the white Bishop gone the discovered check is now possible. It is also a double attack since the bishop threatens to smash the white horse.
 [ B e3 ] , [ B e8 ]  sending bishop to help in case of attack.
 [ R h1 ]  [ Q g4 ] , [ Q h6 ]  ough: on various levels of pain...
 [ c x d4 ] , [ Q x d4 ]  Black cannot play [ B g7 ] lazily without thought or else he loses both bishop and rook. With the knight immediately threatened black cannot trap the queen in the corner depriving white of the queen for the immediate future. The problem is that the queen provides a tasty target once the forced [ N f6 ] is played.
 [ R f2 + ]  [ K d1 ] , [ R x g2 ]  Up by 5 but it could have been 7 with [ R f1 ] followed by Rxc1. But that removes the whole rook on 2nd effect.
 [ c x b4 + ]  [ a x b4 ]  [ a x b4 + ]  [ Q x b4 ]  [ B g6 ]  [ Q x b5 ]  [ Q e5 + ] , [ K b3 ]  My king just got rid of the available checks.....
 [ K f6 ] , [ K d2 ]  Heading to the queenside.
 [ R x d7 ]  [ B x d7 ] , [ R e1 ]  If 21.[ R d1 ] [ Q c6 ] 22.[ B f4 ] [ B f5 ] 23.[ B d3 ] Qxf3. Now [ e7 ] is under attack but Black should create threats instead of wasting time defending it.
 [ b4 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ N x c7 ]  [ R c8 ]  [ Q d5 + ]  [ K e7 ] , [ B g5 + ]  White uses every single one of his well-developed pieces. From having a blocked cumbersome position Black now has a vulnerable position that has been cracked open like an egg. This neat skewer winning queen for bishop completely seals the game for White.
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ d4 ]  The Scotch.
 [ N d3 + ]  [ N x d3 ]  [ R x d3 ] , [ N e3 ]  disrupting the rooks' actions...
 [ B x e1 ] , [ B h3 ]  I capture the knight and black's LB annoyingly returns to his guarding duties!
 [ d4 ] , [ Q f4 ]  7. Qd2!? [ N x e5 ] 8. [ B b5 ] [ N c6 ] 9. [ N e2 ] and my extra pawn is vulnerable.
 [ c5 ]  [ e3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ Q e1 ]  [ b6 ]  [ b3 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ B b2 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ N b5 ]  [ Q b8 ]  [ a3 ]  [ a6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ d5 ]  Now that's hyper-modern chess. It took 12 moves for one of us to thrust a pawn into the center of the board. 19th Century chessmasters are rolling in their graves over what has become of their game.
 [ N b3 ]  [ B b6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ N e7 ]  An odd looking move but perfectly logical. It prepares his advance of the d pawn.
 [ a x b5 ]  [ a x b5 ] , [ B d2 ]  probably the toughest defense...
 [ B f5 ] , [ O-O ]  [ b f5 ] the previous move was one of the two mistakes. Funnily enough the GK machine does want me to go [ B g5 ] here and then castle queenside. The point is that after castling the f pawn doesn't win the bishop because the e pawn is no longer pinned. After that and exchanging queens on [ d4 ] my king is quite safe and black's king ends up very exposed. It'd go: 7. [ B g5 ] [ f6 ] 8. O-O-O [ Q b4 ] 9. [ R h [ e1 ] ] Qx[ d4 ] 10. Nx[ d4 ] [ K f7 ] to avoid a discovered check I believe. SF on the other hand recommends castling first. So at first glance this probably seems like a very easy decision but I spent some time on this. I wanted two things in this position and I wasn't sure which to do first: either to develop the dark squared bishop and bring the a rook into the game or to get the king to safety and unpin the pawn. I ended up going with castling because it both allowed me to get a rook to [ e1 ] faster (threatening to pin the bishop the queen or both) and because it allowed me to not commit to moving the bishop just yet.
 [ Q c7 ]  [ d3 ] , [ b5 ]  Black would like to play [ f3 ] and [ e4 ] but does not have the time.
 [ R e1 ]  [ B h4 ] , [ Q f3 ]  white is powerful at this point with many guns directing blacks king. and blacks queen is far away to help his queen.
 [ R x d1 ] , [ g x f3 ]  Now Black has a pawn within Queening distance - *if* he can survive White's attack!
 [ R h b8 ] , [ a5 ]  and here Black timed out: such a shame...
 [ K f7 ]  [ Q b7 + ]  [ B e7 ]  [ e4 ]  [ f x e4 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ h6 ]  [ B x e7 ]  [ N x e7 ]  [ O-O-O ]  [ Q a5 ]  [ f3 ]  [ R a b8 ]  [ Q d7 ]  [ R h d8 ] , [ Q a4 ]  that's a tough one. I would normally always trade the wenches just because they can be so troublesome but when a little down..
 [ R x d7 ] , [ K x d7 ]  If 17... Nxd7; then 18.[ B x g8 ] - wins the R
 [ c x b4 ] , [ d4 ]  I think a better continuation here might have been a3. My attempts at [ B b2 ] have also not been very successful.
 [ K x h6 ]  [ K g3 ]  [ K g5 ] , [ K x g2 ]  
 [ K f4 ] , [ K b3 ]  Preparing to advance my apawn.
 [ d5 ] , [ c4 ]  Queens Gambit. One of my common openings.
 [ R x c1 + ]  [ K x c1 ]  [ B x c4 ]  [ B x c4 ] , [ R x b2 ]  [%clk 0:03:40] I think this is stronger than Bxb2+. This also invites white to a last trick!
 [ R e c8 ]  [ R d7 ]  [ K f8 ]  [ N d6 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ N x c8 ]  [ N x d7 ] , [ N x a7 ]  
 [ K e2 ]  [ K b6 ]  [ K d2 ]  [ K c5 ] , [ K c3 ]  The cat and mouse chase ends here as white has blocked the pawn but cannot capture it as it is supported by Black's king. Black applying correct principle of supporting pass pawn with king. King at end game is a great warrior and it is king's responsibility to escort the pass pawn to Queening square.
 [ Q x f7 ] , [ e5 ]  sneaky pawn advance
 [ K h3 ]  [ Q c3 + ] , [ K g2 ]  Note that 34. [ K h4 ] leads to 34...[ Q e1 ] and 35...[ Q h1 ] forcing a queen exchange in 1-3 moves (depending on the variation). After which I can take the [ h6 ] pawn giving me a pawn advantage 5-3 in the endgame (after Rxb7) and thus potencial winning chances.
 [ b5 ] , [ B x b5 ]  I really should know better.
 [ B e3 ] , [ c4 ]  ? Black's game is in keeping the tension "on" in order to control the game with a constant threat on the center pressure on the c column and intelligent use of Nb4... and I am throwing it all out with this move! In addition I have no support against a future [ b3 ] because of my previous tempo loss allowing a5. And now I would struggle to develop. A very bad move for sure!
 [ e5 ] , [ N f3 ]  Here I saw this layout and believed myself to be heading towards a Scotch opening. Though I like the Scotch personally when I'm playing as White as Black I do not as I believe it can give White an advantage having their Queen on D5. So I chose to counter and take my Queen onto D5 instead by offering White the D file pawn.
 [ O-O ] , [ N x c3 ]  7...[ N x f4 ] 8.[ d4 ] with plenty of activity for the pawn.
 [ h3 ] , [ B h5 ]  13....Bh5. Better than the other options.
 [ B x d8 ]  [ N x c3 ] , [ b x c3 ]  The Spanish player Diego Piay Augusto preferred 12.[ Q h5 + ] but after 12...[ K x d8 ] 13.[ Q g5 + ] [ K c8 ] 14.[ Q x g7 ] [ N e4 + ] 15.[ K e2 ] [ R f8 ] Black had more than enough for the queen and went on to win. However the text move is inferior.
 [ R x a7 ]  [ B x a7 ] , [ R b7 ]  The b pawn still has to be defended and that shows the strength of the white´s 23th move (Qe2). Now other moves for black would be bad. E.g. 31.....Rd8? 32 [ B b6 ] or 31..... Rc8? 32 Rd5.
 [ N g3 ] , [ Q x c4 ]  White missed the second threat (really the first threat I guess since the lone queen wasn't much threat to white's castled position yet). I have to put a ? on 11. Ng3?. Adding to the pile.
 [ R x b4 ]  [ a x b4 ] , [ K b3 ]  I advance my king. My only advantage in this endgame is my king is active while his hides in the corner.
 [ N f6 ]  [ d3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ a3 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ] , [ N d4 ]  Nd4? I thought about a series of exchanges 10. [ N x f3 ] [ B x e2 ] but did not see 11. Nxe2...
 [ N x d4 ]  [ c x d4 ] , [ K g1 ]  Both players have an isolated pawn the black one is even a passed pawn however it will be hard to hold onto it since blacks King has a longer route to go. And this is the part in which I really enjoy white's play. There is only one minor piece left and white instantly moves his King towards the center.
 [ e3 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ g4 ]  [ b6 ]  [ R f1 ]  [ Q e7 ] , [ K g1 ]  I castle "manually."
 [ N e4 ]  [ R a6 ] , [ d5 ]  This Pawn will be my key.
 [ e x f4 ]  [ R d4 ]  [ g5 ] , [ K g2 ]  Trying to get closer toward the center in order to prevent the king going to [ e6 ] and attacking the [ d4 ] rook.
 [ g6 ] , [ Q h6 ]  This sets and advantage: [ g6 ] is pinned to the black queen. Incredibly this makes me win the game.
 [ N x c4 ]  [ c5 ] , [ N c e5 ]  white threats to win a free pawn after11. [ N x d7 ] -[ B x d7 ] .12.dxc or 11...[ N x d7 ] .12.Bxh7+.
 [ g3 ] , [ Q x c4 ]  Black is up a pawn and he has ruined white's castle. Of note is the fact that we have opposite colored bishops and eventually if white is allowed to exchange everything else off the board black cannot force a win with K B P vs. K B when the bishops are on opposite colors.
 [ h3 ]  [ K b6 ]  [ K d7 ]  [ a7 ]  [ K e7 ]  [ a8 = Q ]  [ K f6 ]  [ Q b8 ]  [ K f5 ]  [ Q e5 + ]  [ K g4 ]  [ B h2 ]  [ K h4 ]  [ Q g3 + ]  [ K h5 ]  [ Q x h3 + ]  [ K g5 ]  [ Q x e6 ]  [ K h4 ]  [ B e5 ]  [ K g5 ]  [ Q f7 ]  [ K h6 ] , [ B f4 # ]  
 [ K e2 ] , [ N d4 + ]  Another check allowing my queen to get to safety and protect c5.
 [ R a f1 ]  [ Q e3 + ]  [ K c2 ] , [ N d4 + ]  At this point I'd like to say that White is focusing too much on offense and not enough on defense.
 [ N c7 ] , [ N e5 ]  The same goes for the White knight. Let's examine the endgame a second time. Material is even but White has one almost-passed pawn which will be sooner supported by the second. Black's knight cannot stop both pawns and his king is too far away. Black tries to create some desperate counterplay to save the game.
 [ Q f6 ] , [ B b5 ]  forcing it
 [ g3 ]  [ R x d4 ]  [ Q b3 ] , [ R x d3 + ]  Here black missed the best move. 17.... [ Q b3 ] (QxQ) = BxQ and RxB with more material then the way it was played and game too black.
 [ Q x f3 ] , [ Q x f3 ]  As now I'd like to avoid liquidation with his material advantage. But there are no choices as mate was threatened. The only other option was 20.[ Q d2 ] but then black would've exchanged anyway.
 [ d3 ]  [ B g6 ]  [ c3 ] , [ N c6 ]  white has only developed the rook and his pawns are a mess. black is a piece up with two pieces developed and no pawn weeknesses. Remember that each pawn move creates weak squares behind it.
 [ d3 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ a3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ h3 ] , [ O-O ]  I'm not sure why white is pushing his rook pawns. 6. ... [ B g5 ] might have been fun but the knight is well protected. He could simply play 7. [ c3 ] to banish my knight from [ d4 ] then play [ h3 ] to drive off my bishop. Adn the previous 5. [ a3 ] eludes me.
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ] , [ c6 ]  3. ...... [ [ c6 ] ] - he then decided to play a QGD Slav Defense - [ [ c6 ] ] characterises this move.
 [ Q f6 ] , [ R d7 ]  throws the game away. Alternative variation: 37. [ Q d7 ] [ R e6 ]  [ R d2 ]  [ a4 ]  [ e4 ]  [ R b3 + ]  [ K c2 ]  [ g6 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ B f5 + ]  [ K c1 ] , [ a3 ]  
 [ Q h8 + ]  [ K f7 ] , [ f4 ]  White has huge control over the center and kingside he has pinned black's pieces down and is almost equal in material. The rest of the game is a bit slower than the opening white maneuvers to create a pawn break through and black strives for counterplay while attempting to stop white's threats. Personally I'm a tactical player who loves to attack. Most of my attacks come from a spatial advantage (especially when white). Thus for me this is a dream position white has all the space he could ask for an is well on the way to a win with his attack.
 [ b x c4 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ N b2 ] , [ Q b6 ]  The key idea of Black's ...Rc8. He will finally activate the queen via b6-[ d4 ] (which comes with tempo) and highlight the weak dark squares in White's camp. This continuation involves the sacrifice of at least one pawn but Black's rooks have easy activation and of course White's queen knight are stuck offside on h7. The computer still likes White at this point but the game is getting very sharp as it is difficult for White to defend against Black's ideas without slipping into passivity or dropping a piece - he has very little coordination.
 [ Q d3 + ]  [ K a5 ]  [ Q d8 + ]  [ K b5 ]  [ Q b8 + ]  [ K c5 ] , [ Q a7 + ]  A pity. It would have been a good lesson for black to go on until the win. Overall well played thoug.
 [ R f2 ] , [ R g3 ]  whites game is slowly becoming more difficult to play. the rook is confined to the 2nd rank and his bishop is having difficulty finding usefull tasks.
 [ Q a5 ]  [ B g2 ]  [ Q x b5 + ]  [ K c7 ]  [ c x d6 + ]  [ N x d6 ]  [ Q c5 + ]  [ B c6 ]  [ Q x d6 + ]  [ K b7 ]  [ Q b4 + ]  [ K c7 ]  [ Q f4 + ] , [ K b7 ]  Thanks for the game and Im very happy for comments!
 [ R x g6 ]  [ c5 ] , [ R a6 ]  47. [ R a6 ] - threatening mate on the move - I can now only avoid it by resorting to checks and then somehow getting my rook onto the back rank.
 [ a6 ]  [ B b2 ]  [ N g f6 ]  [ B c4 ] , [ B d6 ]  One from castling. Black has to be careful about sacs in e6.
 [ R d3 ] , [ R e2 ]  He broke through and now he is going for the pieces least important to me but defenseless agains his piecess. My pawns.
 [ B x e5 ] , [ R d8 d2 + ]  26. ....... Rd8[ d2 + ] - an attempt at counterplay but to no avail.
 [ B d6 ] , [ N e5 ]  offers exchage white never had intention of swaping both knight & bishops
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ N f6 ]  This is a Veresov wich is going to have some nice pawn formation.
 [ h4 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ h5 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ B x e5 ]  [ g5 ]  [ h x g6 ]  [ e ]  [ p ]  [ + ]  [ f x g6 ]  [ R b7 + ]  [ K g8 ]  [ Q x g6 + ]  [ K f8 ] , [ Q g7 # ]  
 [ N c6 ]  [ h3 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ B x e6 ]  [ f x e6 ] , [ N g5 ]  7. [ N g5 ] - perhaps [ N c3 ] or [ B e3 ] may be better here.
 [ R x g8 ] , [ R x f6 ]  Rxf6?! was not what I intended nor was it best. I forgot that Black could simply take the rook.
 [ c5 ]  [ Q d5 ] , [ N c6 ]  Now Black is in serious trouble.
 [ Q x d7 ] , [ B f5 ]  More queen chasing like earlier in the game but this time it is much deadlier.
 [ K h7 ]  [ R x f7 + ] , [ R g7 ]  Forced.
 [ R c8 ] , [ B d3 ]  Limiting black's approaches for his rook on the open c-file and putting pressure on black's knight at e4.
 [ O-O ]  [ B x c3 ] , [ b x c3 ]  Recapturing. Now I have the open b and d files to work with.
 [ B g3 ]  [ h5 ] , [ h4 ]  And so ends black's "initiative."
 [ K h5 ] , [ R d1 ]  I tried to put my Rook on g5:)
 [ N a2 ] , [ B d7 ]  Both sides are now completely developed but Black is a pawn to the good.
 [ N x c5 ] , [ d x c5 ]  Now the mistake is apparent although difficult to see... If white now continues 9. [ B x f7 ] Kxf7? 10. [ N x e5 ] [ K f8 ] 11. [ N x g4 ] then white emerges 2 pawns ahead and black has a very exposed king
 [ Q f3 ] , [ Q e7 ]  Bringing his Q in front of the R which is also a good idea.
 [ Q e7 ]  [ g3 ] , [ Q b4 + ]  ? Let's waste time shall we?
 [ K x d6 ]  [ R x c2 ]  [ Q e1 + ]  [ K g2 ] , [ K e5 ]  Now he offered me a draw which I gladly accepted. I wonder though if maybe his king could get in? What do you think? If you have any analysis (stick your silicon beasts on it) feel free to post it in the comments section and maybe we could come to a good conclusion as to whether it is really a draw. Thanks for looking I hope you enjoyed the game.
 [ Q e7 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ B g7 ]  Okay now he is defending the pawn again as well as the [ Q e7 ] move also adds help to the weak [ e6 ] pawn and starts to make room for him to take his boy queenside
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ N c6 ]  Opening with Sicilian Najdorf
 [ Q h4 ]  [ B e7 ] , [ B g5 ]  This is absolutely forced.
 [ K d5 ]  [ R f5 + ]  [ K e4 ]  [ R f4 + ]  [ K e3 ]  [ K g4 ] , [ a5 ]  The opponent was severally trying to push the pawn
 [ h5 ]  [ a4 ]  [ g4 ]  [ a5 ]  [ b x a5 ] , [ b x a5 ]  If he can take my doubled pawn then he maybe able to neutralize my passed rook pawn. However the queening square is the wrong colour for his bishop
 [ R e e7 ] , [ R c a8 ]  Allows white a forced mate in 3. The only move was [ R g8 ]  [ R e x g7 + ]  [ K h8 ]  [ R g h7 + ]  [ K g8 ] , [ R d g7 # ]  
 [ K g1 ]  [ Q x h2 + ]  [ K x h2 ] , [ R x f6 ]  Here white resigned. Even though I wanted to test some ideas but didn't have the chance I enjoyed the game a lot. I want to give the due credits to Rathi - my opponent - for making the game so interesting.
 [ B e7 ]  [ N f5 ]  [ N x f5 ]  [ B x f5 ]  [ g6 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ h5 ]  [ B f3 ]  [ B d7 ] , [ K e2 ]  OMG. Júpiter is running wild.
 [ e5 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ a6 ]  [ R a e1 ]  [ Q f6 ] , [ f3 ]  Around about here I remember trying to calcualte the pros and cons of each kingside pawn move. No advance to the 4th rank seemed to help me so I settled for this more flexible option.
 [ N x c6 ]  [ d x c6 ] , [ e5 ]  Standard and strong.
 [ K h4 ] , [ Q x f6 # ]  Checkmate! Half of Black's pieces never saw action. One of my better efforts in an otherwise mediocre performance in the tourney overall (about the middle of the bottom half as I recall).
 [ N c3 ] , [ b6 ]  P[ d5 ] is the most common response for black. Not criticizing just saying.
 [ e5 ] , [ N f d7 ]  Black lures white's central pawns forward in the hope of undermining them later by playing [ c5 ] [ N c6 ] and [ Q b6 ] or f6. White must be careful not to over exert himself or neglect his development too much.
 [ N f6 ] , [ B x d4 ]  Snap! The tension was too much to bear.
 [ B g5 ] , [ R b7 ]  another useless move from this Bishop while Black is taking over the b-file...
 [ Q x d4 ]  [ Q x d4 ]  [ R x d4 ] , [ c x d5 ]  IvanHoe v73: Análisis reporta errores con cambio de puntuación desde: -5.57 / -4.19 Alternative variation: 29...[ c5 ] 30.[ R d3 ] [ N [ h3 ] ] 31.[ N e1 ] [ N h f2 + ] 32.[ K g2 ] [ N x d3 ] 33.[ N x d3 ] [ a4 ] 34.[ N c1 ] [ f5 ] 35.[ h3 ] [ K f7 ] 36.[ g4 ] [ K f6 ] 37.[ h4 ] [ N d6 ] 38.gx[ f5 ] Nx[ f5 ] 39.[ h5 ] [ a x b3 ] 40.[ a x b3 ]  [ e4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f d7 ]  [ d4 ] , [ c5 ]  I came across this website "Sparkchess" [www.sparkchess.com] which allows a game at four different levels without having to download anything. It's good fun: The levels are 'Beginner'; 'Casual'; 'Advanced' and 'Guru' - although it warns that the higher level takes some time to make its moves. Players can judge its standard from the following game at the second highest level.
 [ N f6 ] , [ d4 ]  The most aggresive continuation. White is playing to maintain the tempo he has by virtue of having the first move of the game. Control of the center is the aim!
 [ O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ N c6 ] , [ B e3 ]  not mocking around...
 [ Q d3 ]  [ B x e4 ]  [ Q e2 ]  [ R f d8 ]  [ B h4 ]  [ B c6 ]  [ N e3 ]  [ b6 ] , [ R f d1 ]  Wrong Rook technically but it matters not. ...And just as an aside how in the world can 2 chessplayers get 18 moves into a Sicilian (closed or not) and still have 15 of the original 16 pawns on the board?? Weird.
 [ R x a2 ]  [ R x a2 ]  [ N x b4 ] , [ R x e2 ]  THIS is the pawn I win in the long term. True is that white has [ R a1 ] but white cannot play [ d5 ] since I can take at ease my e pawn is defended by the rook. Probably white could have tried something but I cannot see the danger. [ R a1 ] [ K d7 ] and my king comes on time to defend b7. Not Rb2: if [ R a1 ] [ R b2 ] [ R a7 ] [ B c8 ] [ N x c6 ] ([ b7 ] would be pinned).
 [ e x f5 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ B e7 ] , [ B f4 ]  Developing without a serious plan of attack yet.
 [ Q x e2 ] , [ B x d4 ]  third ! i'm know +2 and it is not finished ...
 [ d4 ] , [ B b6 ]  keeps the pressure on and pins the pawn.
 [ c5 ] , [ e4 ]  !? Such as this one which is an invitation for black to enter into an Albin Counter-Gambit...reversed! After 3. ...de 4. [ d5 ] white is a tempo up compared to an analogous black position in this opening. Black often plays his bishop either to ...[ f5 ] or ...[ g4 ] in the Albin proper so [ B f4 ] is thematically in-character for such an opening. I play the Albin myself so I was looking forward to the enterprising play that would arise in a reversed approach especially since the staid positions in the London System are usually not to my taste.
 [ B x f6 + ] , [ K x f6 ]  It does bring the King out though. Who's best placed here? Hard to say.
 [ c x d5 ] , [ R a c1 ]  Now line up rook on same column as black's king and queen.
 [ B a4 ] , [ N f6 ]  Jack also told Carl that he could hit my B again but he wanted to Carl to continue developing.
 [ N x g5 ] , [ Q d2 ]  I chose this candidate to chase away her knight so this was ! in my opinion.
 [ R h1 + ] , [ K f2 ]  Forced because the only other option 23. [ K e2 ] would be met with ... Qg2#.
 [ f4 ] , [ N f3 ]  ? [ N g6 ] was much stronger.
 [ B c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ Q b6 ]  [ e3 ]  [ Q c6 ]  [ N h4 ]  [ b6 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ B b4 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ N e4 ]  Again Black side is trying to attack.
 [ c x d5 ] , [ Q c6 + ]  i have to be carefull i'm about to be mate ! ...
 [ g6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ e4 ]  [ b6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ B e3 ] , [ N h6 ]  Interesting move from black keeping the bishop diagonal open.
 [ Q e4 ] , [ h x g3 + ]  
 [ Q d5 + ]  [ Q x d5 + ]  [ c x d5 + ]  [ K x d5 ] , [ K d2 ]  Now a sensible player would have resigned. Not he.
 [ K c3 ]  [ g5 ] , [ B e4 ]  The end ... Next comes 32. [ b7 ] and Black will loose. What a great Bishop pair!
 [ N b d7 ] , [ h3 ]  I plan a pawn storm anyway so this is just tempo gained.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ d3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ f6 ]  [ B h4 ]  [ g5 ]  [ B g3 ]  [ g4 ]  [ N h4 ]  [ N g e7 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ h5 ]  [ O-O ]  [ d5 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ Q a4 + ]  [ B d7 ]  [ Q d1 ]  [ f5 ]  [ e x f5 ]  [ N e x f5 ] , [ N c3 ]  This is not a counter threat. Black has a knight and queen focused on [ N h4 ] protected only by a bishop (Bg3). White would have been better off trading.
 [ R a d8 ]  [ g4 ]  [ K g5 ] , [ K f2 ]  I intend to win the Black KRP with my King.
 [ K a6 ]  [ R d d6 ]  [ R b8 ] , [ R f h6 ]  Right but I have my revenge too.
 [ B x d4 ] , [ N d2 ]  A second fork and this time with a two point gain on offer.
 [ O-O ] , [ f6 ]  I need to break his hold on the center.
 [ O-O ] , [ e5 ]  Want to clear some of the center as we each have some control over it. Also allows my [ c3 ] knight to move to e4.
 [ Q x e5 ] , [ Q x e5 ]  Blunder that let me win the game.
 [ d5 ] , [ c4 ]  and continue with the Queen's Gambit
 [ N c3 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ a3 ] , [ O-O ]  11. ............... 0-0 - now my development is complete both players are entering the middle game.
 [ d6 ] , [ N d5 ]  Darn! A mistake! If my knight on [ f6 ] is taken no doubt I will have doubled pawns and an exposed g-file. My defences have weakened.
 [ Q h4 + ]  [ K g7 ]  [ R e7 + ]  [ K f8 ] , [ Q x f6 # ]  bad game for black. this is my first time trying this so know it's bad.
 [ Q b2 ] , [ R c3 ]  White defends relentlessly against Black's attack.
 [ h3 ]  [ B x f3 ]  [ B x f3 ] , [ Q d7 ]  Sting's development is complete. He has a slight advantage in space and time.
 [ R e1 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ N e3 ] , [ B x e4 ]  I suppose white could trap his knight over on [ a3 ] in which case he would be for all intents and purposes a piece down. Instead white played the better knight move but it cost him a pawn.
 [ f x e6 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ d x e5 ] , [ Q x e5 ]  I'll will win a pawn but black can exchange queens if he wants to with [ Q c5 + ]  [ B x d6 ] , [ B f4 ]  offering the exchange to avoid [ B e5 ] aimed against [ b2 ] and the rook [ a1 ]  [ R d7 ] , [ R a f1 ]  now if black plays [ R x f7 ] I'll play [ R x f7 ] also to keep a rook on the 7th rank
 [ e x d5 ] , [ Q x d5 ]  With the Queen now out on her lonesome this highlights the issues with bringing the Queen out too early. It now enables white to develop while threatening the Queen allowing white to obtain a good lead in development.
 [ R b5 ] , [ B x f8 ]  Now he has to choose whether to take the Knight or the Bishop.
 [ B x e2 ]  [ Q x e2 ] , [ d5 ]  Another critical series of moves that define the game. Any variation would have led to a different result but I get lucky and white takes the [ d5 ] pawn.
 [ e4 ] , [ d5 ]  Elephant Gambit? [ f3 ] is a move i hate because capturing the e pawn and recapturing creats a hole in kingside
 [ N g f6 ]  [ O-O-O ] , [ B e7 ]  If black is setting up to castle opposite and wasn't a master I'd think it was a bad idea. White has 6 pieces to deploy in that direction. On the other hand that same number of black pieces could be bearing down on white soon enough.
 [ g4 ] , [ N e3 ]  If 15. [ N x d4 ] [ N x d4 ] 16. [ Q x d4 ] [ N x c2 + ] queen is lost (the same if 16. Qxe3)
 [ Q e1 + ] , [ K h5 ]  and Capablanca's resignation in my opinion symbolized the end of an heroic era of chess titans dominating the field with their natural genius. Since this historic moment the professional touch has played a more and more important role as an integral part of chess the path to ultimate success.
 [ e x f4 ] , [ O-O ]  Continuing my development.
 [ h x g5 ]  [ N x g5 ] , [ R x g5 + ]  White aims to simplify the game but this move clears the board of many pieces and the two Black's passed pawns increase their value. Alternative variation: 36.[ N g4 ] [ a2 ] 37.[ N x e5 ] [ a1 = Q ] 38.[ R x a1 ] [ R x a1 + ] 39.[ B x a1 ] +/- [And Black's position look really bad with his King completely exposed.]
 [ Q f3 + ]  [ K g1 ] , [ B e3 + ]  41...[ B g3 ] would have lead to a forced mate but this is good enough.
 [ B c6 ]  [ R e5 + ]  [ K c4 ]  [ Q x c6 + ]  [ K d3 ]  [ Q d5 + ]  [ K c2 ] , [ R e2 # ]  
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ O-O ] , [ g6 ]  A slow system for White.
 [ Q x d4 ] , [ c x d4 ]  Black has good chances here but don't count out white yet. White could play [ B b3 ] and try his hand at that kind of play while calmly chasing down the pawn on d4.
 [ R x f6 ] , [ Q x h7 + ]  Continuing with the attack that rides on the edge of the knife. White gains another pawn and is down 4 points.
 [ e x d5 ] , [ N f3 ]  ?! -0.50/31 (7. [ e3 ] -0.24/27 7... [ N f6 ] 8. [ N f3 ] [ B d6 ] 9. [ N b5 ] [ B e7 ] 10. [ B d3 ] O-O 11. O-O [ B d7 ] 12. [ Q b3 ] [ R c8 ] 13. [ B d2 ] [ N e4 ] 14. [ R f d1 ] [ B f5 ] 15. [ R a c1 ] [ a6 ] 16. [ B x e4 ] [ B x e4 ] 17. [ N b d4 ] [ Q c7 ] 18. [ Q a4 ] [ Q d6 ] 19. [ N x c6 ] [ R x c6 ] 20. [ R x c6 ] )
 [ B g4 ]  [ Q d3 ]  [ N g6 ] , [ B e3 ]  Now this is sinister. Do you know why?
 [ B x f5 ]  [ e x f5 ] , [ h4 ]  I've got to worry about him playing a3.
 [ Q d7 ] , [ Q e2 ]  Holds [ e4 ] and [ c4 ] and if Black trades a pawn on either square opens the d-file to the advantage of White's heavy pieces not Black's.
 [ Q h4 ] , [ K g8 ]  ! White threatened [ B g7 + ] [ K g8 ] 26. Qxh7#. Now [ B g7 ] can be met with ...[ h5 ] and White's attack has stalled. Still White's pieces seem extremely threatening and the situation is optically very grim for Black. For one thing [ N x h7 ] looks very strong. The Black position contains hidden resources which are easy to underestimate however and the game is far from over. My opponent thinking I was on the ropes probably expected a resignation soon after his next move…
 [ B d3 ]  [ N b c6 ]  [ Q h5 ] , [ N g6 ]  9. ...... [ N g6 ] - this move blocks the line of Afro's lsb which is attacking [ h7 ] and so is the Witch. This knight move therefore prevents Henry from copping Old Matey.
 [ O-O ] , [ N e6 ]  Knights are the best blockaders and my opponent no doubt knows this so he opposes my active Knight with his blockading one.
 [ g x f6 ] , [ N x f7 ]  With Black's K-side Pawns shattered Najdorf willingly sacrifices the Knight to expose Black's King.
 [ Q g6 ]  [ h5 ] , [ Q f5 ]  23....[ Q f6 ] is bad due to 24. [ N e5 ] threatening 25. [ B e4 ] and 26. [ N g4 ] finally trapping the Queen. In this line 24....Nxe5? provokes 25. de attacking Queen and Bishop. This becomes a real shooting gallery for W against B.
 [ K d6 ] , [ d4 ]  16. [ d4 ] - first I must screen out Bob's dsb on [ g7 ] as Fou Lenoir is no longer protecting the pawn on b2.
 [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ a6 ]  The Najdorf Sicilian was first played in 1937 Warsaw in Steiner-Najdorf and resulted in a victory for Black. The variation employed in that particular game is now referred to as the Schveningen-Najdorf as it features an early ...e6. The variation with ...[ e5 ] was first played in 1942 by Karel Opocensky. Najdorf would not take up the line with any regularity until 1955.
 [ B a3 + ]  [ c5 ] , [ B x c5 + ]  rather lose bishop than rook
 [ b x c6 ] , [ e5 ]  Making the center static. Not sure if this really does much for either side however it does allow white King side attacking chances with the [ f5 ] break.
 [ f3 ]  [ a x b4 ]  [ a x b4 ] , [ N e4 x c5 ]  Probably the move which lead to my draw result. Though there are not many other options I can to try.
 [ R x d7 ]  [ R x d7 ]  [ N f6 + ]  [ K g7 ]  [ N x d7 ]  [ B d6 ] , [ g3 ]  I secure the King side and will go to promote a pawn on Q side.
 [ R a b1 ] , [ Q x a2 ]  Pawn grabbing there's really not much else for Black to do.
 [ B g2 ]  [ f5 ]  [ e x f5 ] , [ Q x f5 ]  ...white needs to release the pin and create grief on the queen side....i thought a4/5 and [ b4 ] followed by [ Q b3 ] creates and major headache for black owing to the very strong long white bishop....given time..
 [ B g5 ]  [ R a b8 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ B x f6 ] , [ N d5 ]  Good move very annoying to have your knight there. I had to move the queen but didn't want to have my bishop lost and worse make me recapture with the e pawn meaning I had a backward d pawn and no piece to protect my king.
 [ g3 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ B g2 ] , [ e6 ]  Still following the world DB. The sample size has gotten tiny just 51 games - all of which favor white. Both sides have a fianchetto on the same long diagonal a8-h1. Both sides have two developed pieces and similar direct and oblique center control; it seems relatively even. I'm not sure why this position is so favorable for white in the DB. It looks relatively balanced to me.
 [ c6 ] , [ Q x d6 ]  Trying to get the best out of the situation!
 [ R e8 ] , [ N f5 ]  Still no mate. If 21. Bxh6? P[ x [ h6 ] ] 22. Q[ x [ h6 ] ] [ N f7 ] and my attack peters out with a loss of material. But I can put more pressure on [ h6 ] as played.
 [ B x d3 ] , [ e5 ]  White's pieces are in disarray but this simply gives up a pawn and evens the material. Up until now I felt my opponent had been playing quite well; he'd played an opening that phases me and had forced me into a series of uncomfortable defenses. Here his play begins to go wrong.
 [ e4 ]  [ Q x a6 + ]  [ K b8 ] , [ Q a8 # ]  
 [ K g6 ] , [ K e5 ]  Black resigns. Good game to black. I don't think I played too badly especially the endgame. However if you have a different opinion please comment. I'd appreciate it if you'd rate my annotation.
 [ Q d2 ]  [ Q x a4 ]  [ Q d5 + ]  [ K h8 ]  [ d7 ] , [ e3 ]  Black wants to hold onto his [ f5 ] pawn for now. There follows some queen play contesting central influence
 [ B f8 ] , [ B a6 ]  Pressure builds. Yay!
 [ N d5 ] , [ B a7 ]  ? Second mistake in a row. I had to give up my bishop with moves such as [ N c6 ] or Bb7.
 [ B d2 ]  [ d4 ]  [ K g4 ]  [ K d5 ]  [ h5 ]  [ e4 ]  [ h6 ]  [ e3 ] , [ B x e3 ]  Nothing else is really possible.
 [ N c3 ]  [ c6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d x c4 ] , [ e4 ]  Transposing to QGA or is this simply count as a variation on QGD?
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ d3 ] , [ e6 ]  This sort of placid development from White generally leads to positions with easy equality for Black or some slight advantage due to queenside space. There are numerous ways to play them but I've always had a preference to adopt a structure similar to that of a Sicilian Kan
 [ B x f3 ]  [ g x f3 ]  [ h4 ] , [ B e4 ]  White's king is in a bit of danger. Black is getting close to winning with [ Q g5 + ] and [ h3 ] and Qg2#. It's not locked yet but white better take precautions. The move as played 14. [ B e4 ] does little to prevent this impending mate but it does allow white to play [ f4 ] at some time letting the bishop cover g2. It also threatens black's rook but with a possible checkmate in sight black doesn't have to save that rook right away - in fact he could use it as bait. Worse while the bishop was on [ e3 ] it protected white's far-flung knight at [ b5 ] but now it does not and black has a simple fork to threaten to win that knight (though the need to save his rook on [ a8 ] will give the knight time to escape).
 [ c5 ] , [ N d5 ]  Here I managed to exert some pressure on his attacking structure by a simultaneous attack to the queen and to [ c7 ] pawn.
 [ Q x e2 + ] , [ B x e2 ]  ...so we exchange...
 [ c3 ]  [ R c6 ] , [ b4 ]  28 [ N d3 ] eyeing [ e5 ] was best with equality.I wanted more so came up with the idea of pushing the Q_side pawns.After 27.[ b4 ] Houdini gives a small plus for black
 [ b3 ]  [ Q a5 ]  [ R a c1 ]  [ R f c8 ]  [ Q c2 ]  [ b5 ]  [ R c a1 ] , [ c4 ]  Well black play with solid attacks and he can't be attacked.....Great!
 [ K h1 ]  [ Q h4 ]  [ Q e2 ]  [ Q x h3 + ]  [ Q h2 ]  [ B x f3 + ] , [ R x f3 ]  Forced.
 [ B g5 ] , [ f6 ]  I expected [ B f6 ]  [ B x f3 ]  [ N x d4 ] , [ B x h5 ]  The analysis suggests that this is an inaccuracy and that [ g4 ] is better however I again was reluctant to disturb the pawns in front of my king and felt that this would weaken the black pawns
 [ N d7 ] , [ h4 ]  The idea in my mind was to play [ g4 ] as well and try to break through on the kingside if nothing opened up on the queenside.
 [ b4 ]  [ N e6 ]  [ R c2 ]  [ a6 ]  [ B a4 ] , [ b5 ]  this manoeuvre just helped me to comfort my bishops focusing on both the center and the king as we'll see. I recognize that black helped me a lot here.
 [ N c4 ]  [ e x f3 ]  [ Q x f3 ] , [ N c6 ]  before castling black prefers to put pressure in the centre
 [ d6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ O-O ] , [ B e2 ]  Black will need to strike at whites large pawn centre and has the option of either doing so with the c pawn to indicate queen side play or else with the e pawn which is indicative of king side play
 [ R a6 + ]  [ R f6 ] , [ R x f6 # ]  It's been an easy friendly game. But was [ N g1 ] a bad mistake like I think?
 [ N d2 ]  [ c3 ] , [ N b3 ]  how to avoid the multiple menace on [ e4 ] and h1? The king position could be any worse? I really thought black should play [ d5 ] to open this diagonal again and forced a [ R g1 ] or [ R h2 ] move.
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ c3 ] , [ g6 ]  I have become quite fond of the accelerated dragon so this move suits me just fine.
 [ Q x a7 ] , [ c5 ]  Highlighting the bad position of the White queen threatening to trap her with ...[ R a8 ] and/or ...Bc6.
 [ h x g3 ]  [ N x g3 ]  [ N x e8 ]  [ N x e2 + ]  [ K g2 ]  [ N x c1 ] , [ R a4 ]  Alternative variation: 25. [ R a3 ] [ B c5 ] 26. [ N c7 ] [ B x a3 ] 27. [ N x a8 ] [ N b3 ] $19
 [ g x h5 ] , [ e4 ]  This is the main drawback of 29.b4. I feared that black would be able to gain much needed counter play by attacking c3.
 [ h3 ] , [ B d2 ]  And now my piece de resistance. My favorite move of the game. If White's queen moves away black wins the bishop on h6. If white captures Black's bishop he loses less material after 31. ... [ Q x f1 ] .
 [ f x e6 ]  [ Q d3 ]  [ N x f1 ]  [ B g6 ] , [ B g5 ]  if 21... [ R f8 ] 22.[ Q h3 ] [ B h4 ] 23.[ N e4 ] followed by 24.[ g3 ] white wins back some material and still has mating threats.
 [ R e8 + ] , [ Q d8 ]  In fact Carl said "I screwed up and I'm now in trouble." It's true but he's not giving up. In this case he was right not to do it. But I would've let the R go because a Q is generally more valuable. Yet he's still losing the equivalent to a R since after I take he will take back. I actually think that this outcome is better for black because both R's against the Q is a general draw. However I'm up almost the equivalent to a R but he has the chance to do a lot of damage with both R's which will happen towards the end. Also this gives him the equivalent to a pawn so it's +4 for me but if he had given up an entire R to avoid giving up the Q it would be a +5 for me which is more. I'm sure that Carl took note of that.
 [ Q d6 ]  [ f x e5 ]  [ f x e5 ] , [ R f3 ]  Here I am considering exchanging my rook for the knight and pawn. This will leave me a point down however I don't like the knight so far forward attacking important squares around my king.
 [ B b3 ] , [ B c5 ]  A sort of Ruy Lopez Classical Deferred. I think the ...[ B c5 ] maneuver appeals more to sub-master players because it's more active on the g1-[ a7 ] diagonal vis-a-vis the [ e7 ] post. This treatment by the second player always seemed to me a distinctly old-fashioned treatment of the Ruy even a little arrogant.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ N f6 ]  2. ........ [ N f6 ] (the Petrov's defense instead of defending his e pawn he attacks mine and develops a piece).
 [ d x e4 ] , [ d x e4 ]  ...intending [ f4 ] without fearing Rd8. Note that I don't find time to take the [ b7 ] pawn.
 [ B e7 ]  [ R d7 ]  [ K g6 ]  [ R x b7 ]  [ B x a3 ]  [ B g2 ]  [ N e5 ] , [ R x a7 ]  No pawns no hope for black.
 [ B d3 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N b d7 ] , [ O-O ]  +- I like white's position better as he seems to have more opportunity but the diagonal is a weakness that will need to be addressed in the future especially as pressure on [ d4 ] continues.
 [ N a6 ] , [ a3 ]  11.[ a3 ] - As has been noted many times it is important to prevent Black from playing Nb4-c2.
 [ N a2 ]  [ R b8 ]  [ Q a7 ] , [ R x b6 ]  sorry about this one. I know you were running out of squares and I'm not entirely sure much at all could be done but trading a rook and a pawn for a pawn and a knight when you are that far behind in material is never a good idea. I will stop here. I am going to go back and look at the opening again. I think there was a move in there that would have helped you in the center more. Certainly [ N f6 ] was one of them. I annotated this game to help my friend adui out or try anyway not to impress any chess geniuses. I hope this will help some adui.
 [ N x a4 ]  [ N x a5 ] , [ B x h4 ]  Now I'm up a solid pawn which is usually enough to win in minor piece endgames where the bishops are on the same color but here White might be able to hold a draw since my king doesn't have an easy path to activity. All I need to worry about is not letting White promote and not letting him win my c-pawn for free
 [ R x c3 ]  [ R d6 ] , [ e4 ]  I wanted to keep the N from centralizing but this was silly on my part because if White moved [ N d5 ] then Rxd3. This move also opened a diagonal for White the Bishop.
 [ R e1 ] , [ Q g7 ]  When you're down big trade pawns not pieces. Down 9 Black is in a big-time hole. This move allows White to force a Queen trade.
 [ Q x f6 ] , [ e x f6 ]  but win a passed pawn as a prize :)
 [ g4 ]  [ h x g4 ]  [ f x g4 ]  [ K e6 ]  [ c4 ] , [ B x h4 ]  Attacking his king side is my only hope.
 [ N x d5 ]  [ B b5 ] , [ e6 ]  I think that 7...[ N x c3 ] 8.[ b x c3 ] [ Q d5 ] which led to a Black victory in Shamkovich-Adianto 1994 would have eased my defensive task significantly and made my next few moves easier. White would no longer have an isolated pawn but the weakness would simply be transferred from [ d4 ] to c3.
 [ N x g3 ]  [ B x g3 ]  [ N g4 ]  [ e2 ]  [ Q c2 ]  [ e x f1 = Q + ] , [ R x f1 ]  black has a great material advantage.
 [ h6 ]  [ B x f6 + ] , [ K x f6 ]  Avoiding doubling pawns on the king-side now!
 [ Q x e5 ]  [ N d2 ] , [ B x h3 ]  To break up the Pawns protecting White's King.
 [ B e2 ]  [ B x f3 ]  [ N x f3 ] , [ Q d6 ]  This may be a mistake--it loses the exchange.
 [ N x f3 + ]  [ g x f3 ]  [ N e7 ] , [ B b5 ]  I can't let this B command this diagonal so...
 [ K e2 ]  [ Q c2 + ]  [ R d2 ]  [ Q c4 + ] , [ K f3 ]  ??
 [ B x f1 ]  [ K x f1 ]  [ N e6 ]  [ B d5 ]  [ R a7 ]  [ b x a6 ]  [ K d7 ]  [ N b3 ]  [ R b8 ]  [ N e1 ]  [ R b6 ]  [ N d3 ] , [ K e7 ]  If indeed 21...R3[ x a6 ] so 22 R[ x a6 ] R[ x a6 ] 23 [ B x e6 + ] [ K e7 ] and White has 2 knights and 1 pawn for the rook.
 [ h x g6 ] , [ N b6 ]  Bad move for bob as this will allow me to pin his rook.
 [ K d3 ]  [ K f8 ]  [ B e3 ] , [ Q b2 ]  I heard him say "Yikes!" and he.....
 [ B e7 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ R e1 ]  [ B g4 ] , [ e5 ]  Not a good idea for black to take the pawn on [ e4 ] isolating his c-pawns.
 [ N c4 ] , [ d x e5 ]  18.[ K g1 ] - [ B g4 ] 19. [ Q d3 ] would have offered more resistance. Although after 19-[ N b2 ] it wouldn't be too hard to crash through White's position.
 [ B c5 ]  [ Q c3 ]  [ f6 ] , [ e5 ]  I dont do well in complicated endings where there are a lot of pieces on the board....AGE related i think! I decided to keep applying pressure with pawn....if I can break down his pawn defence then my queen is in direct line to check his K
 [ R h8 + ] , [ R g8 ]  Forced again.
 [ h6 ] , [ B c7 ]  Closing in for the kill. Black is busted. I gather Joanne considered resigning hereabouts but agreed to play out the mate.
 [ N g4 ] , [ R c7 ]  ?? Bh5! and White has serious trouble.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ B c4 ]  nothing fancy: the Italian party...
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ c6 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ N b d7 ]  [ f4 ] , [ Q c7 ]  This I think is off book. Part of the reason I chose it--time to explore new frontiers.
 [ e x d4 ]  [ B x d4 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ B x e4 ]  [ N c5 ]  [ B g2 ] , [ N e6 ]  The knight stands well on e6.
 [ e4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ N e4 ] , [ f5 ]  the sqaure [ e5 ] is now a weakness in blacks camp which Alekhine using that for hes favor with art .
 [ Q d8 ] , [ N f3 ]  Aiming at nothing overlooking the danger.
 [ K a1 ]  [ K x c3 ]  [ K a2 ] , [ b4 ]  And white sees there is no way to stop the queen and resigns. 0-1
 [ Q x h3 + ] , [ R h2 ]  forced as if 26.[ K g1 ] then 26....[ Q x g2 # ]  [ Q f1 + ] , [ Q g1 ]  Again forced.
 [ Q x f2 ]  [ R h6 + ] , [ K g2 ]  Won't be long now. He's got a forced mate -- and I'll just make sure he sees it before resigning.
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ] , [ N f6 ]  4. ........... [ N f6 ] - the first four moves are standard Sicilian book moves.
 [ f5 ] , [ R f1 ]  Alternative variation: 28. [ Q f3 ] [ Q e2 ] 29. [ N h2 ] [ Q x f3 ] 30. [ N x f3 ] [ R a5 ] $19
 [ K h1 ] , [ B g5 ]  White king moves out of check and I retreat my DB to g5. There was no option for me to bring in my queen sitting at [ e5 ] as I could not connect my bishop and my queen to make an attack possible.
 [ K b3 ]  [ R e4 ]  [ K c3 ]  [ R c4 + ]  [ K b3 ]  [ K d4 ]  [ R b6 ]  [ K d3 ]  [ R a6 ]  [ R c2 ]  [ R b6 ]  [ R c3 + ]  [ K b2 ]  [ R c4 ]  [ K b3 ]  [ K d4 ]  [ R a6 ]  [ K d5 ] , [ R a8 ]  This was a big escape for Caruana a very important game mentally! At the same time I am sure Carlsen is extremely frustrated! The game was in his hands! Until tomorrow.....
 [ B e2 ] , [ e6 ]  Black is initiating a Torre setup where Black has ideas of pushing the queenside pawns for a queenside attack or Black can make the maneuvers [ c5 ] [ N c6 ] [ B d6 ] [ B b8 ] [ Q d6 ] with a kingside attack in mind along the b8-[ h2 ] diagonal.
 [ R f8 ] , [ b8 = Q ]  i wanted him to get my queen
 [ R c6 ]  [ K g3 ] , [ K g8 ]  What else is there?
 [ N d6 ] , [ d4 ]  White gets agressive - by threatening the fork 17.[ d5 ] Black now has to move either his bishop or his knight...
 [ e x d5 ] , [ N c3 ]  Coming out for the attack but a weak one.
 [ b x c3 ] , [ N e4 ]  of course...
 [ B x c6 ] , [ d x c6 ]  Ordinarily I'd capture towards the centre with bxc6. This option gives Black the opportunity to more quickly develop at the expense of a decent pawn centre. Perhaps not worth it.
 [ R d7 x d3 ]  [ c x d3 ]  [ R x d3 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ R d8 ]  [ a4 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ N f7 ]  [ g4 ]  [ f x g4 ]  [ R x e4 ]  [ f3 ] , [ R e3 ]  ? Black fails to see all of White's threats.
 [ Q x d4 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ Q d1 ]  I played the queen back to her orginal square because at this point I was not sure which diagonal she would be best on. Also I wanted to keep my bishop lines clear and free. AT this point my goal is to setup a typical mazanony bind in the centre.
 [ N b5 ]  [ R a1 + ]  [ K f2 ]  [ a5 ]  [ e4 ]  [ R c5 ]  [ N d6 ]  [ a4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ a3 ]  [ N e8 ]  [ R b1 ]  [ N f6 + ] , [ K h8 ]  If 39 [ e6 ] fxe 40 Rx[ e6 ] [ K g7 ] white has nothing.
 [ Q x f3 ] , [ B x f3 ]  Regrettably I am down the exchange by a Knight.
 [ R e f7 ]  [ R h4 ] , [ K g8 ]  In case of ...[ R f2 ] 35. [ Q h6 + ] [ K g8 ] 36. [ B x g6 ] and then if [ h x g6 ] the forced sequence 37. [ Q h8 + ] [ K f7 ] 38. [ R h7 + ] [ K e8 ] and finally simply 39. [ R x c7 ] [ R x h8 ] [ K x f2 ] or 39. [ Q x f8 + ] [ R x f8 ] and 40. [ R x c7 ] with up the exchange
 [ f3 ]  [ B x f3 ]  [ R x f3 ] , [ e x f3 ]  It's here where the pawn comes into it's own. By including the pawn instead of exchanging his way into a material deficit (black's queen can easily break off the attack to bag the knight) white no has his back against the wall without much room to maneuver.
 [ O-O ] , [ d x e4 ]  10...[ d x e4 ] seems kinda weird but I gotta remember it's me who's trying to equalize. Plus I'm ahead in material.
 [ Q x c5 ] , [ b x c5 ]  No more queens on the field
 [ N c6 ] , [ h3 ]  Pointless the bishop's diagonal is mine.
 [ Q c7 ]  [ h3 ]  [ B h5 ]  [ R c1 ]  [ N e7 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ B x e2 ] , [ Q x e2 ]  White has planted a N on e5; Black will try to remove it.
 [ h4 ] , [ h5 ]  the h pawn is blocked now white has two choices advance the f pawns and lose other pawn or to move the king either way black will play [ N f4 ] and wait...
 [ b x c4 ]  [ b x c4 ] , [ B d4 ]  Pins the knight which is defended by the queen. BxN QxB PxP PxP BxP is good for black so I defend the [ f5 ] pawn again.
 [ N f6 ]  [ R b1 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ N d2 ]  [ B x d2 ]  [ R x d2 ] , [ B e4 ]  Here's where I made the second draw offer which was again refused.
 [ Q b2 + ]  [ K d1 ]  [ Q a1 + ] , [ K c2 ]  It would be an exchange and white will be able to counterattack
 [ Q a2 ] , [ Q f8 ]  Next stop for Black Queen will be [ h6 ] and threat the attack on h2.
 [ Q g8 ] , [ B e2 ]  Attacking his h5-pawn
 [ R c8 ] , [ d7 ]  at this point I didn't see any other option then taking the pawn or lose my last rook it is a lost cause anyway
 [ a6 ] , [ N d6 ]  great exactly what i was expecting eat the knight the tower whit has to eat because if the pawn take it my bishop in [ g7 ] will be very dangerous ...
 [ N x g5 ]  [ R c7 ]  [ h4 ]  [ R d7 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ R d3 ]  [ R e6 ] , [ K g7 ]  37. .... [ K g7 ] - Henry decides to help in coralling the passed pawn on e7. Henry must be very wary of knight forks and castle fire however.
 [ Q a7 ] , [ R f8 ]  Alternative variation: 37... [ R g6 ] [does not win a prize] 38. [ K g2 ] [ R h6 ] 39. [ R d1 ] [ Q x h3 + ] 40. [ K f2 ] [ Q h2 + ] 41. [ K e1 ] [ Q h1 + ] 42. [ B f1 ] [ Q x f1 + ] 43. [ K x f1 ] [ R h1 + ] 44. [ K e2 ] [ R x d1 ] 45. [ K x d1 ] $18
 [ O-O ]  [ d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ e5 ]  [ b6 ] , [ e x d6 ]  Now the early Queen move comes back to haunt Black.
 [ B g6 ]  [ B x g6 ] , [ f x g6 ]  Shepparding the Black bishop into the bishop exchange has now given Black doubled pawns on the g file and partially exposed his King.
 [ B x d6 ]  [ Q x d6 ]  [ a x b5 ] , [ R a b8 ]  A terrible move due to my weak back rank. I'm trying to challenge for the rank that will soon be open as the pawn is lost anyway but it turns out to be really bad.
 [ R f f3 ] , [ Q f8 ]  Can't quite rem why I changed my mind.
 [ N f5 ]  [ N x c8 ]  [ N x e3 ] , [ R x d7 + ]  An intermezzio (inbetween move) that helps white greatly. Gets the rook out of trouble and allows the capture of the black rook.
 [ N g e2 ]  [ O-O ]  [ Q d2 ] , [ c6 ]  Black wants to prepare a Queenside attack in case White plays 0-0-0.
 [ N f6 ] , [ N a4 ]  Trying to somehow trap or otherwise harrass my queen. However.....
 [ R g1 ]  [ B x d6 ]  [ B e2 ] , [ N b d7 ]  !
 [ B c2 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ N b d2 ] , [ O-O ]  Black castles into the attack
 [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ b6 ]  [ g3 ] , [ c6 ]  This wasn't the best move but just to take you out of book. Better move would be any of a few Bishop moves such as a fianchetto [ B b4 ] etc. This is not a suicidal move just not the best.
 [ N c8 ] , [ R x e6 ]  Material is even his position is preferable but the game can still be played.
 [ e5 ]  [ Q c3 ]  [ c6 ] , [ h3 ]  simply delays the inevitable: great gain of tempo.
 [ N x e4 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ B x e4 ]  [ N b5 ] , [ d5 ]  This is the kind of position I would hate to have in a blitz-game - even with a pawn up! Of course the Black d-pawn is strong but White has plenty of play around it and the final question could be: Which King is the safest. I decided to seek for simplifications instead.
 [ R f e1 ]  [ B e7 ] , [ R a d1 ]  ?! Missing the opportunity to seize the initiative with [ c4 ] ... d5. One of my only inaccuracies the whole game.
 [ Q g3 ] , [ N x c4 ]  Free piece. I'll bite - doesn't seem to be any overt reprisal.
 [ B d3 ] , [ R e5 ]  Attacked thrice defended thrice.
 [ B h3 ] , [ f4 ]  ?? I understand this move perfectly well. The idea was to gain by forcing my Q away. Unfortunately this is the move that's going to seal her fate once and for all. Note: This ironically is the same mistake that I made against the Master Mater. When I was in trouble I decided to kick his Q figuring that I got out of it. But what I overlooked was the mate in one which he did take advantage of in the exact same way ironically. That was his LSB+Q. While it might appear differently this by my standards is the losing blunder and not her previous move QXP. In order to prevent mate white's only move was to move her g pawn. But when she does that I take and capture her R with 13...[ g x f1 + ] In other words white would be this time forced to give up her R for my B in order to prevent mate. Note: if you lose a lot of material even against a much stronger opponent you still have chances of counterplay and are sometimes able to turn a loss into a draw or win henceforth a swindle. I know because I have pulled such swindles against Mr. Stockel in hopeless positions but once you leave yourself vulnerable to a mating sequence that's when it's over. That is when the opponent takes advantage of that weakness which is what you typically see.
 [ B e7 + ]  [ K c6 ]  [ Q g6 + ]  [ K d7 ] , [ Q d6 + ]  trying to isolate and corner the king
 [ e x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ] , [ Q f6 ]  I found this move interesting. I was hoping for 4...[ B c5 ] 5. [ B e3 ] [ Q f6 ] 6. [ [ c3 ] ] [ N g e7 ] 7. [ B c4 ] O-O 8. b4. I played [ [ c3 ] ] hoping that would still happen
 [ K f2 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ R a7 ]  I had a plan to shuffle my knight about and get it to [ g8 ] however it was then I realised that the black king couldn't actually move and therefore the threat was [ N e7 # ]  [ N x e4 + ] , [ K e3 ]  preventing further checks
 [ g6 ] , [ a3 ]  !?Another pin protection move but this time with no threat of a pin
 [ c5 ]  [ B e3 ] , [ N c6 ]  The luring 6.dxc5?... is an error and is met with 6...[ d4 ] -/+
 [ B d2 ]  [ B x f6 ] , [ a5 ]  And a passed pawn has appeared
 [ K c3 ]  [ K a5 ]  [ a x b5 ] , [ a x b5 ]  44. ......... [ a x b5 ] - I am happy with this exchange as I now have 2 connected passers. Henry looks down to [ b1 ] and [ c1 ] and thinks "Not long now" - Boy isn't he a happy man!
 [ e6 ]  [ d x e6 ]  [ B x e6 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ N c6 ]  [ B c5 ] doesn't stop [ d4 ] and [ B b4 ] is easily rejected by a3.
 [ Q x d4 + ] , [ c x d4 ]  The exchange
 [ B x b4 ] , [ B b2 ]  While now a pawn down this is a good developing move as white is seeking control of this long diagonal and possibly even considering BxN which would damage a king's potentially castled position.
 [ Q f6 ] , [ a x b5 ]  I completely own the center.
 [ B c6 ]  [ d4 ] , [ R d8 ]  attack the one last threatening pawn.
 [ g x f4 ]  [ N e2 ]  [ f3 ] , [ g x f3 ]  I can see nothing wrong with accepting the pawn. Clearly it divests my king of any protecting pawns but if say ...[ R g8 ] [ K h2 ] followed by [ R g1 ] if necessary to cover the g-file.
 [ O-O ]  [ N b d2 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ Q e1 ] , [ N a5 ]  a very bad moment to try and neutralize Bc4; Black had best in [ Q d6 ] [ N b3 ] [ b6 ] [ N h4 ] a5...
 [ K x h3 ]  [ R x a2 ]  [ R f x g6 + ]  [ K h7 ]  [ R g f6 ]  [ R b7 ]  [ R d a6 ]  [ R b2 ] , [ R f3 ]  41. [ f4 ] was probably a good alternative but I first wanted to start the King-side pawn roller using that f-pawn to anchor the base and then later advance the f-pawn. These pawns are all needed to give the White king shelter from the avalanche of checks that his Rooks will be delivering. And he also knows that as soon as he captures the b-pawn the Rook exchanges will force him to give up his a-pawn with check.
 [ e x d5 ]  [ b5 ]  [ B b3 ]  [ R e8 + ]  [ K f2 ] , [ N b6 ]  Attacking the center !
 [ N c6 ] , [ B b5 ]  I lightely played this as a try. Normally I go pawn's storming with [ h3 ] [ g4 ] etc. but against the fianchetto it hardly works. This is just another try... I didn't know it will soon become wild.
 [ c5 ] , [ N f3 ]  Developing knight and attacking e5.
 [ B b4 ]  [ a3 ]  [ B a5 ]  [ b4 ]  [ B c7 ] , [ f4 ]  White made the move P-[ B4 ] much too fast to suit me so I looked again carefully to see if there was anything wrong with 34... NxP. After 35 PxQ N-[ N6 ] ch 36 K-[ R2 ] NxQ White could not play 37 RxR? on account of ... BxP ch and ... NxR. He would have to play 37 RxB RxR 38 NxR RxN. Then 39 N-[ N5 ] was not agreeable for me but 39... R-Q sq 40 R-[ R7 ] P-[ B3 ] 41 N-[ K6 ] R-K sq was a likely draw.
 [ R d6 ] , [ R a d1 ]  Allowing piece trades is usally bad for the side down in material but it is fine here because my rook will be strong if it gets to d2.
 [ g5 ]  [ B g3 ] , [ O-O ]  Alternative variation: 13... [ g4 ] 14. [ B h4 ] [ R g8 ] 15. [ e5 ] dx[ e5 ] 16. [ Q e2 ] [ Q x d4 ] 17. [ B x f6 ] [ g x h3 ] 18. [ R d1 ] (18. Bx[ e5 ] [ R x g2 + ] 19. [ K h1 ] [ Q d5 ] 20. [ B g3 + ] [ B e6 ] $19) (18. [ Q x e5 + ] Qx[ e5 ] 19. Bx[ e5 ] [ R x g2 + ] 20. [ K h1 ] [ B b7 ] $15) 18... [ R x g2 + ] 19. [ K h1 ] $14
 [ Q x g3 + ]  [ K e2 ]  [ e x f4 ] , [ a3 ]  Preparing to drive the Bishop with P-N4.
 [ Q e7 ] , [ R e3 ]  Queen will now be driven to a weaker square
 [ N e8 ]  [ O-O ] , [ N d6 ]  "Black is planning the move [ f5 ] which would free his position."
 [ R x e1 ]  [ R f x e1 ] , [ N f6 ]  Black hastens to develop his remaining pieces. For a gambiteer he is surprisingly behind in development but has got rid of White's Queen.
 [ K b1 ] , [ N f4 ]  all white's pawns are blocked...
 [ R e1 ]  [ K h2 ] , [ R a1 ]  another one... :-)
 [ c x b6 ] , [ K x b6 ]  40. .... [ K x b6 ] - now now I got a shock when I ran gameknot analysis - for the computer told me that I was winning this game hands down - only I did not see it at the time. White's king really looks as though he is running the show but looks can be very deceptive. I the Class C player I was at the time was certainly deceived so much so I conceded an unnecessary Low Draw my only consolation is is that the game was unrated.
 [ B x f3 ]  [ R d3 ]  [ R a1 ] , [ c4 ]  38. ............ c4? - Here Ion thought that this move was ... A careless slip brought on by a new-found confidence...
 [ Q g5 ]  [ b3 ] , [ B g6 ]  ! A great move that solidifies Rybka's advantage even more! Shredder's next moves are forced (I'm surprised he hasn't resigned here yet...)
 [ R f7 ]  [ h5 ]  [ R x c7 ]  [ R g3 + ]  [ K h2 ]  [ h4 ] , [ R x b7 ]  I offered a draw. He accepted. I think except for my blunder that I played pretty well.
 [ R c8 + ] , [ R c6 ]  protecting and hoping to exchange
 [ N d2 ] , [ N g4 ]  from now white is also exposed to a good Attack but precised moves gave me security
 [ f5 ] , [ e4 ]  open the diagonal for the other bishop
 [ f x g4 ]  [ R x g4 ] , [ Q e8 ]  ... but it was a wrong idea...
 [ R f x f7 ] , [ R a1 + ]  The idea here is that once white gets out of check black would win back a R and everything would henceforth be even after 28...Rxf7. But that is not the case because of what I mentioned above.
 [ a3 ] , [ B x c3 ]  Maintaining the full material advantage. If Black retreats the bishop white can play P[ x c4 ] and black is only up by the exchange of pawn for bishop. This move allows P[ x d3 ] exchanging the pawn rather than outright losing it.
 [ B c4 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ b3 ]  [ N b6 ]  [ Q e2 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ R d1 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ B b2 ]  [ N f d7 ]  [ R d2 ] , [ N x c4 ]  The capture now gives black a valuable tempo black will shore up [ e5 ] and then push for d5!
 [ B f5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ e6 ] , [ N h4 ]  Please forgive this move. I missed the queens obvious defense of the [ h4 ] square. However this loss of piece will give me the Psychological advantage. Besides a mistake free game rarely occurs at this level of play. I say "Psychological advantage" because I'm going to be looking for every way back into this game while my opponent might let his guard down and make a mistake.
 [ B x e4 ]  [ Q x e4 ] , [ K h8 ]  ?! not sure what this was in aid of
 [ B a6 ]  [ Q e1 ]  [ N h5 ]  [ R c a1 ]  [ Q d7 ] , [ N x b4 ]  This is lame but passive defense will lose here too. Black's position is much more coordinated.
 [ Q f2 ] , [ R a d8 ]  A violent attack is nearly coming at this point I was thinking that I was going to lose this game.
 [ R a d1 ] , [ R a d8 ]  Threatening [ c5 ] winning my DSB
 [ B b7 ] , [ N c3 ]  Black strikes at the center again and white defends again with development.
 [ B g5 ] , [ B e7 ]  ? Playing carelessly. [ Q c7 ] [ Q b6 ] or [ h6 ] were all better. What would you play here as white?
 [ e5 ]  [ B f5 ] , [ B d3 ]  A very playable line but it plays right into the caro-kanns main idea i.e. riding my light-square bishop for his active light square bishop.
 [ R b7 ] , [ R a8 ]  Now I didn't analyse this particular line any further when I worked this out earlier because I just assumed here that the a-pawn was doomed. But I cannot take it straight away because of [ R x a7 ] [ Q x a7 ] [ Q x e5 ] 0-1
 [ K g6 ]  [ R e6 + ]  [ K g7 ]  [ R e7 + ]  [ K g6 ] , [ h4 ]  Once white has his passed pawn the rest is a formality
 [ K f6 ]  [ N x e6 ] , [ K x e6 ]  33. ..... [ K x e6 ] - material is even but look at those kingside passers!
 [ e6 ]  [ f x e6 ]  [ d x e6 ] , [ R x e6 ]  And now continues a long battle with Black using both rooks on the double file attempting to secure more of my pawns going into the endgame
 [ f3 ] , [ B d3 ]  only move as [ R d3 ] attacking the queen fails to [ Q b2 + ] and [ K x e2 ] next move
 [ N e5 ] , [ N d7 ]  Offering to exchange off the knight when white has no hope of winning.
 [ f x g5 ] , [ h x g5 ]  Yes the pawn is unprotected
 [ B d4 ] , [ N e d7 ]  6. ........ [ N e d7 ] - trying to avoid a pawn bust up on the kingside.
 [ N d8 ] , [ B b2 ]  pinning an important support pawn in the centre white shows he has not lost it.
 [ R a d1 ] , [ b5 ]  ...a pawn's storm supported by my Q and B not to mention the [ R a8 ] behind . A "gimme".
 [ B f4 ]  [ B x e5 ] , [ B x e5 ]  Still down a pawn but feel like I am ahead in development at this stage which is the sacrifice of the BDG gambit
 [ f x e4 ] , [ R e3 ]  Black captures my knight at [ [ e4 ] ] and I bring rook to [ e3 ] to halt e pawn's progress. Both light colored bishops are on same diagonal as [ [ e4 ] ] pawn. [I think I would have stayed on this file if I was black as he risks losing rook as well if the bishop moves.]
 [ K e7 ] , [ Q c5 + ]  Check.
 [ d x e5 ]  [ f x e5 ]  [ B e7 ] , [ e6 ]  ! The key move.
 [ b3 ] , [ B e6 ]  Part of the weakness. the three pawns need suport of the big guns.
 [ B x d5 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ N b7 ] , [ O-O ]  Having castled my position is now quite a bit better than Black's. I can double up rooks on the c-file and start storming his king.
 [ B f8 ] , [ c4 ]  Finaly.
 [ e4 ] , [ c5 ]  Mini Tournament match this is our second game of the tournament score 1-0 favoring me. This game I'm black and my opponent gets some payback. I open with the Sicilian.
 [ B x e6 + ]  [ K h8 ] , [ g3 ]  white seems to have now a great advantage. nevertheless he must keep it because two pawns up can be a bit "slippery".
 [ Q h5 + ]  [ K c2 ]  [ Q g4 ] , [ K c3 ]  move out of pin
 [ R e3 ] , [ g4 ]  My overextension isn't pretty and I think [ Q a6 ] is better
 [ K b4 ]  [ R g1 ]  [ K c5 ]  [ R g5 + ]  [ K b4 ]  [ K b6 ]  [ K a4 ]  [ K c5 ]  [ K a5 ]  [ R g1 ]  [ K a6 ]  [ R a1 + ]  [ K b7 ]  [ R a5 ]  [ K c7 ]  [ R a7 + ]  [ K b8 ]  [ R g7 ]  [ K c8 ]  [ K b6 ]  [ K d8 ]  [ K a7 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ K b8 ]  [ c5 ] , [ R g8 + ]  EUREKA!!! He offered a draw and i accepted...
 [ Q f4 ]  [ N x g4 ] , [ Q x g4 ]  18. [ Q x g4 ] - that pesky knight swipes off Fou Leblanc. However it does mean that Glenda controls the g column.
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ c4 ] , [ d x c4 ]  Queen's Pawn gambit - the programmed starting move
 [ h6 ]  [ R f1 ]  [ f6 ] , [ e5 ]  I attack another pawn...
 [ f6 ] , [ N f3 ]  roneshet: [ Q f7 ] I say [ Q f7 ] following by [ h5 ] will open their king side... How are you all doing with the corona madness? ptitroque: 28...[ Q f7 ] seems ok protecting our [ d5 ] pawn and giving mobility to our queen bluenoser: [ Q f7 ] [ Q f7 ] looks good to me too.
 [ Q x e6 ]  [ Q x e6 + ]  [ K f8 ]  [ Q f6 + ]  [ K e8 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ R f8 ]  [ Q e6 + ]  [ K d8 ] , [ Q d7 # ]  THE BASIC OPENING PRINCIPLES 1) Control the center 2) Develop your pieces 3) Castle 4) Aim your Rooks
 [ R x a7 ]  [ R b4 ]  [ R b7 ]  [ d4 ]  [ K e2 ]  [ R b3 ]  [ K f2 ]  [ K h6 ]  [ b6 ]  [ R b2 + ]  [ K f3 ]  [ R b3 + ]  [ K f2 ] , [ R b2 + ]  I think a Draw might be the best I can get here...
 [ R f c8 ] , [ B f4 ]  [%clk 0:04:50] If ever you could think a better way to waste four tempos please show me!!! :-)
 [ Q d7 ]  [ f4 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ f5 + ]  [ K h5 ]  [ B e2 + ]  [ K h6 ]  [ d4 + ]  [ g5 ] , [ B x g5 # ]  From move # 7 to the end you can easily witness black NEGATIVELY tripling his King safety. So lets take a quick snapshot analysis of the above diagram.What do you see? Where does Black King rest in only 13 moves?How why?Totally unnecessary and never forced to have Blacks King resting on square [ h6 ] which is at a horrible position resting in front of his [ h7 ] pawn and what should have been an artificial castled position or a King retreat back to his first rank.Also notice that blacks Rook on [ h8 ] never moved and is basically useless.Take additional notes to blacks hemmed in Bishop on [ f8 ] compared to my fully open Bishop pair.And finally take note that white had the capability of castling both K side and Q side to expand whites Rook(s) for additional offensive play against blacks King or many of his other pieces.All of this in only 13 moves?????Think about it. Sure it is only a blitz game but trust me if I look deep enough into this opponents past game record I will find similar moves that slightly mirror a game like this quick 5 minute game with exchanges that are not well thought out non existent castling or non existent artificial castling that SHOULD have occurred but did not and/or Rooks that should have been moved earlier and were not and hemmed in Bishops(which is a bad trend with many 1900+players) and should have been developed with better pawn chain advancements.So blitz DOES tell a story sometimes(and many times)how an opponent will react in a long corresp game. This was a game of psychology.I knew from massive experience that many players WILL place that Bishop in front of their King in blitz expecting me to capture it.And in theory even exchanges when up my Q booty(or just 3 to 5 piece points) is normally par for the course with moves like...(BxB). But the risks outweigh the theory in games like mine.Why?Because that "theory"is fine if you look around FIRST BEFORE trying to exchange and see where your King is located and/or where it will be positioned IF I do "exchange" Bishops!So following normal channels of even exchange theory when up 5 points or more has flaws in it if you King is not properly placed in a good defensive spot first.And of course this game proves much of that.
 [ b4 ]  [ a x b4 ]  [ N x b4 ] , [ N f6 ]  Only chance for Black is to keep the pawns rolling on the K-side. In poker they call it "all in!".
 [ K f3 ] , [ Q d1 + ]  there it is
 [ N c6 ]  [ N f7 ]  [ R x d1 ]  [ R x d1 ] , [ K f8 ]  What can black do?? His position is very cramped.
 [ N c6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ g6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ B x d4 ]  [ O-O ] , [ f5 ]  The defining move in the Grand Prix. White intends to pry open black's kingside.
 [ b5 ]  [ B b3 ]  [ B b7 ] , [ N d2 ]  I could play [ [ d4 ] ] but his white bishop stopped me to do that. 12.[ [ d4 ] ] [ N x e4 ] 13.[ d x e5 ] [ N x e5 ] 14.[ N x e5 ] [ d x e5 ] and I'm a pawn down my dark bishop is locked and I still have doubled pawns on c file.
 [ N f6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ b5 ]  [ B b3 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ O-O ]  [ c3 ] , [ d5 ]  Marshall Attack - Black sacrifices a pawn in return for a lead in development and good chances for a king-side attack.
 [ B c8 ]  [ R f3 ] , [ R d7 ]  ??? He offers me a rook trade? I could not resist that gives me the bishop and clears more pieces of the board
 [ Q x e5 ]  [ R e3 ] , [ g4 ]  The [ f2 ] is the worst peice: completely unable to move. Black now begins planning an attack.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ d4 ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ c3 ] , [ d x c3 ]  3. ............ [ d x c3 ] - this is the Danish or Goring Gambit. I was advised by an Expert to play the Schelecter against this particular gambit to avoid getting eaten alive!
 [ N c2 ] , [ Q x g8 + ]  ...which I do with a bit of luck...
 [ d x e4 ]  [ B x e4 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ B f3 ]  Another play by the same piece.
 [ K d2 ]  [ N b4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ K d5 ] , [ K c3 ]  Black's only hope here is to trap the white king in a fool's ball.
 [ R e1 ] , [ Q c7 ]  Of course 26...[ Q d6 ] was best as then I'd exchange. But I can hold off on that because of the upcoming fork which is going to win an additional R for N.
 [ O-O ]  [ R a e1 ]  [ B b7 ] , [ K h1 ]  13. [ K h1 ] - avoids pin on [ g1 ] - [ a7 ] diagonal but unfortunately walks into a pin from the lsb on b7.
 [ R x e6 + ] , [ K g5 ]  ...but [ g7 ] is defended. And where's the mate? It cames [ h4 + ] but [ K f4 ] (not [ K x g4 ] or the white rooks enters into the fry and goodbay Mr. Black.
 [ Q g8 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B x c3 ] , [ b x c3 ]  12. [ b x c3 ] - Fou Lenoir is traded for one of the knights. Hmm I think I have made things easy for Graham as he now has the bishop pair! Thankfully Graham is not the Master Mater!
 [ B f6 ] , [ K f1 ]  Time to activate the King.
 [ N x f7 ] , [ f4 ]  Best way of defending the pawn.
 [ B x c4 ] , [ N c6 ]  Again ...[ c5 ] is better taking control of the backward d-pawn and the holes on [ d4 ] and d3.
 [ Q c3 ] , [ Q x c3 + ]  White is still tragically underdeveloped. Eliminating the royal ladies leaves black way ahead in development and ahead in material and with a strong attack against the paralyzed white kingside.
 [ g5 + ]  [ K e3 ]  [ N g4 + ]  [ K x e2 ]  [ R b8 ]  [ K d3 ]  [ a5 ]  [ K c3 ]  [ K g6 ]  [ b3 ]  [ R c8 + ]  [ K b2 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ R d1 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ R d5 ]  [ R x e4 ]  [ R x a5 ]  [ h4 ]  [ g x h4 ]  [ N x h4 ]  [ R c2 ]  [ g4 ]  [ R a8 ]  [ K f5 ]  [ a5 ]  [ g3 ]  [ R g8 ]  [ R e5 ]  [ b4 ]  [ g2 ] , [ a6 ]  
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ] , [ f4 ]  The King's Gambit
 [ B h5 ]  [ Q e8 ]  [ Q d1 ]  [ N d8 ]  [ R a2 a3 ]  [ K f8 ]  [ R a1 a2 ]  [ K g8 ]  [ N g4 ]  [ K f8 ]  [ N e3 ]  [ K g8 ]  [ B x f7 + ]  [ N x f7 ]  [ Q h5 ]  [ N d8 ]  [ Q g6 ]  [ K f8 ] , [ N h5 ]  In all these games we have seen Black building the defensive formation c5-d6-[ e5 ] which by its position on the board and the nature of its structure directs the activity of both players towards the wings. Game after game we saw the same crystal-clear method of play based on two actions: the first designed to balk or neutralize Black's counterplay on one wing and the second launching an attack on the king at a moment when the other sectors of the board have been stabilized. In the process we learnt that the central defensive wall is not as durable as it looks. It is immobile and rarely enables Black to create effective counterplay and it did not protect him against wing attacks. Even worse the pawn-wall itself sometimes became the target of the undermining moves [ b4 ] and f4.
 [ e x d5 ]  [ c x d5 ] , [ c5 ]  Black attempts to keep the d-file closed and avoids a pawn exchange on [ c6 ] with discovered check. Now I was struggling to see how to progress the attack. If 22. [ d6 ] (threatening 23. Qd7+) black can play 22...[ R d8 ] and he seems to be OK. I needed to get my rook on [ d1 ] into the game.
 [ O-O ] , [ R b8 ]  Forcing me to make a decision as to the placement of the White knight. Here I was convinced I could eek out a /= with 11. [ N a3 ] however Kramnik provided a wonderful idea with the next move.
 [ Q f8 ] , [ R f x f8 + ]  By now the end is inevitable. The king can only evade white's pieces for a few moves at best.
 [ K x f7 ] , [ N f e5 + ]  Possibly the last choice for White - I thought that [ f3 ] might be useful for the queen.
 [ B x g3 ]  [ f x g3 ]  [ Q f6 ] , [ B x c6 ]  Black didn't save his knight so rather than winning the exchange on [ a8 ] white gains a free knight on c6.
 [ d2 ]  [ K e2 ]  [ f1 = Q + ] , [ K x f1 ]  47. [ K x f1 ] - again forced but now comes the killer [ N e3 + ] and there is no way of stopping that [ d2 ] pawn from crowning so I wave the white flag. Nul point no. 42 for me against the Master Mater sigh and double sigh!
 [ B d6 ] , [ f4 ]  I liked this move: if e4[ x f3 ] NxF3 and I save the knight with a solid center.
 [ B x e2 ]  [ N x e2 ]  [ O-O ]  [ f5 ] , [ Q c5 ]  Liquidating seems to be a good idea now. Glad that you decided to accept. Could have afforded both your rooks and queen on my kingside with that pawn march.
 [ B x f3 ] , [ R x f3 ]  19.[ N x f3 ] [ N c4 ] is not how I wanted to play
 [ Q d7 ] , [ R e3 ]  This was also part of the plan behind bringing both N's on the rim. Once Ted retreated I also bring the Rook as I'm looking at everything that the position indicates because of what I learned from bhidragon. In this position my aim is to use my pieces to attack. But better would've been 20.[ Q f3 ] I did have a little bit of Ghost Vision that was caused by how little time there is. As there's only at most 5 minutes before I need to pack up and get ready for work. So I thought that somehow Ted's [ d5 ] pawn advanced or the Queen moved to the same diagonal as f3. Had I analyzed a little more carefully I would've seen otherwise and thus would've played it. But it's not too late.
 [ B g7 ]  [ B d3 ] , [ f5 ]  opening the E file could prove to be deadly for white. 23. [ e x f4 ] [ B g4 ]  [ f x e4 ]  [ B x e4 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ Q f2 ]  [ Q x f2 + ]  [ B x f2 ] , [ R x e4 ]  White loses a bishop.
 [ R b6 ]  [ h4 ] , [ K d7 ]  Alternative variation: 36... [ R b2 + ] 37. R1[ c2 ] [ R x c2 + ] 38. Rx[ c2 ] [ R x a7 ] 39. [ B x c6 ] [ B x c6 ] 40. [ R x c6 ] [ K d7 ] 41. [ R b6 ] [ K c7 ] 42. [ R b3 ] $11
 [ K g3 ]  [ Q x e5 + ]  [ Q f4 ]  [ Q x f4 + ]  [ K x f4 ]  [ K f7 ]  [ K e5 ]  [ K e7 ] , [ g5 ]  this makes things easier though in truth black should win a piece up for two pawns.
 [ R x e8 + ] , [ R x e8 ]  Although I enjoy even exchanges I learned an important fact about them in this game. Even exchanges are ok if the player has the same amount or more material then the opponent. However they do not work if the player is "down material". In addition he threatens to play a fork between my king and rook with [ R e1 + ] due to the exchange. If this happens he will win a free rook with [ R x a1 ] but I am not about to let that happen.
 [ Q d4 ] , [ Q x d4 ]  White seemed to find an escape but black has a winning combo now. I have to admit at this point I only thought I would win the bishop on d2.
 [ K e6 ]  [ Q x h7 ] , [ K x f6 ]  Losing the queen but white would have won easily anyways.
 [ B x f3 ] , [ N x f3 ]  White's DSB now enters the fray.
 [ R d x d4 ] , [ B g8 ]  Aha. Now I lose the [ e6 ] pawn. The only way to make it less stupid I found was...
 [ f6 ] , [ e4 ]  Well I guess white didn't want the extra pawn.
 [ B x e4 ]  [ f x e4 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ K h2 ] , [ N f2 ]  The point. White cannot save his rook without allowing ..[ N g4 ] forking the queen.
 [ B g7 ] , [ R e1 ]  Now I start to develop a rook...
 [ B h4 ] , [ R f4 ]  nice guarding but the rook has many ideas
 [ f x e4 ]  [ d x e4 ] , [ N f6 ]  So far as GK has foreseen but now...
 [ N f6 ] , [ B e5 ]  Now B-[ K5 ] is a pinning mate threat. The Rook is tethered to the KB file.
 [ R g3 ] , [ f5 ]  Can't take exposing mate on my g7. [ f5 ] protects the Bishop and allows the Queen to defend
 [ e6 ]  [ f4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N e7 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N f5 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ c3 ] , [ N c6 ]  ...black is developing well..White is looking to set up a clamp position on the dark squares and push kingside...
 [ N x f6 ]  [ g x f3 ] , [ e x f3 ]  White is down a pawn but his bishop on [ c4 ] is very strong compared to Black's knight on f6. Note that both players have weak kingside structures.
 [ B a8 ]  [ B h3 ] , [ d5 ]  So both sides have fulfilled what was planned: White has finished the development and Black has played d6-d5. Though generally speaking there was such an opportunity and it was possible to play [ R h e1 ] but that would have been another game. I tried to systematically fulfill the plan that I expected to end in a sacrifice. The move 24.[ R x d4 ] was already clear in my mind though I had not yet realized the possibility of a draw by repetition of moves. I just saw the outline of an attack.
 [ B c5 ] , [ O-O ]  White castles to get his King into safety.
 [ B c4 + ]  [ K h8 ]  [ Q d1 ] , [ N d7 ]  Finally this knight joins the party and not a moment too late.
 [ d x e5 ] , [ c3 ]  Begone foul beast!
 [ B x h7 + ]  [ K h8 ]  [ Q h5 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ B x f6 ]  Black resigned...the Colle allows one to learn how to attack with little risk.
 [ B x c4 ]  [ R e b8 ]  [ Q d3 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ B x d5 ]  [ B x d5 ]  [ Q x d5 ] , [ N f6 ]  In times like this i think simplify
 [ e x d4 ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ Q x e7 + ]  [ B x e7 ]  [ N c e2 ]  [ O-O ] , [ B x d4 ]  I missed this here.
 [ e4 ]  [ K e3 ]  [ K e5 ]  [ B d4 + ]  [ K d5 ] , [ h5 ]  My only hope is to go for the queen.
 [ f4 ]  [ Q e2 ] , [ R g3 ]  White simply resigned. There is not defense since black takes on [ f3 ] with the bishop then the [ h3 ] pawn will fall. A good effort from my opponent.
 [ R e3 ] , [ Q f1 ]  Offering a hopeful exchange?
 [ B x c3 + ]  [ N x c3 ] , [ N g8 ]  Once again I overlooked [ N g4 ] fearing the knight would struggle to make it's way back to my side. This was unfounded as Ng4-e3-[ f5 ] is useable although wastes a lot of time with the knight.
 [ Q f6 ]  [ B x g7 ]  [ Q x g7 ] , [ b5 ]  it doesn't matter he can attack the bishop and save even if i moved the bishop he'd move a knight...
 [ c x d4 ]  [ Q x g7 ]  [ R g8 ] , [ Q x h7 ]  9. [ Q x h7 ] - black has neither played [ g6 ] or castled and allowed the WQ to inflict mayhem on his position. It will be interesting to see what counterplay black has to this.
 [ K g1 ]  [ Q h5 ] , [ h4 ]  Blocking the Queen's attack route.
 [ B e3 + ]  [ K h1 ] , [ Q x f1 # ]  
 [ B x d4 ] , [ h3 ]  trying to open up his king for the price of a pawn which i can win back
 [ B x d5 + ]  [ K h8 ]  [ g5 ]  [ N f7 ]  [ h4 ]  [ N b4 ] , [ B c4 ]  i want to keep my strong bishop
 [ h5 ]  [ R e3 ]  [ B d5 ]  [ R d3 ] , [ B e4 ]  These moves do not require comment but I like to have a picture of the board at least every three moves in online annotations.
 [ d x e4 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ f3 ]  This is a typical move of attacking players but considered to be too risky sometime.
 [ N b6 ] , [ b3 ]  27. [ b3 ] - supports the [ c4 ] pawn and stops a knight incursion into a4.
 [ d5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ e4 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ N g5 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ B x f7 + ]  [ K d7 ]  [ Q x g4 + ]  [ N x g4 ]  [ B e6 + ] , [ K c6 ]  8. ..... [ K [ c6 ] ] - Henry does not have the square [ c7 ] at his disposal so he moves to [ c6 ] which was his usual spot in the Annotation Project Pt.1.
 [ R a x d7 ] , [ R h6 ]  Another weak square. White doesn't want to trade off his one remaining piece and hopes he can start something after 39. [ h5 ] but black has other ideas in mind.
 [ B x h6 ]  [ c x b3 ]  [ B x f8 ]  [ K x f8 ] , [ a x b3 ]  And now white has a large advantage. I would say white has a won game here and just needs to avoid a blunder to convert this into a full point. At this juncture I was pretty disillusioned and needed to come up with a plan.
 [ B x f3 ] , [ Q x f3 ]  well I didn't expect this trade so soon but my queen is now active and I'll leave it standing here untill I find the need to move it again. It is in no danger of being attacked on the first 3 moves.
 [ B b4 + ]  [ B d2 ] , [ B x d2 + ]  I didn't really like this move.
 [ e x d5 ]  [ e4 ]  [ R a3 ]  [ e x d3 ]  [ Q x d3 ]  [ R b c4 ]  [ N e2 ]  [ R c4 x c1 + ]  [ B x c1 ] , [ Q e1 + ]  And with these move black can recovery the disadvantage with 33. Kg2/[ h2 ] [ R x c1 ] 34.[ N x c1 ] Qxc1.
 [ B e7 ] , [ B d4 ]  why not trade?
 [ g4 ] , [ O-O ]  The Muzio Gambit. The idea behind it is you sacrifice the knight on [ f3 ] for an explosive assault on f7. Since most players below master level hardly ever encounter this gambit they don't know the correct lines of defense and very soon find themselves in trouble.
 [ R h7 ] , [ N f3 ]  Here I offered a draw again still wondering how my position could be worse. The problem is that I just have so little space and Black can do whatever he wants because White can hardly break out.
 [ Q x d5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ O-O ]  [ Q d6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ Q g6 ] , [ Q e4 ]  I like this move. I also like [ N h4 ] bullying the black queen. (after [ Q d6 ] or [ Q f6 ] Ne4.)
 [ B x d2 ]  [ Q x d2 ] , [ N c3 ]  The added pressure on [ f2 ] won't help now.
 [ K e8 ] , [ R e1 + ]  Moving out my rook for extra support.
 [ c x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ d x c5 ] , [ B x c5 ]  Black's d-pawn is now isolated and can become a target.
 [ B d6 ] , [ b4 ]  18. [ b4 ] - trying to keep those little footmen together.
 [ Q x c4 ] , [ R h5 ]  White sees the trap and clears that diagonal. Black must now be a little careful. White has a powerful attack brewing so before Black can continue his attack he must be sure that he is safe.
 [ Q d2 ] , [ c6 ]  Threatening the completely wipe White out of the centre.
 [ Q e7 ] , [ R x f6 + ]  white wastes no time
 [ B x f6 ]  [ Q x f6 ]  [ N d5 ]  [ Q d6 ]  [ N b6 ]  [ Q x d1 + ]  [ R x d1 ] , [ R b8 ]  Sequence as expected from previous analysis. I absolutely love the knight on [ b6 ] now.
 [ N x d5 + ]  [ B x d5 ]  [ B x a7 ] , [ N f4 ]  Adding pressure on the king's side.
 [ K h6 ] , [ Q x h2 ]  
 [ B d5 ] , [ c4 ]  An in between move that is not really necessary but gains time
 [ R b8 ]  [ B x d5 ] , [ B x g3 ]  A surprise but it keeps the pawns even enterprising. But....
 [ Q g1 + ]  [ K d2 ]  [ Q f2 + ] , [ K c1 ]  Get my king out of their
 [ f6 ]  [ R g7 + ]  [ K f8 ] , [ B d6 # ]  32. [ B d6 ] MATE!! Out of nowhere Janet delivers the coup de grace. I guess I could have kept both my rooks back but then I would have been subjected to a slow passive death. Maybe if you are behind on material going out with as many guns blazing as possible is a lot less depressing.
 [ R e5 ]  [ R f e1 ]  [ B d2 ]  [ R e2 ]  [ B x c3 ] , [ b x c3 ]  20. [ b x c3 ] - but that dreaded exchange which I had been trying to avoid with my 14th move has come to pass.
 [ c x d4 ] , [ R b8 ]  Exploiting the open b-file.
 [ h6 ]  [ Q g5 + ] , [ K h7 ]  no more checks!!
 [ Q g5 ]  [ R a e7 ] , [ h2 ]  I thought he still had a possible game at this point ... one of the lines I thought about reduced this to a Rook-vs-Queen game but with a massive pawn advantage (*and* King support) on the queen side. I was not 100% sure at this point if my lone queen and my remaining pawns could stop it (I should be but was not sure). This is definitely the best chess game I've played so far even if I had lost. See-saw scenarios with nail-biting moves that were reduced to single-tempo advantages.
 [ K b1 ] , [ f5 ]  That's what the purpose was...
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ f5 ]  ?! The key move of the Latvian Gambit. Black gives up a pawn (and usually more) inviting White to trash the Black kingside in exchange for open files and a potential lead in development.
 [ h3 ]  [ b6 ]  [ R d1 ] , [ K g7 ]  34. ...... [ K g7 ] - now Henry must enter the fray!
 [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e4 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ f3 ]  [ e x f3 ] , [ Q x f3 ]  My opponent starts to develop all his pieces very quickly.
 [ Q e7 ] , [ Q h5 ]  [ Q x e4 ] 8.[ N e2 ] Black has no answer to [ Q f7 ] or [ Q x a5 ]  [ Q g3 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ O-O ]  [ g5 ]  [ f4 ]  [ B b6 + ]  [ N d4 ]  [ O-O-O ]  [ K h1 ]  [ N x c4 ]  [ N x c4 ]  [ B x d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ Q x e4 ] , [ R a c1 ]  Setting a trap by threating the [ d6 ] pawn since the [ c7 ] pawn will be pin to the King.
 [ Q g6 + ]  [ K h1 ]  [ R x h3 ]  [ Q a2 + ]  [ K f8 ] , [ Q d2 ]  36. ... [ B d6 ] pinning his R and threatening [ R x h2 # ] (if he moves his R away) was powerful next. Note that if he tries [ R g5 ] you have mate in 3 (I'll leave that for you to find). Now that I look at it a bit longer another possibility is a rook sac: RxN KxR and then [ B d6 ] locks his R in place. If he tries to check you with his Q he'll lose the R outright. His best move (which he may not find) seems to be [ f4 ] and then you win the exchange back. Then after [ Q e5 + ] you can win his e-pawn and then it's 5 pawns for you to 1 one pawn for him. Unfortunately if he plays right he can win your c and then a pawns but that's a big "if" and you'd still have a pretty straight forward win. I think I like the first option above better. The 2d clears all the minor pieces--something you want to do when you're 3 pawns up--but the 1st choice should simply win the exchange and then you're 5 points ahead.
 [ B f3 ] , [ N d7 ]  This move is questionable. The standard plan in the hedgehog is to play ...[ g6 ] and ...Bg7. Now my attack races forward.
 [ K f7 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ R d8 ]  [ R e7 + ]  [ K g8 ]  [ R c7 ]  [ R d4 ]  [ R x c6 ] , [ R x b4 ]  White exchanges a pair of Q-side Pawns simplifying the game but not making any progress.
 [ N c5 ]  [ B d6 ] , [ N e4 + ]  Not falling for the trick! 42.[ N x a6 ] [ B c7 ] and the knight is trapped
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e3 ]  [ h5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ a5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ Q d7 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ c6 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ b5 ]  [ e4 ] , [ b4 ]  Typical opening so far. At this point I kind of made a blunder with my knight; I should have put it on [ d2 ] but instead I moved it back into its original position making it harder to keep it in play later. (though as it turns out I never actually need it)
 [ N c6 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ O-O ] , [ B c4 ]  Both sides continue their development. 9 [ B c4 ] also prevents the liberating [ d5 ] thrust by black and its influence on the a2-[ g8 ] diagonal can be powerful.
 [ R d7 ] , [ g3 ]  this move may look silly but i wanted to make the advantage clear. i was uneasy about the number of pieces (even less important ones) black had on the board. hence i thought about trading my h rook and a pawn for the bishop and the knight on e5. materially exactly equal and changing whites position very little except to advance my f and g pawns. black cannot move the e knight or else the queen takes the rook on d7. whereas black's position is further weakend as the [ a6 ] pawn is now unprotected and attacked.
 [ N e3 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ R g2 + ]  [ K h1 ]  [ N c2 ]  [ R d1 ]  [ N e3 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ N c2 ]  [ R c1 ]  [ R d2 ]  [ K g1 ]  [ R x b2 ]  [ N b1 ] , [ c6 ]  Why didn't I notice he was attacking the rook?!
 [ d3 ] , [ B e3 ]  Over defending the weak point but the question is whether I can break through somewhere else? I think he'd thought about taking the knight enough for one game but check 'Move List' to see what would have happened... Alternative variation: 22.Rxh5!? Nd4! [ Now trouble emerges from elsewhere... I kind of doubt that he wanted to face this type of attack from the knight... ]
 [ K c5 ]  [ K d7 ]  [ K b6 ] , [ K c8 ]  The King is bound for the protection of the backward [ c7 ] pawn.
 [ K c5 ] , [ K d3 ]  looks like a draw now would you say?
 [ B b5 + ]  [ B d7 ]  [ B x d7 + ] , [ K x d7 ]  well i can't castle now i wasn't really gonna to anyways.
 [ f x e3 ]  [ K f7 ]  [ R d1 ] , [ K e7 ]  Keeping the rook in check
 [ B c2 + ]  [ K e2 ]  [ B x f5 ]  [ K x f2 ]  [ B x g4 ]  [ K x g3 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ K f4 ] , [ K c3 ]  !? White sp in the hope that he might be able to force a win.urned the opportunity to force a draw by 57. [ B x b5 ] leaving me with insufficient mating material
 [ B x f6 ]  [ B x f6 ] , [ R x d6 ]  18. [ R x d6 ] - as a result of the overload combo I have won a pawn.
 [ K h6 ] , [ b4 ]  White could also play 36. [ Q g3 ] to save the pawn on [ g2 ] and defend against checkmate by the Black queen on e1.
 [ R x c5 ]  [ h4 ]  [ R c4 ]  [ f3 ]  [ R d4 ]  [ R c7 ]  [ R d3 ]  [ R c3 ]  [ R d2 + ]  [ R c2 ] , [ R d3 ]  Is Bobby going to give me a draw by repetition? He was still playing five or six others.
 [ N x g2 ]  [ B h5 + ] , [ K d7 ]  My escape route as planned. My K will become exposed but he has an escape route...
 [ N g4 ] , [ R x f8 + ]  Cutting the opposition Rook is apparently an advantage but remember that a Knight is missing!
 [ N e5 ]  [ B x e5 ]  [ d x e5 ] , [ Q f7 ]  Now this is interesting. Second time when I sat down and calculated different options after ambitious (and as it turned out after calculations - winning) 22. Q:d3. Decision taken.
 [ f x e4 ]  [ N x e4 ] , [ N x e4 ]  19...[ Q x e4 ] was not possible due to 20.[ Q g4 ] winning material.
 [ K x b6 ]  [ K d5 ]  [ a4 ]  [ e4 ]  [ a5 ]  [ e3 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d3 ]  [ a6 ]  [ d2 ]  [ a7 ]  [ d1 = Q ] , [ a8 = Q + ]  Bad luck I happen to be right where I don't want to be.
 [ K x f7 ]  [ B c4 + ] , [ d5 ]  If I'm going to survive the attack I have to develop quickly which is why I preferred this to 7 ... [ K e8 ] this gives back a pawn but since the one on [ g4 ] would have been dropping anyway I'm not really losing out.
 [ K e6 ] , [ Q x e8 + ]  the player can force a queen swap here by moving the bishop in the way
 [ N f6 ] , [ N c3 ]  12. [ N c3 ] - hmm in retrospect maybe instead of following the knights before bishops mantra it would have been better to have played [ B e3 ] followed by [ N d2 ] and then my rooks would have a clear communication on the back row and Henry would have been shielded on e2. Do you the Inquest Jury agree?
 [ R h6 ]  [ R h1 ]  [ h4 ]  [ K e2 ]  [ g5 ] , [ R g1 ]  things are going wrong from here...
 [ N c4 ] , [ B a6 ]  I line up the knight with the bishop...
 [ B d6 ] , [ N d8 ]  34. Nd8! - ..... it looks like I am about to lose a pawn ....
 [ e5 ]  [ Q e4 + ]  [ K h5 ] , [ a3 ]  the pawn continues its march
 [ c x d4 ]  [ B x d4 ] , [ N g x e5 ]  14 ...Ngxe5? My move totally neglects the obvious: castle dammit!!! In spite of my own passive play White has permitted me to free up my position while leaving me some weaknesses to exploit. But instead of playing the strong 14... [ B c5 ] or even 14 ...[ R c8 ] I ignore sound principles and greedily snatch a "free" pawn.
 [ c4 ]  [ N g e7 ] , [ N c3 ]  he wants [ d5 ]  [ B x e7 ]  [ B x e7 ]  [ Q d2 ] , [ B b4 ]  re-pinning the knight and the queen.
 [ K x f2 ]  [ g4 ] , [ K f1 ]  70. [ K f1 ] then resigns - my alarm clock goes off I log in at about 645 BST on Monday morning. I am greeted by a white flag from my opponent as he cannot stop the g pawn from crowning and then proceeding to play a deadly game of kiss chase with the white king! Wheeew what a relief!!
 [ B d7 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ N d8 ] , [ Q b1 ]  I decided to try exchanging queens in the hope that I could undouble my pawns
 [ d x e5 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ N x e5 ] , [ B x e5 ]  White has set up a little trap: it won't work...
 [ R f4 ]  [ h5 ]  [ e x d6 ]  [ B x d6 ]  [ e5 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ N e4 ] , [ B f2 ]  This move took me by surprise as I didn't see the bishop's shield allowing the instant 24...Qxh2#. My mind blanked here and I actually thought I'd lost the game over this stupid oversight. I texted my opponent and congratulated him on the awesome move. I told him I'd need a few days to calculate some variations.
 [ f3 ] , [ c5 ]  Silly move from white.
 [ Q b2 + ]  [ N e2 ]  [ d2 ] , [ N c3 ]  this seems to defend [ d1 ] but the pawn promotes with check!
 [ Q e8 ]  [ B h2 ] , [ c5 ]  A total mistake here. I wronfully thought the [ b6 ] [ c5 ] plan would just be inverted. Let's see next move why.
 [ N x e4 ]  [ Q d3 ]  [ d5 ] , [ N d4 ]  Threatening queen with LSB
 [ N c3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ d3 ]  I want to take initiative early and I go into offensive mode early.
 [ B e5 ]  [ B f4 ] , [ B x c3 ]  I missed this!! Watch closely you will see what I mean.
 [ N e7 ] , [ R g5 ]  Here [ f6 ] is impossible due to the pin.
 [ N f5 ]  [ B f2 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ b3 ]  [ b5 ] , [ Q c2 ]  White finished development...
 [ N d6 ] , [ K d2 ]  Attacking [ b5 ] and keeping the bishop from [ e8 ] and f5. The bishop is now reduced to protection of b5.
 [ f7 + ]  [ K f8 ] , [ Q e3 ]  My plan is 25. [ B h6 + ] [ R x h6 ] 26. [ Q x h6 + ] and eventually get back to [ e5 ] where I will force the exchange of queens to simplify to a easy won endgame
 [ d6 ] , [ O-O ]  3. ... d6?! is the Old Steinitz Defense not a popular line these days with most masters preferring to defer [ d6 ] by playing 3. ... [ a6 ] first. The move as played is acceptable and many famous champions (including Steinitz of course) played it but it gives up the center to white and more modern analysis of the Ruy Lopez has found better lines for black.
 [ B x f1 ]  [ R x f1 ] , [ B d6 ]  Still attacking the knight.
 [ b4 ]  [ a6 ]  [ B b2 ]  [ f6 ]  [ a3 ]  [ Q e7 ] , [ c4 ]  I try to develop the left pawns in this way ( like i always do)
 [ R d h8 ] , [ B e7 ]  Another bone head move by me...I really must slow down when playing OTB.
 [ B x e4 ] , [ N x g6 ]  Threatening the rook at [ h8 ] and a checkmate at e7.
 [ K g7 ]  [ R f c6 ] , [ b4 ]  A serious mistake allowing me to remove Black's lone passed Pawn. The material and positional advantage gained should now decide the game in my favor.
 [ Q h5 ]  [ R g6 g3 ]  [ B f5 ] , [ Q e2 ]  Preparing for a discovered attack
 [ g5 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ B d5 ]  [ N c e5 ] , [ Q f2 ]  At this point Judit has about 49 minutes while Gregory has about 39 minutes.
 [ Q x d4 ] , [ c x d4 ]  Now I have a powerful passed Q pawn and with the Queens gone the endgame has been reached.
 [ Q e6 + ]  [ B e7 ] , [ Q x e7 # ]  Overall perrinn played extremely well. In fact about 150 points north of his rating so like an 1100 rated player. But the morals as I told him are to expect that your opponent will find the best move and not make any assumptions ask yourself if there is a threat like checkmate or lost of material and how by doing HW with Analyze the Board which btw is why teachers will often give those HW assignments because it's good practice. In addition this is also the reason that why is the most common chess question. It's about theory because that's where you analyze what move works or doesn't and why such as what I noted about the threats. To look at everything and study the position very carefully the same way as you evaluate the threats so part of the same thing. When you find a good move look for something better. Also when evaluating and you have plans remembering that your opponents plans are just as important as your own. Last but not least when you have an opportunity like getting a piece back as it was with the B early take advantage of it while it's around. That's because opportunites don't last that long and if you don't take advantage early you might wind up in trouble. @perrinn: You're rating will improve before you know it but if you can remember these morals I think your rating will reach 1100 in about 6 months.
 [ R x c6 + ]  [ K f7 ]  [ R c c8 ]  [ g1 = Q ]  [ R d f8 + ]  [ K g6 ]  [ R c6 + ] , [ K h7 ]  End of checks and the game one I deserved to lose but... it was funny to walk over the edge all the time just to see the king walk all over the board... to win. A last note: when you play RTC (real time chess) don't trust ratings such as "500" or so... they are normally not "true".
 [ e4 ] , [ e6 ]  This was no surprise although I'd never seen Andy faced with 1.[ e4 ] I did find some of his [ d4 ] games online and he tries to steer them into French Defence lines. I did manage to do a little prep on the KIA ahead of this game. As I play the French myself I don't like to go into main lines as white.
 [ N d2 ] , [ e6 ]  White enables Queenside castling but the Knight contributes little it does attack [ e5 ] but does not help defend the King. [ N c3 ] is better White could retreat their Bishop to [ c8 ] and look for Kingside play or look to move to [ a3 ] once it is safe.
 [ N f6 ] , [ N f3 ]  I usually play [ c4 ] here but I hoping I could get myself in a Colle system
 [ R c8 ]  [ g3 ] , [ Q g5 ]  '?' A blunder in a bad position. Black underestimates the strength of Bh3. Much better was Qg5/[ Q h5 ] preventing the immediate development of this piece.
 [ R x e6 ] , [ R x e6 ]  of the Bishop...
 [ c3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B g2 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N g e7 ] , [ c x d4 ]  Time to open things up.
 [ B e3 ] , [ R f8 ]  Black cannot castle king's side.
 [ f x g6 ] , [ Q x g6 + ]  now he's in a hurt lock and there's no escape
 [ e6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N f6 ]  [ h3 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ Q e7 ]  [ N a3 ]  [ a6 ]  [ B g3 ]  [ O-O ] , [ N f3 ]  White "unwastes" his previous sortie. Well not. Better was 12. [ f4 ] first grabbing space.
 [ Q h5 + ]  [ K e7 ] , [ d6 # ]  
 [ B a6 ]  [ f4 ]  [ b4 ]  [ f x e5 ]  [ B x d3 ] , [ e x f6 ]  I'm using this pawn as an attacker; it's now accounted for two and I see a potential opening here...
 [ N c6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ B g4 ] , [ B e3 ]  [ B e3 ] gives more protection for the center pawn if my opponent decides BXN.
 [ Q d3 ]  [ Q x f4 ]  [ R h g8 ] , [ R a e1 ]  Black is now down a knight and a pawn but at least he has open files aimed at white's king if he can exploit them. One threat now is 22. ... [ B g5 ] which would win the white bishop on [ e3 ] and moving the bishop means losing the knight on [ d2 ] so white defends the bishop.
 [ R e4 ] , [ h4 ]  26. [ h4 ] - that [ e4 ] rook is trying to spoil the party. I proceed with my attack. I dream of a windmill you know that starts with [ R x g7 + ] and the king is forced to [ h8 ] where a series of discoveries will net oodles of material!
 [ Q h8 + ] , [ Q g8 ]  Black can do that only once
 [ K e7 ] , [ Q a4 ]  ? Threatening [ c6 ] slightly but the Queen can be easily repelled and this doesn't do much for the attack. Furthermore it leaves the King as the only defender of e2.
 [ c x b3 ]  [ c6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ O-O ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ Q x e4 ] , [ B f5 ]  Black forces the white queen to retreat.
 [ R x e1 ] , [ R b1 ]  (??) In my view a terrible misjudgement. Black had at all costs if he wanted to preserve his winning chances to keep his rook on the board. In view of the equalising threat of 27.Re7ch etc Black had pretty much to play 26...Be6.
 [ B x f3 ] , [ R c7 ]  A rook lift to protect the vulnerable bishop on b7.
 [ N d7 ] , [ B g2 ]  Mistake. It menaces a further [ e4 ] but doesn't prevent black's counterattack on [ g5 ]  [ h x g5 ] , [ h5 ]  Mistake white should have taken the pawn. Now black will have it for free.
 [ d6 ] , [ N f3 ]  Again I struggled against playing against c4. I'm a bit too aggressive and I'm attempting to learn to play positionally. So I avoided the [ c4 ] and [ f4 ] line
 [ K f1 ] , [ Q f7 ]  An exposed king does not look good for me. I began to wonder if I still had a chance to pull out the win.
 [ R a6 ]  [ B b2 ]  [ B x c4 ] , [ b x c4 ]  Alternative variation: 33. [ R x c4 ] [ R x a2 ] 34. [ R f2 ] [ R a5 ] $19
 [ B e7 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ] , [ a6 ]  This move happens in all Sicilians. This protects the deadly [ N [ b5 ] ] if ever going to pose a threat and revs up a [ b5 ] push sometime as the goal is to attack on the queen-side.
 [ B f2 ]  [ B x f2 ] , [ R x f2 ]  The exchange went as I wanted it to go but by now black possesses a whole lot of space of the board !
 [ N h3 ]  [ N e2 ]  [ N f2 ] , [ N g1 ]  
 [ N e3 ]  [ Q h6 ]  [ N g4 ]  [ Q g5 ]  [ Q d1 ]  [ a6 ]  [ b4 ] , [ B b6 ]  aiming the dsb at the white king I am hoping it get it into the hole at [ d4 ] where it will be very difficult to extract
 [ Q b3 ]  [ B f7 ]  [ R c6 ] , [ B g6 ]  Again no need to take on [ c4 ] right awayor else white might still be able to generate a counter attack by striking at the a or c pawn.
 [ d5 ] , [ c5 ]  Not the best move as it looks like it could create something of a hole in White's formation but White evidently is willing to risk that if given a piece in return. He calculates that there is little to fear from Black's very defensive position here.
 [ B x d5 ]  [ Q g4 ]  [ h5 ]  [ Q h3 ]  [ K g7 ]  [ R g3 ]  [ K h6 ] , [ R g5 ]  To not allow [ g5 ] and to close Black Queen e7-[ h4 ] diagonal. At the same time to open place for [ g4 ]  [ R f g8 ] , [ Q h4 ]  A little trap for the black queen but my opponent revealed it...
 [ N x e4 ]  [ R x e4 ] , [ B f6 ]  Once again the f-pawn is prevented from advancing.
 [ K e7 ] , [ Q g5 + ]  This came as a minor surprise: I was expecting [ Q g4 ] at once. What the check does is bring the Black King closer to the centre and that had a bearing on the game as it happened. I did consider playing 20...[ f6 ] but took what I thought to be the simpler course.
 [ e5 ] , [ f4 ]  ...following through King's Gambit.
 [ R a5 ]  [ R f6 + ] , [ K g5 ]  The only way out of the checks.
 [ Q x e5 ]  [ d x e5 ] , [ R x d2 ]  16. .............. [ R x d2 ] - not only has white lost a piece but just look where my rook is. The squeeze is on!
 [ Q a5 ] , [ R g3 ]  pinning the [ g7 ] pawn
 [ K h5 ]  [ a7 ] , [ Q e2 + ]  An unnecessary check that uncovers the queening square (g1).
 [ R x e1 ]  [ Q d8 + ]  [ B f8 ]  [ N x e1 ]  [ B d5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ Q b8 ]  [ b5 ]  [ h4 ]  [ h5 ] , [ N e5 ]  only speeding up the process but this is lost anyway; tougher is [ K h3 ] [ N f2 + ] Kg3...
 [ N d5 ] , [ Q x d2 ]  Guess [ Q d8 ] would be better but honestly I didn't even consider it during the game.
 [ Q c2 ] , [ R e8 ]  Pretty dull for a Rook to be tied down to defending a Pawn. Perhaps better was to give up the threat on [ e4 ] and re-route the [ f6 ] Knight via [ e8 ] or d7.
 [ Q f2 ]  [ B d7 ] , [ e5 ]  Start going forward in the center.
 [ N e3 ]  [ N c5 ]  [ R d8 ]  [ R d3 ]  [ N c4 ]  [ d7 ]  [ N b6 ] , [ R e3 ]  That pawn is untouchable because of mate on back rank but also must be taken because [ R e8 ] is mate after queening on [ e8 ]  [ N x d7 ]  [ N x d7 ]  [ K g8 ]  [ N f6 + ]  [ K f7 ]  [ N g4 ]  [ R d5 ] , [ N e5 + ]  And black resigns. They are losing another pawn (or two) giving white a passer. The pawn on [ h6 ] is still annoying and if white ever wins the [ h7 ] pawn is close to queening. This position is so hard because there really isn't counterplay. Just sit around and hope for a mistake. Thanks for reading. I really enjoying playing this game and thought I was totally winning somewhere around the sacrifice but missing [ d x e5 ] meant I really had to try. Both my opponent and I made some mistakes in the midgame but it was hard fought and I thought we both fought back as well as well could.
 [ g x h6 ]  [ Q g4 + ]  [ K h8 ] , [ Q x d7 ]  Now Keres' Pawn plus is virtually nullified by his horrible Pawn structure. He has TWO sets of doubled isolated Pawns.
 [ K g1 ]  [ B x a1 ]  [ R x a1 ] , [ R d f8 ]  Moving the other Rook would let you recapture on [ d8 ] which is a better square for the remaining Rook. A small subtle thing to think about.
 [ N c6 + ]  [ K f5 ]  [ N x a7 ]  [ f x g3 ]  [ f x g3 ]  [ B e5 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ B x g3 ]  Got it again but now his knight is in play rather than chasing down an errant awn on the other side of the board. If he grabs my pawn it doesn't matter whether he loses the knight a forced mate is out (there is an unforced mate but this opponent is waaaayyyyy to competitive to co-operate)
 [ b6 ] , [ Q a3 ]  Not [ Q x d4 ] because of [ B a4 ] winning the exchange. Here [ a7 ] is threatened.
 [ g3 ]  [ O-O ] , [ B g2 ]  Applying further pressure to the advanced Pawn.
 [ h x g5 ]  [ f x g5 ]  [ N e5 ] , [ Q h5 ]  22. Now W threatens a rook lift to [ h3 ] in a move or two...how is B going to counter this...not so easy to see how. B's pawn at [ e6 ] impedes his K-side defense and W owns the g5...[ d8 ] small diagonal...so B's defensive options are meager
 [ K d6 ]  [ K e8 ]  [ c7 ]  [ K f8 ] , [ c8 = Q # ]  A good win by id=chicoboy against opposition rated over 100 ELO ahead of him. Once having gained the upper hand he was always in control and never once looked as though he would let the game slip. His opponent did her best to set him problems to solve but lacked the resources to put serious obstacles in his path. Beginners and early level players might find this game worth playing through just to observe the technique of 'winning the win'.
 [ N c3 ] , [ a6 ]  I don't want that knight coming down to b5. I'm constrained enough as it is.
 [ d x e5 ]  [ B x e6 ] , [ f x e6 ]  Look at his poor isolated doubled e pawns easy to pick off.
 [ K d4 ]  [ Q f2 + ]  [ K d5 ]  [ Q f7 + ] , [ K e5 ]  ?? White's best chance was 74. [ K c6 ] [ R c1 ] 75. [ R c4 ] [ Q f6 ] 76. [ K b7 ] RxR 77. dxR
 [ R d f1 ]  [ R f8 ]  [ Q f2 ] , [ B c8 ]  this was a surprise. Why not Kg7? of course I could eat [ d4 ] but it was a weak pawn anyway and less necessary at first sight. Maybe black was already planning to "pass" this pawn after eating [ d3 ]  [ R x f6 ]  [ Q x f6 ] , [ Q x f6 ]  Is there any other possibility?
 [ K d4 ]  [ K d7 ] , [ K x e4 ]  ...which he does. We both have six pawns apiece with mine all being connected to one another and my opponent having one isolated and weak and a potential target.
 [ R b5 ]  [ K d3 ]  [ B x b4 ]  [ R x b4 ]  [ R b5 x b4 ]  [ N x b4 ]  [ R b3 + ]  [ K e2 ]  [ R x b4 ] , [ R g3 + ]  Alternative variation: 47. [ R d3 ] [ f5 ] $17
 [ B x b5 ] , [ a x b5 ]  The loss of the bishop is crucial since nothing it was threatening my Rook at e8.
 [ d3 ]  [ B e7 ] , [ f4 ]  i like my opponent his aggressive!! i am aggressive this gonna be a jam!!
 [ B x a7 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ R e1 ] , [ N g4 + ]  this is a careless transposition. 21 ... [ Q h6 + ] first was right leading to a win of the exchange as in the game.
 [ Q c7 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ R d8 ]  [ N h2 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ] , [ c x d4 ]  Artificially isolating the White KP.
 [ Q x c7 ] , [ N x c7 ]  If I recapture with my bishop then there is a nasty discovered check with [ N x f6 + ] which picks up my knight on [ d5 ] next move.
 [ B d3 ]  [ N d6 ]  [ a5 ]  [ B x a5 ]  [ g x f6 ]  [ g x f6 ]  [ K g6 ]  [ B d8 ] , [ K h7 ]  So Carlsen gave up his last pawn on the Queenside to fulfill his objective. Now he is banking on his h pawn while putting pressure on the [ f6 ] pawn forcing Black to use a piece to guard it.
 [ B x h7 + ] , [ K f8 ]  With [ K h8 ] I only win a pawn and then I have to spend another tempo backing the Bishop out before [ g6 ] is played. So it would go 13....[ K h8 ] 14.[ N x d7 ] [ Q x d7 ] 15.Bf5! with the pawns still good for me. 14.[ g4 ] would work very nicely too.
 [ N c5 ] , [ Q d4 ]  A move to free my queen.
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N g5 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ N x f7 ]  [ B x f2 + ] , [ K f1 ]  6. [ K f1 ] - this has been my stock move of the tournament and has yielded mixed results for me.
 [ g x f6 ]  [ N x b3 ]  [ R x b3 ] , [ N h6 ]  (EZB) With a terrible mating threat by R-N8. If ...R-[ K1 ] N-[ B7 ] mate. Two white squares are defenceless because the Bishop has gone... The Black king denuded of pieces is defenceless... The game is lost because Black lacks the help of his Bishop. If he had captured the QNP with his *Rook* giving up the Exchange he would have preserved his Bishop which was so essential to the defence and the two united passed pawns supported by the Bishop would have been more than a match for the Rook. Black had this tactical opportunity and failed to take it. Either he did not see it or he underestimated the dangers of the situation or he lacked the pluck to make the sacrifice. White by contrast did not hesitate to sacrifice a whole Knight. Black did not lose because of a faulty conception; his tactical failure in its execution was his downfall.
 [ R c6 ] , [ R d1 ]  Ready for Qe8!
 [ R f e1 ]  [ R e8 ] , [ e4 ]  And black resigned here. He cant avoid losing a piece. If the bishop moves then [ e5 ] with a pawn fork.
 [ N e5 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ B d6 ] , [ d4 ]  I missed the impact of this move. It holds the central tension and begins the pressure on the advanced f pawn.
 [ R f d8 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N e5 ] , [ N b5 ]  maybe 15.[ f4 ] was better move because if black played 15..Nc4.16.Bxc4-Qxc5.17.Bxc5-Nxc4.18.e5-Nxb2.19.[ R d4 ] and the black knight in trouble.
 [ Q c2 ] , [ b5 ]  Now he will take advantage of my bad plan by attacking my Qside so I have to do something. "When attack comes from the flank answer with an attack on the center". This is a hice rule that is whorthy to take into account and here it suits perfectly.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ] , [ N f3 ]  He plays something I'm used to.
 [ B d6 ]  [ h3 ]  [ R c8 ] , [ Q b1 ]  16. [ Q b1 ] - I decided to keep Glenda on the b1-[ h7 ] diagonal but I thought it wise to move her out of the line of the rook on c8.
 [ Q f7 ] , [ Q h6 ]  Instead Tom thing thinks that mate is threatened. But I kept in mind that it isn't due to my [ f6 ] pawn.
 [ B b3 ] , [ b5 ]  
 [ e x d5 ] , [ N d4 ]  We can now see one of the points of the variation. Black has almost completed his development while white is hardly out of the blocks.
 [ d5 ]  [ c4 ]  [ c6 ] , [ N c3 ]  I was a little surprised to see this played now as I had expected 3.[ N f3 ] But I have learned to expect the unexpected. Might not be the right approach but the idea is not to be taken off guard by things that you're not used to because as Ken taught openings can be intense.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ a6 ]  [ B x c6 ]  [ d x c6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ e x d4 ] , [ Q x d4 ]  The character of the position is now clear. White has acquired a K-side pawn majority and left Black with a Q-side one that is badly disrupted by the doubled Pawns. Black however has the Bishop-pair which could be put to good use in this open position.
 [ e x f5 ]  [ B x f5 ]  [ B c8 ]  [ B x c8 ]  [ Q x c8 ] , [ N c3 ]  Morphyb agaqin attacks with gain of time by also attacking the [ d5 ] pawn. Note how White develops with free-and-easy moveswhich are most effective.Black on the otherhand has to resort to tortuous maneuvers which really accomplish almost nothing. In one sense Black has already lost because of his lack of development and because he will not be able to make up for this later on.
 [ d5 ] , [ e3 ]  Starts to build a line
 [ h3 ]  [ B h5 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ N x e5 ] , [ B x e5 ]  10. [ B x e5 ] - knight trade.
 [ B c2 ]  [ g3 ]  [ f x g3 ]  [ B x g3 ]  [ N x g3 ]  [ R x g3 + ]  [ K h1 ] , [ B g4 ]  a nice finish and White has to sacrifice his Queen because of 29. ... Bf3.
 [ R g8 ] , [ N d2 ]  Probably is looking at moving [ B f3 ] to sure up his king-side defenses.
 [ Q c2 ] , [ c6 ]  The knight seems to be doing useful work on a5! Also playable was ...[ c5 ] which would have led to a whole different sort of game. At this point I will allow Alexandr Kotov [AK] and Ray Keene [RK] take up much of the story as given in Barden Hartston and Keene's "The King's Indian Defence" Batsford 1969/1973.
 [ N a5 ] , [ c3 ]  Defends the bishop on [ b3 ] so I don't end up doubling pawns if black captures him. I welcome any exchange of pieces that doesn't create disadvantages in my pawn structure.
 [ B b2 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ Q e7 ] , [ f3 ]  12. [ f3 ] - presumably to stop a black knight landing on [ [ e4 ] ] later on. Another possibility is to prepare [ [ e4 ] ] for himself undermining Freddy's centre.
 [ d5 ]  [ R f3 ] , [ e4 ]  I'm now hoping to trap the light squared Bishop behind my pawn wall so that I can move forward down the Queenside
 [ R a f8 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ d x e4 ] , [ f3 ]  This was my critical defensive idea I was going to keep the f-file closed the best I could.
 [ B e2 ] , [ d x e3 ]  I know he's going to castle so I need to weaken his structure since I have more pieces advanced here I feel like I'm in a good position.
 [ B c5 ]  [ d3 ] , [ d6 ]  So far both sides aquired symmetry. Nothing new here...
 [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ] , [ c5 ]  The modern benoni The point of blacks thrust is to lure white to [ d5 ] and create a pawn imbalance on the opposite board. The disadvantage is that white usually has a slightly better game because of the enduring space advantage in the centre. As a side note I do not recommend playing ...C5 right away. It is good to keep white guessing with ...e6. This allows you to transpose quickly into king indain lines if you feel things are not right to play the benoni.
 [ N e5 ]  [ d5 ]  [ Q f3 ] , [ f6 ]  Forced. We can see how simple lack of development turned from a passive game to a disaster.
 [ N g5 ] , [ e x d3 ]  Black has gotten too greedy and shall be punished with the full force of the Grand Prix!!!
 [ e x f4 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ d5 ]  ?! 0.00/30 (3... [ g5 ] -0.37/26 4. [ h4 ] [ g4 ] 5. [ N e5 ] [ Q e7 ] 6. [ d4 ] [ d6 ] 7. Nx[ g4 ] [ Q x e4 + ] 8. [ Q e2 ] [ Q e7 ] 9. [ Q x e7 + ] [ B x e7 ] 10. [ B e2 ] [ N c6 ] 11. [ c3 ] [ f5 ] 12. [ N f2 ] [ N f6 ] 13. [ B x f4 ] [ R g8 ] 14. B[ g5 ] [ B e6 ] 15. [ N d2 ] O-O-O 16. O-O [ K b8 ] 17. [ R f e1 ] [ N d5 ] 18. [ B c4 ] Bx[ g5 ] )
 [ K g2 ]  [ R f e8 ] , [ g5 ]  i did saw the fork coming...so i fall into the trap
 [ B d2 ] , [ B d6 ]  Attacking the Knight and aiming for the pawn on h2.
 [ K d7 ] , [ N e5 + ]  Fits like a lock and key
 [ N d6 ]  [ e4 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ B x d6 ]  [ e x d6 ]  [ a4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ a5 ]  [ R c a8 ]  [ R c a1 ]  [ R f b8 ]  [ R d b1 ]  [ c3 ]  [ b6 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ f x e4 ]  [ B c4 ] , [ K f2 ]  I did consider 31. [ R c1 ] but I didn't much like 31. [ R c1 ] [ B d3 ] 32. [ R x c3 ] [ B x e4 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ R b e1 ]  [ c2 ]  [ K e3 ]  [ B a6 ]  [ R e c1 ]  [ R b c8 ] , [ R a3 ]  35. [ R a2 ] is probably better with hindsight. I was worried about 35...[ B d3 ] but it's not a serious problem because 36.[ b7 ] has the rooks forked.
 [ O-O ] , [ O-O ]  Before the action both players secure their kings' positions.
 [ B f7 ]  [ g4 ]  [ R f h8 ]  [ g5 ]  [ B g8 ]  [ Q x h8 ]  [ B f7 ]  [ Q f6 ]  [ B g8 ]  [ Q x d6 ]  [ R b8 ]  [ Q x c5 + ]  [ K a8 ]  [ g6 ]  [ B a2 ]  [ e5 ]  [ R d8 ]  [ B e4 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ R b8 ]  [ h7 ]  [ B g8 ] , [ h8 = Q ]  
 [ N f6 ] , [ K h1 ]  Making room for the rook to fullfill a GP: Control open or half open files.
 [ O-O ]  [ B d3 ] , [ N b4 ]  I didn't consider this move.
 [ B b3 ] , [ B g7 ]  that move I regret.
 [ B f8 ] , [ R e1 ]  Opposing the black rook and preparing for a possible rook lift and swing to the kingside.
 [ R x d1 + ]  [ R x d1 ]  [ N x e4 ] , [ f x e4 ]  Now the rook penetration is guarded by my pieces... provided they don't move!!!!!! What a nasty lock! And my own pawns block my dsb.
 [ Q x e4 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ R h7 + ]  [ K g6 ]  [ R h6 + ]  [ K f5 ]  [ a4 ] , [ R f2 ]  Some spite checks from the rook and now black has time to set up the mate.
 [ B c4 ]  [ R a5 ] , [ B b3 ]  Stout defence by this heroic bishop!
 [ d4 ] , [ f5 ]  Opens up the position too early. Black is cramped and behind in development. This will only help White.
 [ Q x e6 ] , [ c5 ]  So after he takes I decide to put pressure on his d pawn by connecting my pawns. I surely thought that this move was enough to win something back but that is not the case.
 [ B x g5 ] , [ N d4 ]  Better yet would be BxP[ g7 ] making back a point while breaking up the black king's pawns.
 [ R e1 ] , [ R d5 ]  ...and this in the middle of the board.
 [ B x e7 ] , [ Q x e7 ]  Black's counterstrike is astonishingly quick.
 [ B x d6 ]  [ e3 ]  [ a6 ]  [ B d2 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ B b4 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N f6 ]  [ c3 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ h5 ] , [ B f3 ]  tries to threaten my pawn on [ b7 ]  [ R e1 + ] , [ K d7 ]  i move my king so that i don't have to block and get that piece pinned for a while
 [ O-O-O ]  [ R b8 ]  [ e4 ] , [ B h6 + ]  After castling queenside the weakness on the h6-[ c1 ] diagonal increased allowing this safe check to come into play.
 [ f6 ] , [ g3 ]  17. [ g3 ] - still following the sequence in the database and creating [ g2 ] for Henry to bolster a rook challenge on the h file but I wonder whether I should have exchanged on [ e5 ] here.
 [ f x e5 ] , [ f x e5 ]  I now have a strong pawn center and mostly developed pieces. Black only has a developed bishop.
 [ d5 ] , [ c4 ]  I chose the Queen's gambit becuase computers tend to play classical positions very strongly. I wanted to test myself so this seemed a logical choice.
 [ R d8 ] , [ Q g5 ]  23. Qg5! threatens too much for black to hold it all. The simple threat is 24. [ Q x d8 + ] and the less obvious threat is 24. [ R x e5 ] and now black cannot capture the rook with his pinned bishop on [ g7 ] nor can he capture with the pawn on [ d6 ] for it is also pinned preventing 25. Rxd8#.
 [ Q x d2 ]  [ d x c4 ] , [ B x c4 ]  I would have taken back with the b-pawn strengthening the centre and creating a good pawn-chain moreover a clear half open b-file for the queen-rook. Taking with the bishop has a clear adventage though it gives way for castling. In spite of the fact I would have taken with the b-pawn I am not entirely sure that was any better.
 [ B e4 ] , [ B x e4 ]  White tried to block the e-file but it merely costs him a pawn.
 [ R e4 ]  [ K d3 ] , [ K c5 ]  This will get black nowhere. As I can bring my rook to [ c7 ] and should black move his king to the queenside then a draw would result since I could create an unpassable "fence" where the black king cannot cross. and without the support of the king the pawns/rook combo would not be able to pomote since my rook would have plenty of waiting moves at it's disposal.
 [ R f2 ]  [ B x c5 ]  [ N x c5 ] , [ R b8 ]  The entire plan behind exchanging was attacking his [ B b7 ] and trying to put comprises. The plan though did not work since this move is powerful. And that's combined with those dangerous passed pawns.
 [ N d5 ] , [ B c4 ]  ? An empty threat since if [ B x d5 ] [ Q x d5 ] then White has the additional liability of guarding g2.
 [ d x e5 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ B x g8 ]  [ K x g8 ]  [ O-O ]  [ b6 ]  [ R d1 ]  [ a5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B a6 ]  [ b3 ]  [ R d8 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ K f8 ] , [ N f6 ]  Getting some more pawns.
 [ R x g7 ] , [ Q d6 ]  ..blocking the escape square and providing the continued threat....
 [ Q x b2 ]  [ Q d3 ]  [ Q b6 ]  [ R f b1 ]  [ Q d8 ] , [ Q b5 ]  winning back the pawn.
 [ f3 ]  [ e x f3 ] , [ g x f3 ]  After [ g x f3 ] my K-side pawn structure was non-existent.
 [ N x e5 ] , [ d x e5 ]  White accepted the exchange perhaps a dubious choice when down by a rook and two pawns. Further it allows black's only isolated and easily hunted pawn to find solace in the camaraderie of an adjacent black pawn.
 [ B g5 ] , [ O-O ]  Fianlly. 4 moves late.
 [ B x e4 ]  [ B x c3 ] , [ b x c3 ]  18. [ b x c3 ] - B for N trade and now white's pawn structure is compromised. However white has the bishop pair and they could become a real swine for me pore ole 'enry!
 [ B b7 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ d5 ]  And now I felt the timing was right to begin the attack with the [ d5 ] thrust expecting to isolate the pawn.
 [ Q a6 ] , [ e5 ]  White's queen escapes from the bishop threat and Black uses the tempo gained to strengthen his stranglehold on the center of the board.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B b5 ] , [ N f6 ]  hmmmmmmmm the Berlin Defense. time to break out the books for the best line against this solid defense.
 [ Q b6 ]  [ Q x c3 ]  [ e x f4 ] , [ Q x g7 ]  The king's wing of the black position is damaged and what is worse black king's position is exposed which is really dangerous here.
 [ g5 ]  [ B g3 ] , [ R e d8 ]  Black now wins back his pawn but White retains the advantage. If White can maneuver his knight to [ f5 ] he probably has a won game.
 [ N c6 ]  [ a3 ]  [ a6 ] , [ h3 ]  White must consider the effect of allowing [ B [ g4 ] ] because of the threat of Nd4. [ N f3 ] blocks the white f pawn from joining in the king-side fight sould one occur and it allows the pin brought by Bg4. [ N f3 ] first would allow [ h3 ] with temp but what would white do after Bh5? The response [ g4 ] commits to king-side expansion. I had doubts that I should castle kingside because of the [ c5 ] bishop. Yes [ [ a3 ] ] prepared [ [ [ b4 ] ] ] but [ a6 ] discouraged an immediate [ [ [ b4 ] ] ] although with preparation the expansion is still playable. 6.[ [ a3 ] ] also prevents the bishop from coming to [ [ [ b4 ] ] ] although I did not believe that was a real threat. I was more concerned with Bd4. I was playing against a higher rated player and thought I would make generally useful moves until it was clear whether the king-side or queen-side thrust was most advantageous. It also provides complications for black as he must prepare for both continuations too.
 [ N f3 ] , [ B d6 ]  Developing pieces.
 [ O-O ] , [ O-O ]  With both Kings tucked away now the tactics can start.
 [ R x e5 ] , [ h4 ]  Protecting my pawn.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ f4 ]  [ e x f4 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ g5 ]  [ h4 ]  [ g4 ] , [ N g5 ]  This variation is called the Algueire gambit witch white scarifies a piece for quick development of all of his Pisces this scarifies is incorrect however Cuba's champion hoped that the young talented kid wont find the right way to defend or the acceptable continuations of these complications witch was made as the result of that piece scarifies . Capablanca indeed didn't knew these continuation however he find the best moves on the board better than everything that was familiar at the time .
 [ f x e5 ]  [ f x e5 ]  [ B x f5 ] , [ R a d8 ]  Black has been walking a tightrope with his play and now sacrifices a pawn to keep his pieces active: White's Rooks must be challenged before they unite on a file.
 [ e x d4 + ] , [ K x d4 ]  And now that I am up the exchange I will surely grab the [ h2 ] pawn and try to convert it to a win right? My last game with this opponent proved to me that I need every last advantage.
 [ B g7 ]  [ N a4 ] , [ O-O ]  I would have delayed the castling to meet Nc5. Although I cannot see a move here that prevents Nc5. Also look how long it takes black to castle! The stage of black's development lags considerably behind white's.
 [ Q g5 + ]  [ Q g7 ] , [ Q x d5 + ]  34. [ Q x d5 + ] - for a start it allows me to claw back another pawn for the missing rook. 3 pawns for the rook is nowhere near enough though and I still have some work to do to save this game here.
 [ c x d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ Q b6 ]  [ N e2 ]  [ B e7 ] , [ h4 ]  In this game losing a "good castling" on the kingside is normal.
 [ K x f7 ]  [ Q f3 + ]  [ K e6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N c b4 ]  [ B b3 ]  [ Q f6 ]  [ B x d5 + ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ Q x d5 + ]  [ K e7 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ Q c6 ]  [ Q x c6 ]  [ b x c6 ] , [ O-O ]  Black is down a pawn and has weak structure must put pressure on in the middle game to equalize.
 [ a4 ] , [ f4 ]  !? A sure way to start the battle that will ensue.
 [ e5 ]  [ N f d7 ]  [ c x b4 ] , [ a x b4 ]  Now black has lost a pawn. Probably not what those 43 grandmasters had in mind when they played 4. ... b5.
 [ O-O ] , [ B d7 ]  Black is packing his pieces in. It looks rather cramped. Something will happen soon though as White will not get through Black's defense without blasting through Black's center.
 [ R f2 ] , [ B g3 ]  ? This move only assists white. Consider 42. [ R g2 ] which attacks a piece that would be tough to protect and also threatens black's g pawn.
 [ B f4 ] , [ R d8 ]  I'm in pure defensive mode here and in bad shape
 [ B f5 ]  [ Q c4 ] , [ R d7 ]  aiming to create a battery. a more forcing move e.g...[ N a5 ] might have helped.
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ g6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ e4 ]  [ d6 ] , [ g3 ]  soon i created a strong defense against the kings indian
 [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B b5 ] , [ Q c7 ]  Well this looks a little like one of my white games as I usually play the queen's gambit.
 [ Q x f7 ]  [ K x f3 ]  [ R x c1 ] , [ R x c1 ]  I got only material equality but I had a hope to achieve advantage by winning the pawn [ g2 ] which sometimes looked like my sincere frend and best defender. But even so it is queens endgame where one pawn advantage is often not sufficient to win. So my victory is questionable now. Very discouraging...
 [ h3 ]  [ R c8 ]  [ g4 ]  [ N a5 ]  [ B d5 ]  [ B c6 ]  [ Q e1 ]  [ B x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ] , [ N c4 ]  ! My opponent made a mistake allowing me to win control over [ c4 ] square. Probably 16. [ B a2 ] was the right choice. Now he makes another inaccuracy with his remaining bishop.
 [ R e5 ]  [ d6 ]  [ R x d6 ]  [ R x d6 ]  [ Q x d6 ]  [ Q a2 ] , [ c3 ]  29. ....... [ c3 ] - I decided not to take the pawn on [ [ a7 ] ] thinking that it might allow the c pawn to crown. After I put Glenda on [ c2 ] I said to Hector in the Chat that the [ [ a7 ] ] pawn reeked of arsenic particularly if a strong IM like him leaves it en prise. Hector told me that I was certainly wise not to take it.
 [ Q x f2 + ]  [ K d1 ] , [ Q x f1 + ]  This could be avoided by Nh3.
 [ K f3 ]  [ b x c6 ] , [ b x c6 ]  52. ...... [ b x c6 ] - the Joblock works to deadly effect. Chris is absolutely starved of any counterplay whatsoever on the queenside.
 [ c5 ] , [ c3 ]  
 [ R e8 ]  [ N x g7 ]  [ K x g7 ]  [ Q c7 + ]  [ K h8 ] , [ Q x b6 ]  And here black resigns. There is no good way to attack my king and my passed a pawn will give me victory.
 [ Q c2 ] , [ c4 ]  22. .... [ c4 ] - opening up an attacking line for Fou Lenoir onto that wretched pawn (I nearly said thorn!) on d6!
 [ c7 ] , [ Q f1 + ]  So the dance begins to keep his pawn from promoting
 [ R x b6 ]  [ Q x b6 ]  [ R b1 ]  [ Q d6 ]  [ R b3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ K g2 ] , [ N c6 ]  Getting the Knight into play is crucial for Black
 [ K g3 ] , [ R g8 ]  ? Why would white not take the rook?
 [ c6 ]  [ f4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ N g5 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ Q x g4 ]  [ N x g4 ]  [ B x f7 + ]  [ K d7 ]  [ B e6 + ]  [ K c7 ]  [ B x g4 ] , [ K b6 ]  Black moves her King away from the fork with Nc3. Of course the goal for Black is to now activate her pieces and protect her King while White seeks to cramp black and attack the exposed King.
 [ Q g3 + ] , [ K f1 ]  This was forced.
 [ R x e1 ] , [ R x e1 + ]  ? [ B c6 ] was better due to problems with the [ b7 ] bishop.
 [ N x b3 ] , [ c x b3 ]  !!
 [ Q c8 + ] , [ K f7 ]  I knew I had to wipe the deficit before the endgame
 [ R a d8 ]  [ Q f3 ] , [ B x b3 ]  ! I didn't see This move. I can't take because I would lose a pawn.
 [ Q f2 ] , [ Q x f2 # ]  and ending matter quickly!
 [ N c6 ] , [ N f3 ]  desperate to save the pawn
 [ h6 ] , [ N d f3 ]  I was so keen to maintain the threat of [ h7 # ] that I'm willing to lose material. Not an amazing strategy what else is really on for white though?
 [ d5 ]  [ c x d5 ] , [ c x d5 ]  32. [ c x d5 ] - pawn trade.
 [ N g5 ]  [ K g2 ]  [ R b2 + ] , [ K g3 ]  I think I'm into a mate net but I'll let my opponent to show it.
 [ c7 ] , [ R c4 ]  No choice left. After 60. ... [ R e8 ] 61. [ R b7 ] snuffs out all of blacks resistance...
 [ N e8 ]  [ N g1 ] , [ f5 ]  Probably premature as black cannot hold the square.
 [ b6 ]  [ R x a5 ]  [ b7 + ] , [ K b8 ]  No. They don't if I play like that. Learn beginners how NOT to play an endgame. Which were the bad strategic decisions white has made that lead him to this after such a wonderful attack? How big blunders were white's that led him to this defeat? :-)
 [ e6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ b6 ] , [ d4 ]  9. [ d4 ] - after black prepares to fianchetto his lsb on [ b7 ] Lallit decided to strike out in the centre and poke the [ c5 ] knight.
 [ R f e8 ] , [ B e4 ]  Cutting the link on the file.
 [ K d6 ] , [ R x e2 ]  That powerful e pawn has finally taken his last breath. *funeral music plays in the distance* If not for that stupid f pawn dropping the e pawn may have one day grown up to be the queen but she was stabbed in the back by one of her closes friends.
 [ g x h5 ]  [ B x h5 ] , [ Q g5 ]  Threatening [ Q x g7 ] ...
 [ B x d3 ]  [ N x d3 ] , [ R d7 ]  A somewhat clumsy move to protect f7.
 [ e3 ]  [ Q f6 ]  [ B e2 ] , [ B b4 + ]  My opponent continues the attack before my king can castle safely.
 [ K c2 ] , [ N d7 ]  opens the h8-[ a1 ] diagonal for my bishop
 [ N g8 ] , [ f4 ]  by now [ f4 ] has lost its momentum...
 [ e x f5 ]  [ N x f5 ] , [ Q e4 ]  Pressuring the knight slightly.
 [ g4 ] , [ g5 ]  Freezing the h pawn.
 [ R d8 ]  [ K f5 ]  [ R d7 ]  [ R e3 + ] , [ K f2 ]  51.[ K g2 ] is slightly better but the pawn is lost anyway after Kg5.
 [ R f1 ]  [ f5 ]  [ R g1 ] , [ f6 ]  Now its only matter of time when white will get his pawns through
 [ N e5 ]  [ B d5 ]  [ R c1 ]  [ Q f8 ]  [ c4 ]  [ B c6 ]  [ b4 ]  [ B e8 ]  [ Q d6 ]  [ N h5 ]  [ g4 ]  [ N f4 ] , [ R e4 ]  attacking the knight
 [ R x g2 + ] , [ K h4 ]  Now I had a hope tp perform my favourite (King-Rook-King) checkmate on White.
 [ B e3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ f3 ]  [ b5 ]  [ g4 ] , [ h6 ]  Pawns pawns pawns.
 [ c6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e5 ] , [ B f5 ]  The Caro-Kann Bayonet variation.
 [ N f3 ] , [ e6 ]  Here I am accepting that my lsb can be exchanged with some manouvering by white. This would be ok to me because as a payment for it in the meantime black starts his own plans on the queenside.
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ d4 ]  [ g6 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ B g7 ]  the Hungarian variation of the Sicilian: I will stick to this until I die...
 [ N e7 ] , [ R c4 x c7 ]  A free pawn.
 [ K e5 ]  [ R h5 + ]  [ K e4 ]  [ R h4 + ]  [ K e5 ]  [ R h5 + ] , [ K d6 ]  so now black can't go back down that path lest it be a draw by reppition.
 [ e x d4 ] , [ N d5 ]  Theoretically not a bad move...
 [ K g4 ] , [ B e2 + ]  Mate in 1.
 [ Q a6 ] , [ B f4 ]  The first pin.
 [ Q e6 ]  [ N x g5 ]  [ N x g5 ]  [ R f2 x f4 ]  [ R x f4 ]  [ R x f4 ]  [ e x f4 + ]  [ Q x f4 ]  [ Q e5 ] , [ Q x e5 ]  Somewhat forced exchange. Simpler is not always better.
 [ R e x e3 ]  [ f x e3 ]  [ R x e3 ]  [ d5 ] , [ R f3 ]  I'm hoping to win a rook with 32...[ B f4 + ] but White's passed d-pawn is much too fast. It will either promote or Black will have to give up a bishop or rook to stop it. I don't know how I could have played this move to be honest. Very careless 31...[ R f3 ] really is a ridiculous move. You have to realize the strength of a passed pawn and keep it in mind at all times. 31...[ B f4 ] is better but Black still seems to be in hot water. ie) 31...[ B f4 ] 32.[ R x f3 ] [ B x f3 + ] 33.[ K c2 ] and maybe 33...[ B c5 ] 34.[ d6 ] Kf7... White may have better options than advancing this pawn right away. I'm not sure.
 [ g5 ]  [ K e2 ]  [ K g7 ]  [ K f3 ]  [ h5 ]  [ K g3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ b4 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ K f7 ]  [ c4 ]  [ b6 ]  [ h4 ]  [ g4 ]  [ K f2 ]  [ K e7 ] , [ K g3 ]  This move is bad because it is obvious that both kings can not pass on the f file so the action will take place queenside where both kings should be.
 [ R h1 ]  [ K h7 ]  [ Q f6 ] , [ R e6 ]  this move baffled me at first I couldn't understand why?
 [ B e2 ]  [ Q e5 ]  [ R a c1 ]  [ Q c5 ] , [ K h1 ]  bad move because it left the pawn in [ f2 ] unprotected.
 [ f5 ] , [ N h2 ]  It is already difficult to suggest moves for white. This ugly move may actually be white's best bet.
 [ d4 ] , [ d5 ]  I play the French as black so this suited me.
 [ g3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ d4 ] , [ e6 ]  So far all book play.
 [ Q x e5 ]  [ N e2 ] , [ O-O-O ]  Black has a lot of high powered protection on the d pawn not enough low power. The threatened c pawn can easily be replaced with black's black bishop which then adds protection to the h rook via the d rook. The d rook's cover isn't worth much in terms of a bishop/rook exchange however. The key idea is that black is exerting more control over the center of the board.
 [ e4 ] , [ c5 ]  this was as close as I could get: in instructing my approach to the Sicilian...
 [ B g4 ] , [ Q e2 ]  Not sure what the point behind that move is.
 [ Q h7 + ]  [ K x f6 ]  [ Q x f5 + ]  [ K e7 ] , [ R h7 + ]  And here black resigns. His decision of push g and h pawns was bad. Maybe White's only possibility to win was attacking the king by the queenside. What do you think about it?
 [ g5 ]  [ Q d3 + ]  [ K g8 ]  [ N d7 ] , [ R c7 ]  Rc7??? React react react! Again why did I not sit back and begin developing a plan rather than just react. [ R c7 ] is bad...watch what happens.
 [ e4 ] , [ d6 ]  E77. King's Indian/ Six Pawn Attack.
 [ Q f6 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ Q x f2 + ]  [ K h1 ] , [ N d f6 ]  White is in serious trouble.
 [ B x f5 ]  [ Q x f5 ] , [ Q d1 ]  Although I would have preferred the Queen's to come off I was happy with this as it's just passive. I also notice that white's keeping an eye on the a-pawn which gives me options to use the a-pawn as a decoy in order to force a mating net on the opposite flank.
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e5 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ e6 ] , [ g4 ]  Very sharp for my standarts
 [ e x d4 ] , [ B x d4 ]  This turns out to be a swap.
 [ N b4 ]  [ Q e3 ]  [ N c2 ]  [ Q b3 ]  [ N b4 ]  [ R h1 ]  [ R c7 c3 ] , [ Q a4 ]  White still has the advantage here although his moves are getting harder to find as Black's collection of pieces are suddenly well coordinated. I remembered Fischer's famous "Game of the Century" against Donald Byrne as an example of how Black should act in such a situation.
 [ g6 ]  [ R g7 ] , [ h4 ]  This blockading technique only works against isolated passed pawns.
 [ c x b4 ] , [ a x b4 ]  2 valorous pawns a knight two bishops and my queen are on the verge to attack an exposed king...
 [ d x c6 ] , [ B x c6 ]  Here I can create a little pressure on e6. Will it be enough?
 [ O-O-O ] , [ B e7 ]  White has gained several tempi here and I think he has an advantage despite being down a pawn now. 13...[ B x g3 ] may lead to 14.[ Q x g3 ] [ Q f6 ] (14...[ [ g6 ] ] 15.Nxg6!) 15.Nc4! (threatening 16.[ N d6 ] and 17.Nxb7) and I think white has the upper hand. 13...[ N x e5 ] 14.[ f x e5 ] [ B x g3 ] is somewhat better 15.[ Q x g3 ] [ R h7 ] (which is probably too passive even if it seems ok for now). After 15...[ [ g6 ] ] 16.[ B g5 ] and black has trouble completing his development. 15...[ N e7 ] giving back material seems risky but may be the best idea 16.[ Q x g7 ] [ R g8 ] 17.[ Q h7 ] (not 17.[ Q x h6 ] Qxd4!) [ R x g2 ] and I think black might untangle.
 [ O-O ]  [ O-O-O ]  [ K h8 ]  [ h4 ]  [ Q d7 ] , [ N e5 ]  Placing Knight on [ e5 ] means I need [ N c6 ]  [ N x e5 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ N g4 ] , [ B d3 ]  Sacrificing one Rook and attacking on [ h7 ] pawn it depends only king
 [ B e7 ]  [ B x e7 + ] , [ K x e7 ]  Now we exchange bishops forcing his king out of his comfort zone.
 [ e3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ h4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ g3 ] , [ f5 ]  This defence worked once before but I suspect it is inherently weak?
 [ R h7 ]  [ N h4 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ N x g6 ] , [ B a6 ]  11...[ B x f6 ] 12.[ N x f6 + ] [ K f7 ] might have been good
 [ N f6 ]  [ f3 ]  [ K b8 ]  [ N c4 ]  [ d5 ] , [ B g5 ]  No time for the en prise knight there's bigger game afoot.
 [ R a b8 ] , [ N x a7 ]  20. [ N x [ a7 ] ] - firstly the [ a7 ] pawn drops.
 [ R b8 ] , [ Q c4 ]  Chessmaster now threatens to checkmate with 23. Qf7#. Unfortunately for Black he must sacrifice a piece to get out of it.
 [ R x d4 ]  [ f5 ] , [ g5 ]  ! Avoiding the trade.
 [ B g6 ] , [ B g5 ]  Another nice move at the very least threatens to pull my king defense apart by exchanging pieces.
 [ g5 ]  [ h x g5 ] , [ h x g5 ]  This Pawn now simply threatens to march to [ N8 ] and Black's King is cut off from guard duty by the White Rook.
 [ K g1 ]  [ Q c7 ] , [ N x d5 ]  An attempt to take the offensive
 [ N e4 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ B x e4 ] , [ f5 ]  14.f5! ... Ion stated that "This move is very much a theme of this whole line. I felt that I was in deep trouble now and it was going to get worse!" I think white threatens to exchange pawns here or force a doubling on the f file either way black's castled position will start to look a little draughty which could be problematical if the queens are on the board.
 [ B x h2 + ] , [ K h1 ]  [ K x h2 ] looks safer to me for some reason partially because white got wiped out shortly after Kh1.
 [ B c6 ]  [ f4 ] , [ g6 ]  Controlling f5. White could think about 28.[ f5 ] gx[ f5 ] 29.[ B x h6 ] [ K e6 ] When he has a outside passed pawn but [ e5 ] is weak.
 [ B c7 ] , [ N f6 ]  Strengthing the knight with gain of time.
 [ N d2 ] , [ K b8 ]  Prepares ...[ R [ c8 ] ] with a battery down the c-file and allows my white-squared bishop to vacate the h3-[ c8 ] diagonal without allowing White to skewer R and K from f5.
 [ B x c4 ]  [ N x c4 ] , [ N d7 ]  I understand this move even less since Shakhriyar isn't going to place his N on [ b4 ] and I don't like where it is now.
 [ K c7 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ b6 ]  [ Q a3 ] , [ Q d4 + ]  A temporary offensive front. A second check! Yippee!
 [ Q g5 ] , [ Q f3 ]  ?
 [ R x e5 + ]  [ N e6 ] , [ R c1 ]  I don't much like this; that pawn isn't really going anywhere if Black doesn't want it to. The computer prefers 23.[ Q g4 ] or 23.[ Q h5 ] and so do I. When behind counterplay has to become the name of the game!
 [ Q d2 ] , [ N d5 ]  Black should drop a pawn with this exchange AND have to move the queen.
 [ B d4 ]  [ h6 ]  [ R d3 ]  [ K h7 ]  [ B c3 ] , [ R h d8 ]  Free at last black's KR rushes to the battle lines. Unfortunately this battle is already lost: while I have pieces enough to cover the threatened e6-pawn I cannot reasonably prevent [ e5 ] and a dangerous opening of the position. But as it happens white turns on a dime and opens the position in a different way.
 [ e4 ]  [ c6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ N x e4 ] , [ N d7 ]  My favoraite way to play caro-kann defence. When played right this move is almost unbeatable
 [ R e b8 ] , [ R d7 ]  they take a pawn i take a pawn
 [ N x c4 ]  [ K c2 ]  [ B x f4 ]  [ h3 ]  [ B e5 ]  [ N g1 ]  [ N x b2 ]  [ R x e5 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ K x b2 ] , [ b5 ]  
 [ R g5 ]  [ N d f3 ]  [ B x f3 ] , [ N x f3 ]  The knight has to capture the bishop instead of the pawn otherwise Qxh3#. At this point the rook could retreat to [ g7 ] and double the rooks as previously planned. However the problem that black faces is a return to [ N h4 ] where the knight is difficult to remove.
 [ e6 ]  [ B b3 ] , [ b5 ]  Aqui por supuesto hay otras alternativas viables: Alternative variation: 7... [ N b d7 ] 8. [ f4 ] [ N c5 ] 9. [ f5 ] [ B e7 ] 10. [ Q f3 ] O-O 11. [ B e3 ] [ e5 ] 12. [ N d e2 ] [ N x b3 ] 13. [ a x b3 ] [ b5 ] 14. O-O ( 14. [ g4 ] [ b4 ] 15. [ N a4 ] [ B b7 ] 16. [ N g3 ] $17) (14. Nx[ b5 ] [ d5 ] 15. ex[ d5 ] Nx[ d5 ] $17) Alternative variation: 7... [ N c6 ] 8. [ B e3 ] [ B e7 ] 9. [ Q e2 ] $11
 [ a4 ] , [ e6 ]  pushing the bishop back
 [ B f6 ] , [ B g5 ]  If 14.[ N e5 ] then 14...[ B x e5 ] 15.[ Q x e5 ] [ R e8 ] wins.
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ f4 ]  [ d6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ d4 ]  A little aggressive here but this wins the centre and also frees up the bishop on [ c1 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ B e7 ] , [ B d3 ]  Strengthening the centre please note not only is white ahead on development but he is already aiming his pieces toward where black's king will end up next move.
 [ e4 ] , [ N f6 ]  Alekhine's defense. Most of white's responses tend to be pretty good for black.
 [ Q x h6 ] , [ a6 ]  Black is pretending that they don't have a problem.
 [ f4 ]  [ f3 ]  [ R g8 ]  [ b3 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ d4 ]  [ K f5 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ B d2 ]  [ b4 ]  [ c4 ]  [ R a d8 ]  [ R a d1 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ R f e1 ]  [ N h5 ]  [ R e2 ]  [ B f6 ]  [ K f1 ]  [ B h4 ] , [ B e1 ]  error with bishop
 [ c6 ] , [ c4 ]  English Variation aka the Accelerated Panov-Botvinnik Variation.
 [ K c8 ]  [ b7 + ]  [ K b8 ] , [ R e3 ]  After [ R e8 + ] there is no way to prevent a pawn from promoting. And there is no way to stop Re8.
 [ Q x a2 ] , [ B e7 ]  White should have captured. He is hoping for 31...Rxe7?? 32. [ Q c8 # ] but Black sees through right his trap.
 [ N g3 ] , [ K h4 ]  Both mistakes just effect the margin of victory.
 [ R x e3 ]  [ f x e3 ] , [ Q x e3 + ]  I had overlooked this shot.
 [ K b5 ]  [ N d4 + ]  [ K b4 ]  [ a3 + ]  [ K a5 ]  [ R c5 + ]  [ K a4 ] , [ R c4 + ]  If I didn't play this attack accurately I would appreciate comments showing me how I went wrong.
 [ B x d5 ]  [ Q x d5 ]  [ N d7 ] , [ O-O ]  Safe finally
 [ B x e5 ] , [ d x e5 ]  white has now removed one of the attackers from the K-side of the board.
 [ B g6 ]  [ R g4 ]  [ N d8 ]  [ K c2 ]  [ N e6 ]  [ f4 ] , [ N x f4 ]  Taking another pawn. My pawn can recapture either the queen or rook if white tries to take the knight.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ] , [ d3 ]  Indian Opening (according to Gameknot).
 [ B d6 ]  [ R d8 ] , [ Q f7 ]  ! with the threat of [ R e8 ] and mate
 [ B b3 ] , [ N d4 ]  Trying to maintain pressure on white and opening c so my pawn can advance
 [ Q b7 ]  [ h4 ]  [ Q c6 ]  [ h5 ]  [ N h8 ]  [ N g5 + ]  [ h x g5 ] , [ f x g5 ]  Threatening mate... how?
 [ c6 ] , [ O-O ]  Tucking the king away and connecting the rooks. White is far ahead in development but does have three pieces hanging.
 [ N c3 ]  [ B x c3 + ]  [ b x c3 ] , [ Q x c3 + ]  [ Q b6 ] is still preferential here. Black does bad to be greedy. I spent 30 seconds and decided to really bait black with the next couple of moves
 [ Q f2 ] , [ B d3 ]  Oops. 16. Qf2? was a mistake allowing the black bishop to sneak into the heart of the enemy camp and win the exchange.
 [ g6 ] , [ Q d3 ]  A nice central position for the Queen.
 [ d4 ] , [ B e6 ]  I of course blockade the passed Pawn.
 [ N f3 ] , [ B c5 ]  A clear threat on f2. 5. [ e3 ] is pretty much forced and the black bishop has a harder time getting developed. In addition to speeding his development with the gambit black also inhibits White's development.
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ c5 ]  [ c3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ f4 ] , [ b6 ]  I don't like playing against the Stonewall type formations. Or is it Colle? Anyway I like piece manouvers but this particular pawn structure is ... well ... just boring. I quickly played 5...[ b6 ] only to realise that the planned exchange of white square bishops was not possible. Let's say 6. [ N f3 ] [ B [ [ a6 ] ] ] 7. B:[ [ a6 ] ] N:[ [ a6 ] ] 8. [ Q a4 ] and I lose the piece... Well too late.
 [ B c3 ] , [ d5 ]  A strong move but you needed to arrange a defence for your e-pawn first.
 [ R x g6 + ]  [ N x g6 ] , [ Q x g6 + ]  White will lose a R all the same but white will do it in a winning mate net.
 [ Q x d4 + ]  [ Q x d4 ]  [ R x d4 ]  [ R x c5 ] , [ B a6 ]  In view of [ R c7 ] .
 [ O-O ] , [ B x c6 ]  Giving up the bishop pair.
 [ g6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ e4 ] , [ d6 ]  free the bishop
 [ K x f7 ]  [ Q c7 + ] , [ K e6 ]  White has managed to flush the enemy king out of his hiding place but Black escapes the checks he runs his king into the region of its opposite number whereupon the threat of a cross-check eventually causes White to run out of checks.
 [ R x e7 + ] , [ K x e7 ]  With a lot of the wood gone an even endgame has emerged.
 [ N x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ Q x d5 ] , [ K b1 ]  Protecting the a-pawn.
 [ g3 ] , [ c5 ]  Fantastic move by black; it makes space for [ B c6 ]  [ Q f4 ]  [ Q h3 ]  [ B x c5 ] , [ B c6 ]  Black develops the bishop threatening mate in one - causing loss of tempo for white who must prevent the threat
 [ Q x c6 ] , [ B x f2 + ]  I take it this means u give up then?
 [ B x g4 ] , [ h3 ]  I thought this move was pretty good. I expected f2-[ f3 ] then my queen goes to [ h7 ] and if he takes the bishop rock a8-[ g8 ] or h3[ x g2 ] with still some chances to create some problems (even if h2-[ h3 ] would have saved white). But again he played "simple".
 [ B g7 ] , [ N c3 ]  I'll try to defend the d pawn as long as possible to limitate white's pawn developement (see above).
 [ N x c4 ]  [ K f2 ]  [ h5 ]  [ R e c1 ]  [ N d6 ]  [ R x c8 + ]  [ N x c8 ]  [ R c1 ]  [ N a7 ]  [ R c7 ]  [ N b5 ]  [ R b7 ]  [ R g7 ] , [ R x b6 ]  Right now I offered a draw. Now I don't think I should have. I expected white to soon take my a pawn after which I would have had an advantage with my knight over the bishop in the closed kingside. on the other hand my rook was blocked by pawns while my opponent's rook was active. So overall was my draw offer justified?
 [ K g3 ] , [ N f5 + ]  !! He has to sac his queen!
 [ d x e4 ] , [ N a3 ]  White needs development but this move looks wasted. Now his queen is hanging and he can't recapture on e4. But I couldn't see a way of taking advantage of the hanging queen so after quite a bit of thought I decided on the following combination:
 [ B e5 ]  [ f6 ]  [ B g6 + ]  [ K e7 ] , [ O-O ]  I was not very smart in castling because he can take my bishop
 [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B b5 ] , [ f5 ]  I actually think this is sound having analysed it and this is what I would play OTB were I to take up 1...[ e5 ] again although I have lost every game I've played with it on here bar this one!
 [ h x g4 ]  [ f x g4 ]  [ B x h4 ]  [ R h5 ]  [ B f6 ]  [ K f4 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ B x d4 ]  [ R h2 ]  [ B a4 ]  [ K e4 ]  [ B f6 ]  [ K d5 ]  [ c3 ]  [ b x c3 ]  [ B x c3 ]  [ K c4 ]  [ B f6 ]  [ K b4 ]  [ B c6 ]  [ a4 ]  [ K g5 ]  [ a5 ]  [ K x g4 ]  [ R f2 ]  [ B e7 + ]  [ K c4 ] , [ b5 + ]  
 [ N f4 + ]  [ K f5 ]  [ N e2 ]  [ R d3 + ]  [ K e1 ]  [ R e3 ] , [ K d2 ]  Note the repetitions. I moved my rook from [ c3 ] to [ e3 ] without using a turn.
 [ N x f6 + ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ Q x f6 ]  [ B x c4 ]  [ R f e8 ] , [ R f d1 ]  Judging the finish of the game it might have been better to exchange the light-squared bishops.
 [ N f3 ] , [ B g4 ]  [ B g4 ] felt stronger then Bf5. if [ B f5 ] was played then I had some concerns regarding [ B d3 ] which could follow. Looking back to it I should have been content with trading off our strong pieces.
 [ Q e3 + ] , [ K b4 ]  Keeping his [ a3 ] and [ c2 ] pawns protected.
 [ R f h1 ]  [ Q f5 ]  [ R h5 ]  [ g5 ] , [ N e4 ]  White could have played 17.Bxg5.
 [ g5 ]  [ c4 ]  [ b x c4 ] , [ R x c4 ]  breaking through the c file...
 [ e3 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ B e5 ]  [ N b d7 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B e2 ]  [ a6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ R e8 ]  [ h3 ]  [ B f8 ] , [ c5 ]  So far this is turning into exactly the sort of game Al likes best - closed featuring incremental positional maneuvering with a slow deliberate build-up to the final attack. Fischer remarked about this style (speaking specifically of the late German GM Wolfgang Unzicker as I recall although he could have as easily mentioned Tigran Petrosian and later Anatoly Karpov) that if this patient constricting style doesn't produce a win then it almost always has the not necessarily unhappy consequence of producing a draw.
 [ N a5 ]  [ Q b4 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ N g3 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ R f e1 ]  [ N c4 ]  [ a4 ]  [ N x d2 ]  [ N x d2 ]  [ a5 ]  [ Q b3 ] , [ g6 ]  Panicking by now because I haven't castled yet.
 [ Q c2 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ e3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B d3 ] , [ N f6 ]  Playing defensively. Not like me. [ f5 ] OR [ N x c3 ] would have been sharper! Would have kept him blocked in.
 [ d x e5 ]  [ B b4 ]  [ B d2 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ h3 ]  [ B x f3 ] , [ e x f3 ]  Exchange of pieces.
 [ g x f6 ]  [ R x f6 ] , [ R e5 ]  Centralization of the rook? Hmmm.
 [ N f6 ]  [ d3 ] , [ d5 ]  The threat is easily deflected so it's time to begin the punishment for a silly opening.
 [ e x d5 ] , [ R b1 ]  ?? I am trying to get him to move the b pawn. It seems SO smart to move here. If he advances the b pawn I can move my Bishop to [ b5 ] and cause all sorts of mischief.
 [ R x b1 ]  [ N e4 ] , [ a3 ]  yes. Now Black is really threatening to play Bb4ch forcing [ K e2 ] where his pieces may have trouble getting his pieces out. good.also the space gaining [ b4 ] is an idea.
 [ N x a4 ] , [ N x e4 ]  Before throwing forward the b-pawn Black wants to get as much material for the Knight as he can. So we snap up the loose e-pawn.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ O-O ]  Didin't want to play d3. Was punished by gmkonig in a previous game.
 [ K f4 ] , [ B c7 ]  
 [ f4 ] , [ N b3 ]  White has pressure on the a-pawn so Black traded pawns. I thought [ b6 ] was better.
 [ B d4 ] , [ Q f3 ]  Sucked into the trap of the Knight sacrifice black moves in for the kill unwittingly having missed the inevitable mate against himself.
 [ b x c6 ]  [ c x d6 ]  [ Q x d6 ]  [ B g2 ]  [ R b8 ]  [ Q c3 ] , [ B a6 ]  Black wants to prevent white from castling and tries to set up a trap.
 [ N d4 ]  [ N x g3 ]  [ f x g3 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ N c e2 ]  [ Q b7 ]  [ R a b1 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ b3 ]  [ R c8 ]  [ Q g5 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ Q g7 ]  [ K d7 ]  [ c3 ] , [ R c g8 ]  you'll have to forgive me I have physical problems that are forcing me to cut the game short
 [ K h6 ]  [ R e6 ]  [ K g6 ]  [ R e7 ]  [ R d6 ] , [ R e8 ]  He can advance pawns but it will just provide my R more space to harass him.
 [ B b7 ]  [ d3 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ N e2 ]  [ d6 ] , [ g4 ]  9. [ g4 ] - a pawn push designed to deter me from castling kingside.
 [ O-O ]  [ N f5 ]  [ B g5 ] , [ h4 ]  (?!) Again marked as inaccuracy by the computer analysis which suggests 29. Bb4. Probably I was too enthusiastic.
 [ Q c8 ]  [ O-O ] , [ B g7 ]  Wanting to stop swap one of the doubled pawns black sees that if he moves the knight our of the way he can play [ e5 ] but that wastes three moves including this one.
 [ Q d2 ]  [ Q x d2 ]  [ R x d2 ]  [ B c1 ]  [ R c2 ]  [ B f4 + ]  [ K g2 ]  [ N x a5 ]  [ g5 ]  [ h6 ]  [ h4 ]  [ N c4 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ R c8 ] , [ K h3 ]  Alternative variation: 36. [ R a2 ] [ N x e5 ] 37. [ N x d5 ] [ e x d5 ] 38. [ d x e5 ] [ b5 ] $17
 [ a5 ] , [ N d2 ]  It works here too though! =)
 [ N d7 ]  [ N e2 ] , [ R x b3 ]  Oh my gosh! She has broken through recovered the pawn with advantage. Perhaps winning the pawn was not such a good idea after all. What do you think dear reader?
 [ Q x d8 + ]  [ B x d8 ] , [ B c6 ]  As now her back rank is weakened. It'll be difficult to defend this position without losing material. I did get ideas from Ken in our training game which I'll discuss as it blends in with our first lesson. And it's the same lesson that I forgot with Bernard when distracted and consequently was punished.
 [ N f3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ b3 ]  [ c5 ]  [ B b2 ] , [ N c6 ]  I've been experimenting with this Zukertort setup for White.
 [ N x a7 + ]  [ R x a7 ] , [ h x g3 ]  Last chance to go wrong: [ g x f3 ] [ B x f3 ] and all my advantage vanishes. He thinks he's safe because of the Q but...
 [ N x d6 + ] , [ Q x d6 ]  ?? aah! why? [ K f8 ] would've been fine a little unpleasant but fine.
 [ N f2 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ N x h1 ]  [ K x h1 ] , [ d6 ]  That is proven here as now not only has he developed a center pawn; but even with the bad B he can still bring it to d7. And if ever ...[ e5 ] that would change into being a good B.
 [ Q e6 + ] , [ K h8 ]  And now i just have to push my panws to promote !
 [ e5 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ B e2 ] , [ f6 ]  ...[ e6 ] looks better because it protects the bishop.
 [ N e d2 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ h3 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ N g5 ]  [ Q d7 ]  [ N x e6 ]  [ Q x e6 ] , [ c5 ]  hah! preparing to pin his queen. This combination helps me win the game
 [ N x e5 ]  [ Q x e5 ] , [ Q f6 ]  Now is there anything good for me other than exchanging? [ R f7 ] was impossible due to [ Q x e6 ] but if I don't take well that pawn on [ h4 ] is really bad all-of-a-sudden.
 [ N f1 ] , [ e6 ]  not quite sure why black didnt play [ e5 ] here. He might have disliked the reply [ N e3 ] eyeing the weakened white squares [ c4 ] [ d5 ]  [ N g3 ]  [ e5 ] , [ h4 ]  wanting to get a kingside attack going. I wonder if piece play with [ Q b3 ] isnt objectively stronger. It is probably better to clarify the center before attacking on the kingside
 [ R g6 ] , [ B x e5 ]  If 19.[ b4 ] [ R x f6 ] 20.[ b x c5 ] [ c6 ] 21.[ Q e2 ] and black have a better position. 19.[ R x d7 ] [ N x d7 ] lead to nothing.
 [ b x c4 ]  [ b x c4 ]  [ B x c4 ] , [ B x g2 ]  I think my attack will be strong enough!
 [ e4 ]  [ B c5 ] , [ N f3 ]  I was feeling pretty good not paying much attention and basically underestimating my opponent since I was ahead. I didn't notice that he had three pieces developed to my one.
 [ Q d1 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B e2 ]  [ g5 ]  [ B g3 ]  [ a6 ]  [ a3 ]  [ b5 ]  [ b3 ]  [ R a b8 ]  [ a4 ]  [ b x c4 ]  [ b x c4 ] , [ R b2 ]  Black threatens to win the bishop or can now employ the fork at c2. White resigned. *Just as a note the last few pawn moves may have been out of order for white (playing black I remember what I did) however this was the final board position reached so they couldn't have been too terribly re-constructed.
 [ B c8 ] , [ R f3 ]  ?! I am not sure whu I made this move. It was probably because I was deluded enough to think that I would have a chance to double my rooks on the f-file and attack.
 [ f4 ] , [ O-O ]  I thought long about this one. It felt like castling into danger with white's knight rook and queen just sitting right there in striking distance. It's never a good idea to castle into danger. Never castle onto a file your opponent controls especially if you're only shielded by a poorly defended pawn and especially if your opponent has multiple pieces lurking about to assist in any attack along that file. But I couldn't see any way for white to make good on the danger and I really wanted to play 19. ... [ f6 ] to chase away the knight for good so I decided the danger was illusory and took the plunge.
 [ b5 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ b4 ]  [ B x f6 ] loses to [ e x f6 ] which will be followed by [ Q g7 ] I realised here that if I could get my [ c3 ] knight to [ f7 ] or [ g6 ] I would win blacks move here helped as I was forced to move the knight I decided to go with [ b5 ] [ d6 ] threatening the black lsb which was of course a decoy as the knight would go to [ f7 ]  [ N b5 ] , [ R x a2 ]  This was a great move for me as the only real threat to my plan was that black would see it and then R x d6. Obviously it's not too late for that
 [ K c2 ]  [ R f2 + ]  [ K b1 ]  [ R f4 ] , [ R h7 ]  ?? Instead of defending with [ b3 ] (it gave the chance to black to play checks with the R and if white tries to escape the black R will haunt the white's pawns in a and b) I wanted to play something more interesting but this was a mistake.
 [ a6 ] , [ Q b3 ]  Was eyeing [ d3 ] also for her.
 [ R c2 + ]  [ K h3 ] , [ d4 ]  ! opens the way for black bishop in [ a8 ] and defenses the other bishop
 [ h4 ] , [ N x f3 + ]  My knight was basically screwed no matter where he moved so I decided to just cut my losses and try for another pawn.
 [ c3 ]  [ R f e8 ]  [ N b3 ] , [ b6 ]  Black initiates maneuvers whose object is to reduce the mobility of the opposing pieces and deprive the Knight of operational bases.
 [ B x f6 ] , [ Q x f6 ]  Much better than recapturing with the pawn. White must be careful as black now has the two bishops and has some pressure against the white kingside.
 [ h3 ]  [ a4 ] , [ R c3 c8 ]  I can safely say that after this move White is lost as the coming endgame is hopeless. White should have tried the active defense 24 Bxh6! [ Q x d4 ] 25 [ R d3 ] Qe4. Black has an edge but White may gain some counter-play later on because of the noticeable weakening of Black’s king position.
 [ B x e6 ] , [ f x e6 ]  8. Ok I did play this out a few moves....and did not see this next move at all. (I actually got burned on this same tatic today on another game I'll need to watch for this in the future) I truly never saw this fork coming.
 [ Q c7 ] , [ e5 ]  As long as Caruana keeps Queens on the board he has nothing to worry about.
 [ K d7 ] , [ N f x d4 ]  Clearing the way for the heavy metal! White is winning.
 [ K d8 ]  [ Q x g8 ] , [ Q x b5 ]  Blinded black DOESN'T capture white's queen.
 [ N f3 ] , [ Q c3 ]  Black attacks two undefended pieces [ c2 ] and [ N f3 ] while exposing Bd6. It will be an exchange leaving black 's queen better positioned to attack white's castle.
 [ h6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ h3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N c3 ]  [ Q a5 ]  [ B d2 ]  [ Q b4 ]  [ b3 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ e5 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ N x e5 ] , [ Q b8 ]  Getting my Queen looking for the [ h2 ] square
 [ e x d5 ] , [ N f6 ]  2.......... [ N f6 ] - the old fashioned response used to be to recapture the pawn with the queen but chessplayers are not encouraged to bring their queen out too early.
 [ f4 ] , [ K f1 ]  As all Jabborg fans know Jabborg has many unique pawn openings; this particular opening 'Jabborgian Torpedoes' involves launching the front line pawns 1 by 1 in the hope of overwhelming their opponent's defences. Safeway continues his defence as expected.
 [ B d7 ] , [ B b3 ]  The most flexible move as the bishop retreat is inevitable. Another perk of this line is to de-claw one of Black's more interesting options (and a personal favorite) the Chinese Dragon with 10. .. Rb8.
 [ B x f6 ]  [ Q x f6 ] , [ e3 ]  The white is protecting his c pawn.
 [ K e7 ]  [ K e2 ]  [ N c8 ]  [ b3 ]  [ N b6 ] , [ B c4 ]  If [ N x c4 ] White has a second passed pawn.
 [ B g7 ] , [ f3 ]  and now [ f3 ] is played to prevent Ng4. 7. [ B e2 ] the Classical variation is also playable.
 [ b4 ]  [ a x b4 ]  [ a x b4 ] , [ N e7 ]  ? Now I made a mistake. I did not want to move the rook and surrender the a-file to White's Rook. So I wanted to attack the Nd5; [ c6 ] but this allows white to win the b-Pawn
 [ N g5 + ]  [ K g8 ] , [ Q h5 ]  only way to defend it is...
 [ B a7 ] , [ B d6 ]  Hoping to pin the black king in the center
 [ Q x d4 + ] , [ Q e3 ]  ? this allows black to simplify his task the pawn majority on queen's wing might became decisive
 [ e x d4 ]  [ Q x d4 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ g6 ]  [ b3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ B b2 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B d3 ]  [ N g4 ]  [ N g e2 ] , [ Q h4 ]  ! Contrary to the usual "rules" of opening theory Black before completing his development makes an early attack with his Queen based on this specific position. This forces White to make an immediate decision about his position. This is where it gets wild and tactical!!
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ B b4 + ]  [ B d2 ]  [ B x d2 + ]  [ Q x d2 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N c3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e3 ]  [ b6 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ B e2 ] , [ B a6 ]  Trading of black's problem bishop
 [ B c3 ]  [ Q e8 ]  [ N f4 ] , [ b5 ]  There were better moves e.g. [ d6 ] to get a little central control or [ N c6 ] to develop another piece.
 [ a3 ]  [ B a5 ] , [ b4 ]  I decide to play uber aggressive in the hope that I can get some counterplay. I can see that his wins a pawn but it gives my rook an open file so maybe...
 [ B x d7 + ] , [ N b8 x d7 ]  we traded bishops
 [ B d2 ]  [ f5 ]  [ B b4 ]  [ f x e4 ]  [ Q x e4 ] , [ d5 ]  This is a very strange move and marks the beginning of the end
 [ R x d3 ] , [ N e2 ]  heading for the [ f4 ] square. I knew that a Q and N work well together. I thought there might be something there.
 [ Q b7 ]  [ a4 ]  [ Q x f3 ] , [ N x f3 ]  24. [ N x f3 ] - and now the queens.
 [ R b5 ] , [ Q a8 + ]  Another questionable move. It doesn't accomplish anything as Black's king can move to [ h7 ] and White can't continue the attack.
 [ N x c4 ]  [ K d7 ]  [ d6 ]  [ B g5 ] , [ N b6 + ]  i want to get that pawn queened
 [ K e7 ] , [ R d5 ]  My Rook is secure on this outpost.
 [ g5 ]  [ N g6 + ]  [ K g7 ] , [ N x e7 ]  Which piece to capture? [ N x e7 ] keeps the knight in play so black still has as many threats as possible to deal with. The rook on [ h8 ] is not doing much or likely to do much so there's no sense diminishing the attacking force to remove it.
 [ c x d4 ]  [ N x c7 ]  [ B x c7 ]  [ N d3 ]  [ B b6 ]  [ R e5 ]  [ R a c8 ]  [ R x e8 + ]  [ R x e8 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ R c8 ]  [ R c1 ] , [ B f5 ]  The rest of the game is well played but with an extra piece black will manage to win
 [ e5 ]  [ Q x d4 + ] , [ K h1 ]  he must move his knight....
 [ R d4 x d3 + ]  [ c3 ]  [ R d3 d1 ] , [ Q f2 ]  If 32.[ R x d1 ] then 32...[ R x d1 + ] wins a queen for a rook.
 [ N c4 ]  [ R d5 ]  [ a3 ] , [ b5 ]  That's what I was expecting when I put the knight on c4. Now it gets relocated to e4.
 [ R x f2 ]  [ R d1 + ] , [ N e1 ]  Trebuia totusi incercat 28. T[ [ f1 ] ] [ N c5 ] 29. C[ [ e3 ] ] N[ [ e3 ] ] 30.D[ [ e3 ] ] T[ [ f1 ] ] 31.R[ [ f1 ] ] f[ [ e3 ] ] 32. Cd4.
 [ h5 ]  [ N f4 ]  [ B f7 ] , [ c4 ]  37. [ c4 ] - to try and screen out the black lsb but black can open up that diagonal with an exchange of one pair of pawns on the queenside.
 [ Q h7 ]  [ R e h8 ] , [ R x d8 ]  The truth is that I can play someting like QxR and his Q is still trapped but...
 [ N c6 ] , [ a3 ]  This is an unusual move for me but I wanted to reduce the risk of doubled pawns on c
 [ N f3 ]  [ B b4 ] , [ B d3 ]  I feel its more important to protect the pawn rather than block the pin by playing [ B d2 ] so i play [ B d3 ] instead.
 [ O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ a3 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ R f e1 ]  [ R f e8 ]  [ R a c1 ] , [ R a c8 ]  16. ........ [ R a c8 ] - battle for control of e file and c file.
 [ N g6 ]  [ b4 ] , [ B e7 ]  Black is preparing to do just that. Now I need to activate my QN an connect my Rooks.
 [ d6 + ]  [ K e6 ]  [ B c4 + ]  [ K d7 ] , [ B x f7 ]  ? I wouldn't have done this it loses his passed pawn.
 [ B c2 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ B e4 ]  [ b5 ]  [ c x b5 ] , [ Q x b5 ]  24. ....... [ Q x b5 ] - one pair of pawns have been exchanged and I have a queenside pawn majority. This looks good for the endgame so I now try and exchange queens. This happens a few moves later on move 28.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ B b5 ]  Typical Ruy Lopez opening
 [ R a d1 ]  [ B x e5 ]  [ R d c1 ]  [ B x c7 ]  [ R x c5 ]  [ b6 ]  [ R x c6 ]  [ R b7 ] , [ R e c1 ]  winning the Bishop after 23. ...[random move] 24. [ R x c7 ] E[ x c7 ] 25. [ R x c7 ]  [ a6 ]  [ R c6 x c7 ]  [ R x c7 ]  [ R x c7 ] , [ R d8 ]  threatening back rank mate by [ R d1 # ]  [ B e6 ]  [ R b7 ]  [ R d2 ]  [ R b8 + ]  [ K g7 ]  [ R x b6 ]  [ R x a2 ]  [ R d6 ]  [ R a5 ]  [ R d8 ]  [ B b3 ]  [ R a8 ]  [ R a3 ] , [ K h2 ]  bringing the king out at the end of the game and avoiding 33. ...[ R a1 + ]  [ R a7 ]  [ K f6 ] , [ f4 ]  taking away escape squares [ e5 ] and g5.
 [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ] , [ B c5 ]  All standard and reasonable so far remember not just the moves in an opening their sequence too
 [ g6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ B g7 ]  Black tries to seize the diagonal.
 [ B e2 ] , [ B x d4 + ]  Initiating a nice sequence.
 [ K d7 ]  [ R x e4 ]  [ B x d2 ] , [ R g4 ]  notice that now white is attacking! usually in this variation white is put into the defensive stance too soon due to the lack of development but in this 8.. [ N x e4 ] variation the initiative is again goes back to white.
 [ B d3 ] , [ e6 ]  without completely his development it is practically impossible for black to drive the knight away
 [ N d5 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ N x e3 ]  [ Q x e3 ]  [ N x d4 ] , [ Q x d4 ]  IT'S YOUR TURN
 [ O-O-O ]  [ R x e6 ]  [ Q c4 ] , [ R d8 ]  prevents the fork from [ d5 ]  [ N b5 ]  [ B x d2 + ] , [ R x d2 ]  I don't like this move from white not that there was a lot better that I can see it allows [ R e1 + ]  [ R e1 + ] , [ K c2 ]  I was expecting [ R d1 ]  [ N b4 + ] , [ K b3 ]  This is probably the best of the options as [ K c3 ] loses to [ N d5 + ] [ Q x d5 ] (forced due to threat of [ K b3 ] Qxa2#) [ N x d5 ] and white is lost
 [ B x d3 ] , [ Q x d3 ]  that was sure ! but i found a response whith [ B f3 ] if he take it then i take it back whith the rook a treat the black queen
 [ N f3 ] , [ N f6 ]  A decent progression but off of book. Good intuitive play early for someone new to chess.
 [ B d3 ]  [ Q b6 ] , [ O-O ]  So your b pawn was undefended then you left your d pawn undefended with Bd3. So I fork them! Always look at what is defended or attacked for both sides.
 [ B x c6 ]  [ B x c6 ]  [ d4 ] , [ e x d4 ]  Opening the e-file.
 [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ a6 ] , [ h3 ]  Lots of side pawn movement.
 [ Q d6 + ]  [ K g7 ] , [ K g5 ]  Black's pieces just continue to surround the king while the rooks are only onlookers who can throw in annoying checks every now and then. Black wants to continue the mating attack with [ Q h6 ] [ K f7 ] [ Q h7 ] forcing the king to the back rank. A queen and bishop is a powerful attacking combo on the open board.
 [ B x d5 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ Q x d5 ] , [ B a6 ]  Now white has a real problem to solve- his king. Also the bishops are in contact with the white army and could attack the weaknesses. White really has no tactic chances vs black. OK black did have to sacrifice a pawn to do it but so what? White cannot promote that extra pawn. The desciption fits the typical club player who in this case is stronger than average. He likes material and highly values it so subconsciously rejected ...[ N d5 ] as being good for white since he wins a pawn. He is willing to go through these troubles since he has the pawn. In my opinion he is fighting a losing battle.
 [ B x h2 + ] , [ K h1 ]  If 10. [ K x h2 ] then 10. .... [ N g4 ] and Black wins the knight by discovered attack. This allows White to continue to threaten [ e6 ] and material gain but Black is too quick for him.
 [ a x b6 ] , [ N b5 ]  Eyeing the [ d6 ] square and the [ f7 ] pawn.
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ a6 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ f3 ]  [ b5 ]  [ a4 ]  [ b4 ]  [ N a2 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N b3 ]  [ d5 ] , [ B g5 ]  M: A possible other route would be 11. e4[ x d5 ] Nf6[ x d5 ] 12. [ B f2 ] [ B f6 ] 13. [ B c4 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ B x e4 ]  [ Q x d1 + ]  [ R x d1 ]  [ R a7 ] , [ B x f6 ]  M: I would not have given away the pair of Bishops even though that weakened my pawn structure. Maybe 15. [ B e3 ] occupying the long diagonal.
 [ N f6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ h6 ]  [ O-O ] , [ O-O ]  Just normal development the last few moves.
 [ B x e4 ]  [ d x e4 ] , [ Q c2 ]  Now [ e4 ] is hanging. If [ f5 ] [ e x f6 ] (ep) and my dsb comes alive.
 [ e x f4 ]  [ R x f4 ]  [ B h6 ]  [ R f1 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ N d5 ]  Nd5!! attacking [ N f6 ] take me plz!
 [ K a2 ]  [ K d3 ] , [ K b1 ]  His plan made sence now. Forced mate in 6
 [ g4 ]  [ R c8 ]  [ Q g2 ] , [ N g3 ]  ?? Chess blindness. I completly forgot about gxf5. The point here was that if [ Q x g3 ] then Bxd3. But like I say I forgot about gxf5. [ B d7 ] was the only way to go I think.
 [ b3 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ R c1 ]  [ R b8 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ a6 ]  [ a4 ]  [ N a7 ]  [ R a1 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ O-O ]  [ b5 ]  [ a x b5 ]  [ a x b5 ]  [ Q c1 ]  [ R f c8 ] , [ e5 ]  this is the move
 [ R g2 ]  [ Q x g2 ] , [ Q x g2 + ]  And bam! Black's position has cracked badly I have an open file to his king.
 [ N f6 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f d7 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ c5 ]  [ c3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ N d f3 ]  ? I shouldn't of played that because I should of done Ne2.
 [ B e2 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ Q a4 ]  [ B d7 ] , [ Q b3 ]  Should have caught this but here is where I make a blunder and get behind early.
 [ Q e1 + ]  [ K h2 ]  [ Q e5 + ]  [ f4 ] , [ Q h8 ]  28. ..... [ Q h8 ] - the trade is forced because the Witch is pinned to her king!
 [ a4 ]  [ B h8 ]  [ R c1 ]  [ f6 ]  [ R b1 ]  [ f x g5 ] , [ K x g5 ]  44. [ K x g5 ] - pawn trade. Now the [ c3 ] pawn drops off. White can play [ R c1 ] skewering Fou Lenoir and my [ c4 ] knight but Fou Lenoir can move out of the skewer with a bishop fork on [ d2 ] winning the rook and no doubt that if I was white I would certainly wave the white flag!
 [ Q e2 ] , [ R f c8 ]  And still I think [ B g5 ] would be better for me......
 [ N g6 ] , [ e5 ]  Which of course I do... and in the process I handed over a knight in exchange for a pawn. Can I get a mulligan?
 [ B e2 ]  [ B c2 ] , [ B x c4 ]  Finally material equality though not for long and I now have a passed pawn too
 [ B x d4 ] , [ B b5 + ]  White's first priority should be to get Black's bishop off the a7-[ g1 ] diagonal so the best move here is 12 Nb5. Black will have at best a minimal edge after the bishop retreats to [ f6 ] or [ g7 ] (e.g. 12 ... B[ f6 ] 13 [ B e3 ] 0-0 14 [ R d1 ] [ B f5 ] 15 [ B e2 ] [ B e4 ] 16 0-0 [ N x d5 ] 17 [ B c4 ] [ e6 ] 18 [ B x a7 ] [ R x a7 ] 19 Nxa7) and White gets a bonus if Black falls into 12 ... Bc5? 13 Qc3.
 [ R b7 ]  [ N a3 ] , [ K e5 ]  regreful move 51.Rb8! (51...[ K c7 ] 52.Rb3!) forces [ B c8 ] which allows me to grab the pawn on g6.
 [ R g7 ] , [ Q f8 + ]  He saw mate was inevitable and resigned.
 [ c5 ]  [ e4 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ N g5 ]  [ g6 ] , [ Q f3 ]  threatens kamshaft mate
 [ R e2 e3 ] , [ B c4 ]  Black is trying to force an exchange but instead of allowing it white can now play the move that I talked about earlier. And that's the move that seals black fate once and for all.
 [ N c4 ]  [ R d8 ]  [ Q e6 ]  [ Q g5 ] , [ N e3 ]  A blunder although loss of some material appears inevitable.
 [ e5 ] , [ c3 ]  Preparing [ d4 ] and taking the game into quite an unusual branch of the Philladors
 [ B f5 ] , [ e3 ]  Reinforce my control on the center.
 [ B x e5 ] , [ f x e5 ]  Minor piece exchange. Whilst the knights are generally better than bishops in a closed position this is actually an inaccuracy from Black. I attack the knight with my pawn...
 [ B f1 ] , [ a4 ]  Attacking. My advantage is 3.56 pawns.
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ e3 ]  White avoids [ c4 ] which allows me to play my Budapest. This move always left me with uninteresting choices ([ f5 ] [ b6 ] [ c5 ] - this last one very interesting but again into very well-studied openings.
 [ B g7 ] , [ B e3 ]  preparing for the long rochade (castling) what brings his queen´s rook in. and gives white a strong pair of bishops which hold their position up to the 19th move.
 [ K d2 ]  [ N c x d5 ] , [ e x d5 ]  This exchange I believe came out in my favor. He lost his bishop and (eventually) pawn occupying center squares while my knight moved in on this precious real estate.
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ h3 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ B f4 ] , [ e6 ]  The game started out innocently enough...
 [ B e3 ] , [ N g3 + ]  [ N g3 ] Kiss the rook goodbye.
 [ R a7 ]  [ h4 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ B x e4 ] , [ R d8 ]  Wait what? Knight for nothing?
 [ Q d5 + ] , [ R g5 ]  [ K h6 ] would have been better as we will see..
 [ d3 ] , [ N e7 ]  An uncalled for retreat. The direct 10. ... [ d6 ] was in order. [ d5 ] is playable as well although the result is an isolated King's pawn.
 [ K x h4 ] , [ Q f4 + ]  24. .............. [ Q f4 ] - closing in if white blocks the check by playing [ g4 ] then Qx[ g4 ] is mate. If white plays his king to [ h3 ] then again [ Q h4 ] is mate. [ K h5 ] is white's only legal alternative but it prolongs the game for just one more move.
 [ K f1 ]  [ Q f6 ] , [ c x d3 ]  I trade my knight for your doubled pawns thats cool.
 [ g3 ]  [ h5 ] , [ c3 ]  Better would have been [ c4 ] either forcing the e.p. capture or [ b x c4 ]  [ c5 ] , [ c x d4 ]  Better should have bee [ c4 ] to try and close up the game to try and make something out of the material disadvantage rather than allowing an open file as a result of [ c x d4 ]  [ c x d4 ] , [ R e2 ]  Error should have been [ R c1 ] to command the newlt opened file
 [ b5 ]  [ B f1 ] , [ R e8 ]  black got a nice position.
 [ Q f2 ]  [ Q c3 ]  [ R c8 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ Q a7 ] , [ Q a5 ]  wins the pawn on [ d6 ]  [ Q d4 ]  [ Q a6 ] , [ R c5 ]  The last major mistake. 42... [ R c7 ] 43. [ Q b5 ] [ R c8 ] 44. [ Q b3 ] [ Q a7 ] 45. [ B e3 ] [ R b8 ] 46. [ Q c2 ] is unclear
 [ B a4 ]  [ R f d8 + ]  [ K e2 ]  [ N d4 + ]  [ B x d4 ]  [ R x d4 ]  [ B b3 + ]  [ K g7 ] , [ R b2 ]  This may look like it saves the pawn but it doesn't.
 [ a4 ] , [ N h7 ]  I would've expected ... [ b g4 ]  [ b3 ] , [ Q f6 ]  Opening for the bish but dangerous for Her Majesty ...
 [ R e2 ]  [ R a c8 ]  [ B e3 ] , [ Q c6 ]  I offered queens exchange here having a pawn plus and solid position
 [ R a d1 ] , [ N x d5 ]  threatens to fork the rooks but I need to get my rook safe first if white breaks the pin
 [ R g4 + ]  [ Q g5 ] , [ B x f6 ]  The bishop at this square is a monster and completely decides the game. It should be mentioned that the simple 19.[ R x g5 ] [ f x g5 ] can be followed with 20.Qd4! [ f6 ] 21.[ B c4 ] Kh8? 22.Qx[ f6 ] Rx[ f6 ] 23.Bxf6#. Instead allowing the queen sac black should play 21...Kg7. I didn't bother calculating all those murky lines as the black king has more moves. Besides I had already found a winning method simple enough.
 [ e3 ]  [ N f6 ] , [ h3 ]  Discussed if a loss of time or not. My bet is a queenside castling and a pawn's storm on the kingside. That's why I play this.
 [ e5 ] , [ B c4 ]  He he plays the bc4. I looked at the opponents history and he seems to favor the 4 move checkmate.
 [ e x f5 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ g x f5 ]  [ Q f3 ] , [ B d2 ]  Kind of pointless
 [ Q x f1 + ]  [ R x f1 ] , [ h5 ]  Looking to make a final blow to whites defense.
 [ f3 ] , [ B d5 ]  [ c4 ] cxB cxB [ Q x d5 ] was ok to me.
 [ B x f2 ]  [ d4 ]  [ K x g6 ]  [ d5 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ K x h4 ]  [ K f5 ] , [ K h3 ]  I offer a draw after this move. Declined.
 [ b3 ] , [ B c5 ]  Black wants to open up the center.
 [ a x b6 ]  [ N x b6 ]  [ N a6 ] , [ R x a6 ]  Here he gave a rook for a Knight
 [ R e1 ]  [ Q x b5 ]  [ f3 ] , [ N x f3 ]  I probably shouldn't have done that. As it were his pawn would have been a better blocker for my king than my pawn would.
 [ N x b3 ]  [ d3 ]  [ K f2 ]  [ f5 ]  [ K e3 ]  [ e4 ]  [ f x e4 ]  [ f x e4 ]  [ B c1 ]  [ K b7 ]  [ K x e4 ]  [ K a6 ]  [ K x d3 ]  [ N x a5 ]  [ N x a5 ]  [ K x a5 ]  [ K d4 ]  [ K b4 ] , [ K d5 ]  Black resigns.
 [ Q x c6 ] , [ b4 ]  Aha! Having survived his blunder white finds a way to win a pawn (the orginal misguided intent of 25. a4?)
 [ R d5 ]  [ R b x c5 ]  [ R d x c5 ]  [ B x c5 ] , [ R a8 ]  after this move I had exactly 5 minutes left on the clock so stopped recording my moves. The following moves are translated from my opponent's Hungarian scoresheet.
 [ K c6 ] , [ Q d7 + ]  41. [ Q d7 + ] - I now set up the conditionals as it is # on the next turn. Notice in the final position Fou Lenoir could also deliver mate on [ d8 ] but the way I feel at the moment I just want Glenda to be putting her stamp on proceedings as she is not called Glenda the Defender for nothing. I may have a few more annotations in the pipeline but for now watch this space ......
 [ e4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ d4 ] , [ d5 ]  The French; my favorite!
 [ N c3 ] , [ R x a3 ]  The fruits of a successful attack? No The win of the pawn is illusory and transitory...
 [ g6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ B g7 ]  This opening is called the King's Indian defence. Black allows White to set up a big centre
 [ Q x f6 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ R x d6 ] , [ B e7 ]  Not surprisingly Jack attacks my R.
 [ K c2 ]  [ Q b2 + ]  [ K d1 ] , [ B c3 ]  This move had to be made otherwise white manages to hold. For example 40...[ Q b1 + ] 41.[ Q c1 ] [ Q x c1 + ] 42.[ K x c1 ] just throws it away.
 [ B x e7 ]  [ Q x e7 ]  [ e x d6 ]  [ Q x d6 ]  [ N x d5 ] , [ c x d5 ]  Of course: 13. ...[ e d5 ] allows white to gain a tempo for development and an attack after 14. Re1.
 [ g6 ] , [ Q h6 ]  Instead of retreating I advance with the same plan of winning the Rook. Yet it's still possible for Ted to retreat his B.
 [ N x e5 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ Q x d1 + ] , [ K x d1 ]  And I would've captured with 10.[ N x d1 ] in order to maintain castling rights. I don't what it is but there's something about castling which is not as good here as otherwise Carlsen would've taken with his N.
 [ a4 ] , [ R d3 ]  Putting pressure on [ b3 ] [ c3 ] [ e3 ] and vacating d8.
 [ Q c7 ] , [ f5 ]  White hastens to attack while Black's king is still in the centre.
 [ N b8 ] , [ N e5 ]  Trying to retain the nuisance of the c pawn.
 [ B x e6 ] , [ f x e6 ]  Here I wanted to remove the knight because I was not happy with it up in my face he could easily clear pieces from the centre or put pressure on me by playing [ d5 ]  [ B x d4 ]  [ e x d4 ]  [ N e2 ]  [ e5 ] , [ N g3 ]  Moving the attack to the kingside
 [ K h8 ]  [ B c3 + ]  [ f6 ]  [ B x f6 + ] , [ R x f6 ]  The only move
 [ Q x f4 ] , [ Q a5 ]  White Queen four moves my Queens first move pinning the Knight on the King. Best move for white castle King-side. I basically have forced him now into casling on the side that I thought he would castle on and have therefore been setting my pieces up for.
 [ N e4 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ f x e4 ]  [ f5 ] , [ B c2 ]  Better for him to exchange pawns? But probably I would have taken with the bishop. Or [ B b3 ] creating some threat on e6. Anyway not easy for white. To tell the truth there was not any "blunder" by white. Simply small half-weak moves... but that is all it's needed to lose a game.
 [ B d7 ] , [ Q b3 ]  I had the feeling that [ N x b8 ] would have lost to [ N x e5 ] threatening the queen. I thought this was smart.
 [ f x e5 ]  [ Q x e5 ]  [ B x c5 ] , [ R f e8 ]  Black is dropping material like Hansel dropping bread crumbs.
 [ K g6 ]  [ g3 ]  [ h6 ]  [ N h3 ]  [ e4 + ]  [ K c2 ] , [ d4 ]  32. ......... [ d4 ] - the central pawns look really menacing.
 [ B g2 ]  [ Q h2 ] , [ Q h1 ]  White looks for revenge. If I play wrongly I'll get in trouble along the h column. I better don't allow g6.
 [ Q x a7 ] , [ B f7 ]  Retreating the bishop looking for a way to remove the queen from the a7-[ g1 ] diagonal.
 [ Q d3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ] , [ B x d5 ]  buh bye strong bisschop
 [ R e8 ]  [ Q f2 ]  [ R g8 ]  [ Q b2 ] , [ Q d6 ]  This guards the King against checks and at the same time keeps the Knight from approaching as long as the KBP is not protected.
 [ K h8 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ N x f6 ] , [ R x g7 ]  Exclam! A brilliant sacrifice! If 21...[ K x g7 ] then 22 [ Q g5 ] [ K h8 ] 23 [ Q x f6 ] [ K g8 ] 24 [ R g1 ] [ B g6 ] 25 [ f x g6 ] and forced mate is coming after 26 [ g x h7 ] [ K x h7 ] 27 [ Q g7 # ] or 22...[ B g6 ] 23 [ f x g6 ] and forced mate follows. A quicker death is 25...[ h x g6 ] 26 [ R x g6 # ] all thanks to the bishop in the corner pinning the pawn.
 [ b x c3 ] , [ Q b7 ]  Now this also prevents 22.[ e5 ] because [ d5 ] would be hanging.
 [ d x e5 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ Q x e5 ] , [ Q c2 ]  The point of this strong move is to prevent ... [ Q f5 ] and also poisons the "d" pawn
 [ K c6 ]  [ B g1 ]  [ a5 ]  [ N b3 ] , [ B d5 ]  Of course not 36 ...a4? 37 [ N d4 ] !
 [ N f5 ] , [ B b4 ]  (!)
 [ d4 ]  [ g6 ] , [ B x h6 ]  I think that every time someone has taken that Knight I end up winning.
 [ N x f3 ]  [ e x f3 + ] , [ K f2 ]  This is the triangulation I was alluding to earlier since the K was originally on [ g1 ] went to [ g2 ] earlier and has now traveled to f2. As I learned from Susan Polgar in endgames this is very damaging. That is the "systematic method" that I once learned about since it involves trigonometry. The idea is that the K has now gone in a triangle which is known to be problematic for the opponent.
 [ c3 ]  [ O-O ] , [ Q c1 ]  13. [ Q c1 ] - preparing a move such as Bh6.
 [ N x f4 ] , [ R g5 ]  ??
 [ c5 ] , [ N c3 ]  The closed Sicilian is somehow not very popular. The Black can be comfortable and probably the best line is 2. [ N f3 ] or 2. c3; but it's a very sharp and extremely entertaining opening.
 [ K x d2 ] , [ N e4 + ]  Here my opponent resigned I would be up another piece no matter what he played. I was hoping he would play a greedy blunder for the poetic sacrifice to stop the mate 14. [ d3 ] [ Q x g5 ] 15. [ K x e4 ] [ N b4 + ] 16. [ B c6 ] [ B x c6 + ] 17. [ Q x c6 ] [ N x c6 ] but I was happy to take the win none the less.
 [ B e6 + ]  [ K h8 ] , [ B c1 ]  Down 9 points all even trades favor black.
 [ N c3 ] , [ Q d4 ]  Blacks trying to hold on to the extra pawn. As it can't be done I suspect this is a bad move.
 [ O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ B x e4 ] , [ c5 ]  This is not a good move. White's bishop is in the dead centre of the board attacking all sides while black's sits at home. In a better move black could regain some tempo in development with kt[ f6 ] which would in addition supply the knight to contest for control in the centre of the board and help defend the king. As it stands however black's king's side is undefended while white has bishop knight and queen all poised to attack black's king with space in which the rooks can develop. After move 12 black is in trouble.
 [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ Q x d5 ] , [ c4 ]  after a swap of pawns and knights i threatened his queen
 [ d x c3 ] , [ B c4 ]  Giving up a second pawn...
 [ e4 + ]  [ K g4 ] , [ B e2 + ]  As her d-pawn must fall Black seeks compensation elsewhere: the White h-pawn.
 [ R d8 + ]  [ K c1 ]  [ R e2 ] , [ h6 ]  A pawn sac to open up lines to my king???
 [ B x e6 + ]  [ K x e6 ]  [ K b3 ]  [ R c8 ]  [ B d4 ] , [ B h2 ]  Oh I like Qc2+. That leaves us 29. [ K a3 ] [ R c3 + ] 30 B[ x R c3 ] Q[ x B c3 + ] 31. [ K a4 ] Qb4#. But let's see what happens.
 [ K a2 ] , [ N c4 ]  Mating in this corner takes more work since the blockading knight is further away. Once White is restricted to two squares Black needs 4 knight moves to complete the mate. The blockading knight needs 2 moves to get to a square stalemating White's king and the other knight needs 2 moves to deliver checkmate. The only problem is that White's pawn will only need 2 moves to promote if the blockading knight moves so one of the 4 knight moves needs to be a check so that mate will occur the same move the pawn promotes.
 [ B e3 ] , [ Q c7 ]  Loses a piece. [ Q d8 ] had to be played. Edit: [ c5 ] had to be played. [ Q d8 ] loses the knight after b6.
 [ B f6 ]  [ R c1 ]  [ Q g3 ] , [ d6 ]  Before I said "the disaster begins".....Now i can explain. I decided to bet all for white's promoting and let black take white pawns........Happens.
 [ K e3 ]  [ a5 ]  [ K d4 ]  [ K h7 ]  [ g3 ] , [ K g6 ]  
 [ c6 ] , [ B b2 ]  Fritz recommends 11. [ B f4 ] (-0.19) [ B f4 ] still seems like a good move. My thought was that by placing my bishop on [ b2 ] I could establish a long-term threat against the King's region of the board.
 [ R x f4 ]  [ B x a2 ]  [ K f2 ] , [ B d5 ]  This is what might have followed. White has no clear way of threatening black's free pawn... And no clear way to start an attack againgst black's King... Of course white must win this in the end. My opponent preferred to resign alltogether...
 [ Q x b5 ]  [ B x a8 ]  [ c5 ]  [ d x c5 ]  [ Q x c5 ] , [ Q f3 ]  Why didn't I defend my Bishop? I don't remember. Was I sacrificing it for a mate solution in my head? I can't find that now for all I know I've left him to die.
 [ e5 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ N g3 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ d x e5 ] , [ d x e5 ]  The game keeps going Baco misses his hoes.
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ] , [ e5 ]  4... [ e5 ] is a mistake in this opening.
 [ B e2 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ N b d7 ] , [ R a c1 ]  11. [ R a c1 ] - putting rook on the same file as Glenda - good idea!
 [ c5 ] , [ N a3 ]  What the ..? Yes...[ N a3 ] is a slightly differing way to stick it to the book worm early..
 [ B b3 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ d3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B g5 ] , [ N d4 ]  Here is where the game gets interesting.
 [ K x h8 ] , [ N x g5 ]  Threatening [ N x f7 ] so black has no time to play Ng7. Still [ N x e6 ] was a good sac chance.
 [ N d2 ]  [ a6 ] , [ c4 ]  Positional flaw in my opinion.
 [ B x e4 ]  [ f x e4 ] , [ N x e4 ]  As you see [ b5 ] not only did a bad job but also this soldier moved to a place from where White's sniper got a clear and easy shot.
 [ O-O ] , [ d3 ]  White has constructed a Hedgehog-like pawn wall on the third row.
 [ f x e6 ] , [ N f3 ]  Getting ready for The Center: Round 2.
 [ f4 ]  [ b x c3 ]  [ f x e5 ]  [ c x b2 ] , [ Q x d4 ]  This is a real blunder. I don't understand why white would give away the rook. I would have a nice endgame with a [ b2 ] pawn ready to queen in the best variation.
 [ e4 ] , [ c6 ]  Though the Caro-Kann and I had somewhat of a falling out a little way ago because I kept getting in traps and tactics from white I began to believe in its power again after I won a wonderful game against a street chess hustler in Kiev.
 [ R e5 + ]  [ K f6 ] , [ R f1 + ]  Black's king is now disconnected from the game. White's material advantage will start to tell
 [ N x d5 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ R x d5 ] , [ e6 ]  And with Charles hit's the Rook. When Janet retreats black will attack the Queen afterwhich white will her Queen (put it directly behind the Rook) which is typical during the late phases of the midgame as well as the endgame.
 [ B x c3 + ]  [ Q x c3 ] , [ N f6 ]  At this point Black is going to lose one of his hanging pawn. He decides to save the g pawn and keep open the option to castle behind a solid pawn structure.
 [ Q d4 ] , [ c5 ]  Threaten white queen to get it move away. Another purpose of this move is so black can move the pawn a step further and block white's bishop on a2. This move has a third purpose which will become evident later.
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ B f4 ] , [ N c6 ]  As I don't remember seeing 2. [ B f4 ] ever before I decided to open cautiously and play a reactive game until the position established itself.
 [ R e8 ]  [ Q c2 ]  [ h6 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ d x c4 ]  [ B x c4 ]  [ a6 ]  [ O-O ] , [ b5 ]  This move is a dangerous one when I push the pawn it leaves my knight unprotected but my next move will be fianchettoing the bishop.
 [ R g3 ] , [ O-O-O ]  an offensive castle best way to bring my rook into the action
 [ b6 ] , [ Q h2 ]  threating mate with [ Q x h7 ]  [ N d2 ]  [ b5 ]  [ b3 ]  [ a5 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ b4 ] , [ Q h5 ]  he moved his queen???
 [ h4 ] , [ h5 ]  Black usually plays [ h5 ] to slow down whites attack. Because time is really crucial in this opening.
 [ K x g5 ] , [ R a3 ]  Wins a pawn.
 [ e4 ]  [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ B b5 + ]  [ N c6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B d6 ]  [ R e1 + ]  [ N g e7 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ B x h2 + ]  [ K x h2 ]  [ Q x d5 ] , [ d4 ]  White must strike quickly.
 [ h6 ] , [ g3 ]  Just in case of a attempted back rank.
 [ f3 ]  [ e x f3 ]  [ B x f3 ]  [ R x d2 ]  [ R x d2 ]  [ R d8 ]  [ Q g2 ]  [ R x d2 ]  [ Q x d2 ]  [ Q d7 ] , [ Q g2 ]  24. [ Q g2 ] - eschews queen swap and puts pressure on c6. A knight swap now follows.
 [ h3 ]  [ h5 ] , [ B a3 ]  Alternative variation: 16. [ Q f4 ] [ N b4 ] 17. [ R a d1 ] [ c5 ] $14
 [ a3 ]  [ a5 ]  [ R h5 ]  [ b4 ] , [ g4 ]  Black cannot ignore the g pawn since [ g5 ] wins the bishop. Either way though white will most likely lose due to material.
 [ K d6 ] , [ K f5 ]  The KP must now fall. Black resigns.
 [ B g5 ] , [ B x f2 + ]  White othesaw this move
 [ R a7 + ]  [ K c6 ]  [ B x f4 ] , [ B d7 ]  ok...ok... I can deal with some more trading.
 [ N e5 + ]  [ K d6 ]  [ N x g6 ]  [ h x g6 ]  [ d x e4 ] , [ N a6 ]  Trying to open up lines for my dsb and defend it again so I can move my [ h8 ] rook.
 [ N c6 ]  [ b4 ]  [ b6 ] , [ N b d2 ]  I'm still not sure that something like [ B e3 ] may have been better here.
 [ N x e5 ]  [ d x c3 ]  [ N x c3 ] , [ Q e7 ]  The open E file is a blatant target and by moving his queen there black makes a mistake.
 [ B x g5 ]  [ R h8 ]  [ R x h8 ]  [ Q x h8 ]  [ B f6 ] , [ Q h1 + ]  white resigns a rook down. Once again frustrated by geniusacamel who gave chances in the opening/middlegame which once again failed to capitalise on
 [ N b d7 ]  [ a4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ N a3 ] , [ B e7 ]  11. ...... [ B e7 ] - quick development ensues and on the next turn I will tuck Henry away on the kingside.
 [ f3 ] , [ g6 ]  25. ....... [ g6 ] - ah - I forgot to mention that with the exchange of knights the h file is open. Henry is rather draughty here but behold - my second rank is empty but for one piece - Glenda! If she senses danger to her other half she will be over there believe you me but first I have the seed of an idea of attacking the enemy king down the h file and it germinates over the next few moves and it will be me with the extra booty!
 [ Q c4 ]  [ e x d4 ] , [ e x d4 ]  28. [ e x [ d4 ] ] - Steve has that pawn for his piece but that pawn on [ d4 ] is isolated and it will soon be rounded up.
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ] , [ e5 ]  this is the Budapest counter gambit. I also play 2...[ c5 ] 3.[ d5 ] [ b5 ] the Benko gambit. Both of these give black durable counterplay. The benko gambit gives black long term queenside pressure and this gives black good piece activity.
 [ e x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ] , [ N x e4 ]  Whites Huge center is falling and the Austrian Attack is losing steam. And now blacks fianchetto's bishop and Queen are laying claim to important diagonals
 [ B x f6 ] , [ N x d7 ]  Now my strategy was based on the fact that the Black King hasn't castled yet.
 [ h x g4 + ] , [ K x g4 ]  Yep I'll win an extra pawn.
 [ N e3 ] , [ R b8 ]  Instead Fritz suggests ...11. [ Q a5 + ] 12. [ B d2 ] [ Q a4 ] which wins a pawn and also offers Black good chances on the queenside.
 [ B f4 ] , [ N e c6 ]  White moves the DB to [ f4 ] allowing the rook to get active if required. My knights still protect each other with the move of my [ e7 ] knight to c6.
 [ d x e4 ] , [ R d2 ]  planning to double up the rooks on the d-file - this turns out to be critical in the final position for White
 [ Q x e5 ]  [ d x e5 ] , [ N g7 ]  I can bring my rook in to support my passed pawn but first I need to neutralise the black knight I didn't want to exchange as it allowed the black king to get out easier
 [ K e7 ]  [ R x e8 + ]  [ K x e8 ] , [ K f2 ]  Waste of a move. I thought the bringing up the king was the solution but after I submitted this move I re-evaluated the pawn advance as being more direct.
 [ B b7 ] , [ B d3 ]  This move seems weird to me because it blocks the [ d3 ] pawn but I don't really have anywhere else to put it and it exercises important control over e4.
 [ a3 ] , [ B e7 ]  The correct move. Although in the [ a3 ] variaitons we normally take on [ c3 ] white will be able to liquidate the [ c4 ] weakness immediately.
 [ B a4 ]  [ R d2 ]  [ B b3 ] , [ h6 ]  Game note: "So 27.[ h6 ] with R lift to come soon. He needs to open his f-file for his R. But how do I land the final blow?"
 [ Q x c5 ]  [ R g6 ]  [ R a d1 ]  [ R e e6 ]  [ Q c8 + ]  [ K e7 ] , [ N d5 # ]  Well done Mike! This was a good thoughtful game and I really enjoyed it!
 [ N d5 + ]  [ K d7 ]  [ Q g4 + ]  [ f5 ] , [ Q x f5 # ]  That's all she wrote folks! Black's weak light squares conveniently provided White's pieces with beautiful staging grounds for a vicious assault. Many thanks to yellowbud for the game (I'll be annotating our rematch soon). Comments are much appreciated and as always thanks for reading!
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ c4 ]  [ g6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ e4 ]  [ N x c3 ] , [ b x c3 ]  Grunfeld defence exchange variation.
 [ g6 ]  [ Q x a5 ] , [ d5 ]  Stronger than 12...dc which would just help White develop. This counter-attack in the center is the best contintuation to fight for the initiative as White's queen is the only developed piece!
 [ Q h5 ] , [ Q e1 ]  Maybe 12. [ e5 ] was an even better option here. I think I wanted to avoid queen exchanges with it still on d1.
 [ N x e4 ]  [ B d2 ] , [ N f6 ]  Lesson #4: Don't be afraid to move your Queen somewhere else. Well that's the end of my techer's lessons because the teacher did the teacher trap sac.
 [ N b3 ]  [ c4 ] , [ N d4 ]  White is back in its strong position again :)
 [ R f2 ]  [ K e7 ] , [ R x g2 ]  White has survived well.
 [ Q x g2 ]  [ K c1 ]  [ Q x h2 ] , [ K b1 ]  Got my king out of the way for the loss of 2 more pawns
 [ N d5 ] , [ N a3 ]  20. [ N a3 ] - movement of that comatose queenside back row at last!
 [ N c e2 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ R c1 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ B c6 ]  [ e4 ] , [ N f6 ]  At this point I was just trying my best to hold on.
 [ K f3 ]  [ K g5 ]  [ N d2 ]  [ B a5 ]  [ N b1 ] , [ b4 ]  This gives White his opportunity. Now if neither side blunders a draw will result.
 [ Q d1 + ]  [ K c5 ]  [ Q c1 + ] , [ K d6 ]  Curiously Mark Dvoretsky gives the note "87. Kd5?! Qc8! but the tablebase shows that this wins for White in exactly the same number of moves as the text.
 [ d4 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ B d3 ] , [ B x d4 ]  I guess this is pawn pinching but it was free.
 [ d4 ]  [ B f4 ] , [ N b4 ]  At this point I'm just prodding him to see what happens. He has very little room to move and so lots of potential for getting hung up in his own pieces.
 [ K e6 ] , [ c6 ]  Passed pawns must be pushed
 [ Q h3 ]  [ B c8 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ N b6 ]  [ B x c8 ]  [ N x c8 ]  [ c x b5 ]  [ a x b5 ]  [ a4 ]  [ b x a4 ]  [ b x a4 ]  [ N e7 ]  [ Q a3 ]  [ R a6 ]  [ R d b1 ]  [ Q g4 ]  [ R b4 ]  [ Q g6 ]  [ R b8 + ]  [ K f7 ]  [ Q b4 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ Q b3 ]  [ R a7 ]  [ g3 ]  [ Q g4 ]  [ R a1 ]  [ N f5 ]  [ R b7 + ]  [ R x b7 ]  [ Q x b7 + ]  [ N e7 ]  [ R a3 ]  [ Q d1 + ]  [ K g2 ]  [ B c1 ]  [ R a1 ]  [ Q c2 ]  [ a5 ]  [ Q e4 + ]  [ K g1 ]  [ Q e1 + ]  [ K g2 ]  [ Q e4 + ] , [ K h2 ]  Almost had a draw by threefold repitition
 [ B e6 ] , [ R e1 ]  I didn't expect this move and am not certain what White is hoping to accomplish. I would have traded knight for bishop with [ N x e6 ] instead. However now that White is allowing me to get rid of one of his two power pieces on my half of the board I must partake. If you allow an opponent to have power pieces on your side of the board for a while they become liabilities quickly. Don't let them get established and drive them away or trade if it's not disadvantageous.
 [ R g6 ] , [ N f3 ]  Looking for a decent home and some play on the KS
 [ B d2 ]  [ Q b6 ] , [ c4 ]  I think I'm ready to commence my pawn assault!
 [ N c3 ] , [ N b6 ]  I don't like this retreat a whole lot; I think Black could just as well play 5...[ c6 ] or 5...[ B e6 ] and maintain his claim to the center.
 [ b5 ]  [ N e1 ]  [ R x c1 ]  [ K x c1 ]  [ N b4 ]  [ a3 ]  [ N d3 + ]  [ N x d3 ] , [ B x d3 ]  Rooks and Knights exchange.
 [ N b d7 ]  [ b4 ] , [ N e4 ]  in preparation for king side attack
 [ B e3 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ a3 ]  A bit of a "luxury"-move but [ N b4 ] by Black could be annoying.
 [ K h7 ]  [ Q f6 ]  [ K g8 ]  [ Q g6 + ]  [ K h8 ] , [ R f8 # ]  thanks for watching
 [ B d7 ] , [ b5 ]  limiting the scope of the bishop and threatening [ c6 ] with massive force. In the endgame I play very logical and methodical
 [ Q h4 + ] , [ K g1 ]  Maybe the best chance for defending although [ K f1 ] might give some chances too.
 [ N x d4 ] , [ N f6 ]  Attacking as yet undefended [ e4 ] pawn.
 [ e3 ] , [ h6 ]  Objectively a fine idea putting the question to the bishop in hopes of gaining the bishop pair. White doesn't want to retreat as he will then lose his bishop for two pawns without much hope of attack because of lack of development on the KS.
 [ d x e4 ] , [ N g5 ]  ? 19. [ K f2 ] [ e x f3 ] 20. [ R x e8 ] [ R x e8 ] 21. [ g x f5 ] [ R e2 ] 22. Kxf3etc.. Or even simpler [ N d2 ] which achieves the same thing as [ N g5 ] but prophylactically blocks the advance of my pawn on [ d3 ] once I've played ex[ d3 ] hence stopping the following combination..
 [ Q c2 ] , [ e5 ]  not sure if this is the answer for Black...
 [ h x g4 ]  [ K e3 ]  [ g5 ]  [ K f2 ]  [ f6 ]  [ R b8 ] , [ K h3 ]  The rook can't get my bishop or else his rook will be captured.
 [ N e5 ]  [ Q e2 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ Q d6 ]  I should have taken [ e4 ] I think
 [ N b6 ] , [ d4 ]  White has advanced two central pawns and a flank pawn with a strong central position. However white has not developed any minor pieces and the position may be vulnerable.
 [ R h2 ]  [ g x f6 ]  [ R x g2 ] , [ f7 ]  Black resigned here as there is no way to stop the pawn now. White can play [ Q e8 ] and force the pawn promotion.
 [ N h7 ] , [ N e2 ]  Well he blocked my pawn attack and immobilized my knight. I back up the bishop with my Queen to attack the pawn but [ g3 ] defeats that. It could be a distraction though that allows me to open the a rank. I think I may want to plug up that side fo the board though.
 [ d x e6 ] , [ B x e6 ]  White's pawns are definitely weaker now than they were a few moves back.
 [ B f2 ] , [ N h6 ]  I took some time to assess the threat with the black knight on f5. I decided it looked good but was well controlled by the B on f2. This gives me time to develop my knight to it's optimal square.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B c4 ] , [ B c5 ]  I played Italian becaue I don´t like the 2 Knight Opening (3. ..Nf6)
 [ K c1 ] , [ B g5 + ]  And there's the game. I only had two legal moves and neither were any good.
 [ e2 ]  [ K b7 ] , [ e1 = Q ]  ...however I get my queen. I was positive she could deal with all three pawns due to her mobility...
 [ K d2 ] , [ N x a1 ]  Winning the exchange as promised. Now if white plays 17. Qxc5?? black responds with 17. ... [ N b3 + ] and 18. ... [ N x c5 ] winning the white queen.
 [ N c3 ] , [ d6 ]  The Vienna Game. I don't know why white ever plays anything else. According to the GK and World databases pretty much everything in this opening favors white. The top 6 000 games in the Expert+ world DB all have higher winning chances for white than for black. Finally there are a mere 12 games that favor black with 2. ... [ f5 ] but the players who chose that were the lowest rated black players on the list... So I went with the option that gets played by masters and has the lowest incidence of draws.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ f5 ]  ?! The key move of the controversial Latvian Gambit. Very rarely seen at high levels Black gives up a pawn (and usually much more) for a lead in space and development.
 [ N e1 ]  [ N f5 ]  [ g4 ]  [ N d6 ]  [ N e1 f3 ] , [ N b7 ]  could i have a chance to fork his rooks ?
 [ e4 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ a6 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ N b d7 ]  [ f3 ]  [ e6 ] , [ g4 ]  white will pawn storm my king side...
 [ R d2 d8 + ]  [ K a7 ]  [ Q c5 + ] , [ b6 ]  Good blocking but Stonewall Crazy Knight had one battle left before retiree
 [ B f5 ] , [ N e1 ]  15. Ne1?! - Ion had this to say about this move. "But 15.[ N e1 ] was definitely a surprise. I thought I had the better of it after that. I had anticipated something like 15.[ N h4 ] [ B x c2 ] with this possible continuation: 16.[ N f5 ] [ B x f5 ] 17.[ Q x f5 ] Nxd4! 18.[ c x d4 ] [ Q d2 ] with a fork against both your bishops. Probably you would get one pawn back but you would probably have had to rely on a more active game for at least partial compensation for the other pawn deficit. Even after 15.[ N e1 ] though I don't think you were out of it until 18.Qe2. That really was a mistake though an understandable one. The only other move was 18.[ Q g3 ] ([ R x f1 ] 19.[ K x f1 ] [ R f8 ] 20.[ K e2 ] after which I was still tossing up whether to bring the Q back to [ d8 ] (preparing ...Bh4) or the N (preparing ...Ne6). Had your K dived back into the corner (20.Kg1) then it was definitely going to be the Q-move (20...Qd8)."
 [ N e8 ] , [ Q e7 ]  A strong move threatens mate in one if the R is taken and mate in two if nothing is done.
 [ N f6 ] , [ Q e5 ]  But no! He is not in least desirous of exchanging Queens!
 [ R d1 ] , [ N d6 ]  The defense again defends and attacks in the single move....
 [ g x f6 ] , [ N b d2 ]  ?! White can hardly be faulted for bringing his last piece into the game in most situations but here white needs to quickly harass the black king before he can consolidate.
 [ h3 ] , [ g x h3 ]  pretty much forced at this point I figured I could get my king in fast enough to prevent promotion
 [ B b3 ] , [ b5 ]  Inevitable. This validates 3. ... [ a6 ] and prepares to build a solid pawn chain to claim huge territory on the queenside. White's move 7. [ B b3 ] prevents black's 7. ... [ b5 ] from gaining a tempo so now white has time to prevent 8. ... c4.
 [ d6 ] , [ c3 ]  I can ignore the apparent threat to the [ e4 ] pawn because of nx[ e4 ] Bd5! It really is poisoned...
 [ g6 ] , [ K f1 ]  Someone has to go to prisoned bishop to kill.
 [ R c7 + ]  [ K f8 ] , [ R c2 ]  He sees that the challenge is fruitless but given that he had not resigned I expected them to continue until the rook was captured followed by [ b4 ] and a5.
 [ B c5 + ]  [ K h1 ]  [ h6 ]  [ N e4 ] , [ B e3 ]  I did not expect this. Looking back it was setup perfectly for after 12. [ N e4 ] to do this and I should have seen that. Had I just done 12. [ N f4 ] would he have gone back to d6? I doubt it looking at this position even [ N f4 ] would have allowed [ B e3 ] and retreat was not something my opponent ultimately needed to do in this game. With the enemy in the midst of my ranks I couldn't let it stand. So I exchanged and hoped to be able to hide the pawn under my knight so I could remove it as well.
 [ e4 ] , [ d6 ]  In such positions black often benefits from delaying the development of the kings knight. In this game I intend to get my knight into the game via [ e7 ] or h6. The idea is to plan and prepare for f7-[ f5 ] attacking white's weak e-pawn. Of course that is a long ways a way from now.
 [ c4 ] , [ e5 ]  C4 is what I think is the Queens Gambit opening. I followed with [ e5 ] which I knew could result in an early exchange of the Queens and remove my ability to castle.
 [ Q x f2 + ] , [ K h1 ]  Amazingly despite being the exchange and a pawn to the good Black is losing in all variations. Now best was ...[ Q f5 ] offering a trade of queens but Black's pinned [ R f7 ] gives White the best of any tactics.
 [ K c1 ]  [ Q c7 + ]  [ K b2 ]  [ R b8 + ] , [ K a2 ]  Sorry. Good game. You really are a good player. Just don't play when you are drunk next time.
 [ N x f6 + ]  [ e x f6 ]  [ N x f7 ]  [ R x f7 ]  [ B d5 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ K f8 ]  [ B x f7 ]  [ K x f7 ]  [ c3 ]  [ Q d7 ]  [ Q b3 + ]  [ Q e6 ]  [ B x d6 ]  [ Q x b3 ]  [ a x b3 ]  [ B f8 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ R d8 ]  [ R f d1 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ e5 ]  [ f5 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N b6 ]  [ e6 + ]  [ K f6 ]  [ B c7 ]  [ R d6 ]  [ B x b6 ]  [ R x b6 ]  [ R a c1 ]  [ K e5 ]  [ R d e1 + ]  [ K f6 ]  [ R c7 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ d6 ]  [ B x d6 ]  [ R f7 + ]  [ K g5 ]  [ R x h7 ]  [ B e4 ]  [ e7 ]  [ R b8 ]  [ f3 ]  [ B c6 ]  [ R e6 ]  [ B c5 + ]  [ K h2 ]  [ B d7 ]  [ R x a6 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ g3 ]  [ f4 ]  [ g4 ]  [ B x g4 ]  [ h x g4 ]  [ B x e7 ]  [ R e6 ]  [ R c8 ]  [ R h x e7 ]  [ R c2 + ]  [ K h3 ]  [ R x b2 ]  [ R g7 ]  [ K h6 ] , [ R e x g6 # ]  that was a my revenge on losing toi him twice because of stupid mistakes when he could have lost twice before - so finally i won!!!------- sorry about my spelling i hoped you enjoied the game!!
 [ N e5 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ] , [ R c8 ]  Development from both sides.
 [ a3 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ N c e3 ]  [ B x e3 ]  [ Q x e3 ]  [ B x d5 ] , [ R x d5 ]  Black exchanges off the remaining minor pieces. Black's main weakness is the backward [ d6 ] pawn. He also has 3 pawn islands to White's two but with all major pieces still on the board a draw is likely
 [ f x e5 ]  [ Q x h5 + ]  [ N g6 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ c x d5 ] , [ N x d5 ]  Whites pieces are coming down on the not castled black king.
 [ Q x h8 ] , [ f5 ]  23. [ f5 ] - supporting the passer.
 [ N x a4 ] , [ Q f3 ]  he really likes to move his queen around.
 [ b5 ]  [ a3 ] , [ a6 ]  Black knows that the greater rook mobility will ensure him the privilige to "waste" a move if he wants to. These pawn moves are to take that away from white.
 [ c x d5 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ f6 ]  I intended to develop my KN on [ h6 ] so this pawn move to fortify [ e5 ] is fine here.
 [ N f6 ] , [ N c3 ]  Developing defending. I'm back on track with general opening principles now but apparently so is my opponent.
 [ N c3 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ B f5 ] , [ N g3 ]  5. [ N g3 ] - Pitroque chooses to retreat his knight and attack the [ f5 ] bishop but would a developing move such as [ e3 ] been better?
 [ b5 ]  [ Q c2 ]  [ R f e8 ]  [ R f e1 ] , [ R c d8 ]  Seizes the open file.
 [ Q d3 + ] , [ N d2 ]  Now both knights are pinned. But no better was 34.[ R d2 ] [ B x c2 + ] 35.[ Q x c2 ] [ R b1 + ] 36.[ Q x b1 ] [ Q x b1 + ] etc.
 [ R x a2 ] , [ R x d7 ]  After the game Dave confessed he just didn't see this move. Computer prefers the Queen capture.
 [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ] , [ N h4 ]  That's the point. The pin is annoying and the white knight heads for f5.
 [ N x f7 ]  [ Q x g4 ]  [ Q f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ Q h5 ] , [ B e6 ]  white threats [ N d4 ]  [ c6 ]  [ Q x b7 ]  [ R c8 ] , [ Q x a7 ]  3 pawns = knight
 [ B b6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ e x d4 ] , [ N f x d4 ]  Now I thought I could do it but ...
 [ B e6 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ N b d7 ]  [ O-O-O ]  [ b5 ]  [ f3 ] , [ h5 ]  [ h5 ] is played to delay white from playing [ g4 ] as a follow up move after having played f3. Sicilian is all about delaying white to develop an attack on the kings side whilst building up your own attack on whites queens side
 [ R x f7 ] , [ R x f7 ]  One set of rook off the board.
 [ a5 ] , [ g3 ]  At this point Fritz gives a - evaluation meaning basically "a decisive advantage". I threaten [ R f2 ] exchanging the last pair of rooks and entering a won (really won) endgame
 [ N f3 ] , [ N e4 ]  He guards the pawn with his knight but now I can move my knight to [ e4 ] and attack his queen.
 [ B e7 ]  [ g3 ]  [ O-O ] , [ B g2 ]  Both players hasten to complete their development.
 [ R e3 ] , [ B d7 ]  At last the bishop lurches off its chuff - but much too late. Instead 39...[ B e6 ] would have been marginally better but who wants to give up material in a position already desperate?
 [ R f d1 ] , [ Q x d6 ]  and now he takes?
 [ g3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ B g2 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ R e8 ]  [ B f4 ] , [ N h5 ]  Perhaps a little early but the idea is simple: [ B f4 ] hits the weak [ d6 ] point in black's camp and with the [ f3 ] knight coming to [ c4 ] to intensify the pressure black must sooner or later push away the threats to get play on the QS
 [ N c3 ] , [ N g4 ]  Very risky move I was anticipating the queen taking it but then I was going to use a pawn to attack a bishop and open up an attack on the queen with my bishop
 [ R x a8 ]  [ d3 ] , [ N b3 ]  Still up eight points the knight/bishop trade is highly advised.
 [ B e2 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ h6 ]  [ d3 ] , [ e6 ]  White helped me with this passive opening.

 [ Q d5 ]  [ Q x d5 ] , [ N x d5 ]  Now I can confidently say that black is better.
 [ K x f4 ]  [ K x d3 ] , [ K x g4 ]  Thanks to kwaster for this interresting game. The attack begun on move 37 was really good leading to an fun edged to edged situation.
 [ N e4 ]  [ Q d3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ B f3 ]  [ f5 ]  [ R a b1 ]  [ N c5 ] , [ Q d2 ]  Until now white played logical and good moves but now his good judgements fails it was necessary to defend his bishop on [ f3 ] by plying 15.Qe2.
 [ Q c6 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ b6 ]  [ N b5 ]  [ N a6 ] , [ O-O ]  The attack on the pawn is failed so let's try to mix the cards
 [ R e8 ] , [ Q x d3 ]  I was a little concerned about a potential bish sac on [ f7 ] winning my queen if she wasn't covered but i wasn't going to let that stop me i felt i could deal with it and atm she is covered twice so....
 [ R x a4 ] , [ N b2 ]  Because of his last move without much to lose I decide to intimidate black with this move. And I was thinking in terms of trying to pull a swindle given that I'm now a pawn behind. However this plan is not going to work.
 [ N c6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B d7 ] , [ a3 ]  11. [ a3 ] - to prevent a move such as Nb4.
 [ Q x b8 + ]  [ K e7 ]  [ Q b7 ] , [ f x e4 ]  takes a poisoned pawn
 [ N c6 ] , [ N x e6 ]  This move was a mistake I should've moved [ c5 ] but i saw the fork on [ c7 ] and got a little too excited.
 [ Q x c3 ] , [ B b3 ]  28. Bb3?? The computer finds a nice winning combination with 28...c4! 29. [ B x c4 ] Ng4! With all sorts of ideas but the evaluation is not so clear
 [ O-O ]  [ d5 ] , [ N a5 ]  Knights on the rim are dim but I didn't feel like retreating to the starting position today.
 [ f5 ] , [ e x f5 ]  Here Is the sacrifice!
 [ N c3 ] , [ d6 ]  d7-[ d6 ] and e7-[ e5 ] is a common motif in the KID challenging White's central formation.
 [ a5 ] , [ b6 ]  Naturally I want to lock the position on this side.
 [ N c6 ]  [ N b5 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ N e5 ]  [ N x e5 ] , [ d x e5 ]  That's ugly. Two pieces unprotected. I think advancing the knight to [ b5 ] was premature. I considered [ N d6 ] but that doesn't look very healthy.
 [ B x f4 ]  [ Q f2 ]  [ B h2 + ]  [ K h1 ] , [ N e5 ]  20. ..... [ N e5 ] - here I am setting a trap. Now why is K x B a blunder here? An obbo. test here for the Inquest Jury.
 [ R g1 ] , [ B c5 ]  Black is certainly controlling the game right now. This move though is seen by the computer analysis as a inaccuracy and that [ Q h4 ] was best. So true for it threatens the [ h3 ] pawn and threatens mate in 1 on [ f2 ] with Qxf2#.
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B b5 ] , [ N f6 ]  But I didn't know he'd respond because there are moves like 3...[ a6 ] or 3...Nxe4?! as we know. However this was a conditional move as I don't deviate from mainlines with him. If I wanted to though I could with 4.[ N c3 ] which I have before. But I prefer to castle sooner then later.
 [ N e2 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ O-O ]  [ b6 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ B a6 ]  [ N g3 ]  [ N a5 ]  [ Q e2 ]  [ Q e8 ] , [ f4 ]  The energy in White's center begins to make itself felt.
 [ d x e6 ]  [ e ]  [ p ] , [ f x e6 ]  he's going to take the pawn in [ d6 ] but it doesnt matter
 [ B h4 ]  [ K c8 ] , [ N f3 ]  I didn't really want to trade two pieces for a rook here but 20. [ f5 ] [ R x e1 ] 21. [ B x e1 ] [ R x e1 ] 22. [ K f2 ] actually creates a rather dangerous situation for black as I will look to play [ f6 ] on the next turn winning the g-pawn and creating a passed pawn that is quite far advanced. Black will still have a lot of play in that position but I feel like I may have had a bit more chances in that line than the cautious one I took.
 [ Q f3 ]  [ N b6 ]  [ B g3 ] , [ Q g5 ]  again black misses undefended piece
 [ f5 ]  [ R b6 ]  [ K e6 ]  [ d7 + ] , [ K x d7 ]  Carlsen needs to push [ f4 ] now. This is an important pawn structure to hold.
 [ R x g7 ]  [ h x g7 ] , [ B h7 ]  Allows black to hold out a little bit longer.
 [ N f6 ] , [ h3 ]  Perhaps a bit negative I might have looked at developed your dark squared bishop possibly pinning the knight.
 [ B g5 ]  [ Q b6 ] , [ d x c5 ]  ?! Unexpected voluntarily weakening his pawn centre.
 [ Q d5 ]  [ c4 ]  [ Q d7 ]  [ c5 ]  [ R c6 ] , [ R h7 + ]  If Krstic follows up with 29 R-[ R8 ] Ujtumen would practically be forced to resign. But by now both men faced a severe time crunch.
 [ N x d5 ]  [ Q x d5 ] , [ B e6 ]  ...all developed...bishop pair connected rooks..weak pawn on c2...Sweet...

 [ N c3 ] , [ N h5 ]  ...switch wings to create threats and counterplay on all the weak squares created by White's pawn advances.
 [ B x c6 ] , [ R c8 ]  ?? At this point I realize that I can no longer attack his queen with my rook so I decide to attack his bishop. However this turns out to be another serious blunder because he will place me in a very serious check with 9.Bxd7+. What makes this serious? That will be answered shortly.
 [ N x c5 ]  [ R a8 ]  [ a6 ] , [ K e2 ]  Typically moving the king into the middle works in an end-game strategy.
 [ R e1 ] , [ R e8 ]  26. ..... [ R e8 ] - it is always a good idea to put your rook in line with the enemy queen. Leaves open a lot of pinning possibilities. If you have your queen in line with an enemy rook - beware!
 [ N a3 ]  [ N f5 ]  [ N b1 ]  [ N h6 ] , [ N a6 ]  with the extra move to Carlsberg's advantage he offers his knight to [ a6 ] so Jabborg may regain ground
 [ g4 ]  [ K g7 ] , [ R g1 ]  I don't understand this R move. Now White will be saddled with a target on g4.
 [ N c3 ]  [ N x d5 ]  [ N x d5 ] , [ e x d5 ]  Let's let the two lovely ladies have their time alone in the spotlight.
 [ h3 ] , [ B e4 ]  ..more pressure on the king..so i thought i need to re-route and bump that dark square bishop/....
 [ N h8 ]  [ b4 ]  [ B d8 ] , [ Q h6 ]  (j) The ingenuity of despair.
 [ O-O ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ R a d1 ] , [ a6 ]  Black provokes the bishop to either exchange or retreat.
 [ R h2 + ]  [ K g6 ]  [ Q e4 + ] , [ K x f6 ]  And the journey began.
 [ a5 ]  [ R d1 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ R e3 ]  [ R x e3 ] , [ Q x e3 ]  30. [ Q x e3 ] - rook trade but those 2 enemy bishops still look ominous.
 [ e5 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ N x e4 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ B f5 ] , [ N e2 ]  White has the dark squares under control and Black has the light squares somewhat under control.
 [ K d5 ]  [ N b3 ] , [ B c6 ]  Threatening [ K c4 ] winning the knight after the king moves out of check
 [ B x b7 ] , [ Q d7 ]  Black is going to put a lot of pressure on Bb7. But white can delay and get the rooks defending each other first.
 [ K c4 ]  [ Q c2 + ]  [ K d5 ] , [ d2 ]  ready for promotion
 [ R e1 ] , [ N e4 ]  He has to block it.
 [ h5 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ h4 ]  [ N e8 ]  [ N b5 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ K e3 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ N a7 ] , [ N x g5 ]  52. [ N x g5 ] - after a further set of knight moves - black can only shunt her knight from [ b5 ] to [ a7 ] - my knight ensures that another black pawn drops off. My own g pawn will drop off but the knight moves into a position where he defends both f and h isolanis.
 [ R f5 ]  [ Q b6 ]  [ N f4 + ] , [ K h6 ]  Leontxo says Capablanca could have won with 16. [ Q f7 ] never mind if black plays [ Q x e3 + ] 17. [ K h1 ] after which indicates [ g6 ] as the correct defence for black (white threats [ g4 ] - [ g5 # ] and if Nx[ g4 ] Rh5#). 18. [ N e6 ] (threatening mate) [ R g8 ] 19. [ N d5 ] [ Q x e4 ] 20. R[ x N f6 ] to which black answers with [ N f8 ] - losing. It seems a weird move but... Black cannot take N[ x R f6 ] because of 21. N[ x N f6 ] threatening the queen and mate in [ h8 ] AND the rook... ...and if black plays Qx[ N d5 ] white goes 21. Qx[ R g8 ] N[ x R f6 ] 22. [ Q g7 + ] [ K h5 ] (forced) and 23. [ N f4 + ] winning the queen! ... [ N e5 ] and with 21. [ Q x g8 ] white wins even if black goes: [ B x e6 ] 22. [ Q x e6 ] (not Q[ x R a8 ] BxN with a strong attack).
 [ Q x h5 + ]  [ R h6 ]  [ Q f5 + ] , [ R g6 ]  hoping for a draw perhaps
 [ a4 ] , [ a5 ]  symmetrical
 [ K g8 ] , [ a6 ]  Eventually formed this plan of getting the Knight to [ b7 ] and piling up on the c-pawn.
 [ Q b6 ] , [ N f3 ]  Selman is now forced to trade Queens in order to avoid material loss.
 [ Q g6 ] , [ R e4 ]  This is an option but this wont release the white queen yet. I think [ Q d2 ] is stronger i believe follows up with [ Q c3 ] and the bisschop is saved and still white is having a pawn up. But maybe with this move he can still keep up the pawn and bisschop.
 [ d x e4 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ Q x d1 + ] , [ K x d1 ]  W lost castling right
 [ K c3 ]  [ R a2 ]  [ a5 ]  [ R a1 ]  [ K d2 ]  [ R a3 ]  [ a6 ] , [ f5 ]  Played with he idea of creating a passed f-pawn.
 [ d3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ h3 ] , [ d5 ]  5. .... [ [ d5 ] ] - perhaps [ [ d5 ] ] could have been played the move before or perhaps Gerhard wanted to see what move Dan was gonna make before he decided to play this pawn move. This now leads to a pawn trade.
 [ N d2 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ O-O-O ]  [ O-O ]  [ B c4 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ N b3 ]  [ R e5 ]  [ N d4 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ B b3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ N b5 ]  [ c6 ]  [ N d6 ]  [ B a6 ]  [ e4 ] , [ R h5 ]  If 20...[ R d8 ] then 21. [ f4 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ R g2 ]  [ K f8 ]  [ c4 ]  [ d x c4 ]  [ B x c4 ]  [ B x c4 ]  [ N x c4 ]  [ R c8 ]  [ b3 ] , [ N d5 ]  The knight is eying the [ e3 ] square.
 [ a5 ] , [ e x f5 ]  Now I remove a pawn...
 [ f6 ]  [ R f3 ]  [ K h8 ]  [ R a f1 ] , [ Q f7 ]  Forcing White at last to admit the threat to his doubled pawn.
 [ N c6 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ B e2 ] , [ d5 ]  (?) A desirable break but played much too early. Black should lose a pawn here bring material back to even...
 [ h5 ]  [ B d4 ]  [ R d5 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ g5 ]  [ b5 ]  [ R d7 ]  [ B e5 ]  [ g6 ]  [ b4 ] , [ g7 ]  I have to sac the B for the pawn to prevent it queening.
 [ B x g2 ] , [ K x g2 ]  Forced move if white doesn't want to lose his rook.
 [ Q f3 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ N e2 ]  [ h5 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N b6 ]  [ B b3 ] , [ B g4 ]  I imagine his knight wants to go to [ [ g3 ] ] (or maybe f4). From [ [ g3 ] ] it makes my bishop move again so I might as well move it now and force his queen to run around a little too. Plus that bishop is usually a difficult piece to deal with in this opening for Black so he's eventually going to get traded for that knight on [ e2 ] I predict.
 [ Q x e8 + ]  [ K x e8 ] , [ g8 = Q + ]  My opponent timed out at this stage although my material advantage is very heavy.
 [ g4 ]  [ f x g4 ]  [ Q x g4 ] , [ Q e8 ]  Another exchange occurs here. Also fine by me.
 [ B x f3 ]  [ Q x f3 ]  [ N x f4 ] , [ Q x f4 ]  Black is solid but white is a little ahead in developement. Not that bad...
 [ N g4 ]  [ N h3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B g5 ]  [ f6 ]  [ B h4 ]  [ B d4 ]  [ O-O-O ] , [ N d7 ]  Black's advantege is already decive. His knights will decide the game. Check out the knoght moves for the rest of the game!
 [ b3 ] , [ c x b3 ]  To force the LSB to leave the diagonal
 [ B e5 ]  [ Q x e5 + ]  [ K x e5 ]  [ B x d8 ]  [ R x d8 ] , [ f3 ]  White is satisfied for the gain of a knight from the attack.
 [ O-O ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ b5 ] , [ O-O-O ]  Castling queenside was probably wrong for the position. I should have castled kingside and exploited blacks advanced pawns.
 [ R f8 ] , [ R f3 ]  20. [ R f3 ] - rook lift preparing to go to h3.
 [ Q e3 ] , [ B x f3 ]  Or 14. ...[ N x f3 ] the choice is mostly one of taste.
 [ N f3 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ] , [ N c6 ]  (?) Maybe [ B b4 ] was better looking for a quick castling. Now [ N d b5 ] creates a lot of pain in black´s defenses
 [ d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ e3 ]  [ b6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ B b7 ]  [ c4 ]  [ e6 ] , [ B d3 ]  Having lost several games one after another I am trying to play very carefully. Builing up something like a Colle system.
 [ N x e5 ] , [ Q h5 ]  It's finished mate in four moves (appart of the possible sacrifices from queen knight or rooks) I don't see what black can do to avoid it. But if you find a way...
 [ N x e4 ] , [ d5 ]  Here the line goes: 7.[ N f g5 + ] (the idea is to keep going with the attack) 7...[ K e8 ] (or [ K e7 ] 8.Qf3! [ d x e4 ] 9.[ Q f7 + ] [ K d6 ] (forced) 10.Nxe4#) 8.Qf3!. This wins for White even if 7...Kg8.
 [ c5 ]  [ c3 ]  [ Q b6 ] , [ Q b3 ]  5. [ Q b3 ] - offering a queen trade of which the database suggests it is best to decline.
 [ R e7 ] , [ N d5 + ]  So long white rook!
 [ h x g3 ]  [ d x e5 ] , [ N g5 + ]  Can I give myself a ! ? The only move for black is [ K g8 ] allowing [ N x f7 ] RxN Bxg6. Otherwise...
 [ c x d5 ]  [ c x d5 ]  [ d4 ]  [ R e2 ] , [ R d e1 ]  this move was no good i felt so pressured to trade that i end up forcing one that is to my disadvantage i probably should have tried [ K g2 ] instead.
 [ Q x f4 ]  [ Q e7 ] , [ O-O-O ]  Looked brilliant. Double threat on the d pawn right? Wrong.
 [ N c3 ]  [ R f e8 ]  [ R f3 ]  [ a6 ]  [ N d5 ] , [ R f8 ]  To protect [ f5 ]  [ a4 ]  [ f4 ]  [ g x f4 ]  [ g x f4 ]  [ R x f4 ]  [ R x f4 ]  [ N x f4 ]  [ R e8 ] , [ N d5 ]  White did that with no hesitation Not sure why
 [ R g3 ]  [ N x d1 ] , [ N x d1 ]  ? i think he should have played r[ x g7 + ]  [ N f6 + ]  [ B x f6 ] , [ e x f6 ]  hes got nothing!
 [ B x c4 ]  [ B x b5 ]  [ B x b5 ]  [ R x b5 ]  [ R x b5 ]  [ Q x b5 ]  [ R c1 ] , [ B h6 ]  Attacking the Knight and skewering the Rook.
 [ N x c4 ] , [ b x c4 ]  Fritz recommends 12. [ b x c4 ] (-0.20) An obligatory move.
 [ c5 ]  [ a3 ]  [ B x c3 + ]  [ b x c3 ] , [ Q c7 ]  Not the mainline usual here is 6...[ N e7 ] but i wanted to play this old move of Botvinnik which is just as good as [ N e7 ]  [ Q g4 ] , [ f5 ]  the main idea black defends the [ g7 ] square.
 [ B x e7 ]  [ Q x e7 ]  [ N e2 ]  [ R a d8 ]  [ O-O ] , [ Q g5 ]  17. ..... Qg5?! - Gameknot Analysis seemed to indicate that this was the move that condemned me to that Low Draw. I really can't seem to resist the habit to trade queens. Over the past few years I have managed to trust in Glenda a bit more but sometimes I do tend to lapse into those bad habits of inappropriate exchanges and passivitis!
 [ K b6 ] , [ K c4 ]  
 [ e5 ] , [ d x e5 ]  OK so my opponent doesn't waste time and fight for the center there are going to be some bullets in the air now so hold tight !!
 [ a x b3 ]  [ N x f1 ]  [ B x d8 ]  [ B c5 + ]  [ K g2 ]  [ Q d5 ] , [ R x a6 ]  Another mistake. But RgxN just will allow me to resist some more moves.
 [ B b7 ] , [ Q d5 + ]  Oh nuts! At the time I felt the only way to diffuse that threat was to interpose and check forcing the Queen trade...I think f2-[ f3 ] might have given me a little breathing room...
 [ c4 ]  [ N b6 ] , [ b3 ]  I wished [ Q x d1 ] and later [ R c2 ] with Bd3.
 [ d3 ] , [ N d4 ]  8. ..... [ N d4 ] - an aggressive placement for my knight but Freddy's response is equally aggressive .....
 [ B b7 ] , [ Q f3 ]  Time has come to exchange the queens. That is I expect black to start the trade. If black would withdraw to for example [ d5 ] black is bound to loose material.
 [ B x a1 ]  [ R e8 ] , [ B e2 ]  It looked like it was a cover for [ e2 ] but I was really after [ b4 ] hoping he will not see me
 [ B b3 ]  [ Q g6 ] , [ Q x g6 ]  I was divided on that. Would it have been better to play Qh4?
 [ K e7 ] , [ e3 ]  I have no idea whether my plan will work i can't see that far ahead but i know it will give me chances. In a friendly match against a non-human it has to be worth a go.
 [ K d4 ]  [ N b7 ]  [ K d5 ]  [ K c8 ]  [ K c6 ]  [ K b8 ]  [ N d6 ]  [ N d8 + ]  [ K d7 ]  [ N b7 ]  [ K c6 ]  [ K a7 ] , [ N x b7 ]  white wins!!!!!!!!!!!!
 [ B g5 ]  [ f6 ]  [ B f4 + ]  [ K d5 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ K d6 ]  [ K g7 ]  [ K c7 ]  [ R x d7 + ]  [ K x d7 ]  [ K h6 ] , [ R a8 ]  Black can't defend the pawns so black resigns.
 [ K h1 ]  [ R g4 ]  [ Q c3 ]  [ R f3 ]  [ R e3 ]  [ R x f2 ]  [ R g1 ]  [ R x g1 + ]  [ K x g1 ] , [ Q f7 ]  Threatening mate in two
 [ B d3 ] , [ f5 ]  Serious blunder blithely carrying out my plans without watching what my opponent is doing. [ N g6 ] would have been better defensively.
 [ B x h5 ] , [ g x h5 ]  Who benefits most from this exchange?
 [ K e3 ]  [ R x a2 ]  [ K d4 ] , [ K d2 ]  For the end game I must bring in the King.
 [ N x e7 + ]  [ Q x e7 ]  [ R x g7 + ]  [ K x g7 ]  [ R g1 + ]  [ K f8 ]  [ Q f5 + ]  [ Q f7 ] , [ Q c8 + ]  ! the best move i think if qxq then kxq and pushes his h pawns forth
 [ N x g4 ]  [ B x e4 + ] , [ K b8 ]  White must of course be supremely careful as Black is threatening instant mate on h2. But there is a swarm of minor pieces descending on the Black King...
 [ N f6 ]  [ B f3 ] , [ B g5 ]  So that when I play [ e4 ] if Baron tries [ B x f6 ] I can retake with my bishop and replace one blockader with another.
 [ R b4 ]  [ R d6 ]  [ K f3 ]  [ R b6 ]  [ K e4 ] , [ a6 ]  ahh...the rest is ugly.
 [ R g6 ] , [ R f g1 ]  Since black is slow to bring his other rook to the party I will either double up my rooks or cause my f pawn to migrate to the g file. Either way I should get access to the kingside soon.
 [ a3 ]  [ B c5 ] , [ B h3 ]  ? i think [ B g2 ] is best.
 [ N d2 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N g f3 ] , [ N d7 ]  11. …[ e5 ] 12. [ N d4 ] held no interest for me. Now my Knight is passive but I clear [ f6 ] for the Bishop.
 [ e4 ]  [ e6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ d5 ] , [ e x d5 ]  3. [ e x d5 ] The Exchange Variation of the French Defense. Always interesting though not as dynamic as many others like the Winawer or even the Classical lines with 3. [ N c3 ] and 4. Bg5. It tends to lead to more drawish positions but I have never encountered a quiet game playing against it.
 [ f3 ]  [ R a b8 ]  [ K f2 ] , [ R b2 ]  I decide to use this rook as an attacker...
 [ N f3 ]  [ d5 ]  [ d4 ] , [ B f5 ]  After 1.[ d4 ] [ d5 ] 2.[ c4 ] [ B f5 ] we have the Baltic Defence which is a radical way of black trying to solve the problem of the QB in the Queens Gambit. The idea is to play an early [ B x b1 ] giving up the bishop for white's QN. I thought for a while about playing 3.c4; did I really want to allow 3...Bxb1? It leaves white with the two bishops of course. I've never quite believed that they are as strong as they are made out if the beneficiary of such an exchange tries to utilise their power by simply 'opening the game up'. I've always thought that certainly in the middle game the player with the two bishops can benefit not so much because of the power of the pair of clerics but because the opponent will probably struggle to defend the squares of the colour of the bishop they have given up. Usually the player with the B and N will try to stick their pawns on the colour square of which they have no defending bishop. In this case black would play an early [ e6 ] and c6; in a normal QGD or a Slav they would be trying for the freeing moves [ e5 ] or c5; without the white-squared bishop that strategy MUST lead to white-square weaknesses. So a Baltic Defence-style plan must logically lead to a passive game.
 [ d x c4 ]  [ Q x c4 ]  [ b5 ]  [ Q b3 ] , [ a5 ]  11. ......... a5! - here comes that pawn roll. Glenda now has to retreat fast to her home square.
 [ d x e5 ]  [ f x e5 ]  [ B x e5 ] , [ N e g6 ]  multiple pieces attacked...
 [ B h4 ] , [ g5 ]  Black being aggressive dictating White's responses gaining initiative and commanding more board space.
 [ B x d7 ]  [ Q x d7 ] , [ a3 ]  Kicking my N which I protect. I don't know what his plan is until 13.[ Q c2 ] is played.
 [ R e4 ] , [ K d5 ]  final trades black cannot win defend both weaknesses.
 [ N c3 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ N f3 ] , [ N f6 ]  4. ..... [ N f6 ] - over the course of a few moves both sides have developed their pieces. Although white looks more active I am ready to tuck Henry away on the kingside.
 [ B c1 ] , [ N c6 e5 ]  I now move my DB onto [ c1 ] and hope to find a better position for this piece. Black moves his [ c6 ] knight to [ e4 ] attacking the [ f3 ] square and [ g4 ] square.
 [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ B b5 ]  Ruy Lopez. There are many variations including [ d6 ] [ f5 ] n[ f6 ] and bc4. Weinstein responds with this pawn push.
 [ B g4 ] , [ K f6 ]  1-0. Black gave it up at this point. I thought at first he should have played on: White still had the job to do. Now I am less inclined to be critical. For instance after 74...[ B f5 ] White does not at once play 75.g6? but a waiting move: 75.Bf2. Then White continues to play waiting moves until Black relaxes his guard over [ e6 ] or [ [ g6 ] ] so: 74...[ B f5 ] 75.[ B f2 ] [ b5 ] 76.[ B e1 ] [ B g4 ] 77.[ [ g6 ] ] [ K h6 ] 78.Bd2ch [ K h5 ] 79.[ g7 ] wins. My earlier suggested 'improvements' notwithstanding this is a well played example of a difficult type of ending.
 [ c2 ] , [ R b8 + ]  Classical attack with Rook and pawn against rook.
 [ N h3 ]  [ N x g5 ]  [ N x g5 ] , [ d5 ]  This is where I realised I may have made a mistake. After 4 moves material is even but positionally White is better.
 [ B e1 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ B a5 ] , [ R e6 ]  ?
 [ R h8 ] , [ Q g3 ]  Ah this is foolish. Now [ K e6 ] and [ K c7 ] are caused problems by [ R f e1 ] or Rae1. Having the knight skewered is awkward to say the least. [ K e7 ] would have been better than 27... [ R h8 ] by a long shot --
 [ R x d8 + ]  [ K x d8 ]  [ N x e4 ] , [ N d5 ]  Four little knights all in a row.
 [ N d4 ] , [ R e5 ]  Alternative variation: 31... [ R e4 ] 32. [ Q b1 ] [ R a5 ] 33. [ N e6 + ] [ K g6 ] 34. [ N x c7 ] $19
 [ N f3 ]  [ c5 ]  [ Q d3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ N h5 ] , [ Q d2 ]  Probably should have moved 13. [ B g2 ]  [ N d4 ] , [ Q e3 ]  This was an obvious blunder. The move 15. [ Q d3 ] would have been much better as it negates the fork that results and protects the c-pawn ... further if I'd made 13. [ B g2 ] black wouldn't have found this peach of an opening. This is just a continuation of the error on 13
 [ N f6 ]  [ Q f3 ] , [ d5 ]  4. ........ [ d5 ] - I avoid the passive set up of my last game against him with this move twice attacking the e pawn.
 [ N b3 ]  [ R b1 ]  [ N c5 ]  [ Q e3 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N x b6 ]  [ Q x b6 ]  [ h3 ]  [ B h5 ] , [ c4 ]  A bit of an inacuracy...[ Q a5 + ] will now win me a pawn
 [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ] , [ N x d4 ]  I new I could force the queen back
 [ N x e4 ] , [ N x e4 ]  ! I had certainly not expected this. I began to think and saw that after [ B x g5 ] that the knight could hop over to [ c5 ] and fork my pawns. I quickly wrote that off though because if 15 N[ c5 ] [ Q e7 ] protected everything... or so I thought.
 [ B d7 ]  [ O-O ] , [ R c8 ]  castling long might have been an option: I don't know...
 [ B x d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ N e7 ] , [ N e3 ]  this is not needed as bishop is covering [ d5 ] pawn. r[ b1 ] would be better.
 [ b3 ] , [ c x b3 ]  I chose this pawn since I didn't want to give black the a-file to achieve checkmate at some point.
 [ N x e4 ] , [ N f3 ]  Trying to cover up?
 [ R f2 + ] , [ N d2 ]  The problem is the King is safe unless I take the wimpy [ e5 ] pawn and develop my Bishop.
 [ K e6 ] , [ K x h5 ]  55. [ K x h5 ] - again Henry wins back a side pawn for me. This h pawn of mine is going to be a vital pawn as you will see.
 [ N c5 ]  [ e x f7 + ]  [ R x f7 ] , [ B a3 ]  Forcing my [ c4 ] bishop to move and put pressure on e7.
 [ K g7 ] , [ R f4 ]  This stops the centralizing move Nd4.
 [ f x g4 ] , [ Q x d5 ]  White goes for the knight. This is where the position falls apart for white.
 [ N b3 ]  [ B x d4 ]  [ g3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B g2 ]  [ B b6 ]  [ R h f1 ] , [ R d7 ]  I wished to double my power on d-file and the knight make into action.
 [ Q a7 ] , [ a4 ]  Here white really should have taken the knight because it would prove to be lethal
 [ b4 ]  [ c x b4 ]  [ Q x b4 + ]  [ K g7 ]  [ Q b5 ]  [ R e6 ]  [ Q x h5 ]  [ R c6 ] , [ Q g5 + ]  With 3 mins. remaining I added 30 minutes. I know going into the endgame sure helped Black's position and White was fighting for a draw.
 [ Q e6 ] , [ R f d1 ]  I chose this rook because I felt the other rook may belong on the open c file.
 [ R e5 e6 ] , [ g5 ]  Finally I get to play my "death move" and am promptly rewarded with....
 [ N x d4 ]  [ B x d3 ]  [ Q x d3 ] , [ B b4 ]  My development is lagging and I need to get the bishop out before i can get out my N on g8. Exchanging on [ [ d4 ] ] leaves white's Q on [ [ d4 ] ] preventing my bishop from getting to [ b4 ] which would continue to doom my [ g8 ] knight.
 [ d4 ] , [ N f6 ]  I don't know this opening so I just wing it by playing what feels natural
 [ K d1 ]  [ B x d3 ]  [ c x d3 ] , [ Q a6 ]  I was tempted to play [ R x b3 ] and make an simplification sacrifice but I decided this was better as it threatens a queen pin.
 [ N f3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ c4 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ c6 ]  And again you manage to play your 1st four moves in one of the accepted normal openings of chess. Paul Blum that weird guy with a 629 rating that I played a few weeks ago makes mistakes taking him out of accepted openings on the 2nd or 3rd move in every game he plays. Your intuitive grasp of good opening moves is impressive. Incidentally this is the Slav Variation (the precise one that he erroneously thought that he was playing against me). The slav is solid and fine for black and your instincts about how to develop your pieces in this opening are good - though once I start pressuring you had a hard time finding the optimal responses.
 [ N x f5 ]  [ R x f5 ]  [ R x e4 ]  [ R a1 ]  [ Q x a1 ]  [ B x a1 ]  [ R x c4 ] , [ R x b5 ]  ?? Missing the chance to queen my pawn. I played this on a real chess board and did not calculate deep enough.
 [ R b6 ] , [ R d7 + ]  Near mate here [ K c8 ] gives fastest mate [ K b8 ] looses the rook.
 [ g x f6 ]  [ h3 ] , [ R e2 ]  sure come on in.
 [ N h2 ] , [ f5 ]  open the black bishop
 [ R g7 ] , [ R h5 + ]  .
 [ Q g4 ] , [ B f7 ]  and so Black holds the LSB...
 [ K e4 ]  [ K g3 ]  [ R g8 + ]  [ K f2 ] , [ R b8 ]  si 59 T[ g2 + ] 60 [ R f1 ] T[ x h2 ] 61 T[ x b4 + ] etc =
 [ N f6 ]  [ B c4 ] , [ N x d5 ]  22..[ a5 ] is answered by 23.Qh6! plainning to meet 23...[ N x d5 ] with the decisive 24.Bb5+(Svidler). But in my opinion the move which was played is also bad better was 22...[ R c8 ] or 22...[ R b8 ]  [ Q x d5 ]  [ B g5 + ]  [ K b1 ]  [ R a7 ]  [ e5 ] , [ K f8 ]  Or 25...[ R d7 ] 26.[ e6 ] and white crashes through on the weakened light squares for example 26...fx[ e6 ] 27.[ Q x e6 + ] [ Q e7 ] 28.[ Q g8 + ] [ Q f8 ] 29.[ Q x g6 + ] and Qxg5.
 [ B b3 ] , [ B b7 ]  This is an important decision! Black plays for a win and wants to preserve his bishop on the beautiful diagonal [ a8 ] - h1. Against a stronger opponent than I am he might have considered to trade the bishops or maybe stay on [ d5 ] and wait for me to trade bishops (otherwise my knight is stuck on d2).
 [ d x e5 ]  [ B x e5 ]  [ B x e5 ]  [ R x e5 ]  [ Q d4 ]  [ R e8 ] , [ N e2 ]  he had a chance to kick my knight out by moving the pawn to [ f3 ] but I will move my knight to [ g3 ] and attack the bishop and rock or I will move it to [ g5 ] and then [ f3 ]  [ B x g4 ]  [ N f4 ]  [ B f5 ] , [ N d3 ]  now his pawn is double protected I will threat the rock
 [ f4 ]  [ B g7 ]  [ f x e5 ]  [ d x e5 ] , [ d6 ]  '!?' - This is not as it appears which is to say a patzer move. White vacates [ d5 ] with tempo planning Nd5. The noose tightens as Black loses even more space and still has not castled. White is winning. Also possible was the typical [ Q e1 ] plan piling up on the kingside dark squares via Qg3/[ h4 ] and Bg5. Note how White can easily switch between queenside central and kingside plans with his massive space advantage while Black's pieces struggle to move along the last two files.
 [ N x e4 ]  [ h6 ]  [ g x h6 ]  [ R h4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ d3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B x h6 ]  [ B x h6 ]  [ R x h6 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ B h3 ]  [ Q a5 + ]  [ c3 ]  [ B x h3 ]  [ N x h3 ]  [ O-O-O ] , [ b4 ]  Black has a pawn knight and queen guarding this square. A trade leaves white down another pawn without improving his position or developing pieces.
 [ N f1 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ N d2 ] , [ B a4 ]  Black seeing no way to make any headway offered the draw which was accepted
 [ R x a5 ]  [ B e1 ]  [ R a7 ] , [ N a1 ]  I also spent time considering if [ R h3 ] was worth playing.
 [ R c x f2 ]  [ B x f2 ] , [ R x f2 ]  by now Black must have realized what he has done; there is no mate on the bottom row...
 [ g4 ] , [ f6 ]  28. ....... [ f6 ] - reinforcing the [ e5 ] pawn and creating some luft for Henry. Also Henry will start a Royal Progress very shortly to the middle of the battlefield.
 [ N x d4 ] , [ Q x d4 ]  This is more aggressive and much better than [ N x d4 ]  [ Q e2 ] , [ Q x b2 ]  This is "greedy". 15. ...f5! had been the strongest continuation of the king side attack
 [ N x e5 ] , [ K x c5 ]  ...and again even if one was taken in exchange.
 [ B f4 ]  [ K g1 ] , [ N g5 ]  !
 [ Q b6 ]  [ f5 ]  [ O-O-O ] , [ g3 ]  The route to [ e6 ] lies through [ h3 ] not c4.
 [ B f4 ] , [ e6 ]  defend and open diagonal knight move to [ e7 ]  [ K e2 ] , [ R d2 + ]  attack white resigns i did less attacking and only responded to his game i think !!
 [ R b3 + ] , [ K g2 ]  Unlike before I considered 38.Kg4. In fact that is what I almost played but I didn't want to allow 38...[ R b4 + ] as then my K would be forced to run back to the third. Therefore allowing Tom to continue checking me on the third and forth rank could result in a draw by repetition. Well I am determined not to allow a swindle with a draw since I have a win here.
 [ Q f4 ]  [ R f6 ]  [ Q g5 ]  [ R d6 ] , [ R h e1 ]  I'm not concerned about doubling my pawns on the kingside. A pawn on [ g5 ] would be on a dark square and would block the [ [ h6 ] ] and [ [ f6 ] ] squares hindering the centralization of the king. Furthermore black would be forced to play [ [ f6 ] ] or [ [ h6 ] ] letting me "undouble" the pawn. Playing the rook here lets me claim the d-file as my own.
 [ K d7 ]  [ K b6 ]  [ N d5 + ] , [ K x a6 ]  43. [ K x a6 ] - mission accomplished - gets rid of black's remotest queenside pawn as well as winning my pawn back.
 [ R x f3 ]  [ R x g6 ]  [ f x g6 ] , [ B x f3 ]  White's material advantage is now decisive.
 [ b5 ]  [ c5 ]  [ b4 ]  [ B e6 + ]  [ K b7 ]  [ B x f5 ]  [ g x f5 ]  [ N e6 ]  [ R e8 ] , [ N d4 ]  37. Ng7?? [ R e2 ] equalizes. The final is still far from won for White.
 [ N f3 ]  [ O-O ] , [ B d3 ]  Well it's not the best continuation but it's still fine. [ B e2 ] or [ h3 ] are more popular and have more success.
 [ h5 ]  [ R d8 ]  [ B e6 ]  [ a4 ]  [ c3 ] , [ b x c3 ]  I stop another pawn...
 [ d3 ] , [ Q x d3 ]  Sacrificing the Knight as well. But if mate is in the offing...
 [ N c4 ]  [ Q c1 ]  [ B x d4 ]  [ B x f8 ]  [ K x f8 ]  [ Q h6 + ]  [ K g8 ]  [ R e4 ] , [ B f6 ]  Overprotecting [ e7 ] and denying [ h5 ] to white's major pieces.
 [ d4 ] , [ B x f8 ]  considered the critical line.
 [ R a7 ] , [ R a1 ]  And I get my Rook behin d it which is how it's supposed to be!
 [ d4 ]  [ d5 ] , [ f4 ]  first time I have played against this opening so I decide to just develop
 [ Q a3 ]  [ Q b8 ] , [ N c4 ]  I am not really looking for his rock I need his valuable pawn. with check+
 [ B g4 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ B x f3 ]  [ B x f3 ]  [ N x e5 ] , [ O-O ]  ?! In addition Carl was threatening to liquidate my Bf3. I asked myself how to prevent this. But I didn't there was a way to do it. As 6.[ B h5 ] is met with 6...[ g6 ] which allows him to exchange. However 6.[ B e2 ] was the only move that I didn't consider and it turns to be the best one available. As afterwards I'm still hanging on to my B which is stronger and doesn't allow liquidation.
 [ B g5 + ]  [ N f6 ]  [ Q e1 ]  [ K d7 ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ B x f3 ]  [ R x f3 ]  [ g x f6 ]  [ Q h4 ]  [ K c8 ] , [ R x f6 ]  Black resigned
 [ B b8 ]  [ a5 ]  [ B x a7 ]  [ a4 ]  [ B b6 ] , [ B c3 ]  The final blow guarding [ Q R8 ] and preventing the Bishop from stopping the Pawn.
 [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ a6 ] , [ B x c6 ]  ruy lopez exchange variation
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ] , [ d4 ]  I move up these pawns to give my queen and bishops room to manoeuvre...
 [ d x c5 ]  [ b4 ]  [ N d4 ] , [ Q a5 ]  Trying to pressure Forgacs' Q-side where Maroczy has a spatial edge. Forgacs' play should lie on the K-side with this Pawn formation.
 [ R x b3 ] , [ K c1 ]  I continue my attempt to escape from danger.
 [ Q x a5 ]  [ Q x b2 + ]  [ K f1 ] , [ N e7 ]  Finally black develops his knight after sitting silently for forty moves.
 [ O-O ]  [ N d3 ] , [ B b6 ]  I should be castling here
 [ K a6 ]  [ K d6 ] , [ K b7 ]  Awaiting for black's move..
 [ K x g4 ]  [ K x a4 ]  [ K f5 ] , [ K b3 ]  And they're off!
 [ Q g2 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ g5 ] , [ B x h3 ]  Not really sure why I traded bishops here. It looks like a bad move. If 9. [ Q x h3 ] black's knight on [ f6 ] has nowhere to run except back home on g8. If 9. ... [ N d7 ] 10 [ N x d5 ] gains white a pawn. I didn't analyze this any further because white let me off the hook.
 [ d6 ] , [ h3 ]  To prevent his Bg4-[ N d4 ] ideas
 [ N g4 ] , [ R e4 ]  A mistake. At a minimum I should win the exchange. The attack on the Queen does not buy time for the [ f6 ] Rook to move. When you launch an assault against an enemy Queen it really should gain something - time material position or some combination thereof.
 [ c5 ]  [ d x c5 ] , [ b x c5 ]  ? But had Ted played 20.[ R c8 ] the plan behind exchanging would have failed as now he would have had another defender to equal my attackers. By taking right away which I anticipated knowing him white winds up a pawn down.
 [ K d6 ]  [ Q d5 + ]  [ K c7 ]  [ N c5 + ]  [ K c8 ]  [ Q d7 + ]  [ K b8 ]  [ R h8 + ] , [ N d8 ]  Forced
 [ B d3 ] , [ B x h2 ]  opps seem i miss my pawns
 [ N c6 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ a6 ]  [ B a4 ]  [ b5 ] , [ B b3 ]  Pressure on [ f7 ] I like this position
 [ b5 ] , [ d4 ]  i was expecting that....
 [ g6 ] , [ e4 ]  His minions advance onward through the night into a battlefield that will soon run red with the blood of peasants and noblemen alike!
 [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ a6 ]  Nardof
 [ e5 ] , [ N c3 ]  My goal is protect [ e4 ] and attack center with piece instead no with pawn. It not usual teach method but I not average player.
 [ g x f5 ]  [ e x f5 ]  [ e5 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ B x e3 ] , [ Q x e3 ]  20. [ Q x e3 ] - after a plethora of pawn exchanges and the two dsbs my position hasn't improved much. White has a solid passer which will be a real thorn in my derriere later on.
 [ R e8 ] , [ e7 ]  Black prevented the easy promotion but promotion is still on the way.
 [ B d3 ]  [ O-O-O ]  [ e4 ]  [ N c4 ]  [ B x c4 ]  [ d x c4 ] , [ d5 ]  nice fork i though
 [ K d7 ] , [ N x a6 ]  You're almost certainly buggered now.
 [ N c3 ]  [ B b4 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ O-O ]  [ e3 ] , [ c5 ]  Here a pin on my king is countered with my own pin on his queen note the two pinned knights.
 [ K f8 ] , [ g4 ]  Now my knight move [ N f6 ] looks nice forks White's bishop and pawn and blocks the f pawn. One thing to keep in mind is a future [ g5 ] by Baron which will fork my bishop and knight.
 [ B d2 ]  [ a5 ]  [ b x a5 ]  [ N x a5 ]  [ N x b5 ]  [ N c4 ]  [ a4 ]  [ B c6 ]  [ Q c1 ]  [ N x d2 ]  [ N x d2 ] , [ Q a5 ]  Black has sacced a pawn for play and is now attacking Nb5: sort of; [ B c6 ] is only just covered...
 [ B d7 ]  [ R x e4 ] , [ B c5 ]  Black has some serious attacking chances here but I was pretty sure I could defend this position.
 [ B c6 ]  [ Q x d8 + ]  [ R x d8 ]  [ B x c6 + ]  [ b x c6 ]  [ N e4 ] , [ N e7 ]  Black should have pushed a pawn to threaten the white knight. That would give black either the knight or white's black bishop.
 [ N x d5 ]  [ N h7 ]  [ f5 ] , [ B f6 ]  I am eyeing black's kingside as it may become cut off from the center if I can land my pawn on [ f6 ] or cause other mayhem.
 [ Q d3 + ]  [ K e1 ]  [ Q x c3 + ]  [ K f1 ]  [ Q d3 + ]  [ K g2 ] , [ Q e4 ]  Pinning my N is a mild downside for such a terrible incursion. Now his best chance were the c and d pawns and I think that aftr [ d4 ] I am in very serious trouble.
 [ B x c7 ] , [ K d7 ]  ! Normally not good when you don't want to move that K before the endgame as where it's generally exposed. But this is an exception and a very good move mobilizing that K and preparing it for action. So there is a plan behind this.
 [ R d1 ] , [ d6 ]  couldn't have got the queen or my queen would go
 [ R b8 ]  [ B x f6 ] , [ g4 ]  Black just doesn't have many moves. The Rook cannot interfere with the coming mate. The best move is probably 33. ... [ h6 ] which loses more slowly to 34. [ R g7 + ] [ K h8 ] 35. [ R b7 + ] [ K g7 ] 36. [ R x b8 ]  [ R g7 + ]  [ K h8 ] , [ R x g4 # ]  I was not particularly pleased with my play in this game upon analyzation because I could have done more when my opponent played the early 3. ... Bb4. Still I managed to make some good moves and slowly gain an overwhelming advantage.
 [ N d c4 ]  [ B e7 ] , [ R d2 ]  Looking to double up on the f file in combination with my knight
 [ K b1 ] , [ Q x d2 ]  I think I would have recommended using the rook instead. This would make it easier to bring more heavy artillery to bear on the king's position.
 [ N e7 ]  [ B e3 ] , [ N f5 ]  Seizing a good outpost.
 [ Q x d6 ] , [ R d7 ]  This again seems to be a "naive" move but if [ Q c7 ] probably white wins with Rb8...
 [ K x b2 ]  [ Q a3 + ] , [ K x a3 ]  Of course black gave away his pieces there at the end but he was dead at the end there. I really enjoyed playing this game and my opponent and I messaged back and forth for a bit after the game. I thought he played fine really for most of the game but that move [ B g4 ] early on was probably not a great one and then moving the knight to [ h5 ] put t offside so early on in the game where I could improved my position get an attack going and then take it off at my leisure.
 [ e x f5 ]  [ N a6 ]  [ f6 ] , [ R e6 ]  Now normally I would have gone for the exchange but still in the mood to let the threats develop and my opponent to worry himself.
 [ Q x c8 ]  [ Q x c8 ]  [ R x c8 ] , [ R x c8 ]  We now find ourselves in a relatively equal endgame. Computer puts me up by + 0.37.
 [ N f3 ]  [ h6 ]  [ h3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ c6 ]  [ O-O ]  [ N b d7 ] , [ B f4 ]  10. [ B f4 ] - over the last few moves we continue to develop our pieces.
 [ N x d6 ] , [ c x d6 ]  The position is difficult for an amateur like me to understand. Black has a doubled pawn on the d-file which is blocked. White has control of the c-file at the moment. Black's bishop on [ b7 ] is buried while the battery of White queen and bishop is blocked successfully.
 [ c6 ] , [ N f3 ]  Bad because [ Q b6 ] now forces me out of my lines.
 [ Q e2 ] , [ f6 ]  f6. Not the best move but I didn't want to think all the troubles that could involve the position if white do [ f6 ] first.. As my style of chess I thought I would prefer to defend this position than the other one (after the computer analysis the other position was much more easy to play as Black.. damn! why I'm so thought-lazy?)
 [ Q x c2 ]  [ R x c2 ]  [ R a1 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ B d5 ] , [ B d3 ]  Move gives the bishop plenty of life and keep the king out of the game for the moment.
 [ Q d4 ] , [ Q g5 ]  black threatens mate.
 [ R x e5 ]  [ R c e8 ]  [ Q f5 ]  [ Q h6 ]  [ R x e8 + ]  [ R x e8 ]  [ Q h5 ]  [ Q x h5 ] , [ g x h5 ]  I Can't say I am totally thrilled with having doubled pawns here though I still had hopes of a draw the computer gives white a fair advantage at this point
 [ c4 ] , [ Q b4 ]  (??) Already the decisive blunder. Black must now lose his Queen. How...?
 [ N f5 ] , [ Q f6 ]  Aha! Surprise! This moves sets a threat for the near future after say castling... can you see it?
 [ B d3 ]  [ N e4 ]  [ Q e2 ]  [ R a e8 ]  [ O-O ]  [ B h4 ]  [ g3 ]  [ Q g6 ]  [ B d4 ]  [ a6 ]  [ K h1 ] , [ N x g3 + ]  black must win. The bishop on [ d3 ] is over and a quality will lost.
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ] , [ B c4 ]  I like the Italian open. It seems to flow very well.
 [ g5 + ]  [ K e6 ]  [ h5 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ g6 ]  [ K f6 ]  [ K g4 ]  [ N e5 + ]  [ K f4 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ g7 ]  [ B h7 ] , [ h6 ]  It got pretty hairy as those pawns got pretty close to queening but it was really a formality. It was going to happen one way or another. However don't think that I didn't spend hours thinking carefully through each move making sure I don't make a mistake.
 [ Q b4 ] , [ B f8 ]  Redirecting the bishop with tempo.
 [ R h8 ]  [ Q g5 ] , [ N e4 ]  The Queen is trapped!
 [ O-O ] , [ R f d1 ]  Just saw some kind of tactical possibility since Black's B and Q were in line.
 [ R e2 + ] , [ K h3 ]  If 25.[ K f3 ] Black mates with 25...Rf2+.
 [ e5 ]  [ Q d7 ]  [ B x e6 ] , [ Q x e6 ]  19. ..... [ Q x e6 ] - white initiates the trade - I still have to bring out those knights. However those 3 white central pawns (2 of them passers) become a right nuisance to me over the next few moves.
 [ Q x e7 ]  [ B b5 ] , [ d x c3 ]  well if you don't kill this pawn it'll keep eating pieces
 [ R a c8 ] , [ Q b3 ]  And the king is in very big troubles. Now I had to prevent [ B h7 + ] loosing my Queen and I did it with Bc3.
 [ K e5 ] , [ h4 ]  Black appears to be trying to lock the position and going for stalemate his only hope.
 [ Q b6 ]  [ B e1 ]  [ d x c3 + ]  [ B f2 ]  [ Q x b2 ]  [ e5 ]  [ R f d8 ]  [ Q b1 ]  [ R d2 ]  [ B e4 ]  [ R x f2 ]  [ B x h7 + ]  [ K h8 ]  [ B e4 ]  [ B c5 ]  [ Q x b2 ]  [ R x b2 + ]  [ K h1 ]  [ R d8 ]  [ R a b1 ]  [ R d d2 ]  [ h4 ] , [ R d h2 # ]  
 [ R d3 ]  [ K e2 ] , [ c3 ]  ! Correct. Now 33.[ f4 ] won't work anymore since my pawn is too far advanced.
 [ e5 ]  [ N b3 ]  [ B e7 ] , [ B e3 ]  8. O-O is the most common move but I don't think it makes a big difference.
 [ g x f4 ]  [ e x f4 ] , [ B x d7 + ]  Getting rid of the knight. Now black should take back with the queen.
 [ B d7 ] , [ N e5 ]  This was a blunder that was made because I was looking further into the position than my abilities allowed and caused me to miss the obvious threat.
 [ Q c6 + ]  [ K b8 ]  [ Q x b6 + ]  [ K c8 ]  [ Q c6 + ]  [ K d8 ]  [ Q x d6 + ]  [ N d7 ] , [ b5 ]  I believe this pawn push was useless. [ R a1 ] now loses her the rook and bishop because the only way to avoid 35. [ R a8 # ] is 34. ... Kc8.
 [ K g7 ]  [ R b2 ] , [ R d7 ]  Heading for d7. White cannot take yet because of 49. [ R x b5 ] [ R x d2 ]  [ R e4 ]  [ R d4 ] , [ R e2 ]  Blacks doesn't want to trade. 55 [ R x d4 ] [ B x d4 ] and blacks queen-side pawns are lost. Then white will sacrifice his bishop for the two king-side pawns and guide the f2-pawn to queen. This is why the king needed to be posted on c5. Otherwise 55 .. [ R x d4 ] 56 [ B x d4 ] [ b4 ] gives black counterplay.
 [ c4 ] , [ B b7 ]  IMO 14...[ d4 ] with an enduring space advantage in the center was a better option.
 [ a6 ] , [ Q d2 ]  If anything it was to move queen out of the Kings path for a castle if needed
 [ Q d4 ]  [ R b7 ] , [ B b2 ]  oh my... mate in one. i have one move.
 [ K b4 ] , [ B d2 ]  Now that the queenside is all protected I'll move my king towards his knight to queen my h pawn.
 [ d4 ] , [ N a4 ]  I losted on time.
 [ R e1 ] , [ B e6 ]  I certainly didn't anticipate this. I was expecting [ Q d7 ] with a fairly even game.
 [ b4 ]  [ R f e8 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ R d b8 ]  [ R e1 ] , [ R e d8 ]  26. ......... [ R e d8 ] - there now follows a series of rook moves but again would [ b6 ] have been better?
 [ R f3 ] , [ e6 ]  Now [ R f8 ] is the only move for Carlsen. Otherwise Caruana's pawn is unstoppable.
 [ K h7 ] , [ Q e6 ]  ! Wins by force.
 [ b4 ] , [ d x e5 ]  White's attack on the queenside is met by black's attack into the center. Black would like to open the a1-[ h8 ] diagonal for his bishop.
 [ d4 ]  [ N b7 ]  [ R h3 ]  [ c4 ]  [ b4 ]  [ N d6 ]  [ c3 ] , [ R c a8 ]  Black is reduced to attacking down the a-file and it becomes a pawn race to open up the files.
 [ K g3 ]  [ b5 ]  [ R d1 ] , [ R e2 ]  Now it's a question who can snaffle most pawns...
 [ N x c3 ]  [ b x c3 ] , [ B a3 + ]  and so i decide to strike right away. maybe this is too early i dont know its my first time trying this opening. it felt right. i believe CSF tried moving his pawns first. i told myself i could race the B and A pawns up there if he doesnt let me checkmate him.
 [ b x c4 ] , [ R c7 ]  It was a pawn drop. At this stage in the game that is a problem that I need to dispute right now.
 [ R e1 ]  [ b5 ]  [ B b3 ] , [ d6 ]  All by the book but now I'm regretting at least a little the limited mobility of my bishop on e7.
 [ K h8 ] , [ Q x h6 + ]  A nice trick to analyze the position is the "check-capture-attack-positional" way of thinking.
 [ N f3 ] , [ N f6 ]  
 [ N f d7 ] , [ h4 ]  Nd2-[ f3 ] was also possible. I was taking care of his Nc4...
 [ N c6 ] , [ B a3 ]  Ok ok....the whole "freezing same colored bishops" thing. White makes this move to develop while hindering my castling plans.
 [ N f4 ] , [ N f6 ]  Think Black should've looked at [ N x f4 ] and exchange the final two Knights.
 [ g3 ]  [ f x g3 + ]  [ K g2 ]  [ g x h2 ]  [ R x h2 ] , [ Q x e4 + ]  The Tumbleweed in all its glory. White has open lines on the K-side to use for attack and Black's Queen is exposed but Black has a material advantage in return.
 [ K x d6 ]  [ N f4 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ R e6 + ]  [ K d7 ]  [ R b6 ]  [ B c6 ]  [ g4 ]  [ a5 ]  [ N d3 ]  [ K d6 ]  [ K f2 ]  [ a4 ]  [ N c1 ] , [ a3 ]  I think I have counted the moves and foudn a win but we will see what he comes up with.
 [ e6 ]  [ B b5 ]  [ a6 ]  [ B x c6 + ] , [ b x c6 ]  10. ..... [ b x c6 ] - I return the compliment by trading off my own lsb for a knight. Although it does give a clear line for black's QR it does make the a pawn a weakie.
 [ B x b5 ]  [ B x h6 ] , [ Q a5 + ]  Bad move. had white played [ Q d2 ] I'd have lost some more material
 [ B f4 ] , [ N h3 + ]  It took a while to find this obvious attacking move.
 [ B h5 ] , [ Q b1 + ]  Black has to find counterplay. Passive defence offers no hope.
 [ R e8 ]  [ R e1 ]  [ Q c7 ]  [ B b2 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ h3 ]  [ B h5 ] , [ N a4 ]  wants: 15. [ B x f6 ] [ g x f6 ] (15... [ B x f6 ] - weakness c5) and the position will be about equal.
 [ O-O ] , [ B a3 ]  9. [ B a3 ] Notice how White's own pawns prevent him from developing his Knight and maximizing his Bishop. His pieces are scattered along the outer edges of the board in an uncoordinated fashion.
 [ B c3 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ d4 ]  [ K g2 ]  [ d3 ] , [ K g3 ]  ?? I was planning a hopeless pawn storm when I made this blunder.
 [ R h8 ]  [ K c5 ]  [ R c8 + ]  [ K b4 ]  [ h4 ]  [ K x a4 ]  [ R b8 ]  [ R c5 ]  [ R x b6 ]  [ R x c4 ]  [ R b7 ]  [ f5 ]  [ R b6 ]  [ e5 ]  [ R x g6 ]  [ f4 + ]  [ K g4 ]  [ e4 ]  [ f x e4 ]  [ R x e4 ]  [ h5 ]  [ K b3 ]  [ h6 ]  [ f3 + ]  [ K x f3 ]  [ R h4 ]  [ R b6 + ]  [ K a3 ]  [ K g3 ]  [ R h5 ]  [ K g4 ]  [ R h2 ]  [ R a6 ]  [ a4 ]  [ K g3 ]  [ R h1 ]  [ K g2 ]  [ R h5 ]  [ K g3 ]  [ K b3 ]  [ K g4 ]  [ R h2 ]  [ R b6 + ]  [ K a2 ]  [ K g3 ]  [ R h5 ]  [ K g4 ]  [ R h1 ]  [ K g5 ]  [ a3 ]  [ K g6 ]  [ R g1 + ]  [ K h7 ]  [ K a1 ]  [ K h8 ]  [ a2 ]  [ h7 ]  [ R h1 ]  [ K g8 ]  [ R x h7 ] , [ K x h7 ]  
 [ d5 ]  [ e x d5 ]  [ e x d4 ] , [ Q x d4 ]  4. Qxd4?! - I think this is where I start to go wrong. This is where I bring out the queen too early in order to try and hold on to the gambit pawn. It is gonna backfire on me big time because Freddy gains some important tempi that will prove disastrous for yours truly.
 [ B e3 ]  [ N d7 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ B d6 ] , [ N b5 ]  This idea of mine was flawed. I thought I could tie down his bishop defending the [ c7 ] square by making it run back to [ b8 ] but wasn't thinking about how easy it would be to remove my knight the next move and then re-locate the bishop. Also a better option for black would be to play 12...[ B e5 ] keeping his piece active and still defending the important square.
 [ g4 ] , [ N d5 ]  Well it looks like I won't be able to use [ e6 ] after all. And this N is really annoying.
 [ h5 ] , [ N x f2 ]  I have an almost trapped rook for the next "free" move. [ c5 ] is still mine if I have the tempo to play c6.
 [ R b1 ]  [ B x c2 ]  [ Q x c2 ]  [ B x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ B x d4 ] , [ Q x d4 ]  16. ...... [ Q x d4 ] - wheew! What a plethora of exchanges! Incredibly under my board the material count registers plus one to me! Also just look where Glenda is! That is not her usual location in the middlegame against Class A oppo. and above. She is usually defending something on the first or second rank. Can Glenda stay aggressive and keep me on that Yellow Brick Road to Expertdom? Or will The Wicked Witch of the West stand in my way? We shall see.
 [ K e2 ] , [ g2 ]  He has a choice between capturing the pawn and capturing the other pawn.
 [ e x d4 ] , [ B x d4 ]  Taking back my control of center. I won't let him have it!
 [ B x f3 ] , [ Q x f3 ]  I wasn't expecting Black to so willingly give up a minor exchange.
 [ O-O ] , [ N h2 ]  I think black could have castled queenside since white doesn't have enough space on the queen's wing to mount an attack currently. ( I could be wrong about that if you would help me out with your opinion I would appreciate it. ) If black still had the bishop on [ e6 ] white would need find a different way to get [ f4 ] in. If black could play [ Q d7 ] the pawn on [ h3 ] would hang and the replies for white are not all that appealing.
 [ K g6 ]  [ B x e5 ] , [ Q x e5 ]  My material advantage now is minimal. I am still thinking Q vs his no Q is a stronger position any time you can have it. I usually take that scenario with up to 2 material advantage of my opponent (Q vs 2 rooks and 2 material advantage for the opponent). I found out that a free Q roaming on the open board is a much stronger than 2 rooks and up to 2 material advantage. Off course this is just a rule of thumb but as this match shows all that can be useless if you are in significantly disadvantageous position.
 [ f4 ]  [ B h4 ]  [ c4 ]  [ f5 ]  [ R a4 ]  [ B x g3 ] , [ h x g3 ]  The better move
 [ c x d4 ] , [ B f5 ]  ? I thought I had something ready for [ g4 ] obviously I was mistaken.
 [ N a3 ] , [ Q e5 + ]  ...but I move my new queen back to fork the king and c3-pawn...
 [ N c6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ d3 ]  [ e6 ]  [ B g5 ]  [ B e7 ]  [ Q d2 ]  [ h6 ] , [ B f4 ]  Not 8 [ B h4 ] Nxe4! 9 [ B x e7 ] [ N x d2 ] 10 [ B x d8 ] [ N x f3 + ] 11 [ g x f3 ] [ K x d8 ] or 9 [ d x e4 ] [ B x h4 ] 10 [ N x h4 ] [ Q x h4 ] 11 [ Q x d6 ] [ Q x e4 + ] 12 [ K f1 ] Qd4! with an extra pawn
 [ d x e5 ] , [ B b7 ]  My opponent wisely does not recapture this pawn as 12...[ d x e5 ] 13. [ Q d5 ] would fork the knight and the rook.
 [ N d4 ]  [ N x f6 + ]  [ B x f6 ]  [ Q d3 ]  [ N x b3 ] , [ Q x b3 ]  The game is about equal here. Good job
 [ R f x d1 ] , [ R f d8 ]  I was struggling to decide whether [ R a d8 ] was better but I didn't like how it left the a-pawn weak.
 [ e4 ] , [ a6 ]  Maroczy plays a most unusual response to Forgacs' opening thrust.
 [ O-O ] , [ B h3 ]  10. ...... [ B h3 ] - as Freddy chooses to castle kingside I decided to adopt my earlier plan of trade off of bishops and to delay castling. I would have preferred to go queenside if at all but alas the decks are not cleared.
 [ Q x e7 + ] , [ N g x e7 ]  ...but I do get the queen-for-queen swap I was loking for...
 [ B b5 + ] , [ c6 ]  This makes it a gambit. Black can also play 6...[ B d7 ] which is a quieter line. Black will eventually be able to round up the [ d5 ] pawn so he won't be a pawn down but White gets a good game. In this line it is Black who has all the fun and attacking chances though the compensation for the pawn is not trivial at first sight.
 [ g4 ] , [ Q x h4 + ]  !
 [ R c1 ] , [ B b4 ]  18. ...... [ B b4 ] - before deciding to contest the c column I decided to back up my [ a4 ] pawn. I thought this move was good because there are no pawns on the a or c column to drive Fou Lenoir off that square. The draw offer comes next move and I accept it. Gameknot analysis proved white to have a slight advantage. I am pretty chuffed by this much needed result which put my rating back into the 1930s - just. I hope you all have a good read. Bye for now - Joanne
 [ N f5 + ] , [ K f2 ]  nowhere else to go....
 [ R x g2 ] , [ Q b3 + ]  White resigns as the loss of the rook is unavoidable. (30.[ K e4 ] Qd5+) (30.[ K e2 ] [ Q x b2 + ] 31.[ K f1 ] [ Q x g2 + ] 32.[ K x g2 ] [ a5 ] the king is too far away to stop the pawn.) 0-1
 [ N d7 ] , [ B x b8 ]  The black queen captured both players were making their moves rapidly - it was recorded that at this point in the game there was less than a second between each move. Safeway's moves were particularly frantic.
 [ K x f7 ]  [ B d5 + ] , [ K g6 ]  The best square for black's king.
 [ B e7 ] , [ K h1 ]  There are many options here but I decided to make a waiting move to see what Black would do. Another move I considered was 14.[ Q e2 ] but I didn't like to concede the bishop pair after 14...Nc5. Still it could be a good move as after (14.[ Q e2 ] Nc5) 15.[ B x c5 ] [ d x c5 ] Black has many weaknesses on the queenside.
 [ R f c1 ]  [ R d c8 ]  [ R a2 ] , [ R c a8 ]  20. ..... [ R a8 ] - Hmm I think Dave is trying to double rooks on the a column. I think my heavies ought to be in the near vicinity of it to prevent any ingress of white pieces into my pos!
 [ R f7 ]  [ R x f6 ] , [ Q e1 ]  Hoping for some kind of check but..
 [ R x c6 ] , [ R e4 e1 + ]  ... If only that knight wasn't there this move would've been so much better. My analysis missed the knight so my plan was to capture the queen and rook for 2 rooks and end up even in material but that isn't the case.
 [ K h8 ]  [ N x f7 + ]  [ Q x f7 ]  [ B g6 ]  [ Q e6 ]  [ B x e8 ]  [ R x e8 ] , [ B g3 ]  I have +1 material but in fact my attack has vanished. I need some tempoes in order to reasset my pieces and this gives time to black to get the best from his active pieces.
 [ K f1 ] , [ Q x d5 ]  Black let [ g7 ] fall prefering to take the central pawn.
 [ R x b7 ]  [ B x b7 ]  [ Q x b7 ]  [ Q a3 ]  [ Q b1 + ]  [ K h2 ] , [ Q d1 ]  [ B e7 ] would help get that rook out.
 [ K x d1 ] , [ K d7 ]  Trying to get my king to the middle of the board I'm happy to do so because I think it won't be long before White offers to swap more pieces.
 [ N d8 ] , [ e4 ]  Securing the bishop on d5.
 [ Q x h2 + ]  [ K f1 ] , [ R d f8 ]  Is this a beauty or not?
 [ R x e5 + ] , [ B e7 ]  Forced.
 [ N x b5 ]  [ R x b5 ]  [ R a8 ]  [ f4 ]  [ a4 ]  [ R b1 ]  [ a3 ]  [ f5 ]  [ a2 ]  [ R a1 ]  [ R a4 + ]  [ K h5 ]  [ K g7 ]  [ f x e6 ]  [ f x e6 ]  [ R g1 + ]  [ K h8 ]  [ R a1 ] , [ K h7 ]  Showing the neat timing of his previous move.
 [ d4 ]  [ f5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B f4 ]  [ g6 ]  [ e3 ]  [ B g7 ] , [ B c4 ]  5.Bc4? It´s better to get all the center with 5.[ c4 ]  [ N x g5 ]  [ N x g5 ]  [ R f6 ]  [ N x e6 ]  [ K h8 ] , [ N g5 ]  20.Ng5? Better: 20.[ N x g7 ] [ K x g7 ] and 21.[ R d7 ] define the game
 [ R e3 ]  [ N d6 ]  [ B e2 ]  [ K e6 ]  [ R h3 ]  [ B g6 ]  [ B g4 + ] , [ K e7 ]  41. .... [ K e7 ] - still scratching around.
 [ B b7 ] , [ h5 ]  This seemed a good time to start pushing for a big kingside attack. Maybe this wasn't well enough supported at this point though :S
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B c4 ] , [ N f6 ]  Go ATTACK KNIGHT AND BISHOP@@@@@@@@@@@
 [ b6 ]  [ O-O ] , [ B b7 ]  He adds pressure to my e pawn which is only defended twice.
 [ N e5 + ]  [ K d6 ]  [ N f7 + ]  [ K d7 ] , [ N h6 ]  44. Nh6? - I think this is a mistake as this just drops a pawn and I now have only one kingside passer to deal with.
 [ e3 ]  [ e x d4 ] , [ Q x d4 ]  Although white gains time while attacking [ d5 ] his queen is soon destined to get chased away. I would rather capture that way than 4. [ e x d4 ] though
 [ K x d1 ]  [ K x d8 ] , [ N f7 + ]  Check
 [ e x d4 ] , [ Q x d4 ]  An active queen. I love that. Put her in the center and watch her work. It's nice when she's safe from attack too.
 [ d x c5 ] , [ Q h4 + ]  And there is the unexpected danger I spoke of on move 9.
 [ K d1 ] , [ Q f1 + ]  [ K c2 ] will cause problems for me long term - still think I can win - have to avoid taking the Rook since it is guarded by the bishop - will have to take the bishp first if [ K c2 ] I will lose the ability to continue the checks at some point - one sceanrio even had black being checkmated - [ K c2 ] [ Q c1 ] [ K b3 ] [ Q d1 ] [ K a3 ] now what - [ B c6 ] threating mate with Qa4. That would allow White [ Q x g7 + ] with Q attack on [ g5 ]  [ K c2 ]  [ Q c1 + ]  [ K b3 ]  [ Q d1 + ]  [ K a3 ]  [ K b6 ]  [ Q x g7 ] , [ B c6 ]  Will give up the Black square bishop for a shot at checkmate
 [ Q d3 ] , [ Q d8 ]  I prepare to bring my Queen onto the Kingside.
 [ N x g4 ] , [ R x g4 ]  I wonder if ...[ h x g4 ] was better here. The white King could not get past that pawn easily and the entire kingside may have stayed blockaded. Here black apparently did not want me to get a passed pawn. But it allows something else...
 [ Q g3 + ]  [ K h1 ] , [ R x g4 ]  32. ..... [ R x g4 ] - Freddy decided to given Henry a Stay of Execution for just one move but after I taken off the bishop he does knight Henry and then Henry is taken away to Freddy's castle to spend yet another night or two in Freddy's there - this time it is the luxury suite - away from his beloved Glenda. Ah well I hope he fares better in Freddy's Traxler Tournament that I plan to enter once I get my games load down.
 [ R e1 ] , [ K d7 ]  Illustrates a peculiar kind of mistake. Black's [ d7 ] pawn looks well protected here.
 [ N x g7 ] , [ R f8 ]  black is trying a last tactical shot. if instead [ K x g7 ] 29. [ Q g5 ] Kf8(or Kh8) 30. [ Q d8 ] and white is finally a piece up!
 [ g5 ]  [ N g4 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ N x e3 ]  [ K x e3 ]  [ B x c3 ]  [ R h8 + ]  [ K d7 ]  [ R h7 ]  [ d4 + ]  [ K d3 ] , [ b5 ]  I can't believe it. I am self-tangled.
 [ e5 ]  [ d x e5 ]  [ N x c5 ]  [ R d7 x d2 ]  [ R x d2 ]  [ R x d2 ]  [ Q x d2 ] , [ B a8 ]  But if Caruana manages to win game 3 with black watch out! Anything can happen in game 4! Nerves still a factor here. As long as Rapid and Blitz playoff still exist someone has to beat Carlsen in Classical Chess as he is a beast in this format!
 [ h2 ] , [ K d5 ]  Naturally 74.[ R x d4 ] is hopeless. But the rook will have to be given up for the pawn. Black has now a winning game - for a given value of 'winning'. White isn't going to give this one away.
 [ Q e3 ] , [ Q b4 ]  Black doens't want to swap queens noticing my panic and seeing his chances for a better outcome.
 [ c5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ d6 ]  [ d4 ]  [ c x d4 ]  [ N x d4 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ N c3 ] , [ g6 ]  But instead I get the dragon. Ah well.
 [ B x e5 ] , [ R h g8 ]  protecting the pawn and preparing an advance but white had other ideas
 [ K x h7 ]  [ N f3 g5 + ] , [ K g8 ]  Only move. The alternative 25... [ B x g5 ] leads to 26. [ N x g5 + ] [ K h8 ] 27. [ Q g6 ] followed by 28. [ Q h7 # ]  [ Q g6 ] , [ R a e8 ]  Blunder: 24... [ R a e8 ] 25. Qh7#. Moving the Rook from f8: also a bad move: 25. [ Q h7 + ] [ K f8 ] 26. Qh8#. Best (only) move: 24... [ B x g5 ] 25. [ N x g5 ] then 25... [ R e8 ] or 25... [ R d8 ] (all other moves either lose the game with 26. [ Q h7 # ] or lose a Rook with 26. [ Q h7 + ] [ K g8 ] 27. Qh8+)
 [ R e1 ] , [ K c7 ]  No check if the Q leaves and [ Q x d3 + ] would follow.
 [ N h3 ]  [ Q e6 ]  [ g4 ]  [ h6 ]  [ B h4 ] , [ g5 ]  Cutting off his Bishop at the pass.
 [ B x f6 ]  [ B x f6 ] , [ R a d1 ]  I was told it is good to centralize you rooks is it correct?
 [ R e2 ] , [ Q g4 ]  Adding more pressure but perhaps this move is not necessary
 [ K g7 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ K f6 ]  [ R f8 + ]  [ K e5 ] , [ a5 ]  White continues pawn-pushing to victory. This postion appears slightly comical; black's king rook and knight are all immobile.
 [ f4 ]  [ d5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ g6 ]  [ e4 ]  [ d x e4 ]  [ N g5 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B c4 ]  [ B g4 ]  [ B x f7 + ]  [ K d7 ]  [ Q x g4 + ]  [ N x g4 ]  [ B e6 + ]  [ K c6 ] , [ B x g4 ]  Basically the start of this tournament almost forced except the king might get the chance to reside on [ e8 ] instead of c6.
 [ e x f6 ]  [ N x f6 ] , [ e5 ]  Further overextention of the position trying to hold this pawn but this severely weakens the b1-[ h7 ] diagonal for my bishop which is what led to my tactical crush.
 [ R c8 ] , [ Q b3 ]  Blunder a piece will be lost
 [ g4 ]  [ N g1 ]  [ Q f6 ]  [ N c3 ]  [ N e7 ]  [ N g e2 ] , [ B h6 ]  If White can regain the pawn his mobile center will assure him the advantage.
 [ N b c6 ]  [ f4 ] , [ d x c3 ]  11. .... [ d x c3 ] - recovers pawn loss and puts a crimp on Afro's queenside.
 [ Q h5 ] , [ N f5 ]  [ g6 ] weakens my kingside too much for my liking
 [ N x h2 ]  [ R x d3 ] , [ B x d3 ]  Fortunately Bishop came into the action and got the Rook leaving Black Queen against three pieces including the two Rooks.
 [ K f6 ]  [ B f5 ]  [ N e5 ] , [ g3 ]  Preparing for 19 [ B x e5 ] [ K x e5 ] 20 [ f4 + ]  [ B x e5 + ]  [ K x e5 ]  [ B x g6 ]  [ R h g8 ]  [ f4 + ]  [ K f6 ] , [ B f5 ]  Possibly 22 [ B h5 ] would be a better alternative....
 [ Q x e2 ] , [ Q x h7 # ]  all he had to do was [ R f e8 ] to stay alive for one turn but then 29... [ K f8 ] Qxf7#. what did you think of game 1?
 [ B x f2 + ]  [ K h1 ] , [ B e4 ]  And my opponent resigned here. It is interesting to note that a winning move for black is [ Q f3 ] (if gxQ Bxf3#). Aside fromt that my bet is that from here black has a forced mate. Not so evident for the puzzle engine but it stopped before proving it is not. What do you think? :-)
 [ N c6 ] , [ g4 ]  grabs more space on the king side and further cramps blacks position.
 [ B f5 ] , [ N c5 ]  Threatening R-[ [ Q7 ] ] ch. Black's Knight is pinned and cannot defend the [ [ Q7 ] ] square.
 [ N d2 ]  [ Q x c3 ]  [ R d1 ] , [ Q c2 ]  They can't all be saved now.
 [ Q x a3 ] , [ f4 ]  the danger on the queenside has temporarily passed so white takes the oppurtunity to continue his kingside pawn storm unfortunatly this move weakens the [ e4 ] square significantly which comes back to haunt white
 [ g4 ]  [ N e7 ]  [ R a1 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B c1 ]  [ R c2 ]  [ B a3 ] , [ R c4 ]  The renewed threat to the Q Pawn now restricts White still further.
 [ N c3 ] , [ a6 ]  I then went A6 to move the Bishop away
 [ K h6 ] , [ Q d2 + ]  21. [ Q d2 + ] and #2. My gut feeling came to the fore. Before the usage of analyse the board I thought [ Q d2 + ] looked good. I played it out on analyse the board but it said check and not mate. However I then noticed the BK had no legal moves aha. So would [ Q x [ g5 ] ] be mate? The detector said yes so I set up the moves [ g5 ] and [ Q x g5 # ] as conditionals. My opponent duly played into them. Nice.
 [ N e2 ]  [ N x e2 + ] , [ Q x e2 ]  perhaps [ B x e2 ] was worth a look as well.
 [ R a c8 ]  [ K d3 ]  [ R c5 ]  [ K d2 ] , [ R e c8 ]  39. ........... [ R c e8 ] - after several moves of trying not to upset the status quo here is a big threat from Freddy it seems I cannot avoid losing a pawn. I did analyse my next move [ N x e6 ] and went in for it because I thought that it would be better to lose a piece for 2 pawns rather than a pawn - this I picked up through reading a Dan Heisman article - it doesn't apply here. Here is some analysis:- Variation A: 40. [ N x e6 ] [ [ d4 ] ] 41. [ R x c5 ] [ d x e3 ] 42. [ K x e3 ] [ R x c5 ] 43. [ N x c5 ] Variation B: 40. [ N x e6 ] [ [ d4 ] ] 41. cx[ [ d4 ] ] [ R c2 ] 42. [ K e1 ] [ R x g2 ] 43. [ K f1 ] [ R c c2 ] 44. [ d5 ] [ R c f2 ] 45. [ K e1 ] [ R h2 ] 46. [ R e2 ] [ R x e2 ] 47. [ R x e2 ]  [ N x e6 ] , [ d4 ]  40. ......... d4! - this little move throws a big spanner in the works because it discovers an attack from the rook on [ c5 ] to my rook on e5. I decide to take with the c pawn backing up the rook on [ e5 ] but it doesn't work.
 [ N f5 ]  [ R f d1 ]  [ h5 ] , [ N a4 ]  Black didn't see the check here or he just ignored the threat. [ K a8 ] would have been a better move.
 [ N h4 ] , [ Q e4 ]  
 [ N b4 ]  [ B c4 ] , [ a3 ]  Releasing the knight which was defending the pawn.
 [ Q e6 ] , [ R c6 ]  I am trying to make everything safe and engineer a favourable exchange of queens. Computer agrees with this move.
 [ Q h5 + ]  [ K f5 ]  [ Q g4 + ] , [ K e5 ]  68. [ K e5 ] - if [ K g6 ] Glenda just checks him again on [ h5 ] and it will lead to perpetual check.
 [ R x e7 ]  [ d x e7 ]  [ K f7 ]  [ g x f6 ]  [ N x f6 ]  [ R d4 ]  [ R b8 ]  [ K d2 ] , [ K x e7 ]  a tough endgame now ensues. Black has his work cut out for him to win this one.
 [ b3 ]  [ K f8 ]  [ K d3 ]  [ K g8 ]  [ R d6 ]  [ Q c8 ]  [ R d5 ]  [ Q e6 ]  [ g4 ]  [ K f8 ]  [ Q f4 ]  [ K g8 ]  [ Q e4 ] , [ K f8 ]  Black persists in waiting for developments. He sees that if White plays P-[ K R5 ] he has... PxP. If White replies PxP Black plays... Q-[ R6 ] causing White serious difficulties. White therefore decides to bring his King to [ K N3 ] to defend the squares [ K R3 ] and [ K N4 ] against invasion.
 [ N x d6 ]  [ Q x d6 ]  [ Q x e7 ] , [ B d5 + ]  Exploiting the newly created light-square weakness.
 [ R b3 ]  [ R e3 e5 ] , [ c3 ]  White has failed to seize this opening. His queen has yet to move.
 [ B g4 ]  [ O-O ] , [ N e5 ]  The automatic move in this position would be [ B e2 ] moving the lsb out of danger and protecting the knight on f3. But... this would cost White the bishop pair and exchange a rather powerful freeranging piece for a bishop of mediocre influence. Are there any alternatives? Turns out there is one...
 [ K a4 ] , [ a x b3 # ]  6! A real gem of a mini! The calculating ability of Steinitz was really incredible. I hope you enjoyed it:) - Thomas
 [ B g4 ]  [ B e3 ]  [ e5 ] , [ B b5 ]  This is where I take control of the game. I know that he has his light sqaured bishop pinning down my knight and i also realize that he will want to put an extra defender on the [ e5 ] pawn so i decide to pin his knight to his king.
 [ Q a2 ]  [ N d4 ] , [ B h3 ]  He doesn't allow Nxf5. So it's either shift the king to [ h8 ] (or f8) or play [ R d f8 ] (or Rdd7). Playing [ [ c4 ] ] does the trick too but queenie has a limited future on that diagonal and is likely to reposition soon anyway; I also distrusted [ [ c4 ] ] because it might lead to [ a4 ] or even [ b3 ] from him. I might as well hide the king [22. ...[ b4 ] instead was best].
 [ N f6 ]  [ h3 ] , [ Q c7 ]  The b8-[ h2 ] diagonal is significanly stronger playing this plays on that diagonal. Possibly should have played [ a6 ] first to prevent [ N b5 ]  [ d6 ] , [ N e2 ]  This move baffles me a bit. What was whites plan? Instead of this [ B h6 ] [ N f3 ] to give some extra control over [ e5 ] or possibly even exchanging with fxg would be better they would actually be part of a plan at any rate.
 [ g5 ]  [ f5 ]  [ R e8 ]  [ N f2 ]  [ R x d1 ] , [ N x d1 ]  44. [ N x d1 ] - one pair of rooks is traded off.
 [ N x e3 ] , [ K x e3 ]  Black resigns. The only move that was criticised by the computer was 33.[ Q x e3 ] and I can't really count it as a mistake seeing that black resigned straight after it. I felt like this game was like jazz music improvisation combining fluently with pieces of calculation and positional flair resulting into a smooth attacking victory against a good opponent. Thanks for the game and thanks for reading! I'll be back with games that maybe are more complex!
 [ e4 ]  [ e5 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N c6 ]  [ B b5 ] , [ d6 ]  Lasker: Steinitz's well-known defense. Steinitz: The revival of this defense met with much opposition but I have seen nothing as yet to vitiate the equalizing effect which in my opinion it possess.
 [ B x f3 ] , [ B x f3 ]  This B is now out of position and the d-pawn is under-protected in view of Black's next move.
 [ R d7 + ] , [ K h6 ]  This is the better move! If 30. ... [ K h8 ] then 31. [ B x f2 ] [ B x f3 ] 32. [ B d4 ] and white wins instead of black. Goes to show you that you have to be careful even in the face of victory!
 [ e6 ]  [ N f3 ]  [ N f6 ]  [ B d3 ]  [ B d6 ]  [ O-O ] , [ O-O ]  ready for fight. the goal is easy for me [ N e5 ] is a nice place to stand
 [ c5 ]  [ N x c5 ] , [ B c4 ]  Well I pushed the wrong button and made my problem worse. He did not use his pawn to take mine and now has a good attack on e4.
 [ N x e5 ]  [ N x e5 ] , [ Q x e5 ]  Pawn exchange leads to knight exchange.
 [ B x f5 ] , [ N x f5 ]  Threatening [ N x e3 ]  [ B f2 ]  [ N e4 ] , [ B e1 ]  ?
 [ K b3 ]  [ R b8 + ] , [ K a2 ]  35. [ K a2 ] - the BK is now restricted to the a column. Now how do I find a mate here. I know ......
 [ d x e4 ]  [ N x e4 ] , [ B f5 ]  The Capablanca Variation. Black gets his bad bishop outside the pawn chain. Other possibilities are 4...[ N f6 ] and 4...Nd7.
 [ b x c5 ]  [ K x c5 ] , [ g5 ]  Smart? I can get another pawn but I will have mine scrambled. Anyway better than my "wonderful" idea.
